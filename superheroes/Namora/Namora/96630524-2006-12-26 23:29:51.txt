==Marvel Universe==
The first Namora is a character from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].  Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed "Namora" in honor of her cousin Namor.  When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for "Avenging Daughter", as Namor means "Avenging Son".  She was Namor's cousin, and became his companion for a period of several years.  She had her own comic book, but it lasted only three issues.  In the modern age, she appeared in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] ''Sub-Mariner'' series, where she was fatally poisoned by the Atlantean terrorist [[Llyra]].  She was survived by her [[cloning|clone]], [[Namorita]], who by Atlantean law is legally considered her daughter.  ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' revealed that she had been a member of The [[Monster Hunters]] in 1956.

=== Agents of Atlas ===
{{spoiler}}
As of Issue 4 of ''[[Agents of Atlas]]'', Namora resurfaces as being very much alive. The agents find Namora in a coffin that appears damaged and it looks like she is mummified. Upon closer inspection, [[Marvel Boy]] disables a holographic display and we see a well preserved, alive Namora.

When awakened, Namora joins in a fight against underwater sea creatures and we are shown just how like her cousin, [[Namor]], she is.

[[Jimmy Woo]] offers her a spot, and Namora joins the [[Agents of Atlas]], where the plot continues to thicken.

How Namora will find out the fate of [[Namorita]] has yet to be revealed, if at all.

In issue 5 of ''[[Agents of Atlas]]'', it is revealed that Namora innermost desire is to sleep with her cousin [[Namor]].

The second Namora  first appeared in ''Exiles'' #46, and was created by [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Mizuki Sakakibara]], and was associated with the multiversal travelers called the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].  She is an alternate-earth counterpart of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], rather than of Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, the [[Earth-616]] Namora. Unlike the Marvel Universe Namor and Namora, she has the blue skin of most Atlanteans.

In Namora's universe, she became an early ally of [[Charles Xavier]] who convinced her to not attack the surface world. She would later do so, after anti-mutant hysteria lead to the imprisonment of most mutants. Namora killed all of her Earth's superheroes, having the most difficulty with the [[Fantastic Four]], and she conquered the world and ruled it for decades, before becoming 'unhinged' in time and forced to join the Exiles, much to her chagrin.  Having a haughty attitude, she acted like she was superior to the other members. Still, she was shown that she did care for them, as evidenced when she thought that [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] had killed [[Morph (comics)|Morph]]. She lashed out at Hyperion, breaking his neck. However, it was for naught. Hyperion recovered quickly and blasted Namora, killing her. The Exiles later sent her body back to her home reality (Earth-2189) for burial.
