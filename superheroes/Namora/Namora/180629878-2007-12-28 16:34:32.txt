'''Namora''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s in various [[Marvel Comics]] publications.  Both are female [[superhero]]es from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], both are the daughters of an Atlantean parent and a surface-dwelling parent, and both are associated in some way with [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].

==Fictional character biography==
The first Namora is a character from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed "Namora" in honor of her cousin Namor. Like Namor, she is a hybrid mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her always [[barefoot|bare feet]]. When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for "Avenging Daughter", as Namor means "Avenging Son".  She was Namor's cousin, and became his companion for a period of several years. She had her own comic book, but while it lasted only three issues, she regularly appeared with Namor in [[Marvel Mystery Comics]] and [[Sub-Mariner]] (and in the latter until the series ended in the mid-fifties).
  
In the modern age, she next appeared in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] ''Sub-Mariner'' series<ref>Sub-Mariner #33</ref>, where she was shown in flashback to have been fatally poisoned by the Lemurian terrorist [[Llyra]].<ref>Sub-Mariner #50</ref>  She was survived by her [[cloning|clone]], [[Namorita]], whom she passed off as her birth daughter despite Atlantian taboos against cloning.  ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' revealed that she had been a member of The [[Monster Hunters]] in 1956.

===Agents of Atlas===
Namora eventually resurfaces as being very much alive.<ref>''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #4</ref> The agents find Namora in a coffin that appears damaged and it looks like she is mummified. Upon closer inspection, [[Marvel Boy]] disables a holographic display and we see a well preserved, alive Namora.

When awakened, Namora joins in a fight against underwater sea creatures and we are shown just how much she likes her cousin, [[Namor]].
 
[[Jimmy Woo]] offers her a spot, and Namora joins the [[Agents of Atlas]], where the plot continues to thicken.

How Namora will find out the fate of [[Namorita]] has yet to be revealed, if at all. However, solicitation images for the ''World War Hulk'' event suggest she will take a more active stance in current superhuman activities [http://www.newsarama.com/NYCC/2007/Marvel/INC_Hulk.jpg]

It is later revealed that Namora's innermost desire is to sleep with her cousin [[Namor]].<ref>''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #5</ref>

===World War Hulk===
Namora joins up with [[Mastermind Excello|Amadeus Cho]] along with [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)| Hercules]] and [[Angel (Marvel Comics)| Angel]] to aid the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #107</ref>  Namora joined Cho's efforts because of the death and subsequent vilification of her daughter at the onset of the Civil War. During the action, she and Hercules shared a passionate kiss.

The second Namora  first appeared in ''Exiles'' #46, and was created by [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Mizuki Sakakibara]], and was associated with the multiversal travelers called the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. She is an alternate-earth counterpart of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], rather than of Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, the [[Earth-616]] Namora. She is a mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her always [[barefoot|bare feet]]. Unlike the Marvel Universe Namor and Namora, she has the blue skin of most Atlanteans.

In Namora's universe, she became an early ally of [[Charles Xavier]] who convinced her to not attack the surface world. She would later do so, after anti-mutant hysteria lead to the imprisonment of most mutants. Namora killed all of her Earth's superheroes, having the most difficulty with the [[Fantastic Four]], and she conquered the world and ruled it for decades, before becoming 'unhinged' in time and forced to join the Exiles, much to her chagrin.  Having a haughty attitude, she acted like she was superior to the other members. Still, she was shown that she did care for them, as evidenced when she thought that [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] had killed [[Morph (comics)|Morph]]. She lashed out at Hyperion, breaking his neck. However, it was for naught. Hyperion recovered quickly and blasted Namora, killing her. The Exiles later sent her body back to her home reality (Earth-2189) for burial.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Mangaverse===
Namora appeared in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] series. In the  story, "Eternity Twilight",  Namora rescued Bruce Banner, who suffered temporary amnesia and have fallen for him not before Banner regained his memory involving the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (who was tall like [[Godzilla]]).  Afterwards, Banner and Namora went back to the surface and helps earth's heroes battle not only the giant-size Hulk, but also the demon-god, [[Dormammu]].
