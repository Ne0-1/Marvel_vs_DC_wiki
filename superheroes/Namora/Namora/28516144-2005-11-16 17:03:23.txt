'''Namora''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s in various [[Marvel Comics]] publications.  Both are female [[superhero]]es from [[Atlantis]], both are the daughters of an Atlantean parent and a surface-dwelling parent, and both are associated in some way with [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].

The first Namora is a character from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].  Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed "Namora" in honor of her cousin Namor.  When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for "Avenging Daughter", as Namor means "Avenging Son".  She was Namor's cousin, and became his companion for a period of several years.  She had her own comic book, but it lasted only three issues.  In the modern age, she appeared in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] ''Sub-Mariner'' series, where she was fatally poisoned by the Atlantean terrorist [[Llyra]].  She was survived by her [[cloning|clone]], [[Namorita]], who by Atlantean law is legally considered her daughter.  ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' revealed that she had been a member of [[The Monster Hunters]] in 1956.

==Exiles==
The second Namora is associated with the multiversal travelers called the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]].  She is an alternate-earth counterpart of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].  Unlike the [[Earth-616]] Namor, she is female and has the blue skin of most Atlanteans.  Namora first appeared in ''Exiles'' #46, and was created by [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Mizuki Sakakibara]].  In Namora's universe, she conquered the world and ruled it for decades, before becoming 'unhinged' in time and forced to join the Exiles, much to her chagrin.  Having a haughty attitude, she acted like she was superior to the other members. Still, she was shown that she did care for them, as evidenced when she thought that [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] had killed [[Morph (comics)|Morph]]. She lashed out at Hyperion, breaking his neck. However, it was for naught. Hyperion recovered quickly and blasted Namora, killing her.
