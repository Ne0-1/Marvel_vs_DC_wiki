'''Pulsar''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared as '''Impulse''' in ''[[X-Men]]'' #107 (October 1977-February 1978), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
Pulsar is a long-time member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], also known as '''Impulse'''. He is made of pure energy, and his form is only contained by his costume. He can release blasts of energy from his visor.

He was with the Imperial Guard the first time they fought the X-Men.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

He was seemingly killed by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], who breached Impulse's suit.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Pulsar later reappeared alive, battling alongside the rest of the Imperial Guard in an assault on the Kree, where Pulsar gravely wounded the Inhuman elite warrior, Gorgon.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Pulsar can fire energy blasts from his hands and visor. He can also fly either on his own or using the Shi'ar anti-gravity device.

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] (Dave Cockrum, co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion). Pulsar is based on LSH member [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
