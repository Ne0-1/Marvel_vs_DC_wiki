'''Superman''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], high school students living in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in 1933. They sold Superman to Detective Comics, the future [[DC Comics]], in 1938. Superman debuted in ''[[Action Comics]]'' [[Action Comics 1|#1]] ([[cover-date]]d June 1938) and subsequently appeared in various radio serials, [[Comic strip|newspaper strips]], television programs, films, and video games. With this success, Superman helped to create the superhero archetype and establish its primacy within the [[American comic book]].<ref name=TCS11/> The character is also referred to by such epithets as the Man of Steel, the Man of Tomorrow, and The Last Son of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comic Books: How the Industry Works|page=72|first=Shirrel|last=Rhoades|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2008|isbn=0820488925}}</ref>

The [[Origin of Superman|origin story of Superman]] relates that he was born '''Kal-El''' on the alien planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], before being rocketed to [[Earth]] as an infant by his scientist father [[Jor-El]], moments before Krypton's destruction. Discovered and adopted by [[Ma and Pa Kent|a Kansas farmer and his wife]], the child is raised as '''Clark Kent''' and imbued with a strong moral compass. Very early on he started to display various [[superhuman]] [[Powers and abilities of Superman|abilities]], which, upon reaching maturity, he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity through a secret "Superman" identity.

Superman resides and operates in the fictional American city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. As [[Clark Kent]], he is a journalist for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', a Metropolis newspaper. Superman's love interest is generally [[Lois Lane]], and his archenemy is [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]]. He is typically a member of the [[Justice League]] and close ally of [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. Like other characters in the DC Universe, several [[alternative versions of Superman|alternate versions]] of Superman have been depicted over the years.

Superman's appearance is distinctive and iconic; he usually wears a blue costume with a red-and-yellow [[Superman logo|emblem]] on the chest, consisting of the letter ''S'' in a shield shape, and a red cape. This shield is used in many media to symbolize the character. Superman is widely considered an [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]].<ref name=TCS11/><ref>{{cite book | last=Holt | first=Douglas B. | year=2004 | title=How Brands Become Icons: The Principles of Cultural Branding | publisher=[[Harvard Business School Press]] | location=[[Boston]], MA | page=1 | isbn=1-57851-774-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor= Koehler, Derek J. |editor2=Harvey, Nigel. | year=2004 | title=Blackwell Handbook of Judgment and Decision Making | publisher=Blackwell| page=519 | isbn=1-4051-0746-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Dinerstein | first=Joel | year=2003 | title=Swinging the machine: Modernity, technology, and African American culture between the wars | publisher=University of Massachusetts Press| page=81 | isbn=1-55849-383-2 }}</ref> He has fascinated scholars, with [[Cultural studies|cultural theorists]], commentators, and critics alike exploring the character's impact and role in the [[United States]] and worldwide. The character's ownership has often been the subject of dispute, with Siegel and Shuster twice suing for the return of rights. The character has been [[Superman (franchise)|adapted extensively]] and portrayed in other forms of media as well, including films, television series, and video games. Several actors have portrayed Superman in motion pictures and TV series including [[Kirk Alyn]], [[George Reeves]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Dean Cain]], [[Tom Welling]], [[Brandon Routh]], [[Henry Cavill]], and [[Tyler Hoechlin]].

The titular character is a vagrant who gains vast psychic powers from an experimental drug and uses them maliciously for profit and amusement, only to lose them and become a vagrant again, ashamed that he will be remembered only as a villain.<ref name="Daniels13-14"/> Siegel's fanzine did not sell well. Siegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, which they self-published in a book they called ''Popular Comics''. The pair dreamed of becoming professional authors and believed that syndicated newspaper strips offered more lucrative and stable work than pulp magazines. The art quality standards were also lower, making them more accessible to the inexperienced Shuster.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}: "What really pushed Jerry in this direction was an article about comics called “The Funny Papers” that he read in ''Fortune'' magazine. The article begins with the shocking fact that “some twenty comic-strip headliners are paid at least $1,000 a week.” The article describes in detail how syndicates such as the Chicago Tribune and even Cleveland’s Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) worked ''for'' writers and artists to put their strips into hundreds of papers. According to the article, this “is how the strips get into Big Money.” So much so that “the headliners usually get 50 per cent of the gross income.” [...] As far as artists go, “In many cases they were not artists at all, but just fellows with a knack for sketching who thought of a good idea or a funny character that ‘made a hit’ with an editor and eventually with newspaper readers.”"</ref>

In early 1933 or in 1934,<ref name=riccap92>{{harvp|Ricca |2014|p= 92}}, says, "It was the night of Sunday, June 18, 1933". Siegel says only "early 1933" In {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}. Other sources, including court records, list the year as 1934. <!--The cover to their first Superman comic &mdash; the one they submitted to Humor Publishing &mdash; is dated 1933.--></ref> Siegel developed a new character, also named Superman, but now a heroic character, which Siegel felt would be more marketable.<ref>In {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}, Siegel is quoted as saying: "Obviously, having him a hero would be infinitely more commercial than having him a villain.  I understand that the comic strip Dr. Fu Manchu ran into all sorts of difficulties because the main character was a villain.  And with the example before us of Tarzan and other action heroes of fiction who were very successful, mainly because people admired them and looked up to them, it seemed the sensible thing to do to make The Superman a hero.  The first piece was a short story, and that's one thing; but creating a successful comic strip with a character you'll hope will continue for many years, it would definitely be going in the wrong direction to make him a villain."</ref> This first prototype of Superman had no fantastic abilities and wore casual clothing. Siegel and Shuster often compared this version to [[Slam Bradley]], a comics character they created in 1936.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=17}}: "... usually [Shuster] and Siegel agreed that no special costume was in evidence, and the surviving artwork bears them out. The most important point on which [Siegel and Shuster] are clear is that this version of the hero had no superpowers."</ref><ref>In {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}, Shuster is quoted as saying: "It wasn't really Superman: that was before he evolved into a costumed figure.  He was simply wearing a T-shirt and pants..."</ref>

Siegel shared his idea with Shuster and they decided to turn it into a comic strip. The first publisher they solicited was Humor Publishing in Chicago, after having read one of their comic books, [[Dan Dunn|''Detective Dan'']].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/publisher/5115/ Humor Publishing Company] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref><ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/dandunn.htm Dan Dunn] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

And its publication didn't depend on the distant and indifferent world of newspaper syndication but on what was, in Jerry's mind at least, the far more familiar world of cheap magazines. 'We can ''do'' this!' he said."</ref> A representative of Humor Publishing was due to visit Cleveland on a business trip and so Siegel and Shuster hastily put together a comic story titled "The Superman" and presented it to the publisher.<ref>Most sources, including {{harvp|Jones|2004}} and {{harvp|Ricca|2014}}, agree that Siegel met with Humor Publishing in Cleveland. {{harvp|Tye|2012}} writes that they mailed their proposal to Humor's offices in Chicago.</ref> Although Humor showed interest, it pulled out of the comics business before any book deal could be made.<ref name=Ricca2014>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}</ref>

[[File:Siegel_Shuster_Superman_1933_concept.png|thumb|upright|Inked cover of ''The Superman'', a rejected 1933 comic story proposal by Siegel and Shuster]]
Siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster.<ref name=riccap99>{{harvp|Ricca |2014|p= 99}}: "Jerry was convinced, just as he was in those early pulp days, that you had to align yourself with someone famous to be famous yourself."</ref> When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "'When I told Joe of this, he unhappily destroyed the drawn-up pages of "THE SUPERMAN" burning them in the furnace of his apartment building,' Jerry recalled. 'At my request, he gave me as a gift the torn cover.'"</ref><ref>In an interview with {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}, Shuster said he destroyed their 1933 Superman comic as a reaction to Humor Publishing's rejection letter, which contradicts Siegel's account in Siegel's unpublished memoir. {{harvp|Tye|2012}} argues that the account from the memoir is the truth, and that Shuster lied in the interview to avoid tension.</ref>

Siegel solicited multiple artists<ref name=riccap99 /><ref name=jonesp112-113>{{harvp|Jones|2004|p=112-113}}</ref> and in 1934 Russell Keaton,<ref name=jonesp112-113 /> who worked on the ''[[Buck Rogers (comic strip)|Buck Rogers]]'' comic strip, responded. In nine sample strips Keaton produced based on Siegel's treatment, the Superman character further evolves: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to "giant cataclysms", the last surviving man sends his child back in time to the year 1935, where he is adopted by Sam and Molly Kent. The boy exhibits superhuman strength and bulletproof skin, and the Kents teach the child, whom they name Clark, to use his powers for good.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080820-SupermanKeaton.html|title=Superman's Hidden History: The Other "First" Artist|last=Trexler|first=Jeff|date=August 20, 2008|publisher= Newsarama.com | accessdate = August 26, 2008 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5aMw18S0O | archivedate = August 26, 2008 | deadurl = no }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.fortalezadelasoledad.com/notas/siegel_keaton_complete.pdf|title=Scans of Siegel and Keaton's collaboration | archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6dbvdUMF0 |archive-date=7 December 2015}}</ref> However, the [[Print syndication|newspaper syndicates]] rejected their work and Keaton abandoned the project.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014|p=102}}: "Jerry tried to sell this version to the syndicates, but no one was interested, so Keaton gave up."</ref>

Siegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman. The character became an alien from the planet Krypton with the now-familiar costume: tights with an "S" on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape.<ref name=TCS18/><ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Daniel|author2=Bryan Singer |title=The Art of Superman Returns | publisher= Chronicle Books|year=2006|page=22|isbn=0-8118-5344-6}}</ref><ref>Over the years, Siegel and Shuster made contradictory statements regarding when they developed Superman's familiar costume. They occasionally claimed to have developed it immediately in 1933, but {{harvp|Daniels|1998}} writes: "... usually [Shuster] and Siegel agreed that no special costume was in evidence [in 1933], and the surviving artwork bears them out." The cover art for their 1933 proposal to Humor Publishing shows a shirtless, cape-less Superman. Siegel's collaboration with Russell Keaton in 1934 contains no description or illustration of Superman in costume. {{harvp|Tye|2012}} writes that Siegel and Shuster developed the costume shortly after they resumed working together. In an interview with {{harvp|Andrae|1983}}, Siegel said:<br/><br/>"NEMO: When you first conceived Superman, did you have the dual-identity theme in mind?
Siegel: That occurred to me in late 1934, when I decided that I'd like to do ''Superman'' as a newspaper strip.  I approached Joe about it, and he was enthusiastic about the possibility.  I was up late one night, and more and more ideas kept coming to me, and I kept writing out several weeks of syndicate strips for the proposed newspaper strip.  When morning came, I had written several weeks of material, and I dashed over to Joe's place and showed it to him. (This was the story that appeared in ''Action Comics'' #1, June, 1938, the first published appearance of ''Superman''.) [...] Of course, Joe had worked on that earlier version of ''Superman'', and when I came to him with this new version of it, he was immediately sold."</ref> They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and introduced his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman but does not realize he and Kent are the same person.<ref>Siegel's unpublished memoir, [https://www.scribd.com/document/322254278/The-Story-Behind-Superman ''The Story Behind Superman''], as well as an interview in ''Nemo'' #2 in 1983, corroborate each other that Clark Kent's timid-journalist persona and Lois Lane were developed in 1934.</ref>

Siegel and Shuster entered the comics field professionally in 1935, producing detective and adventure stories for the New York-based comic-book publisher [[National Allied Publications]]. Although National expressed  interest in Superman,<ref name=riccap146>Letter quoted in {{harvp|Ricca|2014|p=146}}</ref> Siegel and Shuster wanted to sell Superman as a [[print syndication|syndicated comic strip]], but the newspaper syndicates all turned them down.<ref name=riccap134>{{harvp|Ricca|2014|p=134}} "They submitted and resubmitted for several years."</ref> [[Max Gaines]], who worked at [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]], suggested they show their work to Detective Comics (which had recently bought out National Allied).<ref>Siegel, Jerry.

In March 1938, Siegel and Shuster sold all rights to the character to Detective Comics, Inc.<ref name=gcd-action1>[http://www.comics.org/issue/293/ ''Action Comics'' #1 (June 1938)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> for $130 (the equivalent of ${{Inflation|US|130|1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} when adjusted for inflation).<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}: "The facts are that it was Harry [Donenfeld] who signed [Siegel and Shuster], at Gaines's direction, and when McClure sold the Superman strip to the newspapers, McClure bought the rights from Harry, not the boys. It was then Donenfeld who not only now owned the property, but received the lion's share of the profits; whatever Jerry and Joe got was parsed out by him."</ref> It was the company's policy to buy the full rights to the characters it published.<ref>{{harvp|Kobler|1941|p=73}}: "Before payment, however, [Donenfeld's] far-seeing general manager, Jack Liebowitz, mailed them a release form, explaining, ‘It is customary for all our contributors to release all rights to us. This is the businesslike way of doing things.’"</ref> By this time, they had resigned themselves that Superman would never be a success, and with this deal they would at least see their character finally published.<ref>{{harvp|Kobler|1941|p=73}}: "The partners, who by this time had abandoned hope that Superman would ever amount to much, mulled this over gloomily. Then Siegel shrugged, ‘Well, at least this way we'll see him in print.’ They signed the form."</ref>

=== Influences ===
Siegel and Shuster read [[Pulp magazine|pulp science-fiction and adventure magazines]], and many stories featured characters with extraordinary powers such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and superhuman strength. An influence was [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[John Carter of Mars]], a human who was displaced to Mars, where the low gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "...when I did the version in 1934, (which years later, in 1938, was published, in revised form, in Action Comics #1) the John Carter stories did influence me. Carter was able to leap great distances because the planet Mars was smaller that the planet Earth; and he had great strength. I visualized the planet Krypton as a huge planet, much larger than Earth; so whoever came to Earth from that planet would be able to leap great distances and lift great weights."</ref> While it is widely assumed that the 1930 [[Philip Wylie]] novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'', featuring a protagonist, [[Hugo Danner]], with similar powers, was an inspiration for Superman,<ref>{{harvp|Steranko|1970|p=37}}: "Wylie's story was one of Siegel's favorites; he even reviewed it in his S-F fanzine."</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last =Feeley | first =Gregory |date=March 2005 | title =When World-views Collide: Philip Wylie in the Twenty-first Century | journal =Science Fiction Studies | volume =32 | issue =95 |issn=0091-7729 | url =http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/feeley95.htm | accessdate =December 6, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130403153230/http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/feeley95.htm | archivedate=April 3, 2013|deadurl = no}}</ref> Siegel denied this.<ref>{{harvp|Jones|2004|p=346}}: Wylie threatened to sue Siegel for plagiarism in 1940, but there is no evidence that he carried through with the litigation.

Siegel and Shuster were also avid moviegoers.<ref name=Andrae1983>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}</ref> Shuster based Superman's stance and devil-may-care attitude on that of [[Douglas Fairbanks]], who starred in adventure films such as ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "... I was inspired by the movies.  In the silent films, my hero was Douglas Fairbanks Senior, who was very agile and athletic.  So I think he might have been an inspiration to us, even in his attitude.  He had a stance which I often used in drawing Superman. You'll see in many of his roles—including Robin Hood—that he always stood with his hands on his hips and his feet spread apart, laughing—taking nothing seriously."</ref> The name of Superman's home city, Metropolis, was taken from the [[Metropolis (1927 film)|1927 film of the same name]].<ref name=Andrae1983/> [[Popeye]] cartoons were also an influence.<ref name=dannyboy>{{cite web| url = http://ohdannyboy.blogspot.be/2012/08/jerry-and-i-did-comic-book-together.html| first= Daniel|last=Best| date=August 3, 2012| title='Jerry and I did a comic book together...'

The persona of Clark Kent was inspired by slapstick comedian [[Harold Lloyd]]. Lloyd wore glasses and often played gentle characters who were abused by bullies, but later in the story would snap and fight back furiously. Shuster, who also wore glasses and described himself as "mild-mannered", found Lloyd's characters relatable.<ref>Siegel: "We especially loved some of those movies in which Harold Lloyd would start off as a sort of momma's boy being pushed around, kicked around, thrown around, and then suddenly would turn into a fighting whirlwind."<br/><br/>Shuster: "I was kind of mild-manned and wore glasses so I really identified with it"<br/><br/>{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUrFYU2e_I |title= Superman - The Comic Strip Hero| publisher=BBC| people= Anthony Wall | medium=Television production| date=1981| time= 00:04:50}}</ref> Kent is a journalist because Siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school. The inclusion of a romantic subplot with [[Lois Lane]] was inspired by Siegel's own awkwardness with girls.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: Siegel: “As a high school student, I thought that some day I might become a reporter, and I had crushes on several attractive girls who either didn't know I existed or didn't care I existed. [...] It occurred to me: What if I was real terrific? What if I had something special going for me, like jumping over buildings or throwing cars around or something like that? Then maybe they would notice me.”</ref>

The pair collected comic strips in their youth, with a favorite being [[Winsor McCay]]'s fantastical ''[[Little Nemo]]''.<ref name=Andrae1983/> Shuster remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style: "[[Alex Raymond]] and [[Burne Hogarth]] were my idols&nbsp;– also [[Milt Caniff]], [[Hal Foster]], and [[Roy Crane]]."<ref name=Andrae1983/> Shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected.<ref name=Ricca2014>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}</ref>

As a boy, Shuster was obsessed with fitness culture<ref name=dannyboy /> and a fan of [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]] such as [[Siegmund Breitbart]] and [[Joseph Greenstein]]. He collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art.<ref name=Ricca2014/>

The visual design of Superman came from multiple influences. The tight-fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers, boxers, and [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]]. Shuster first gave Superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes.<ref>{{harvp|Andrae|1983}}: "I also had classical heroes and strongmen in mind, and this shows in the footwear.  In the third version Superman wore sandals laced halfway up the calf. You can still see this on the cover of Action #1, though they were covered over in red to look like boots when the comic was printed."</ref> The emblem on his chest may have been inspired by the uniforms of athletic teams. Many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes. Superman's face was based on [[Johnny Weissmuller]]'s.<ref name=Ricca2014/><!-- cite is for whole paragraph-->

The word "superman" was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability, most often athletes and politicians.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}: "What the boys did read were the magazines and papers where "superman" was a common word. Its usage was almost always preceded by "a." Most times the word was used to refer to an athlete or a politician."</ref> It occasionally appeared in pulp fiction stories as well, such as "The Superman of Dr. Jukes"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Flagg |first=Francis |date=Nov 11, 1931 |title=The Superman of Dr. Jukes |magazine=Wonder Stories |publisher=Gernsback}}</ref> and [[Doc Savage]].<ref>"His life work was one which called for the abilities of a superman, and Doc had been trained from the cradle, that he might have the strength to arise to any occasion."<br/>-Robeson, Kenneth (September 1933). "The Lost Oasis". ''Doc Savage Magazine''. Street & Smith.</ref> It is unclear whether Siegel and Shuster were influenced by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of the [[Übermensch]];<ref name="mythology" /> they never acknowledged as much.<ref>{{cite news | first=Howard | last=Jacobson | page=5 | title=Up, Up and Oy Vey! | date=March 5, 2005 |work=The Times | url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/article2396955.ece |location=UK }}: "If Siegel and Shuster knew of Nietzsche's Ubermensch, they didn't say..."</ref>

Superman debuted as the cover feature of the anthology [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] ([[cover-date]]d June 1938 and published on April 18, 1938).<ref>{{Cite book | last=Muir | first=John Kenneth | title=The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kdMzAQAAIAAJ | accessdate=2011-05-31 | date=July 2008 | publisher=[[McFarland & Co.]] | isbn=978-0-7864-3755-9 | page=539}}</ref> The series was an immediate success,<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Vendors had sold 130,000 comic books, or 64 percent of the print run. Anything over 50 percent constituted a success and guaranteed a profit. [...]  Sales, meanwhile, continued to climb—to 136,000 for the second issue, 159,000 for the third, 190,000 for the fourth, and 197,000 for the fifth. Action No. 13, released on the first anniversary of the original, offered up 415,000 reasons to celebrate. National printed 725,000 copies of Action No. 16 and sold 625,000—an unheard-of success rate of 86 percent."</ref> and reader feedback showed that Superman was responsible.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "...readers were asked to list in order of preference their five favorite stories.

Sales of ''Action Comics'' and ''Superman'' declined steadily from the 1950s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zak-site.com/Great-American-Novel/comic_sales.html|title=Marvel and DC sales figures|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comichron.com/titlespotlights/superman.html|title=Superman Annual Sales Figures|first=John Jackson, ed.|last= Miller|publisher=ComicChron.com}}</ref> but rose again starting in 1987. ''Superman'' #75 (Nov 1992) sold over 6 million copies, making it the best-selling issue of a comic book of all time,<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "''Superman'' 75, the death issue, tallied the biggest one-day sale ever for a comic book, with more than six million copies printed."</ref> thanks to a media sensation over the possibly permanent death of the character in that issue.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Journalists, along with most of their readers and viewers, didn’t understand that heroes regularly perished in the comics and almost never stayed dead."</ref> Sales declined from that point on. In February 2016, ''Action Comics'' sold just over 31,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2016/2016-02.html |title=February 2016 Comic Book Sales Figures |publisher=Comichron |accessdate=2016-07-26}}</ref> The comic books are today considered a niche aspect of the Superman franchise due to low readership.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "The remaining audience [by 2011] was dedicated to the point of fanaticism, a trend that was self-reinforcing. No longer did casual readers pick up a comic at the drugstore or grocery, both because the books increasingly required an insider’s knowledge to follow the action and because they simply weren’t being sold anymore at markets, pharmacies, or even the few newsstands that were left. [...] Comic books had gone from being a cultural emblem to a countercultural refuge."</ref>

Beginning in January 1939, a ''Superman'' daily comic strip appeared in newspapers, syndicated through the [[McClure Syndicate]]. A color Sunday version was added that November. The Sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips, possibly because Siegel had to delegate the Sunday strips to [[ghostwriter]]s.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.tcj.com/reviews/superman-the-golden-age-sundays-1943-1946/| title= Reviews: ''Superman: The Golden Age Sundays 1943-1946''| first= Paul|last=Tumey| work=[[The Comics Journal]] |date=April 14, 2014| accessdate= March 1, 2016|archivedate=May 29, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529211844/http://www.tcj.com/reviews/superman-the-golden-age-sundays-1943-1946/ | deadurl=no| quote=...Jerry Siegel had his hands — and typewriter — full, turning out stories for the comic books and the daily newspaper strips (which had completely separate continuities from the Sundays).}}</ref> By 1941, the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=74}}</ref> Shuster drew the early strips, then passed the job to [[Wayne Boring]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.supermansupersite.com/boring.html|publisher=SupermanSuperSite.com| editor-first= Neil A. |editor-last=Cole| title=Wayne Boring (1905 - 1987)| accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> From 1949 to 1956, the newspaper strips were drawn by [[Win Mortimer]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.supermansupersite.com/mortimer.html| publisher=SupermanSuperSite.com| editor-first= Neil A. |editor-last=Cole| title=Win Mortimer (1919 - 1998)| accessdate=March 1, 2016| archivedate= June 30, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140630192703/http://www.supermansupersite.com/mortimer.html | deadurl=no}}</ref> The strip ended in May 1966, but was revived from 1977 to 1983 to coincide with a series of movies released by Warner Bros.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/other/other.php?topic=newspaper-strip |title=Superman Newspaper Strips| publisher=SupermanHomepage.com |first=Steven, ed. |last=Younis|accessdate= February 28, 2016| archivedate= March 26, 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150326134156/http://www.supermanhomepage.com/other/other.php?topic=newspaper-strip | deadurl=no}}</ref>

After Shuster left National, Boring also succeeded him as the principal artist on Superman comic books.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{harvp|Eury|2006|p=18}}: "In 1948 Boring succeeded Shuster as the principal superman artist, his art style epitomizing the Man of Steel's comics and merchandising look throughout the 1950s."</ref> He redrew Superman taller and more detailed.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=74}}: "...Superman was drawn in a more detailed, realistic style of illustration.  He also looked bigger and stronger. "Until then Superman had always seemed squat," Boring said. "He was six heads high, a bit shorter than normal. I made him taller&mdash;nine heads high&mdash;but kept his massive chest."</ref> Around 1955, [[Curt Swan]] in turn succeeded Boring.<ref name="Curt Swan 1987">Curt Swan (1987). ''Drawing Superman''. Essay reprinted in {{harvp|Eury|2006|pp=58}}: "For 30 years or so, from around 1955 until a couple of years ago when I more or less retired, I was the principal artists of the ''Superman'' comic for DC Comics."</ref>

===Creative management===
Initially, Siegel was allowed to write Superman more or less as he saw fit,<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Initially Harry [Donenfeld], Jack [Liebowitz], and the managers they hired to oversee their growing editorial empire had let Jerry [Siegel] do as he wished with the character..."</ref> because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Neither Harry [Donenfeld] nor Jack [Liebowitz] had planned for a separate Superman comic book, or for that to be ongoing. Having Superman's story play out across different venues presented a challenge for Jerry [Siegel] and the writers who came after him: Each installment needed to seem original yet part of a whole, stylistically and narratively. Their solution, at the beginning, was to wing it..."</ref> But soon Siegel and Shuster's work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=42}}: "...the publisher was anxious to avoid any repetition of the censorship problems associated with his early pulp magazines (such as the lurid ''Spicy Detective'')."</ref> Siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Once Superman became big business, however, plots had to be sent to New York for vetting. Not only did editors tell Jerry to cut out the guns and knives and cut back on social crusading, they started calling the shots on minute details of script and drawing."</ref> Editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]], hired in 1940, dictated that Superman not kill.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=42}}: "It was left to Ellsworth to impose tight editorial controls on Jerry Siegel. Henceforth, Superman would be forbidden to use his powers to kill anyone, even a villain."</ref> Sexuality was banned, and colorfully outlandish villains such as [[Ultra-Humanite]] and [[Toyman]] were thought to be less nightmarish for young readers.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "No hint of sex. No alienating parents or teachers. Evil geniuses like the Ultra-Humanite were too otherworldly to give kids nightmares."<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>"The Prankster, the Toyman, the Puzzler, and J. Wilbur Wolngham, a W. C. Fields lookalike, used tricks and gags instead of a bow and arrows in their bids to conquer Superman. For editors wary of controversy, 1940s villains like those were a way to avoid the sharp edges of the real world."</ref>

[[Mort Weisinger]] was the editor on Superman comics from 1941 to 1970, his tenure briefly interrupted by military service. Siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology, but as the number of Superman titles and the pool of writers grew, Weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Before Mort came along, Superman’s world was ad hoc and seat-of-the-pants, with Jerry and other writers adding elements as they went along without any planning or anyone worrying whether it all hung together. That worked fine when all the books centered around Superman and all the writing was done by a small stable. Now the pool of writers had grown and there were eight different comic books with hundreds of Superman stories a year to worry about."</ref> Weisinger assigned story ideas, and the logic of Superman's powers, his origin, the locales, and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned. Elements such as [[Bizarro]], [[Supergirl]], the [[Phantom Zone]], alternate varieties of [[kryptonite]], [[Superman robots|robot doppelgangers]], and [[Krypto]] were introduced. The complicated universe built under Weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "But Weisinger’s innovations were taking a quiet toll on the story. Superman’s world had become so complicated that readers needed a map or even an encyclopedia to keep track of everyone and everything. (There would eventually be encyclopedias, two in fact, but the first did not appear until 1978.) All the plot complications were beguiling to devoted readers, who loved the challenge of keeping current, but to more casual fans they could be exhausting."</ref> Weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama, and avoided sensitive subjects such as the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] because he feared his [[right-wing]] views would alienate his writing staff and readers.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Weisinger stories steered clear of the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, the black power movement, and other issues that red the 1960s. There was none of what Mort would have called “touchy-feely” either, much as readers might have liked to know how Clark felt about his split personality, or whether Superman and Lois engaged in the battles between the sexes that were a hallmark of the era. Mort wanted his comics to be a haven for young readers, and he knew his right-leaning politics wouldn’t sit well with his leftist writers and many of his Superman fans."</ref> Weisinger also introduced [[Comic book letter column|letters columns]] in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=102}}: "One of the ways the editor kept in touch with his young audience was through a letters colum, "Metropolis Mailbag," introduced in 1958."</ref> Superman was the best-selling comic book character of the 1960s.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "It did work. In 1960, the first year in which sales data was made public, Superman was selling more comic books than any other title or character, and he stayed on top through much of the decade. The Man of Steel was at the front of a charge that saw superheroes taking over from western and romance-themed comics. Some of that was a dividend from an easing of the comics scare and other, broader forces, but Weisinger’s reinventions were key ingredients in Superman’s comeback. “Mort kept it alive,” says Carmine Infantino, a National Comics artist who would rise to editorial director, then publisher. “He was a damn good editor. Damn good.”"</ref><ref>Comichron. [http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales.html Comic Book Sales By Year].</ref>

Weisinger retired in 1970 and [[Julius Schwartz]] took over. By his own admission, Weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "He admitted later he was losing touch with a new generation of kids and their notions about heroes and villains."</ref> Schwartz updated Superman by removing overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers and making Clark Kent a television anchor.<ref>Julius Schwartz, quoted in {{harvp|Daniels|1998}}: "I said, 'I want to get rid of all the kryptonite. I want to get rid of all the robots that are used to get him out of situations. And I'm sick and tired of that stupid suit Clark Kent wears all the time. I want to give him more up-to-date clothes.  And maybe the most important thing I want to do is take him out of the Daily Planet and put him into television.' I said 'Our readers are not that familiar with newspapers. Most of them get their news on television, and I think it's high time after all these years.'"</ref> Schwartz also scaled Superman's powers down to a level closer to Siegel's original. These changes would eventually be reversed by later writers. Schwartz allowed stories with serious drama, as in "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]" (''Superman Annual'' #11), in which the villain [[Mongul]] torments Superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living Krypton.

Schwartz retired from DC Comics in 1986, and was succeeded by [[Mike Carlin]] as editor on Superman comics His retirement coincided with DC Comics' decision to streamline the shared continuity called the [[DC Universe]] with the companywide-crossover storyline "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]". Writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] rewrote the Superman mythos, again reducing Superman's powers, which writers had slowly re-strengthened, and revised many supporting characters, such as making [[Lex Luthor]] a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist, and making Supergirl an [[Supergirl (Matrix)|artificial shapeshifting organism]] because DC wanted Superman to be the sole surviving Kryptonian.

Carlin was promoted to Executive Editor for the [[DC Universe]] books in 1996, a position he held until 2002. K.C. Carlson took his place as editor of the Superman comics.

The 1940s radio serial was produced by [[Robert Maxwell (producer)|Robert Maxwell]] and Allen Ducovny, who were employees of Superman, Inc. and Detective Comics, respectively.<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "[Harry Donenfeld] drafted Maxwell into Superman, Inc., first to oversee the licensing of toys and other products, then to bring the superhero into the world of broadcast."</ref><ref>{{harvp|Scivally|2007}}: "Superman was brought to radio by Allen Ducovny, a press agent with Detective Comics, and Robert Maxwell (the pen name of Robert Joffe), a former pulp fiction author who was in charge of licensing the subsidiary rights of the company's comic book characters."</ref> Robert Maxwell was later hired to produce the TV show starring [[George Reeves]]. DC Comics (then known as National Comics Publications) felt that the first season was too violent for what they expected to be a children's show, so they removed Maxwell and replaced him with [[Whitney Ellsworth]], a veteran writer and editor at National Comics.<ref>{{harvp|Scivally|2007}}: "...Robert Maxwell hoped for an adult time slot, so he made Superman an adult show, with death scenes and rough violence."<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>"In May of 1953, script conferences began for the second season of ''Adventures of Superman''.  The program was now under the supervision of a new producer. Robert Maxwell was out, National Comics' editorial director Whitney Ellsworth was in."</ref> DC Comics had approval rights over all creative aspects of the [[Superboy (TV series)|''Superboy'' TV series (1988-1992)]], from scripts to casting to shooting revisions.<ref>Jenette Kahn: "We have approval rights to everything, the casting of Superboy/Clark Kent, approval of the synopses, the scripts and revised scripts.  We even have the right to be on the set as the show is being shot to oversee the revisions being made during shooting."<br/><br/>{{cite magazine |last1=McDonnell |first1=David |last2=Dickholtz |first2=Daniel |date=1988 |title=...And the Adventures of Superboy |magazine=Comics Scene |issue=5 |publisher=O'Quinn Studios, Inc.}}</ref>

The first three movies starring [[Christopher Reeve]] were produced by [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]]. When Warner Bros sold the movie rights to Superman to the Salkinds in 1974, it demanded control over the budget and the casting but left everything else to the producers' discretion.<ref>{{harvp|Scivally|2007|p=77}}: "Under the terms of the deal, Warners would have budget and casting approval and the right of first refusal for Superman films made by the Salkinds, but otherwise the financing and production of the films was up to the producers."</ref> These movies influenced future stories, with the Salkinds insisting Clark Kent be a newspaper journalist, in order to appeal to older fans.<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1998}}: "The Salkinds told Puzo to take Clark Kent off TV and make him a newspaperman after a survey revealed that's how most adults remembered him."</ref> Kent left his TV anchor job and returned to the ''Daily Planet''. Innovations such as [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]]'s crystalline set designs for Krypton and the Fortress of Solitude, Superman's chest emblem being his family crest, and screenwriter [[Mario Puzo]]'s messianic themes were also adopted by the comics' writers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Aesthetic style===
In the earlier decades of Superman comics, artists were expected to conform to a certain "house style".<ref>{{harvp|Harvey|1996|p=144}}: "Artistic expressiveness of a highly individualistic sort had never been particularly welcomed by traditional comic book publishers. The corporate mind, ever focused on the bottom line of the balance sheet, favored bland "house styles" of rendering..."</ref> Joe Shuster defined the aesthetic style of Superman in the 1940s, and not just in the comics: he also provided character [[model sheet]]s for the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Fleischer & Famous animated serial of the 1940s]].<ref>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Max and Dave [Fleischer's] composers knew what Superman, Lois, and the others should look like, thanks to model sheets provided by Joe Shuster."</ref> After Shuster left National, [[Wayne Boring]] succeeded him as the principal artist on Superman comic books.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He redrew Superman taller and more detailed.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Around 1955, [[Curt Swan]] in turn succeeded Boring.<ref name="Curt Swan 1987"/> The 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single "house style" in Superman comics.<ref>{{harvp|Wandtke|2012}}</ref>

==Copyright battles==

===Ownership lawsuits===
{{Main article|Superman ownership disputes}}
Siegel wrote most of the comic-book and daily newspaper stories until he was conscripted in 1943.<ref>"While I was in the service they started ghosting the Superman scripts, because obviously I couldn't write them while I was away in the service."<br/>-Siegel, in a 1975 interview with Phil Yeh for ''Cobblestone'' magazine.  Quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=WCmjvlWSngsC&pg=PA49&dq=While+I+was+in+the+service+they+started+ghosting+the+Superman+scripts,+because+obviously+I+couldn%27t+write+them+while+I+was+away+in+the+service&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-ktLOzaLLAhVGRhQKHeO3Ak8Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=While%20I%20was%20in%20the%20service%20they%20started%20ghosting%20the%20Superman%20scripts%2C%20because%20obviously%20I%20couldn't%20write%20them%20while%20I%20was%20away%20in%20the%20service&f=false ''Siegel and Shuster's Funnyman'' by Tom Andrae and Mel Gordon] on page 49.</ref> While Siegel was serving in Hawaii, Detective Comics introduced a child version of Superman called "[[Superboy]]", based on a concept Siegel had submitted several years before. Siegel was furious because Detective did this without having bought the character.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}: "Jerry felt angry and instantly very isolated: ''Harry had gone ahead and okayed the title without telling him—or paying for it''?"</ref> After Siegel's discharge from the Army, he and Shuster sued Detective Comics in 1947 for the rights to Superman and [[Superboy]].  The judge ruled that the March 1938 sale of Superman was binding, but that Superboy was a separate entity that rightfully belonged to Siegel. Siegel and Shuster settled out-of-court with Detective, which paid the pair $94,000 (${{Inflation|US|94000|1948|r=-4|fmt=c}} when adjusted for inflation) in exchange for the full rights to both Superman and Superboy.<ref name=Sergi2015>{{harvp|Sergi|2015}}</ref> Detective then fired Siegel and Shuster.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}: "Jerry and Joe got a final check—and were promptly shown the door by National."</ref>

In 1969, Siegel and Shuster attempted to regain rights to Superman using the renewal option in the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], but the court ruled Siegel and Shuster had transferred the renewal rights to Detective Comics in 1938. Siegel and Shuster appealed, but the appeals court upheld this decision. Detective had re-hired Siegel as a writer in 1957, but fired him again when he filed this second lawsuit.

In 1975, Siegel and a number of other comic book writers and artists launched a public campaign for better compensation and treatment of comic creators.  Warner Brothers agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, full medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman productions in exchange for never contesting ownership of Superman. Siegel and Shuster upheld this bargain.<ref name=Ricca2014/>

Shuster died in 1992.  DC Comics offered Shuster's heirs a stipend in exchange for never challenging ownership of Superman, which they accepted for some years.<ref name=Sergi2015/>

Siegel died in 1996. His heirs attempted to take the rights to Superman using the termination provision of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. DC Comics negotiated an agreement wherein it would pay the Siegel heirs several million dollars and a yearly stipend of $500,000 in exchange for permanently granting DC the rights to Superman.  DC Comics also agreed to insert the line "By Special Arrangement with the Jerry Siegel Family" in all future Superman productions.<ref>This term was spelled out in an [https://www.scribd.com/doc/298962960/October-19-2001-Letter-From-the-Siegels-to-DC-Comics October 19, 2001 letter] from the lawyer representing the Siegel heirs.</ref> The Siegels accepted DC's offer in an October 2001 letter.<ref name=Sergi2015/>

Copyright lawyer and movie producer [[Marc Toberoff]] then struck a deal with the heirs of both Siegel and Shuster to help them get the rights to Superman in exchange for signing the rights over to his production company, Pacific Pictures. Both groups accepted. The Siegel heirs called off their deal with DC Comics and in 2004 sued DC for the rights to Superman and Superboy. In 2008, the judge ruled in favor of the Siegels. DC Comics appealed the decision, and the appeals court ruled in favored of DC, arguing that the October 2001 letter was binding. In 2003, the Shuster heirs served a termination notice for Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman. DC Comics sued the Shuster heirs in 2010, and the court ruled in DC's favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the Shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant.<ref name=Sergi2015/>

Superman is due to enter the public domain in 2033.<ref name=Sergi2015/> However, this would only apply to the character as he is depicted in ''Action Comics'' #1 (1938). Later developments, such as his power of "heat vision" (introduced in 1949), may persist under copyright until the works they were introduced in enter the public domain themselves.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Scott Niswander |date=2015-07-22  |title=Why Isn't SUPERMAN a PUBLIC DOMAIN Superhero?? |medium=YouTube video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzZIQJMYKc8 |access-date=2016-05-21 |time=3:03~3:33 |location= |publisher=NerdSync Productions }}</ref>

===Copyright infringement lawsuits===
Superman's success quickly spawned a wave of imitations, and Detective Comics defended its copyright vigorously.<ref>{{harvp|Ricca|2014}}: "Harry sued these impostors &mdash; Wonder Man, Captain Marvel, and others &mdash; usually within days of their release."</ref> [[Will Eisner]] created a character called [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]] in 1939, but a lawsuit from Detective Comics forced its cancellation after just one issue.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.publaw.com/article/protection-of-graphic-characters/ | title =Protection of Graphic Characters | accessdate =December 3, 2011|year=1998 | author=Lloyd L.

==Fictional character biography==
In ''Action Comics'' #1 (April 1938), Superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans. When his world is on the verge of destruction, his father, a scientist, places his infant son alone in a spaceship that takes him to Earth. The earliest newspaper strips name the planet "Krypton", the baby "Kal-L", and his biological parents "Jor-L" and "Lora";<ref>[http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/daily/ep01_15/episode1_1.jpg ''Superman'' comic strip, January 16, 1939], reprinted at {{cite web|url= http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/daily/ep01_15/ep1.html |title=Episode 1: Superman Comes to Earth| publisher=TheSpeedingBullet.com| accessdate= March 27, 2016| archivedate=March 6, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306164334/http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/daily/ep01_15/ep1.html |deadurl=no}}</ref> their names become "Jor-el", and "Lara" in a 1942 spinoff novel by George Lowther.<ref>Lowther, George (1942).

The Kents teach Clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed identity of Superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment's notice. To complete this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and suffers occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice.

Writers developed Superman's powers gradually. Since the beginning, he has had superhuman strength and a nigh-invulnerable body. In the earliest comics, Superman travels by running and leaping.  In the radio serial that began in 1940, Superman has the ability to fly.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Clark Kent, Reporter |series=The Adventures of Superman |number=2 |station=WOR |date=February 14, 1940}}:<br/><br/>-''Look!

A way to avoid drawing these extra frames was to simply take the frame with Superman standing and move it up slowly over the background, which would make it appear as though he was flying off the ground."</ref> and their animation tests of Superman leaping looked "silly" anyway.<ref name=Fleischer1>{{cite web| url = http://www.fleischerstudios.com/blog/celebrating-supermans-leap-to-the-silver-screen| title=Celebrating Superman's Leap to the Silver Screen!| publisher= [[Fleischer Studios]]| date=September 26, 2015| accessdate= March 22, 2016| archivedate= March 7, 2016| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307203024/http://www.fleischerstudios.com/blog/celebrating-supermans-leap-to-the-silver-screen |quote=But the Fleischers found all that, when animated, all that leaping was kind of... silly looking.

Originally, Superman's powers were common on Krypton, but in later stories they are activated by the light of Earth's yellow sun, and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of Krypton's sun.

Siegel understood that Superman's invulnerability diminished his appeal as an action hero, and so wrote a story introducing "K-metal", whose radiation harms Superman. This draft was never published since the story had Superman reveal his secret identity to Lois,<ref name=Tye2012>{{harvp|Tye|2012}}</ref> but the writers of the radio serial took inspiration and introduced the green mineral [[kryptonite]] in a 1943 episode.<ref>''The Meteor From Krypton'' (June 1943). Per {{harvp|Ricca|2014}}: "And sure enough, elements of Jerry's K-metal story would later surface on the radio, where it would finally be named "kryptonite.""</ref> It first appeared in comics in the story "Superman Returns To Krypton!", credited to writer [[Bill Finger]], in ''Superman'' #61 (Dec. 1949).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/7882/#74473 ''Superman'' #61] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].

Clark works as a newspaper journalist. In the earliest stories, he is employed by George Taylor of ''The Daily Star'', but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to Perry White of  ''The Daily Planet''.<ref>{{harvp|Scivally|2007}}: "The episode also introduced Julian Noa as Clark Kent's boss, whose name had evolved from Paris White to Perry White. White's newspaper changed from ''The Daily Flash'' to ''The Daily Planet''.

Clark is romantically attracted to her, but she rejects the mild-mannered Clark and is infatuated with the bold and mighty Superman. This love triangle was conceived in 1934 and is present in most Superman stories. Jerry Siegel objected to any proposal that Lois discover that Clark is Superman because he felt that, as implausible as Clark's disguise is, the love triangle was too important to the book's appeal.<ref>"If Lois should ACTUALLY learn Clark's secret, the strip would lose about 75% of its appeal—the human interest angle. I know that a formula can possibly prove monotonous through repetition but I fear that if this element is removed from the story formula that makes up SUPERMAN, that this strip will lose a great part of its effectiveness." Siegel, in his script notes, quoted in {{harvp|Ricca|2014}}.</ref> For decades in comic stories, Lois suspects Clark is Superman and tries to prove it, but Superman always outwits her; the first such story was ''Superman'' #17 (1942).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/2212/ ''Superman'' #17] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/06/28/when-we-first-met-30/ | title=When We First Met |publisher=(column #30) [[ComicBookResources.com]]| first=Brian |last=Cronin | date= June 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 16, 2016 | archivedate= October 17, 2013| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131017031635/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/06/28/when-we-first-met-30/ | deadurl=no}}</ref>

The first story in which Superman dies was published in ''Superman'' #188 (April 1966) in which he is killed by kryptonite radiation, but is revived in the same issue by one of [[Superman robots|his android doppelgangers]]. In the 1990s ''[[The Death of Superman|The Death and Return of Superman]]'' story arc, after a deadly battle with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Superman died in ''Superman'' #75 (Jan. 1993). He was later revived by the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. In ''Superman'' #52 (May 2016) Superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning, and this time he was not resurrected but replaced by the Superman of a previous continuity.

In 2011, DC Comics rebooted its continuity and relaunched its entire line of comic books under the rubric [[The New 52]], with a new version of Superman as the protagonist of the ''Superman'' books. In this new version of events, Clark's parents were killed by a drunk driver when he was a teenager, and he is not married to Lois.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.newsarama.com/7998-didio-lee-say-dcnu-superman-changes-make-him-accessible.html | title= DiDio, Lee Say DCnU Superman Changes Make Him "Accessible' | first= Vaneta |last=Rogers| date= July 18, 2011 |accessdate= March 27, 2016| archivedate= March 6, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306213859/http://www.newsarama.com/7998-didio-lee-say-dcnu-superman-changes-make-him-accessible.html | deadurl=no}}</ref> In this continity, he first encounters Lex Luthor early in his career as a superhero.

In June 2016, DC Comics once again relaunched its comic book titles with [[DC Rebirth]]. The publisher re-established the pre-''New 52'' Superman as the protagonist of the new comic books, with Lois Lane as his wife once more. He and Lois also conceive a biological son, [[Jonathan Samuel Kent]], who eventually becomes [[Superboy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Vaneta|url=http://www.newsarama.com/29499-rebirth-s-superman-to-explore-father-son-dynamic.html|title= Rebirth Superman's New Status Quo - Being a Super-Dad|publisher=Newsarama.com|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>

=== Personality ===
In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. The character often attacks and terrorizes [[domestic violence|wife beaters]], profiteers, [[lynch mob]]s, and gangsters in a rough manner and with a looser moral code than audiences today might be used to.<ref name="60Y2223"/> Although not as ruthless as the early [[Batman]], Superman in the comics of the 1930s is unconcerned about the harm his strength may cause. He tosses villainous characters in such a manner that fatalities would presumably occur, although these are seldom shown explicitly on the page. This came to an end in late 1940 when new editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing.<ref name="TCS42">{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=42}}</ref> The character was softened and given a sense of [[humanitarianism]]. Ellsworth's code, however, is not to be confused with "[[Comics Code Authority|the Comics Code]]", which was created in 1954 by the [[Comics Code Authority]] and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century.<ref>[[Lee, Jim]].

In his first appearances, Superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities, being fired upon by the National Guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor. By 1942, however, Superman was working side-by-side with the police.<ref name="Weldon33"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Superman the Unauthorized Biography|author=Glen Weldon|page=55|year=2013}}</ref> Today, Superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality, and righteousness.

In ''Superman/Batman'' #3 (Dec. 2003), [[Batman]], under writer [[Jeph Loeb]], observes, "It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then&nbsp;... he shoots fire from the skies, and it is difficult not to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to 'him'." In writer [[Geoff Johns]]' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1 (Dec. 2005), part of the 2005–2006 "Infinite Crisis" crossover storyline, Batman admonishes him for identifying with humanity too much and failing to provide the strong leadership that superhumans need.

=== Age and birthday ===
Superman's age has varied through his history in comics. His age was originally left undefined, with real-time references to specific years sometimes given to past events in Golden Age and early Silver Age comics. In comics published between the early 1970s and early 1990s, his age was usually cited as 29 years old.<ref>''Superboy'' #171, January 1971</ref> However, during "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline, Clark's age was given as 34 years old (in a fictional promotional newspaper published), while 1994's "[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]" timeline established his age as 35.

''Action Comics'' #149 (Oct. 1950) gives October as Superman's birthdate. Comics of the 1960s through 1980s describe Superman's birthday as February 29.<ref>For example, [[For the Man Who Has Everything|''Superman'' Annual #11]] (1985).</ref> Clark Kent, meanwhile, would celebrate his birthday on June 18, the date the Kents first found Clark;  June 18 is also the birthdate of Superman voice actor [[Bud Collyer]].<ref>''Superman'' #263 (April 1973)</ref> Following the 1980s editorial-revamp DC called ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Kent's birthday is given as February 29.<ref>For example, ''Action Comics'' #655 (July 1990).</ref> ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'' #1 (Nov. 2009) depicts Kent celebrating his birthday on December 1.

=== Other versions ===
{{Main article|Alternative versions of Superman}}
{{See also|Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman (Earth-One)}}
The details Superman's story vary across his large body of fiction published since 1938.  Versions of Superman depicted on television and in movies are typically not part of the same narrative continuity presented in the comics, and even in the comic books there are many different depictions of the character, a few of which differ radically from the "classic" version (e.g., the graphic novel ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' depicts a Communist Superman who rules the Soviet Union).  DC Comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different depictions of Superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes.  For instance, in the 1960s, the Superman of "Earth-One" would occasionally star in stories alongside the Superman of "Earth-Two", the latter of whom resembled Superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s.  DC Comics has not developed a consistent and universal system to classify all versions of the character.

== Powers and abilities ==
{{Main article|Powers and abilities of Superman}}
As an influential archetype of the superhero genre, Superman possesses extraordinary powers, with the character traditionally described as "Faster than a speeding bullet.  More powerful than a locomotive.  Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound&nbsp;... It's Superman!",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/radio/radio.php?topic=r-radio|title=Superman Homepage - Superman on Radio & Audio|work=supermanhomepage.com}}</ref> a phrase coined by Jay Morton and first used in the ''Superman'' radio serials and [[Max Fleischer]] animated shorts of the 1940s<ref>{{cite news | title= Obituaries of note | date= September 25, 2003 | work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | url= http://www.sptimes.com/2003/09/25/Worldandnation/Obituaries_of_note.shtml | publisher=[[Wire services]] | accessdate =December 8, 2006}}</ref> as well as the TV series of the 1950s. For most of his existence, Superman's famous arsenal of powers has included [[flight]], [[Superhuman strength|super-strength]], [[invulnerability]] to non-magical attacks, [[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman speed|super-speed]], vision powers (including [[X-ray vision|x-ray]], [[Energy blast|heat]]-emitting, telescopic, infra-red, and microscopic vision), super-hearing, super-intelligence, and super-breath, which enables him to blow out air at freezing temperatures, as well as exert the propulsive force of high-speed winds.<ref name="60Y80">{{harvp|Daniels|1995|p=80}}</ref>

As originally conceived and presented in his early stories, Superman's powers were relatively limited, consisting of superhuman strength that allowed him to lift a car over his head, run at amazing speeds and leap one-eighth of a mile, as well as an incredibly dense body structure that could be pierced by nothing less than an exploding artillery shell.<ref name="60Y80"/> Siegel and Shuster compared his strength and leaping abilities to an ant and a grasshopper.<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] | Artist =[[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]] | Story = A Scientific Explanation of Superman's Amazing Strength--! | Title = Superman | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = Summer 1939 | Publisher=[[National Periodical Publications]] }}</ref> When making the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman cartoons]] in the early 1940s, the [[Fleischer Brothers]] found it difficult to keep animating him leaping and requested to DC to change his ability to flying; this was an especially convenient concept for short films, which would have otherwise had to waste precious running time moving earthbound Clark Kent from place to place.<ref>Cabarga, Leslie, [[Jerry Beck|Beck, Jerry]], [[Richard Fleischer|Fleischer, Richard]] (Interviewees). (2006). "First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series" (supplementary DVD documentary). ''Superman II'' (Two-Disc Special Edition) [DVD]. [[Warner Bros.]].</ref> Writers gradually increased his powers to larger extents during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], in which Superman could fly to other worlds and galaxies and even across universes with relative ease.<ref name="60Y80"/> He would often fly across the solar system to stop meteors from hitting the Earth or sometimes just to clear his head. Writers found it increasingly difficult to write Superman stories in which the character was believably challenged,<ref name="TCS133">Daniels (1998), p. 133.</ref> so DC made a series of attempts to rein the character in. The most significant attempt, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 rewrite, established several hard limits on his abilities: He barely survives a nuclear blast, and his space flights are limited by how long he can hold his breath.<ref name="AH96">{{cite journal | last =Sanderson | first =Peter |date=June 1986 | title = The End of History | journal=[[Amazing Heroes]] | issue =96 | issn =0745-6506 }}</ref> Superman's power levels have again increased since then, with Superman eventually possessing enough strength to hurl mountains, withstand nuclear blasts with ease, fly into the sun unharmed, and survive in the vacuum of outer space without oxygen.

The source of Superman's powers has changed subtly over the course of his history. It was originally stated that Superman's abilities derived from his Kryptonian heritage, which made him eons more evolved than humans.<ref name="TCS42"/> This was soon amended, with the source for the powers now based upon the establishment of Krypton's gravity as having been stronger than that of the Earth. This situation mirrors that of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]]. As Superman's powers increased, the implication that all Kryptonians had possessed the same abilities became problematic for writers, making it doubtful that a race of such beings could have been wiped out by something as trifling as an exploding planet. In part to counter this, the Superman writers established that Kryptonians, whose native star [[Rao (comics)|Rao]] had been red, possessed superpowers only under the light of a yellow sun.<ref name=nationalgeographic>{{cite news|url  = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060622-superman-movie_2.html| title='Superman Returns' Science: Decoding the Movie Hero's Powers | work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] | first=Richard A. |last=Lovett | date=June 23, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2016 | page=2 | archivedate= March 10, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310004659/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060622-superman-movie.html | deadurl=no}}</ref>

Superman is most vulnerable to green [[Kryptonite]], mineral debris from [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet. Exposure to green Kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and immobilizes him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. The only substance on Earth that can protect him from Kryptonite is lead, which blocks the radiation. Lead is also the only known substance that Superman cannot see through with his x-ray vision. Kryptonite was introduced in 1943 as a [[plot device]] to allow the radio-serial voice actor, [[Bud Collyer]], to take some time off.<ref name="TIME14388">{{cite news | first= Otto | last=Friedrich | page =6 | title=Up, Up and Awaaay!!! | date= March 14, 1988 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966978-6,00.html | accessdate =June 6, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065655/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966978-1,00.html| archivedate=October 21, 2007|deadurl=no}} {{subscription}}</ref> Although green Kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with its own effect.<ref name="TCS106107">Daniels (1998), pp. 106–107.</ref>

=== Allies ===
Superman's large cast of supporting characters includes [[Lois Lane]], the character most commonly associated with Superman, being portrayed at different times as his colleague, competitor, love interest and wife. Other main supporting characters include ''[[Daily Planet]]'' coworkers such as photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]] and editor [[Perry White]], Clark Kent's adoptive parents [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]], childhood sweetheart [[Lana Lang]] and best friend [[Pete Ross]], associates like [[Professor Hamilton]] and [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] who often provide scientific advice and tech support, and former college love interest [[Lori Lemaris]] (a [[mermaid]]). Stories making reference to the possibility of Superman siring children have been featured both in and out of mainstream continuity.

Incarnations of [[Supergirl]], [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]], and Superboy have also been major characters in the mythos, as well as the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (of which Superman is usually a member and often its leader). A feature shared by several supporting characters is [[alliteration|alliterative]] names, especially with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], Lois Lane, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Linda Lee]], Lana Lang, Lori Lemaris, and [[Lucy Lane]],<ref>{{Comic book reference | story=Superman's LL's [Text page] | title=Superman | issue=204 | date=February, 1968 | | publisher=DC Comics }}</ref> alliteration being common in early comics.

Team-ups with fellow comics icon [[Batman]] are common, inspiring many stories over the years. When paired, they are often referred to as the "World's Finest" in a nod to the name of the comic book series that features many team-up stories. In 2003, DC began to publish a new series featuring the two characters titled ''[[Superman/Batman|Superman/Batman or Batman/Superman]]''. Following DC Comic's [[The New 52]] line-wide relaunch, Superman established a romantic relationship with Wonder Woman. A comic book series titled ''[[Superman/Wonder Woman]]'' debuted in 2013, which explores their relationship and shared adventures.

The villains Superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, corrupt politicians, and violent husbands, but they soon grew more outlandish  and collectively become Superman's rogues gallery. The mad scientist [[Ultra-Humanite]],  introduced in ''Action Comics'' #13 (June 1939), was Superman's first recurring villain. The hero's best-known nemesis, [[Lex Luthor]], was introduced in ''Action Comics'' #23 (April 1940) and has been envisioned over the years as both a recluse with advanced weaponry to a power-mad billionaire.<ref name="TCS160">{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=160}}</ref> In 1944, the magical imp [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], Superman's first recurring super-powered adversary, was introduced.<ref>Though created to appear in ''Superman'' #30 (Sept. 1944), publishing lag time resulted in the character first appearing in the ''Superman'' daily comic strip that year, per [http://www.comics.org/issue/3811/ ''Superman'' #30] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> Superman's first alien villain, [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], debuted in ''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958).

This point is debated by historians: [[Doctor Occult]], an earlier creation of Siegel and Shuster, appeared in comic books two years before, and in newspaper comics there was [[the Phantom]] and [[Mandrake the Magician]]. But it was Superman that started the 20th century's craze for costumed adventurers.

His adventures and popularity have established the character as an inspiring force within the public eye, with the character serving as inspiration for musicians, comedians and writers alike. Kryptonite, Brainiac and Bizarro have become synonymous in popular vernacular with [[Achilles' heel]], extreme intelligence<ref>Soanes, C. and Stevenson, A. 2004.

Superman became popular very quickly, with an additional title, ''Superman Quarterly'', rapidly added.

By 1940 the amount of merchandise available increased dramatically, with jigsaw puzzles, paper dolls, bubble gum and trading cards available, as well as wooden or metal figures. The popularity of such merchandise increased when Superman was licensed to appear in other media, and Les Daniels has written that this represents "the start of the process that media moguls of later decades would describe as 'synergy.'"<ref name="TCS50">{{harvp|Daniels|1998|p=50}}</ref> By the release of ''[[Superman Returns]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] had arranged a cross promotion with [[Burger King]],<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1534100/20060612/story.jhtml | title =The 'Superman' Fanboy Dilemma, Part 4: Come On Feel The Toyz | accessdate =January 16, 2007 | author=Karl Heitmueller | date =June 13, 2006 | format =Flash | publisher=MTV News | quote =Warner Bros. has "Superman Returns" licensing deals with Mattel, Pepsi, Burger King, Duracell, Samsung, EA Games and Quaker State Motor Oil, to name a few. }}</ref> and licensed many other products for sale.

=== In other media ===
{{Main article|Superman (franchise)}}
The character of Superman has appeared in various media aside from comic books, including radio and television series, [[Superman film series|several films]], and [[video games]]. The first adaptation was [[Superman (comic strip)|a daily newspaper comic strip]], launched on January 16, 1939, and running through May 1966; Siegel and Shuster used the first strips to establish Superman's background, adding details such as the planet Krypton and Superman's father, [[Jor-El]], concepts not yet established in the comic books.<ref name="TCS42"/> A radio show, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', premiered February 12, 1940, and featured the voice of [[Bud Collyer]] as Superman. It ran through 1951. Collyer was also cast as the voice of Superman in [[Paramount Pictures]]' 17 [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|''Superman'' animated cartoons]] produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] and then [[Famous Studios]] for theatrical release in 1941–1943. Early episodes each had a budget of $50,000<ref>{{harvp|Weldon|2013}}: "...the budget for each short &mdash; an astonishing $50,000..."</ref> (${{Inflation|US|50000|1941|r=-2|fmt=c}} when adjusted for inflation), which was exceptional for the time.<ref>Dave Fleischer, quoted in {{harvp|Daniels|2004|p=58}}: "The average short cost nine or ten thousand dollars, some ran up to fifteen; they varied."</ref> The first live-action film was a [[Superman (serial)|15-part serial released in 1948]].

In 1948, the [[movie serial]] ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' made [[Kirk Alyn]] the first actor to portray the hero onscreen. The first feature film, ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', starring [[George Reeves]], was released in 1951, and was intended to promote the first television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', which aired from 1952 to 1958. National had creative control over the show.<ref>{{harvp|Weldon|2013}}: "...the last time the character had enjoyed a similar chance to reach beyond the comics shelves to a mass audience &mdash; during the run of the fifties television show &mdash; the comics had moved in lockstep.  Yet that had been an inevitable result of DC holding creative control over all aspects of the television program..."</ref> Television series featuring Superman and Superboy would also debut in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In 1966 came the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman]]'', remade for television in 1975. Also in 1966, Superman starred in the first of several animated television series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

Superman returned to movie theaters in 1978 with director [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', starring [[Christopher Reeve]], which spawned three sequels and was the most successful Superman feature film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=superman.htm |title=Superman Movies at the Box Office |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Box Office Mojo |publisher= |access-date=2016-07-24 |quote=}} <br/><br/>''Superman'' (1978) made $134,218,018 in North American theaters, which is about ${{Inflation|US|134218018|1978|r=-2|fmt=c}} when adjusted for inflation. By comparison, ''Batman v Superman'' (2016) made only $330,360,194.</ref> DC Comics has had little creative control over these in movies: When Warner Bros. sold the movie rights to Superman to the Salkinds in 1974, it demanded control over the budget and the casting but left everything else to the producers' discretion.<ref>{{harvp|Scivally|2007|p=77}}: "Under the terms of the deal, Warners would have budget and casting approval and the right of first refusal for Superman films made by the Salkinds, but otherwise the financing and production of the films was up to the producers."</ref>

In 2006, [[Bryan Singer]] directed the feature ''[[Superman Returns]]'', starring [[Brandon Routh]]. In 2013, director [[Zack Snyder]] rebooted the film franchise with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', starring [[Henry Cavill]]. Snyder also directed its 2016 sequel, ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', which featured Superman alongside [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] for the first time in a live-action movie. Cavill will reprise his role as Superman in the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''. [[Tyler Hoechlin]] is set to play Superman in the second season of the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' TV series.<ref>(June 16, 2016), "[http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/16/supergirl-tyler-hoechlin-superman Supergirl casts Teen Wolf star as Superman]," [[Entertainment Weekly]].

Superman has also featured as an inspiration for musicians, with songs by numerous artists from several generations celebrating the character. [[Donovan]]'s [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] topping single "[[Sunshine Superman]]" utilized the character in both the title and the lyric, declaring "Superman and [[Green Lantern]] ain't got nothing on me."<ref>[[Donovan]].

Parodies of Superman did not take long to appear, with ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' introduced in "The Mouse of Tomorrow" animated short in 1942.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Turner|title=Deputy Dawg |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |page=21 |date=August 8, 2006}}</ref> While the character swiftly took on a life of its own, moving beyond parody, other animated characters soon took their turn to parody the character.

This short ends with Bugs stepping into a phone booth to change into a real "Superman" and emerging as a [[U.S. Marine]]. In 1956 [[Daffy Duck]] assumes the mantle of "Cluck Trent" in the short "[[Stupor Duck]]", a role later reprised in various issues of the ''Looney Tunes'' comic book.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.comics-db.com/comic-book/1046821-Looney_Tunes_97.html | title = Looney Tunes # 97 | accessdate =January 16, 2007 | publisher=Big Comicbook Database}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref> In the United Kingdom [[Monty Python]] created the character Bicycle Repairman, who fixes bicycles on a world full of Supermen, for a sketch in series of their BBC show.<ref>{{cite news | first=Mel | last=Clarke | title=The Pitch | work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | page=34 | date=August 1, 2004 }}</ref> Also on the BBC was the sitcom ''[[My Hero (UK TV series)|My Hero]]'', which presented Thermoman as a slightly dense Superman pastiche, attempting to save the world and pursue romantic aspirations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sally |last=Kinnes |title=The One To Watch |work=The Sunday Times |page=58 |date=January 30, 2000 }}</ref> In the United States, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' has often parodied the figure, with [[Margot Kidder]] reprising her role as Lois Lane in a 1979 episode.

Superman is also mentioned in several films, including [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which [[Batman]] states, "That's why Superman works alone&nbsp;..." in reference to the many troubles caused by his partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and also in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', in which [[Aunt May]] gives her nephew [[Peter Parker]] a word of advice not to strain himself too much because, "You're not Superman, you know", among many others.

=== Literary analysis ===
Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut. The character's status as the first costumed superhero has allowed him to be used in many studies discussing the genre, [[Umberto Eco]] noting that "he can be seen as the representative of all his similars".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eco |first=Umberto |authorlink=Umberto Eco |editor=Jeet Heer |editor2=Kent Worcester |title=Arguing Comics |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-687-5|page=162 |chapter=The Myth of Superman |origyear=1962 }}</ref> Writing in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1971, Gerald Clarke stated: "Superman's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signalling the beginning of the end for the [[Horatio Alger myth]] of the self-made man." Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance, and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which "only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Gerald |last=Clarke |authorlink=Gerald Clarke (author)|title=The Comics On The Couch |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842864,00.html | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |issn=0040-781X |pages=1–4 |date=December 13, 1971 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}</ref> Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman's partial role in exploring assimilation, the character's alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level.

A.C. Grayling, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of [[Al Capone]], through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell [[war bonds]],<ref name="60Y64">{{harvp|Daniels|1995|p=64}}</ref> and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the [[Cold War]] as being one where "matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions", and discusses events post [[9/11]], stating that as a nation "caught between the terrifying [[George W. Bush]] and the terrorist [[Osama bin Laden]], America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape".<ref>{{cite news|first=A C |last=Grayling |title=The Philosophy of Superman: A Short Course |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/23525/the-philosophy-of-superman.thtml |work=The Spectator |location=UK |issn=0038-6952 |date=July 8, 2006 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011230733/http://spectator.co.uk/archive/features/23525/the-philosophy-of-superman.thtml |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref>

An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the [[Great Depression]]. The left-leaning perspective of creators Shuster and Siegel is reflected in early storylines.{{Attribution needed|date=December 2015}} Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements.<ref name="60Y2223">{{harvp|Daniels|1995|pp=22–23}}</ref> Comics scholar [[Roger Sabin]] sees this as a reflection of "the liberal idealism of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]", with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes.<ref name="mythology">{{cite video | title = The Mythology of Superman | medium = DVD | publisher=Warner Bros.|date = 2006}}</ref><ref name="Sabin">{{cite book | last=Sabin | first=Roger | authorlink=Roger Sabin | year=1996 | title= Comics, Comix & Graphic Novels| edition=4th paperback | publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-3993-0 }}</ref> In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues, tackling a version of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|1946 broadcast]], as well as combating  anti-semitism and veteran discrimination.<ref>{{cite news | first= Richard | last= von Busack | title=Superman Versus the KKK | date= July 2–8, 1998 |work=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|location = San Jose, California | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.02.98/comics-9826.html|accessdate=January 28, 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511114046/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.02.98/comics-9826.html| archivedate=May 11, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Stephen J | last=Dubner |author2=Levitt, Steven D  | page = F26 | title=Hoodwinked? | date= January 8, 2006 |work=The New York Times Magazine | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/magazine/08wwln_freakonomics.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate=January 28, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Superman the Unauthorized Biography|page=83|author=Glen Weldon|year=2013}}</ref>

[[Scott Bukatman]] has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman's ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis. He writes that the character "represented, in 1938, a kind of [[Le Corbusier|Corbusierian]] ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that 'Everything is known to us'."<ref name="MOG">{{cite book | last=Bukatman | first=Scott | authorlink=Scott Bukatman | year=2003 | title=Matters of Gravity: Special Effects and Supermen in the 20th century | publisher=[[Duke University Press]] | isbn=0-8223-3132-2 }}</ref>

[[Jules Feiffer]] has argued that Superman's real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what "made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent." Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfillment,<ref>[[Jules Feiffer]] ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', (2003). [[Fantagraphics]]. ISBN 1-56097-501-6</ref> a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that "If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions&nbsp;... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from" and Shuster supporting that as being "why so many people could relate to it".<ref>Andrae (1983), [https://web.archive.org/web/20031207220852/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=10 p.10].</ref>

[[Ian Gordon (historian)|Ian Gordon]] suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman he notes was very much part of that effort.<ref>[[Ian Gordon (historian)|Ian Gordon]] "Nostalgia, Myth, and Ideology: Visions of Superman at the End of the 'American Century"in Michael Ryan, ' 'Cultural Studies: An Anthology' '(2007). Blackwell ISBN 978-1-4051-4577-0 [http://nus.academia.edu/IanGordon/Papers/509594/Nostalgia_Myth_and_Ideology_Visions_of_Superman_at_the_End_of_the_American_Century].</ref>

Superman's immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal.<ref>Fingeroth, Danny ''Superman on the Couch'' (2004). Continuum International Publishing Group p53. ISBN 0-8264-1539-3</ref><ref name="Engle">Engle, Gary "What Makes Superman So Darned American?" reprinted in ''Popular Culture'' (1992) Popular Press p&nbsp;331–343.

The extraterrestrial origin was seen by Regalado as challenging the notion that [[Anglo-Saxon]] ancestry was the source of all might.<ref>Regalado, Aldo "Modernity, Race, and the American Superhero" in McLaughlin, Jeff (ed.) ''Comics as Philosophy'' (2005). Univ of Mississippi Press p92. ISBN 1-57806-794-4</ref> Gary Engle saw the "myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in [[American culture]]." He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the [[Western (genre)|Western]] as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants cultural heritage for the greater good.<ref name="Engle" /> David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman's early stories portray a threat: "the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country."<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenemann|first=David|title=Adorno in America|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2007|page=180|isbn=0-8166-4809-3}}</ref> David Rooney, a [[critic|theater critic]] for ''The New York Times'', in his evaluation of the play, ''Year Zero'', considers Superman to be the "quintessential immigrant story&nbsp;...

Some see Judaic themes in Superman. [[Simcha Weinstein]] notes that Superman's story has some parallels to that of [[Moses]].  For example, Moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and adopted by a foreign culture. Weinstein also posits that Superman's Kryptonian name, "Kal-El", resembles the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words קל-אל, which can be taken to mean "voice of God".<ref name="UUaOV">{{cite book | last=Weinstein| first=Simcha| authorlink=Simcha Weinstein | year=2006 | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey! | edition=1st | publisher=Leviathan Press | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7 }}</ref> [[Larry Tye]] suggests that this "Voice of God" is an allusion to Moses' role as a prophet.<ref name="Tye, 2012">{{cite book| authorlink= Larry Tye|last=Tye|first=Larry|title=Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero|year=2012|publisher=[[Random House Digital]]|isbn=978-1-4000-6866-1|pages=65–67| quote=Like Moses.

The Nazis also thought Superman was a Jew and in 1940 [[Joseph Goebbels]] publicly denounced Superman and his creator Siegel.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goebbels |first=Paul Joseph |date=25 April 1940 |title=Jerry Siegel Attacks! |page=8 |url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/superman.htm |newspaper=''Das schwarze Korps'' |location= |access-date= }}</ref>

Superman stories have occasionally exhibited Christian themes as well. Screenwriter [[Tom Mankiewicz]] consciously made Superman an allegory for Christ in [[Superman (1978 film)|the 1978 movie]] starring [[Christopher Reeve]]:<ref>{{Cite news| author = Daniel Dickholtz | title = Steel Dreams: Interview with Tom Mankiewicz | work = [[Starlog]] | date = December 16, 1998 | pages = 67–71 | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> baby Kal-El's ship resembles the [[Star of Bethlehem]], and Jor-El's gives his son a messianic mission.
