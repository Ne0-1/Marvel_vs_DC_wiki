The [[Origin of Superman|origin story of Superman]] relates that he was born '''Kal-El''' on the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], before being rocketed to [[Earth]] as an infant by his scientist father [[Jor-El]], moments before Krypton's destruction. Discovered and adopted by a [[Kansas]] farmer and his wife, the child is raised as '''[[Clark Kent]]''' and imbued with a strong moral compass. Very early he started to display [[superhuman]] abilities, which upon reaching maturity he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity. 

While referred to less than flatteringly as "the big blue Boy Scout" by some of his fellow superheroes,<ref>{{cite news | first=Charlie | last=McCollum | pages= | title=Times change, but Superman endures as an American cultural icon | date=June 2006 | publisher=The Mercury News | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmtmn/is_200606/ai_n16560106| format=Registration required | accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref> Superman is hailed as "'''The Man of Steel'''", "'''The Man of Tomorrow'''", and "'''The Last Son of Krypton'''" by the general public within the comics. As Clark Kent, Superman lives among humans as a "mild-mannered [[Journalist|reporter]]" for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper ''[[Daily Planet]]'' (''Daily Star'' in the earliest stories)<!--Leave in this order-->. There he works alongside reporter [[Lois Lane]], with whom he is romantically linked. This relationship has been consummated by marriage on numerous occasions across various media, and this union is now firmly established within the mainstream comics [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

The character's supporting cast, powers, and trappings have slowly expanded throughout the years. Superman's backstory was altered to allow for adventures as [[Superboy]], and other survivors of Krypton were created, including [[Supergirl]] and [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]]. In addition, Superman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, perhaps most notably portrayed by [[Christopher Reeve]] in [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'' in 1978, which garnered critical praise and became [[Warner Bros]]' most successful feature film of its time. The motion picture ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was released in 2006, with a performance at the international box office which exceeded expectations,<ref name="411BryanSinger">{{cite web |author=Epstein, Daniel Robert | url = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=78755 | title = 4:11 with Bryan Singer |accessdate=2007-01-30 |publisher = Newsarama|date=July 30, 2006}}</ref> however, the overall box office performance was considered to have fallen short by Warner Bros, and Superman is planned to receive a newly-rebooted film franchise in the near future. In the seven decades since Superman's debut, the character has been revamped and updated several times.

A significant overhaul occurred in 1986, when [[John Byrne]] revamped and [[retconned]] the character, reducing Superman's powers and erasing several characters from the canon, in a move that attracted media attention. Press coverage was again garnered in the 1990s with ''[[The Death of Superman]]'', a storyline which saw the character killed and later restored to life. 

Superman has fascinated scholars, with [[Cultural studies|cultural theorists]], commentators, and [[critic]]s alike exploring the character's impact and role in the United States and the rest of the world. [[Umberto Eco]] discussed the mythic qualities of the character in the early 1960s, and [[Larry Niven]] has pondered the implications of a sexual relationship the character might enjoy with Lois Lane.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.larryniven.org/stories/Man_of_Steel_Woman_of_Kleenex.shtml | title =Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex | accessdate =2007-01-30| last =Niven | first =Larry | authorlink =Larry Niven | year =1971 | work =All the Myriad Ways | publisher =Larry Niven }}</ref> The character's [[ownership]] has often been the subject of dispute, with Siegel and Shuster twice suing for the return of legal ownership. The [[copyright]] is again currently in dispute, with changes in copyright law allowing Siegel's wife and daughter to claim a share of the copyright, a move DC parent company [[Warner Bros.]] disputes.

==Publication history==
===Creation and conception===
[[Image:Reign of the Superman.jpg|thumb|250px|"[[The Reign of the Super-Man]]" in the [[fanzine]] ''Science Fiction'' vol. 1, #3 (June 1933).]]
[[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] first created a bald [[Telepathy|telepathic]] villain bent on dominating the entire world. He appeared in the short story "[[The Reign of the Super-Man]]" from ''Science Fiction'' #3, a [[science fiction]] [[fanzine]] that Siegel published in 1933.<ref name="TCS13">Daniels (1998), p. 13.</ref> Siegel re-wrote the character in 1933 as a hero, bearing little or no resemblance to his villainous namesake, and began a six-year quest to find a publisher. Titling it ''The Superman'', Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing, who had published a 48-page black-and-white comic book entitled ''[[Dan Dunn|Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48]]''. Although the duo received an encouraging letter, Consolidated never again published comic books. Shuster took this to heart and burned all pages of the story, the cover surviving only because Siegel rescued it from the fire. Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to [[Slam Bradley]], an adventurer the pair had created for ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #1 (May 1939).<ref name="TCS17">Daniels (1998), p. 17.</ref>

Siegel contacted other artists to collaborate on the strip, according to Gerard Jones feeling that "Superman was going nowhere with Joe".<ref name="GJMT">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gerard|title=Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book|publisher=Basic Books|year=2004|pages=115|isbn=0465036562}}</ref>  [[Tony Strobl]], [[Mel Graff]] and [[Russell Keaton]] were all contacted as potential collaborators by Siegel.<ref name="GJMT" /> Artwork produced by Keaton based on Siegel's treatment shows the concept evolving. Superman is now sent back in time as a baby by the last man on Earth, where he is found and raised by Sam and Molly Kent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080820-SupermanKeaton.html|title=Superman's Hidden History: The Other "First" Artist|last=Trexler|first=Jeff|coauthors=Paul August|date=August 20, 2008|work=Newsarama|publisher=Imaginova Corp.|accessdate=2008-08-26}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5aMw18S0O Archived] August 26, 2008.</ref> However Keaton did not pursue the collaboration, and soon Siegel and Shuster were back working together on the character again.<ref name="GJMT" />

The pair re-envisioned the character, who became more of a [[hero]] in the mythic tradition, inspired by such characters as [[Samson]] and [[Hercules]],<ref name="TMOS">Petrou, David Michael (1978). ''The Making of Superman the Movie'', New York: [[Warner Books]] ISBN 0-446-82565-4</ref> who would right the wrongs of Siegel and Shuster's times, fighting for [[social justice]] and against [[tyranny]]. It was at this stage the costume was introduced, Siegel later recalling that they created a "kind of costume and let's give him a big ''S'' on his chest, and a cape, make him as colorful as we can and as distinctive as we can."<ref name="TCS18">Daniels (1998), p. 18.</ref> The design was based in part on the costumes worn by characters in outer space settings published in pulp magazines, as well as comic strips such as ''[[Flash Gordon]]'',<ref name="TCS19">Daniels (1998), p. 19.</ref> and also partly suggested by the traditional circus strong-man outfit.<ref name="TCS18"/><ref name ="MorrisonHerald">{{cite news | first= Grant | last= Morrison | authorlink=Grant Morrison | title=Seriously, Perilously | date= September 29, 1998 | publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |page=14}}</ref> However, the cape has been noted as being markedly different from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] tradition. Gary Engle described it as without "precedent in popular culture" in ''Superman at Fifty: The Persistence of a Legend''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Engle |first=Gary |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Dennis Dooley and Gary Engle (eds.)|title=Superman at Fifty: The Persistence of a Legend |year=1987|publisher=Octavia |location=Cleveland, OH |isbn=0020429010|chapter="What Makes Superman So Darned American?" }}</ref> The pants-over-tights outfit was soon established as the basis for many future superhero outfits. This third version of the character was given extraordinary abilities, although this time of a physical nature as opposed to the mental abilities of the villainous Superman.<ref name="TCS18"/>

The locale and the hero's civilian names were inspired by the movies, Shuster said in 1983. "Jerry created all the names. We were great movie fans, and were inspired a lot by the actors and actresses we saw. As for Clark Kent, he combined the names of [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]]. And [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the city in which Superman operated, came from the [[Fritz Lang]] movie <nowiki>[</nowiki>''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927], which we both loved".<ref name="AND8">Andrae, ''Nemo'' (online version): "Superman Through the Ages: The Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster Interview, Part 8 of 10" (1983).</ref>

Although they were by now selling material to comic book publishers, notably [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]]'s [[National Publications|National Allied Publishing]], the pair decided to feature this character in a comic strip format, rather than in the longer comic book story format that was establishing itself at this time. They offered it to both [[Max Gaines]], who passed, and to [[United Feature Syndicate]], who expressed interest initially but finally rejected the strip in a letter dated February 18, 1937. However, in what historian Les Daniels describes as "an incredibly convoluted turn of events", Max Gaines ended up positioning the strip as the lead feature in Wheeler-Nicholson's new publication, ''[[Action Comics]]''. [[Vin Sullivan]], editor of the new book, wrote to the pair requesting that the comic strips be refashioned to suit the comic book format, requesting "eight panels a page". However Siegel and Shuster ignored this, utilizing their own experience and ideas to create [[Comics vocabulary|page layouts]], with Siegel also identifying the image used for the cover of ''Action Comics'' #1 ([[1938 in comics|June 1938]]), Superman's [[first appearance]].<!--whole paragraph sourced from same source--><ref name="TCS2531">Daniels (1998), pp. 25–31.</ref>

Siegel may have been inspired to create the ''Superman'' character due to the death of his father. Mitchell Siegel was an immigrant who owned a clothing store on New York's Lower East Side. He died during a robbery attempt in 1932, a year before Superman was created. Although Siegel never mentioned the death of his father in interviews, both [[Gerard Jones]] and [[Brad Meltzer]] believe it must have affected him. "It had to have an effect," says Jones. "There's a connection there: the loss of a dad as a source for Superman."  Meltzer states: "Your father dies in a robbery, and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the world's greatest hero. I'm sorry, but there's a story there."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-08-25-superman-creators_N.htm?se=yahoorefer |title=The crime that created Superman: Did fatal robbery spawn Man of Steel? |accessdate=2008-08-26 |author=David Colton |date=2008-08-25 |work=USAToday.com |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5aMwEGibC |archivedate=2008-08-26 }}</ref>

===Publication===
{{see also|List of Superman comics}}
[[Image:Action1.JPG|thumb|left|Superman made his debut in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 (June 1938). Cover art by [[Joe Shuster]].]]
Superman's first appearance was in ''Action Comics'' #1, in 1938. In 1939, a [[Superman (comic book)|self-titled series]] was launched. The first issue mainly reprinted adventures published in ''Action Comics'', but despite this the book achieved greater sales.<ref name="TCS44">Daniels (1998), p. 44.</ref> 1939 also saw the publication of ''New York World's Fair Comics'', which by summer of 1942 became ''[[World's Finest Comics]]''. With issue #7 of ''All Star Comics'', Superman made the first of a number of infrequent appearances, on this occasion appearing in cameo to establish his honorary membership of the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]] | artist = [[Everett E. Hibbard|Hibbard, Everett E.]] | Story = $1,000,000 for War Orphans | Title = All Star Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 7 | Date = October-November 1941 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] }}</ref>

Initially [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] would provide the story and art for all the strips published. However, Shuster's eyesight began to deteriorate, and the increasing appearances of the character saw an increase in the workload. This led Shuster to establish a [[studio]] to assist in the production of the art,<ref name="TCS44"/> although he insisted on drawing the face of every Superman the studio produced. Outside the studio, [[Jack Burnley]] began supplying covers and stories in 1940,<ref name="TCS47">Daniels (1998), p. 13</ref> and in 1941, artist [[Fred Ray]] began contributing a stream of Superman covers, some of which, such as that of ''Superman'' #14 (Feb. 1942), became iconic and much-reproduced. [[Wayne Boring]], initially employed in Shuster's studio, began working for [[DC Comics]] in his own right in 1942 providing pages for both ''Superman'' and ''Action Comics''.<ref name="TCS69">Daniels (1998), p. 69.</ref> [[Al Plastino]] was hired initially to copy Wayne Boring but was eventually allowed to create his own style and became one of the most prolific Superman artists during the Gold and Silver Ages of comics.<ref>Eury (2006), p. 38.</ref> 

The scripting duties also became shared. In late 1939 a new [[editorial]] team assumed control of the character's adventures. [[Whitney Ellsworth]], [[Mort Weisinger]] and [[Jack Schiff]] were brought in following Vin Sullivan's departure. This new editorial team brought in [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Manly Wade Wellman]], and [[Alfred Bester]], established writers of science fiction.<ref name="60Y28">Daniels (1995), p. 28.</ref>

By 1943, Jerry Siegel was drafted into the army in a special celebration, and his duties there saw high contributions drop. [[Don Cameron]] and [[Alvin Schwartz]] joined the writing team, Schwartz teaming up with Wayne Boring to work on the [[Superman (comic strip)|Superman comic strip]] which had been launched by Siegel and Shuster in 1939.<ref name="TCS69"/>

In 1945, [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] made his debut in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101. The character moved to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' in 1946, and his own title, ''[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]'', launched in 1949. The 1950s saw the launching of ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' (1954) and ''[[Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane]]'' (1958). By 1974 these titles had merged into ''[[Superman Family]]'', although the series was cancelled in 1982. ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' was a series published from 1978 to 1986 featuring team-ups between Superman and a wide variety of other characters of the [[DC Universe]].

In 1986, a decision was taken to restructure the [[Fictional universe|universe]] the Superman character inhabited with other DC characters. This saw the publication of "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow]]", a two part story written by [[Alan Moore]], with art by [[Curt Swan]], [[George Pérez]] and [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]] | Penciller = [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]] | Inker=[[George Pérez|Pérez, George]] & [[Kurt Schaffenberger|Schaffenberger, Kurt]] | Title = [[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]] | year = 1997 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] |ID=ISBN 1-56389-315-0}}</ref> The story was published in ''Superman'' #423 and ''Action Comics'' #583, and presented what Les Daniels notes as "the sense of loss the fans might have experienced if this had really been the last Superman tale."<ref name="TCS150">Daniels (1998), p. 150.</ref>

[[Image:Mansteel1.png|thumb|Superman's origin is reimagined in ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' #1 (July 1986), written and drawn by [[John Byrne]].]]
Superman was relaunched by writer & artist [[John Byrne]], initially in the [[limited series]] ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' (1986). 1986 also saw the cancellation of ''World's Finest Comics'', and the ''Superman'' title renamed ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]''. A second volume of ''Superman'' was launched in 1987, running until cancellation in 2006. This cancellation saw ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' revert to the ''Superman'' title. ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' was launched in 1991, running until 2003, whilst the quarterly book ''[[Superman: The Man of Tomorrow]]'' ran from 1995 to 1999. In 2003 ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' launched, as well as the ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' limited series, with ''[[All Star Superman]]'' launched in 2005 and ''[[Superman Confidential]]'' in 2006 (this title was cancelled in 2008).

Current ongoing publications that feature Superman on a regular basis are ''Superman'', ''Action Comics'', ''All-Star Superman'', ''Superman/Batman'', ''[[Justice League#Justice League of America (vol. 2)|Justice League of America]]'', ''[[Justice League Adventures|Justice League Unlimited]]'' and ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|The Legion of Super-Heroes In The 31st Century]]''. The character often appears as a guest star in other series and is usually a pivotal figure in DC Comics [[Fictional crossover|crossover events]].

===Influences===

An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the [[Great Depression]]. The left-leaning perspective of creators Shuster and Siegel is reflected in early storylines. Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements.<ref name="60Y2223">Daniels (1995), pp. 22–23.</ref> This is seen by comics scholar [[Roger Sabin]] as a reflection of "the liberal idealism of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]", with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes.<ref name="Sabin"/> In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues, tackling a version of the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] in a [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|1946 broadcast]].<ref>{{cite news | first= Richard | last= von Busack | title=Superman Versus the KKK | date= July 2 – July 8, 1998 | publisher=[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metro]] | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.02.98/comics-9826.html|accessdate=2007-01-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Stephen J | last=Dubner | coauthors=Levitt, Steven D | page = F26 | title=Hoodwinked? | date= January 8, 2006 | publisher=The New York Times | url= http://www.freakonomics.com/times0108col.php | accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref> Siegel and Shuster's staus as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work. Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued that they crafted "an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American", something which Pevey feels taps into an important aspect of American identity.<ref name="Pevey">Pevey, Timothy Aaron "{{pdf|[http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04172007-133407/unrestricted/Pevey_Aaron_200705_MA.pdf "From Superman to Superbland: The Man of Steel's Popular Decline Among Postmodern Youth"]|3.14 Mb}}. 2007-04-10 URN: etd-04172007-133407</ref>

Siegel himself noted that the many mythic heroes which exist in the traditions of many cultures bore an influence on the character, including [[Hercules]] and [[Samson]].<ref name="TCS18"/> The character has also been seen by [[Scott Bukatman]] to be "a worthy successor to [[Charles Lindberg|Lindberg]] ... (and) also ... like [[Babe Ruth]]", and is also representative of the United States dedication to "progress and the 'new'" through his "invulnerable body ... on which history cannot be inscribed."<ref name="MOG">{{cite book | last=Bukatman | first=Scott | authorlink=Scott Bukatman | year=2003 | title=Matters of Gravity: Special Effects and Supermen in the 20th century | publisher=Duke University Press | isbn=0822331322 }}</ref> Further, given that Siegel and Shuster were noted fans of pulp science fiction,<ref name="TCS13"/> it has been suggested that another influence may have been [[Hugo Danner]]. Danner was the main character of the 1930 novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'' by [[Philip Wylie]], and is possessed of same powers of the early Superman.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Feeley | first =Gregory | year =2005 | month =March | title =When World-views Collide: Philip Wylie in the Twenty-first Century | journal =Science Fiction Studies | volume =32 | issue =95 | id ={{ISSN|0091-7729}} | url =http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/feeley95.htm | accessdate =2006-12-06 }}</ref>

Because Siegel and Shuster were both [[Jewish]], some religious commentators and pop-culture scholars such as Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist [[Howard Jacobson]] suggest that Superman's creation was partly influenced by [[Moses]],<ref name="TIMES05"/><ref name="mythology">{{cite video | title = The Mythology of Superman | medium = DVD | publisher = Warner Bros.| year = 2006}}</ref> and other Jewish elements.

Whilst the term Superman was initially coined by Nietzsche, it is unclear how influential Nietzsche and his ideals were to Siegel and Shuster.<ref name="mythology" /> Les Daniels has speculated that "Siegel picked up the term from other science fiction writers who had casually employed it", further noting that "his concept is remembered by hundreds of millions who may barely know who Nietzsche is."<ref name="TCS18"/> Others argue that Siegel and Shuster "could not have been unaware of an idea that would dominate Hitler's National Socialism.

Siegel and Shuster have themselves discussed a number of influences that impacted upon the character. Both were avid readers, and their mutual love of [[science fiction]] helped to drive their friendship. Siegel cited [[John Carter (character)|John Carter]] stories as an influence: "Carter was able to leap great distances because the planet Mars was smaller that the planet Earth; and he had great strength. I visualized the planet Krypton as a huge planet, much larger than Earth".<ref name="AND8" /> The pair were also avid collectors of comic strips in their youth, cutting them from the newspaper, with [[Winsor McKay]]'s ''[[Little Nemo]]'' firing their imagination with its sense of fantasy.<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031207221050/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=2 p.2].</ref> Shuster has remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style, whilst also noting a larger influence: "[[Alex Raymond]] and [[Burne Hogarth]] were my idols — also [[Milt Caniff]], [[Hal Foster]], and [[Roy Crane]]. But the movies were the greatest influence on our imagination: especially the films of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] Senior."<ref name="AND4">Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031208131136/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=4 p.4].</ref> Fairbanks' role as ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' was certainly an inspiration, as Shuster admitted to basing Superman's stance upon scenes from the movie.<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031208132241/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=7 p.7].</ref> The movies also influenced the storytelling and page layouts,<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031208131627/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=5 p.5].</ref> whilst the city of Metropolis was named in honor of the [[Fritz Lang]] motion picture of the [[Metropolis (film)|same title]].<ref name="AND8"/>

===Copyright issues===
As part of the deal which saw Superman published in ''Action Comics'', Siegel and Shuster sold the [[Exclusive right|rights]] to the company in return for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material.<ref>{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Hurwitt | page=PK-24 | title= Comic Book Artist Populates Movies | date= January 16, 2005 | publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2005/01/16/PKGT6AJH9A1.DTL&type=movies |accessdate = 2006-12-08}}</ref><ref name="Heidi">MacDonald, Heidi.

The pair also sued National in the same year over the rights to [[Superboy]], which they claimed was a separate creation that National had published without authorization. National immediately fired them and took their byline off the stories, prompting a legal battle that ended in 1948, when a New York court ruled that the 1938 contract should be upheld. However, a ruling from Justice J. Addison Young awarded them the rights to Superboy. A month after the Superboy judgment the two sides agreed on a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. National paid Siegel and Shuster $94,000 for the rights to [[Superboy]]. The pair also acknowledged in writing the company's ownership of Superman, attesting that they held rights for "all other forms of reproduction and presentation, whether now in existence or that may hereafter be created",<ref name="TCJ26313">Dean (2004), p. 13.</ref> but DC refused to re-hire them.<ref name="TCS73">Daniels (1998), p. 73.</ref>
[[Image:The Siegels.jpg|thumb|200px|Jerry Siegel, with wife Joanne and daughter Laura in 1976. Joanne and Laura Siegel filed a termination notice on Jerry Siegel's share of the copyright of Superman in 1999.]]
In 1973 Siegel and Shuster again launched a [[suit]] claiming ownership of Superman, this time basing the claim on the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] which saw copyright granted for 28 years but allowed for a renewal of an extra 28 years. Their argument was that they had granted DC the copyright for only 28 years. The pair again lost this battle, both in a [[district court]] ruling of October 18, 1973 and an [[appeal court]] ruling of December 5, 1974.<ref name="TCJ2631415">Dean (2004), pp. 14–15.</ref>

In 1975 after news reports of their pauper-like existences, [[Warner Communications]] gave Siegel and Shuster lifetime [[pensions]] of $20,000 per year and [[Health care in the United States|health care benefits]]. Jay Emmett, then [[Vice president|executive vice president]] of Warner, was quoted in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as stating "There is no legal obligation, but I sure feel there is a moral obligation on our part."<ref name="TCJ26316">Dean (2004), p. 16.</ref> In addition, any media production which includes the Superman character were to include the credit "Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster".<ref name="Heidi"/>

The year after this settlement, 1976, saw the copyright term extended again, this time for another 19 years to a total of 75 years. However, this time a clause was inserted into the extension to allow a creator to reclaim their work, reflecting the arguments Siegel and Shuster had made in 1973. The [[Copyright Act of 1976|new act]] came into power in 1978 and allowed a reclamation window in a period based on the previous copyright term of 56 years. This meant the copyright on Superman could be reclaimed between 1994 to 1999, based on the initial publication date of 1938. Jerry Siegel having died in January 1996, his wife and daughter filed a copyright termination notice in 1999. Although Joe Shuster died in July 1992, no termination was filed at this time by his [[Estate (law)|estate]].<ref name="TCJ26317">Dean (2004), p. 17.</ref>

1998 saw copyright extended again, with the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]. This time the copyright term was extended to 95 years, with a further window for reclamation introduced. In January 2004 Mark Peary, nephew and legal [[heir]] to Joe Shuster's estate, filed notice of his intent to reclaim Shuster's half of the copyright, the termination effective in 2013.<ref name="TCJ26317"/> The status of Siegel's share of the copyright is now the subject of a legal battle. Warner Bros. and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve the issues raised by the termination notice, but these discussions were set aside by the Siegels and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. counter sued, alleging the termination notice contains defects amongst other arguments.<ref name="TWOS">{{cite web| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070506063326/http://www.insidecounsel.com/issues/insidecounsel/15_159/profiles/191-1.html | title =The Woman Of Steel | accessdate =2007-01-26 | last =Vosper | first =Robert| year =2005 | month =February | publisher = Inside Counsel | quote =DC isn't going to hand over its most valued asset without putting up one hell of a legal battle }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.newsarama.com/DC/Superman/Intro.htm | title =Inside The Siegel/DC Battle For Superman | accessdate =2007-01-26 | last =Brady | first =Matt | date = March 3, 2005 | publisher =[[Newsarama]] | quote = While the complaint, response and counterclaim has been filed, no one even remotely expects a slam-dunk win for either side.

{{main|History of Superman}}
{{see also|Superman (Earth-Two)}}

Superman, given the serial nature of comic publishing and the length of the character's existence, has evolved as a character as his adventures have increased.<ref name="TIME14388">{{cite news | first= Otto | last=Friedrich | page =9 | title=Up, Up and Awaaay!!! | date= March 14, 1988 | publisher=''[[Time Magazine]]'' | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966978-9,00.html | accessdate =2007-01-28 }}</ref> The details of Superman's origin, relationships and abilities changed significantly during the course of the character's publication, from what is considered the [[Golden Age of comic books]] through the [[Modern Age of comic books|Modern Age]]. The powers and villains were developed through the 1940s, with Superman developing the ability to fly, and costumed villains introduced from 1941.<ref name="TCS67">Daniels (1998), p. 67.</ref> The character was shown as learning of the existence of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] in 1949.

The 1960s saw the introduction of a second Superman, [[Kal-L]]. [[DC Comics|DC]] had established a [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] within the fictional universe its characters shared. This allowed characters published in the 1940s to exist alongside updated counterparts published in the 1960s. This was explained to the reader through the notion that the two groups of characters inhabited [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel Earths]]. The [[Kal-L|second Superman]] was introduced to explain to the reader Superman's membership of both the 1940s superhero team the [[Justice Society of America]] and the 1960s superhero team the [[Justice League of America]].<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]] | Penciller = [[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]] | Inker = [[Sid Greene|Greene, Sid]] | Story = Star Light, Star Bright — Death Star I See Tonight! | Title = Justice League of America | Volume = 1 | Issue = 73 | Date = August, 1969 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref>

The 1980s saw radical revisions of the character. DC Comics decided to remove the multiverse in a bid to simplify its comics line. This led to the rewriting of the [[back story]] of the characters DC published, Superman included. [[John Byrne]] rewrote Superman, removing many established conventions and characters from continuity, including [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Byrne also re-established Superman's adoptive parents, [[Ma and Pa Kent|The Kents]], as characters.<ref>[[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] (w)(p), [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]] (i).

===Personality===
In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. The character was seen stepping in to stop [[domestic violence|wife beaters]], profiteers, a [[lynch mob]] and gangsters, with rather rough edges and a looser moral code than audiences may be used to today.<ref name="60Y2223"/> Later writers have softened the character, and instilled a sense of idealism and moral code of conduct. Although not as cold-blooded as the early [[Batman]], the Superman featured in the comics of the 1930s is unconcerned about the harm his strength may cause, tossing villainous characters in such a manner that fatalities would presumably occur, although these were seldom shown explicitly on the page. This came to an end late in 1940, when new editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing.<ref name="TCS42"/>

Today, Superman adheres to a strict moral code, often attributed to the [[Midwestern United States#Culture|Midwestern values]] with which he was raised. His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many other heroes but has stirred resentment among others, who refer to him as the "big blue [[boy scout]]." Superman can be rather rigid in this trait, causing tensions in super hero community, notably with [[Wonder Woman]] (one of his closest friends) after she killed [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Greg Rucka|Rucka, Greg]] | Penciller = [[David Lopez|Lopez, David]] | Title = [[Wonder Woman]] | Volume =2 | Story = Affirmative Defense | Issue = 220 | Date = October 2005 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref>

Having lost his homeworld of Krypton, Superman is very protective of Earth, and especially of Clark Kent’s family and friends. This same loss, combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite his many friends, his wife and his parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians, [[Power Girl]]<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | Penciller = [[Amanda Conner|Conner, Amanda]] | Inker = [[Jimmy Palmiotti|Palmiotti, Jimmy]] | Title = JSA: Classified | Volume =1 | Story = Power Trip | Issue = 1 | Date = September 2005 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref> (who is, in fact from the Krypton of the [[Earth-Two]] universe) and [[Mon-El]],<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] [[Richard Donner|Donner, Richard]] | Penciller = [[Eric Wight|Wight, Eric]] | Inker = [[Eric Wight|Wight, Eric]] | Title = Action Comics Annual | Volume =1 | Story = Who is Clark Kent's Big Brother? | Issue = 10 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref> have led to disappointment. The arrival of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], who has been confirmed to be not only from Krypton, but also is his cousin, has relieved this loneliness somewhat.<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Kurt Busiek|Buskiek, Kurt]], [[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]], [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | Penciller = [[Renato Guedes|Guedes, Renato]] | Inker = [[Jose Wilson Magalhaes|Magalhaes, Jose Wilson]] | Title = Action Comics | Volume =1 | Story = Superman: Family | Issue = 850 | Date = July 2007 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref>

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 (December 2003), [[Batman]] observes, "It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then...he shoots fire from the skies, and it is difficult not to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to ''him''."<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | Penciller = [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | Inker = [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] | Title = [[Superman/Batman]] | Volume =1 | Story = Running Wild | Issue = 3 | Date = December 2003 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref> Later, as ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' began, Batman admonished him for identifying with humanity too much and failing to provide the strong leadership that superhumans need.<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | Penciller = [[Phil Jimenez|Jimenez, Phil]] | Inker = [[Andy Lanning|Lanning, Andy]] | Title = [[Infinite Crisis]] | Volume =1 | Story = Infinite Crisis | Issue = 1 | Date = December 2005 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref>

===Alternative versions===
{{main|Alternate versions of Superman}}
Both the multiverse established by the publishers in the 1960s and the [[Elseworlds]] line of comics established in 1989 have allowed writers to introduce variations on Superman. These have included differences in the nationality, race and morality of the character. Alongside such re-imaginings, a number of characters have assumed the title of Superman, especially in the wake of "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline, where four newly introduced characters are seen to claim the mantle.<ref>Jurgens ''[[et al]]''. ''The Return of Superman'' (1993).</ref>  In addition to these, the [[Bizarro]] character created in 1958 is a weird, imperfect duplicate of Superman.<ref>Dooley, Dennis and Engle, Gary D. ''Superman at Fifty!'' (1988)</ref> Other members of Superman's family of characters have borne the ''Super-'' prefix, including [[Supergirl]], [[Krypto|Superdog]] and [[Superwoman]].  Outside comics published by DC Comics, the notoriety of the Superman or "[[Übermensch]]" [[archetype]] makes the character a popular figure to be represented through an analogue in entirely unrelated continuities.

==Powers and abilities==
{{main|Powers and abilities of Superman}}
As an influential archetype of the superhero genre, Superman possesses extraordinary powers, with the character traditionally described as "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound", a phrase coined by [[Jay Morton]] and first used in the ''Superman'' radio serials and [[Max Fleischer]] animated shorts of the 1940s<ref>{{cite news | title= Obituaries of note | date= September 25, 2003 | work= [[St. Petersburg Times]] | url= http://www.sptimes.com/2003/09/25/Worldandnation/Obituaries_of_note.shtml | publisher=[[Wire services]] | accessdate = 2006-12-08}}</ref> as well as the TV series of the 1950s. For most of his existence, Superman's famous arsenal of powers has included [[flight]], [[Superhuman strength|super-strength]], invulnerability to non-magical attacks, [[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman speed|super-speed]], vision powers (including [[X-ray vision|x-ray]], [[Heat vision|heat]]-emitting, telescopic, infra-red, and microscopic vision), super-hearing, and super-breath, which enables him to blow out air at freezing temperatures, as well as exert the propulsive force of high-speed winds.<ref name="60Y80">Daniels (1995), p. 80.</ref>

As originally conceived and presented in his early stories, Superman's powers were relatively limited, consisting of superhuman strength that allowed him to lift a car over his head, run at amazing speeds and leap one-eighth of a mile, as well as incredibly tough skin that could be pierced by nothing less than an exploding artillery shell.<ref name="60Y80"/> Siegel and Shuster compared his strength and leaping abilities to an [[ant]] and a [[grasshopper]].<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] | Artist =[[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]] | Story = A Scientific Explanation of Superman's Amazing Strength--! | Title = Superman | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = Summer 1939 | Publisher = [[National Periodical Publications]] }}</ref> When making the cartoons, the [[Fleischer Brothers]] found it difficult to keep animating him leaping and requested to DC to change his ability to flying.<ref>[[Leslie Cabarga|Cabarga, Leslie]], [[Jerry Beck|Beck, Jerry]], [[Richard Fleischer|Fleischer, Richard]] (Interviewees). (2006). "First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series" (supplementary DVD documentary). ''[[Superman II]]'' (Two-Disc Special Edition) [DVD]. [[Warner Bros.]].</ref> Writers gradually increased his powers to larger extents during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], in which Superman could fly to other worlds and galaxies and even across universes with relative ease.<ref name="60Y80"/> He would often fly across the solar system to stop meteors from hitting the Earth, or sometimes just to clear his head. Writers found it increasingly difficult to write Superman stories in which the character was believably challenged,<ref name="TCS133">Daniels (1998), p. 133.</ref> so [[DC Comics]] made a series of attempts to rein the character in. The most significant attempt, [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 rewrite, established several hard limits on his abilities: He barely survives a nuclear blast, and his space flights are limited by how long he can hold his breath.<ref name="AH96">{{cite journal | last =Sanderson | first =Peter | year =1986 | month =June | title = The End of History | journal =Amazing Heroes | issue =96 | id ={{ISSN|0745-6506}} }}</ref> Superman's power levels have again increased since then, with Superman currently possessing enough strength to hurl mountains, withstand nuclear blasts with ease, fly into the sun unharmed, and survive in the [[Outer space#The "vacuum of space"|vacuum of outer space]] without oxygen.

The source of Superman's powers has changed subtly over the course of his history. It was originally stated that Superman's abilities derived from his Kryptonian heritage, which made him eons more evolved than [[humans]].<ref name="TCS42"/> This was soon amended, with the source for the powers now based upon the establishment of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton's]] [[gravity]] as having been stronger than that of the [[Earth]]. This situation mirrors that of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]]. As Superman's powers increased, the implication that all Kryptonians had possessed the same abilities became problematic for writers, making it doubtful that a race of such beings could have been wiped out by something as trifling as an exploding planet. In part to counter this, the Superman writers established that Kryptonians, whose native star [[Rao (comics)|Rao]] had been red, only possessed superpowers under the light of a yellow [[sun]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13556951/ | title =Sex and the Superman | accessdate =2007-01-26 | last =Lundegaard | first =Erik | date = July 3, 2006 | publisher =[[MSNBC]] | quote =Even his origin kept changing. Initially Krypton was populated by a race of supermen whose physical structure was millions of years more advanced than our own. Eventually the red sun/yellow sun dynamic was introduced, where Superman's level of power is dependent upon the amount of yellow solar radiation his cells have absorbed. }}</ref> More recent stories have attempted to find a balance between the two explanations.

Superman is most vulnerable to green [[Kryptonite]], mineral debris from [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet. Exposure to green Kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and immobilizes him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. The only mineral on Earth that can protect him from Kryptonite is lead, which blocks the radiation. Lead is also the only known substance that Superman cannot see through with his x-ray vision. Kryptonite was first introduced to the public in 1943 as a [[plot device]] to allow the radio serial voice actor, [[Bud Collyer]], to take some time off.<ref name="TIME14388"/> Although green Kryptonite is the most commonly seen form writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with its own effect.<ref name="TCS106107">Daniels (1998), pp. 106–107.</ref>

==Supporting cast==
{{main|Superman character and cast}}

[[Clark Kent]], Superman's [[secret identity]], was based partly on [[Harold Lloyd]] and named after [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]].<ref>{{cite news | first=John | last=Gross | title=Books of the Times | date=December 15, 1987 | publisher=[[New York Times]] | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1F38F936A25751C1A961948260 |accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref> Creators have discussed the idea of whether Superman pretends to be Clark Kent or vice versa, and at differing times in the publication either approach has been adopted.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.newsarama.com/TwoMorrows/BackIssue/20/BackIssue20.html | title = From Back Issue 20: Pro 2 Pro: A Clark Kent Roundtable | accessdate =2007-01-31 | last =Zeno | first =Eddy | authorlink =Eddy Zeno | date =December 25, 2006 | format =excerpted from <!-- NOTE TO AWB USERS: PLEASE DO NOT ADD AN END OF TEMPLATE HERE, THE TEMPLATE CONTINUES, THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF ONE TEMPLATE ENCODED INSIDE ANOTHER.

Superman's large cast of supporting characters includes [[Lois Lane]], perhaps the character most commonly associated with Superman, being portrayed at different times as his colleague, competitor, love interest and/or wife. Other main supporting characters include ''[[Daily Planet]]'' coworkers such as photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]] and editor [[Perry White]], [[Clark Kent]]'s adopted parents [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]], childhood sweetheart [[Lana Lang]] and best friend [[Pete Ross]], and former college love interest [[Lori Lemaris]] (a [[mermaid]]). Stories making reference to the possibility of Superman siring children have been featured both in and out of mainstream continuity.

Incarnations of [[Supergirl]], [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]], and [[Superboy]] have also been major characters in the mythos, as well as the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (of which Superman is usually a member). A feature shared by several supporting characters is [[alliteration|alliterative]] names, especially with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lois Lane]], [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Linda Lee]], [[Lana Lang]], [[Lori Lemaris]] and [[Lucy Lane]],<ref>{{ Comic book reference | story=Superman's LL's [Text page] | title=[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] | issue=204 | date=February, 1968 | | publisher=[[DC Comics]] }}</ref> alliteration being common in early comics.

Team-ups with fellow comics icon [[Batman]] are common, inspiring many stories over the years. When paired, they are often referred to as the "World's Finest" in a nod to the name of the comic book series that features many team-up stories. In 2003, DC Comics began to publish a new series featuring the two characters titled ''[[Superman/Batman]]''.

Superman also has a [[rogues gallery]] of enemies, including his most well-known nemesis, [[Lex Luthor]], who has been envisioned over the years in various forms as either a [[Mad scientist|rogue scientific genius]] with a personal vendetta against Superman, or a powerful but corrupt [[CEO]] of a conglomerate called [[LexCorp]].<ref name="TCS160">Daniels (1998), p. 160.</ref> In the 2000s, he even becomes [[President of the United States]],<ref>[[J.M.

[[Darkseid]], one of the most powerful beings in the [[DC Universe]], is also a formidable nemesis in most post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] comics. Other enemies who have featured in various incarnations of the character, from comic books to film and television include the fifth-dimensional [[imp]] [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]], the reverse Superman known as [[Bizarro]] and the Kryptonian criminal [[General Zod]].

==Cultural impact==
Superman has come to be seen as both an American cultural icon<ref>{{cite book | last=Magnussen | first=Anne | coauthors=Hans-Christian

His adventures and popularity have established the character as an inspiring force within the public eye, with the character serving as inspiration for musicians, comedians and writers alike.

===Merchandising===
Superman became popular very quickly, with an additional title, ''Superman Quarterly'' quickly added. In 1940 the character was represented in the annual [[Macy's parade]] for the first time.<ref>Staff writer. "Superman Struts In Macy Parade". ''[[New York Times]]'', November 22, 1940. p.18</ref> In fact Superman had become popular to the extent that in 1942, with sales of the character's three titles standing at a combined total of over 1.5 million, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' was reporting that "the Navy Department (had) ruled that Superman comic books should be included among essential supplies destined for the Marine garrison at Midway Islands."<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writer | title=Superman's Dilemma | date=April 13, 1942 |accessdate= 2007-01-29| publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766523,00.html }}</ref> The character was soon [[licensed]] by companies keen to cash in on this success through [[merchandising]]. The earliest paraphernalia appeared in 1939, a [[Campaign button|button]] proclaiming membership in the Supermen of America club. By 1940 the amount of merchandise available increased dramatically, with [[jigsaw puzzles]], [[doll|paper dolls]], [[bubble gum]] and [[trading cards]] available, as well as wooden or metal [[action figure|figures]]. The popularity of such merchandise increased when Superman was licensed to appear in other media, and Les Daniels has written that this represents "the start of the process that media moguls of later decades would describe as '[[synergy]].'"<ref name="TCS50">Daniels (1998), p. 50.</ref> By the release of ''[[Superman Returns]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] had arranged a cross promotion with [[Burger King]],<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1534100/20060612/story.jhtml | title =The 'Superman' Fanboy Dilemma, Part 4: Come On Feel The Toyz | accessdate =2007-01-16 | author =Karl Heitmueller | date =June 13, 2006 | format =Flash | publisher =MTV News | quote =Warner Bros. has "Superman Returns" licensing deals with Mattel, Pepsi, Burger King, Duracell, Samsung, EA Games and Quaker State Motor Oil, to name a few. }}</ref> and licensed many other products for sale.

Superman's appeal to licensees rests upon the character's continuing popularity, cross market appeal and the status of the "S" shield, the stylized magenta and gold "S" emblem Superman wears on his chest, as a fashion symbol.<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Lieberman | title=Classics are back in licensed gear | date=June 21, 2005 |accessdate= 2007-01-29| publisher=[[USA Today]] | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2005-06-20-licensing_x.htm }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Warner Bros.

The first adaptation of Superman was as a daily newspaper comic strip, launching on January 16, 1939. The strip ran until May 1966, and significantly, Siegel and Shuster used the first strips to establish Superman's backstory, adding details such as the planet Krypton and Superman's father, [[Jor-El]], concepts not yet established in the comic books.<ref name="TCS42"/> Following on from the success of this was the first radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', which premiered on February 12, 1940 and featured the voice of [[Bud Collyer]] as Superman. The series ran until March, 1951. Collyer was also cast as the voice of Superman in a series of [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|''Superman'' animated cartoons]] produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] for theatrical release. Seventeen shorts were produced between 1941 and 1943. By 1948 Superman was back in the movie theatres, this time in a filmed serial, ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'', with [[Kirk Alyn]] becoming the first actor to portray Superman on screen. A second serial, ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'', followed in 1950.<ref name="TCS7576">Daniels (1998), pp. 75–76.</ref>

In 1951 a television series was commissioned, ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' starring [[George Reeves]], with the pilot episode of the series gaining a theatrical release as ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]''. The series ran for a 104 episodes, from 1952–1958. The next adaptation of Superman occurred in 1966, when Superman was adapted for the stage in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman]]''. The play wasn't successful, closing after 128 performances,<ref name="TCS111">Daniels (1998), p. 111.</ref> although a [[cast album]] recording was released.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.amazon.com/Bird-Plane-Superman-Original-Broadway/dp/B0000027WB | title =Amazon.com: It's A Bird ...

Superman was again animated, this time for television, in the series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]''. 68 shorts were made and broadcast between 1966 and 1969. Bud Collyer again provided the voice for Superman. Then from 1973 until 1984 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast the "[[Super Friends]]" series, this time animated by [[Hanna-Barbera]].<ref name="TCS111115">Daniels (1998), pp. 111–115</ref>

Superman returned to movie theatres in 1978, with director Richard Donner's ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' starring [[Christopher Reeve]]. The film spawned three sequels, ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980), ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest For Peace]]'' (1987).<ref name="TCS141143">Daniels (1998), pp. 141–143</ref> In 1988 Superman returned to television in the [[Ruby Spears]] animated series ''[[Superman (1988 TV series)|Superman]]'',<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.rubyspears.com/film.shtml#C | title =About Us | accessdate =2007-01-11 |work=Ruby-Spears website |publisher=Ruby-Spears Productions | quote = Ruby-Spears pulled the coup of the 1988–89 season by acquiring the rights to two heavily sought after properties.

Superman has also featured as an inspiration for musicians, with songs by numerous artists from several generations celebrating the character.

===Literary analysis===
Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut. The character's status as the first costumed superhero has allowed him to be used in many studies discussing the genre, [[Umberto Eco]] noting that "he can be seen as the representative of all his similars".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eco |first=Umberto |authorlink=Umberto Eco |coauthors= |editor=Jeet Heer & Kent Worcester |title=Arguing Comics |origdate=1962 |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-687-5|page=162 |chapter=The Myth of Superman }}</ref> Writing in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in 1971, [[Gerald Clarke]] stated: "Superman's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signalling the beginning of the end for the [[Horatio Alger]] myth of the self-made man." Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance, and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which "only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper."<ref>{{cite news |first=Gerald |last=Clarke |authorlink=Gerald Clarke|title=The Comics On The Couch |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842864,00.html | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |id={{ISSN|0040-781X}} |pages=1–4 |date=December 13, 1971 |accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref> Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman's partial role in exploring assimilation, the character's alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level.<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Arnold |authorlink=Andrew Arnold |title=The Hard Knock Life |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,1115061,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |id={{ISSN|0040-781X}} |accessdate=2007-01-29 |quote=much of The Quitter involves the classic American literary theme of assimilation. Though extremely popular in other mediums, this theme, again, has gotten little attention in comix except obliquely, through such genre works as Seigel and Shuster's Superman character. }}</ref>
[[Image:Clark-Kent.png|thumb|left|Clark Kent, argued by [[Jules Feiffer]] to be the most innovative feature of Superman]]<!-- FAIR USE of Clark-Kent.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Clark-Kent.png for rationale -->
A.C. Grayling, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of [[Al Capone]], through the 1940s and [[World War II]], a period in which Superman helped sell [[war bonds]],<ref name="60Y64">Daniels (1995), p. 64.</ref> and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the [[Cold War]] as being one where "matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions", and discusses events post [[9/11]], stating that as a nation "caught between the terrifying [[George W. Bush]] and the terrorist [[Osama bin Laden]], America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape".<ref>{{cite news |first=A C |last=Grayling |title=The Philosophy of Superman: A Short Course |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/23525/the-philosophy-of-superman.thtml |format=Fee required |work=[[The Spectator]] |publisher=Press Holdings |id={{ISSN|0038-6952}} |date=July 8, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>

[[Scott Bukatman]] has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman's ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of [[Metropolis]]. He writes that the character "represented, in 1938, a kind of [[Le Corbusier|Corbusierian]] ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that 'Everything is known to us'."<ref name="MOG"/>

[[Jules Feiffer]] has argued that Superman's real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what "made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent." Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfilment,<ref>[[Jules Feiffer]] ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', (2003). [[Fantagraphics]]. ISBN 1-56097-501-6</ref> a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that "If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from" and Shuster supporting that as being "why so many people could relate to it".<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031207220852/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=10 p.10].</ref>

Superman's [[immigrant]] status is a key aspect of his appeal.<ref>Fingeroth, Danny ''Superman on the Couch'' (2004). Continuum International Publishing Group p53. ISBN 0826415393</ref><ref name="Engle">Engle, Gary "What Makes Superman So Darned American?" reprinted in ''Popular Culture'' (1992) Popular Press p331-343. ISBN 0879725729</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Daniel|coauthors=Bryan Singer|title=The Art of Superman Returns|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2006|pages=92|isbn=0811853446}}</ref> Jeff McLaughlin saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in America. the extraterrestrial origin was seen by McLaughlin as challenging the notion that [[Anglo-Saxon]] ancestry was the source of all might.<ref>McLaughlin, Jeff "Comics as Philosophy" (2005). Univ of Mississippi Press p92. ISBN 1578067944</ref> Gary Engle saw the "myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in [[American culture]]." He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the [[Western (genre)|Western]] as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants cultural heritage for the greater good.<ref name="Engle" /> Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued other aspects of the story reinforce the acceptance of the [[American dream]]. He notes that "the only thing capable of harming Superman is Kryptonite, a piece of his old home world."<ref name="Pevey" /> David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman's early stories portray a threat: "the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country."<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenemann|first=David|title=Adorno in America|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2007|pages=180|isbn=0816648093}}</ref>

===Critical reception and popularity===
The character Superman and his various comic series have received various awards over the years. ''[[The Death of Superman#The Reign of the Supermen|The Reign of the Supermen]]'' is one of many storylines or works to have received a ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' Fan Award, winning the Favorite Comic Book Story category in 1993.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&view=topic&forumid=34&postid=147| title = CBG Fan Awards Archives| accessdate = 2007-01-29| last = Miller| first = John Jackson| authorlink = John Jackson Miller| date = June 9, 2005| | work = www.cbgxtra.com| publisher = [[Krause Publications]]| quote = CBG Fan Award winners 1982–present}}</ref> Superman came at number 2 in ''VH1's Top Pop Culture Icons 2004''.<ref name="200greatest">{{cite news | title= 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons List: The Folks that Have Impacted American Society |url= http://www.azreporter.com/entertainment/television/news/200popicons.shtml |publisher= Arizona Reporter | date=October 27, 2003 | accessdate=2006-12-08}} Syndicated reprint of a Newsweek article </ref> In the same year British cinemagoers voted Superman as the greatest superhero of all time.<ref>{{cite news | title = Superman is 'greatest superhero' | publisher = BBC | date = 2004-12-22 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4090207.stm | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> Works featuring the character have also garnered six [[Eisner Awards]]<ref>{{cite web| url =http://users.rcn.com/aardy/comics/awards/eisnersum.shtml | title =Will Eisner Comic Industry Award: Summary of Winners | accessdate =2007-01-17 | author =Joel Hahn | year =2006 | work =Comic Book Awards Almanac | publisher =Joel Hahn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners_06rcv.shtml | title =Alan Moore Back on Top for 2006 Eisner Awards | accessdate =2007-01-17 | month =July | year =2006 | publisher =Comic-Con International }}</ref> and three [[Harvey Awards]],<ref>{{cite web| url =http://users.rcn.com/aardy/comics/awards/harveysum.shtml | title =Will Harvey Award Winners Summary | accessdate =2007-01-17 | author =Joel Hahn | year =2006 | work =Comic Book Awards Almanac | publisher =Joel Hahn}}</ref> either for the works themselves or the creators of the works.
