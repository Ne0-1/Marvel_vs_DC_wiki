[[de:Superman]]
<b>Superman</b> (fictitious character), is a [[superhero]], present in [[comic book]]s bearing his name from [[DC Comics]].  The character has also been in various television series and movies. 

Note: For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of the ''Übermensch'' ("superman" or "overman" in the [[German language]]) see [[Übermensch]].

== History ==
Superman was invented by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] and originally appeared in [[Action Comics]] in [[1938]]. They sold the rights to the company for $130 and when the popularity of the character led them to sue for more in 1947 they were fired. Superman has been more or less consistently popular throughout the [[20th century]].

== Synopsis ==
[[Clark Kent]] is the the [[secret identity]] of Superman. The story of Superman's origin is a science-fiction update of the common origin story of various culture heroes eg. [[Moses]], [[Gilgamesh]], who, to save them from death as babies, are placed in a basket to float downriver: born as Kal-el on the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], while still a baby he was put into a spaceship alone by his father, Jor-El, and escaped moments before his home-planet exploded.  His spaceship finally landed on Earth. He was adopted by a family in [[Smallville]], and was raised there until, as an adult, he moved to [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]].   As Kent he works as a reporter at the Daily Planet, a major newspaper in Metropolis. A co-reporter is [[Lois Lane]], who also is the target of Kent's/Superman's romantic affections.  A central part of the storyline is Lane's affection for the strapping superhero and rebuttals of all advances from the meeker Clark Kent.

Superman possesses a number of extraordinary powers, rendering him -- in terms contemporary to the [[1950s]] -- "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound".  Other powers include X-ray vision, heat vision, near-invulnerability to damage, and the power of flight.  The origin of Superman's powers is the solar radiation of Earth's sun, which differs from the radiation of the star around which Superman's native planet, Krypton, orbits. The yellow sun of earth grants him powers he would not have under Krypton's red sun.  Numerous stories have had Superman's enemies take advantage of that fact and expose him to synthesized red solar radiation to neutralize his powers as long they can maintain the exposure.

The remains of the shattered planet spread throughout the universe as a green crystalline or metallic substance known as [[kryptonite]], which is harmful to Superman and robs him of his powers when it is in close proximity to him. A variant form of kryptonite is "red kryptonite", which does not usually damage him directly but has highly unpredictable effects on his psyche and powers (for example, red kryptonite exposure once [[transmogrification|transformed]] Superman's head into that of a giant [[ant]]). There have been a number of other lesser-known variants of kryptonite, introduced sporadically over the years whenever a particular plotline required them and then forgotten, but in a recent revision of the DC shared story universe they have been [[retcon|retconned]] out of existence.  

The comics have also established that Superman and other Kryptonians are also highly vulnerable to magic.  This means any wizard, magic based monster or even a ordinary person with a magic object can be extremely dangerous.

With a series that has lasted for over sixty years (as of [[2002]]), numerous comic book series, a radio series, cartoons, movies, and written novels, Superman has starred in an amazing number of adventures that have put him into every imaginable situation, on Earth and throughout the universe, in numerous eras of history.  During his long history, as he has faced nearly every imaginable peril, Superman's powers increased to the point where he was quite literally an omnipotent being who could do anything.  This posed an enormous challenge for anyone assigned to write stories about the character, as it provided a nearly insurmountable obstacle: "How does one write about a character who is nearly as powerful as [[God]]?"  This, among other reasons, contributed to a decline in Superman's popularity, especially during the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] when [[Marvel Comics]] brought a new level of character development to mainstream comic books.  By the early [[1980s]], DC Comics had decided that a major change was needed to boost Superman's popularity and make him more appealing to the audiences of the time.  Comic book writer-artist [[John Byrne]] was brought in to re-create Superman from scratch and re-start the series.  The resulting [[retcon]] of Superman, which took place in [[1986]], brought a number of substantial changes to the character, some of which were less than successful (and were met with varying degrees of acceptance by comic book buyers).  The re-launch of the ''Superman'' comic book series did succeed in returning the character to the fold of mainstream comic books, returning it to the forefront of DC's flagship titles.

Since the launch of the "new" Superman, the editorial staff at DC has introduced several drastic changes to the character, which boosted sales of the comic but also sparked debate among fans as to whether some of the changes were necessary.  The two major changes to Superman that have had long-term effects included the "Death of Superman" storyline, in which Superman died at the hands of a supervillain named [[Doomsday]].  He returned from the dead to finally defeat Doomsday, though his "death" gave rise to a number of new characters and storylines.  In [[1995]], Superman (or rather, Clark Kent) finally married [[Lois Lane]], and the two have had a happy marriage that has lasted...so far.  Future editorial changes to the ''Superman'' comic book series may reverse some or all of these changes.

== Other characters ==
Famous characters in Superman include [[Lois Lane]], the criminal mastermind [[Lex Luthor]], the Daily Planet photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]], and a host of various [[supervillain]]s like [[Lex Luthor]] and Brainiac.

Superman also had a cousin from Krypton, [[Supergirl]]; though she was killed in the comic book series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''  After the [[retcon]] of Superman, Supergirl was re-introduced into the comic book series, but her history is now far more confusing and convoluted.

== Cultural influences ==
Both Superman's name and the premise of his character owe a large debt to the concept of the [[Uebermensch|Übermensch]], developed by the [[19th century]] philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Superman is a staple of American [[pop culture]].

The Superman character has made the transition to television and movies, both on multiple occasions.  Among the actors who have played the role are [[George Reeves]], [[Christopher Reeve]], and [[Dean Cain]].

DC Comics has [[copyright|copyrighted]] variations on the "super" theme, such as "superdog" and "supergal" to circumvent parody or product confusion.  Nevertheless, a great many imitations and parodies of Superman have appeared over the years.  One of the first Superman imitations, Fawcett Comics' [[Captain Marvel]], sparked legal action because of its similarities to Superman.  Several famous spoofs of Superman have become famous (at least among children who grew up at the time of their popularity) include [[Mighty Mouse]], [[Underdog]], and [[Super Goof]].

In the [[1990s]], comic book artist and writer [[Rob Liefeld]] created a Superman imitation and starred him in his own comic book series, called ''[[Supreme]].''  The series sold moderately well at first, but sales dwindled until the series was taken over with issue #41 by writer [[Alan Moore]].  Moore produced about fifteen issues of ''Supreme'' that paid homage to the classic "Silver Age" Superman before his [[1985]] [[retcon]].
