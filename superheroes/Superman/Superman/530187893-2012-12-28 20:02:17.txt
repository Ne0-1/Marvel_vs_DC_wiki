The [[Origin of Superman|origin story of Superman]] relates that he was born '''Kal-El''' on the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], before being rocketed to [[Earth]] as an infant by his scientist father [[Jor-El]], moments before Krypton's destruction. Discovered and adopted by a [[Kansas]] farmer and his wife, the child is raised as '''[[Clark Kent]]''' and imbued with a strong moral compass. Very early he started to display [[superhuman]] abilities, which upon reaching maturity he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity.

Superman has fascinated scholars, with [[Cultural studies|cultural theorists]], commentators, and critics alike exploring the character's impact and role in the [[United States]] and the rest of the world. [[Umberto Eco]] discussed the mythic qualities of the character in the early 1960s, and [[Larry Niven]] has pondered [[Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex|the implications of a sexual relationship]] involving the character.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.rawbw.com/~svw/superman.html | title =Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex | accessdate =June 14, 2010| last =Niven | first =Larry | authorlink =Larry Niven | year =1971 | work=All the Myriad Ways | publisher=Larry Niven|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qVCr9NkN|archivedate=June 14, 2010 | deadurl = no }}</ref> The character's ownership has often been the subject of dispute, with Siegel and Shuster twice suing for the return of legal ownership.

== Publication history ==
=== Creation and conception ===
[[File:Reign of the Superman.jpg|thumb|250px|"[[The Reign of the Super-Man]]" in the fanzine ''Science Fiction'', No.3 (June 1933)]]
Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster had initially created a bald [[Telepathy|telepathic]] [[villain]] bent on dominating the world, in the short story "[[The Reign of the Super-Man]]" in ''Science Fiction'' #3, a [[fanzine]] Siegel published in 1933.<ref name="TCS13">Daniels (1998), p. 13.</ref> Siegel re-envisioned the character later that year as a hero bearing no resemblance to his villainous namesake, with Shuster visually modeling Superman on [[Douglas Fairbanks Sr.]], and his bespectacled alter ego, Clark Kent, on a combination of [[Harold Lloyd]]<ref name=SundayClassics>{{cite book | authorlink=Roger Stern | first=Roger | last=Stern | title = Superman: Sunday Classics: 1939 - 1943 | publisher = [[DC Comics]]/[[Kitchen Sink Press]]/[[Sterling Publishing]] | year = 2006 | page = xii}}</ref><ref name=BookTimes>{{cite news | first=John | last=Gross | title=Books of the Times | date=December 15, 1987 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1F38F936A25751C1A961948260 |accessdate=2007-01-29 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qVBNx6rO|archivedate=June 14, 2010 | deadurl = no }}</ref> and Shuster himself, with the name "[[Clark Kent]]" derived from movie stars [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]].<ref name=torontostar1992>{{cite news | url = http://joeshusterawards.com/hof/hall-of-fame-joe-shuster/superman-at-the-star-joe-shusters-last-interview/ | title = Great Krypton!

Titling it ''The Superman'', Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing, who had published a 48-page [[black-and-white]] comic book entitled ''[[Dan Dunn|Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48]]''. Although the duo received an encouraging letter, Consolidated never again published comic books. Shuster took this to heart and burned all pages of the story, the cover surviving only because Siegel rescued it from the fire. Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to [[Slam Bradley]], an adventurer the pair had created for ''[[Detective Comics]]'' No.1 (March 1937).<ref name="TCS17">Daniels (1998), p. 17.</ref>

Siegel, feeling that Superman would not progress with Shuster, contacted artists [[Tony Strobl]], [[Mel Graff]], and [[Russell Keaton]] as potential collaborators on the strip.<ref name="GJMT">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gerard|title=Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book|publisher=Basic Books|year=2004|page=115|isbn=0-465-03656-2}}</ref> Artwork produced by Keaton based on Siegel's treatment shows the concept evolving.

The pair re-envisioned the character, who became more of a hero in the mythic tradition, inspired by such characters as [[Samson]] and [[Hercules]],<ref name="TMOS">Petrou, David Michael (1978). ''The Making of Superman the Movie'', New York: [[Warner Books]] ISBN 0-446-82565-4</ref> who would right the wrongs of Siegel and Shuster's times, fighting for [[social justice]] and against [[tyranny]]. It was at this stage the costume was introduced, Siegel later recalling that they created a "kind of costume and let's give him a big ''S'' on his chest, and a cape, make him as colorful as we can and as distinctive as we can."<ref name="TCS18">Daniels (1998), p. 18.</ref> The design was based in part on the costumes worn by characters in outer space settings published in [[pulp magazine]]s, as well as comic strips such as ''[[Flash Gordon]]'',<ref name="TCS19">Daniels (1998), p. 19.</ref> and also partly suggested by the traditional circus strong-man outfit, which comprised a pair of shorts worn over a contrasting bodysuit.<ref name="TCS18"/><ref name="MorrisonHerald">{{cite news | first= Grant | last= Morrison | authorlink=Grant Morrison | title=Seriously, Perilously | date= September 29, 1998 | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |page=14}}</ref> However, the cape has been noted as being markedly different from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] tradition. Gary Engle described it as without "precedent in popular culture" in ''Superman at Fifty: The Persistence of a Legend''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Engle |first=Gary |editor=Dennis Dooley and Gary Engle (eds.)|title=Superman at Fifty: The Persistence of a Legend |year=1987|publisher=Octavia |location=Cleveland, OH |isbn=0-02-042901-0|chapter="What Makes Superman So Darned American?" }}</ref> The circus performer's shorts-over-tights outfit was soon established as the basis for many future superhero outfits. This third version of the character was given extraordinary abilities, although this time of a physical nature as opposed to the mental abilities of the villainous Superman.<ref name="TCS18"/>

The locale and the hero's civilian names were inspired by the movies, Shuster said in 1983. "Jerry created all the names. We were great movie fans, and were inspired a lot by the actors and actresses we saw. As for Clark Kent, he combined the names of [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]]. And Metropolis, the city in which Superman operated, came from the [[Fritz Lang]] movie <nowiki>[</nowiki>''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927], which we both loved".<ref name="AND8">Andrae, ''Nemo'' (online version): "Superman Through the Ages: The Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster Interview, Part 8 of 10" (1983).</ref>

Although they were by now selling material to comic book publishers, notably [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]]'s [[National Publications|National Allied Publishing]], the pair decided to feature this character in a comic strip format, rather than in the longer comic book story format that was establishing itself at this time. They offered it both to [[Max Gaines]], who passed, and to [[United Feature Syndicate]], who expressed interest initially but finally rejected the strip in a letter dated February&nbsp;18, 1937. However, in what historian Les Daniels describes as "an incredibly convoluted turn of events", Max Gaines ended up positioning the strip as the lead feature in Wheeler-Nicholson's new publication, ''Action Comics''. [[Vin Sullivan]], editor of the new book, wrote to the pair requesting that the comic strips be refashioned to suit the comic book format, requesting "eight panels a page". However Siegel and Shuster ignored this, utilizing their own experience and ideas to create [[Comics vocabulary|page layouts]], with Siegel also identifying the image used for the cover of ''Action Comics'' No.1 ([[1938 in comics|June 1938]]), Superman's [[first appearance]].<!-- whole paragraph sourced from same source --><ref name="TCS2531">Daniels (1998), pp. 25–31.</ref> In February 2010, an original ''Action Comics #1'' was sold at auction for $1,000,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/americas/8529504.stm |title=First Superman comic sells for $1m |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=February 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

Siegel may have been inspired to create the ''Superman'' character because of the death of his father. Mitchell Siegel was an immigrant who owned a clothing store on Cleveland's near east side. He died during a robbery attempt in 1932, a year before Superman was created. Although Siegel never mentioned the death of his father in interviews, both [[Gerard Jones]] and [[Brad Meltzer]] believe it must have affected him. "It had to have an effect," says Jones. "There's a connection there: the loss of a dad as a source for Superman." Meltzer states: "Your father dies in a robbery, and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the world's greatest hero. I'm sorry, but there's a story there."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-08-25-superman-creators_N.htm |title=Superman's story: Did a fatal robbery forge the Man of Steel? |accessdate=August 26, 2008 |author=David Colton |date=August 25, 2008 |work=[[USA Today]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5aMwEGibC |archivedate=August 26, 2008 | deadurl = no }}</ref>

Superman's first appearance was in ''Action Comics'' #1, published on April 18, 1938 (cover-dated to June 1938).<ref>{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|title=The encyclopedia of superheroes on film and television|accessdate=May 31, 2011|date=2008-07|publisher=McFarland & Co.|isbn=978-0-7864-3755-9|page=539}}</ref> In 1939, a [[Superman (comic book)|self-titled series]] was launched. The first issue mainly reprinted adventures published in ''Action Comics'', but despite this the book achieved greater sales.<ref name="TCS44">Daniels (1998), p. 44.</ref> The year 1939 also saw the publication of ''New York World's Fair Comics'', which by summer of 1942 became ''[[World's Finest Comics]]''. With issue No.7 of ''All Star Comics'', Superman made the first of a number of infrequent appearances, on this occasion appearing in cameo to establish his honorary membership in the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]] | artist = Hibbard, Everett E. | Story = $1,000,000 for War Orphans | Title = All Star Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 7 | Date = October–November 1941 | Publisher=[[All-American Publications]] }}</ref>

Initially Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster provided the story and art for all the strips published. However, Shuster's eyesight began to deteriorate, and the increasing appearances of the character meant an increase in the workload. This led Shuster to establish a studio to assist in the production of the art,<ref name="TCS44"/> although he insisted on drawing the face of every Superman the studio produced. Outside the studio, [[Jack Burnley]] began supplying covers and stories in 1940,<ref name="TCS47">Daniels (1998), p. 13</ref> and in 1941 artist [[Fred Ray]] began contributing a stream of Superman covers, some of which, such as that of ''Superman'' No.14 (February 1942), became iconic and much reproduced. [[Wayne Boring]], initially employed in Shuster's studio, began working for DC in his own right in 1942 providing pages for both ''Superman'' and ''Action Comics''.<ref name="TCS69">Daniels (1998), p. 69.</ref> [[Al Plastino]] was hired initially to copy Wayne Boring but was eventually allowed to create his own style and became one of the most prolific Superman artists during the Gold and Silver Ages of comics.<ref>Eury (2006), p. 38.</ref>

The scripting duties also became shared. In late 1939 a new editorial team assumed control of the character's adventures. [[Whitney Ellsworth]], [[Mort Weisinger]] and [[Jack Schiff]] were brought in following Vin Sullivan's departure. This new editorial team brought in [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Manly Wade Wellman]], and [[Alfred Bester]], established writers of science fiction.<ref name="60Y28">Daniels (1995), p. 28.</ref>

By 1943, Jerry Siegel was drafted into the army in a special celebration, and as a result his contributions diminished. [[Don Cameron (comics)|Don Cameron]] and [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Alvin Schwartz]] joined the writing team, Schwartz teaming up with Wayne Boring to work on the [[Superman (comic strip)|''Superman'' comic strip]], which had been launched by Siegel and Shuster in 1939.<ref name="TCS69"/>

In 1945, [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] made his debut in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101. The character moved to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' in 1946, and his own title, ''[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]'', was launched in 1949. The 1950s saw the launching of ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' (1954) and ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' (1958). By 1974 these titles had merged into ''[[Superman Family]]'', although the series was canceled in 1982. ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' was a series published from 1978 to 1986 featuring team-ups between Superman and a wide variety of other characters of the [[DC Universe]].

In 1986, a decision was taken to restructure the [[Fictional universe|universe]] the Superman character inhabited with other DC characters in the mini-series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', resulting in the publication of "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow]]", a two-part story written by [[Alan Moore]], with art by [[Curt Swan]], [[George Pérez]] and [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]] | Penciller = [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]] | Inker=[[George Pérez|Pérez, George]] & [[Kurt Schaffenberger|Schaffenberger, Kurt]] | Title = [[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]] | year = 1997 | Publisher=DC Comics |ID=ISBN 1-56389-315-0}}</ref> The story was published in ''Superman'' No.423 and ''Action Comics'' No.583 and presented what Les Daniels notes as "the sense of loss the fans might have experienced if this had really been the last Superman tale."<ref name="TCS150">Daniels (1998), p. 150.</ref>

[[File:Mansteel1.png|thumb|Superman's origin is revamped in ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' No.1 (July 1986), written and drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]
Superman was relaunched by writer & artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], initially in the limited series ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' (1986). The year 1986 also saw the cancellation of ''World's Finest Comics'', and the ''Superman'' title renamed ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]''. A second volume of ''Superman'' was launched in 1987, running until cancellation in 2006. After this cancellation, ''The Adventures of Superman'' reverted to the ''Superman'' title. ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' was launched in 1991, running until 2003, while the quarterly book ''[[Superman: The Man of Tomorrow]]'' ran from 1995 to 1999. In 2003 ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' was launched, ending in 2011 as well as the ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' limited series, with ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' launched in 2005 and ''[[Superman Confidential]]'' in 2006 (this title was canceled in 2008). He also appeared in the TV animated series-based comic book tie-ins ''[[Superman Adventures]]'' (1996–2002), ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'', ''[[Justice League Adventures|Justice League Unlimited]]'' (canceled in 2008) and ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|The Legion of Super-Heroes In The 31st Century]]'' (canceled in 2008).

In 2011, DC Comics relaunched the Superman comics, along with the [[The New 52|rest of their titles]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2011/05/31/dc-comics-announces-historic-renumbering-of-all-superhero-titles-and-landmark-day-and-date-digital-distribution |title=Announces Historic Renumbering of All Superhero Titles and Landmark Day-and-Date Digital Distribution |publisher=DC Comics |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> ''Superman'' and ''Action Comics'' were canceled and restarted with all-new #1 issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/10/new-superman-comics |title=The New Superman Titles Are Here, Grant Morrison on 'Action Comics' - ComicsAlliance &#124; Comic book culture, news, humor, commentary, and reviews |publisher=ComicsAlliance |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> Superman's costume was redesigned to look more like armor and the red shorts over his tights were removed.

Current ongoing publications that feature Superman on a regular basis are ''Superman'', ''[[Action Comics]]'' and ''[[Justice League#Justice League|Justice League]]''. The character often appears as a guest star in other series and is usually a pivotal figure in DC [[Fictional crossover|crossover events]].

=== Influences ===
An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the [[Great Depression]]. The left-leaning perspective of creators Shuster and Siegel is reflected in early storylines. Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements.<ref name="60Y2223">Daniels (1995), pp. 22–23.</ref> This is seen by comics scholar [[Roger Sabin]] as a reflection of "the liberal idealism of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]", with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes.<ref name="Sabin"/> In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues, tackling a version of the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] in a [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|1946 broadcast]].<ref>{{cite news | first= Richard | last= von Busack | title=Superman Versus the KKK | date= July 2–8, 1998 |work=[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metro]] | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.02.98/comics-9826.html|accessdate=January 28, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Stephen J | last=Dubner | coauthors=Levitt, Steven D | page = F26 | title=Hoodwinked? | date= January 8, 2006 |work=The New York Times Magazine | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/magazine/08wwln_freakonomics.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate=January 28, 2007 }}</ref> Siegel and Shuster's status as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work. Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued that they crafted "an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American", something which Pevey feels taps into an important aspect of American identity.<ref name="Pevey">Pevey, Timothy Aaron "{{pdf|[http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04172007-133407/unrestricted/Pevey_Aaron_200705_MA.pdf "From Superman to Superbland: The Man of Steel's Popular Decline Among Postmodern Youth"]|3.14 Mb}}. April 10, 2007 URN: etd-04172007-133407</ref>

Siegel himself noted that the mythic heroes in the traditions of many cultures bore an influence on the character, including [[Hercules]] and [[Samson]].<ref name="TCS18"/> [[Scott Bukatman]] sees the character to be "a worthy successor to [[Charles Lindberg|Lindberg]] ... (and) also ... like [[Babe Ruth]]", and is also representative of the United States dedication to "progress and the 'new'" through his "invulnerable body ... on which history cannot be inscribed."<ref name="MOG">{{cite book | last=Bukatman | first=Scott | authorlink=Scott Bukatman | year=2003 | title=Matters of Gravity: Special Effects and Supermen in the 20th century | publisher=Duke University Press | isbn=0-8223-3132-2 }}</ref> Because Siegel and Shuster were fans of pulp science fiction,<ref name="TCS13"/> it is widely assumed that the 1930 [[Philip Wylie]] novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'', featuring a protagonist, [[Hugo Danner]], with similar powers, was an inspiration for Superman,<ref>{{cite journal | last =Feeley | first =Gregory | year =2005 | month =March | title =When World-views Collide: Philip Wylie in the Twenty-first Century | journal =Science Fiction Studies | volume =32 | issue =95 | id ={{ISSN|0091-7729}} | url =http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/review_essays/feeley95.htm | accessdate =2006-12-06 }}</ref> though no confirmation exists Siegel and Shuster were influenced by it.<ref>[[Gerard Jones|Jones, Gerard]]. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book''. New York: Basic Books, 2004 (ISBN 0465036562), pg. 346: Wylie threatened to sue Siegel for plagiarism in 1940, but there is no evidence he carried through with the litigation. Historian Jones writes that, "Siegel flatly denied that Wylie's novel had influenced him in any way," although Jones added his own conjecture that "the timing and striking similarities ... would seem to leave no doubt of ''Gladiator''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s role".</ref>

Comics creator and historian [[Jim Steranko]] has cited the [[Pulp magazine|pulp hero]] [[Doc Savage]] as another likely source of inspiration, noting similarities between Shuster's initial art and contemporary advertisements for Doc Savage: "Initially, Superman was a variation of pulp heavyweight Doc Savage".<ref name="SHC">{{cite book|last=Steranko|first=Jim|title=The Steranko History of Comics|publisher=Supergraphics|year=1970|volume=1|pages=35–37|isbn=0-517-50188-0}}</ref> Steranko argued that the pulps played a major part in shaping the initial concept: "Siegel's Superman concept embodied and amalgamated three separate and distinct themes: the visitor from another planet, the superhuman being and the dual identity. He composed the Superman charisma by exploiting all three elements, and all three contributed equally to the eventual success of the strip. His inspiration, of course, came from the science fiction pulps",<ref name="SHC" /> identifying another pulp likely to have influenced the pair as being "[[John W. Campbell]]'s Aarn Munro stories about a descendant of earthmen raised on the planet Jupiter who, because of the planet's dense gravity, is a mental and physical superman on Earth."<ref name="SHC" />

Because Siegel and Shuster were both Jewish, some religious commentators and pop-culture scholars such as Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist [[Howard Jacobson]] suggest that Superman's creation was partly influenced by [[Moses]],<ref name="TIMES05"/><ref name="mythology">{{cite video | title = The Mythology of Superman | medium = DVD | publisher=Warner Bros.|date = 2006}}</ref> and other Jewish elements. More recently, this interpretation has been endorsed by biographer Larry Tye.<ref name="Tye, 2012">{{cite book|last=Tye|first=Larry|title=Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero|year=2012|publisher=Random House Digital|isbn=1400068665, 9781400068661|pages=65–67}}</ref> For example, Superman's Kryptonian name, "Kal-El", resembles the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words קל-אל, which can be taken to mean "voice of God".<ref name="UUaOV">{{cite book | last=Weinstein| first=Simcha| authorlink=Simcha Weinstein | year=2006 | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey! | edition=1st | publisher=[[Leviathan Press]] | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7 }}</ref> The suffix "[[El (god)|el]]", meaning "(of) God," is also found in the name of angels (e.g. [[Gabriel]], [[Ariel (angel)|Ariel]]), who are flying humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers. Tye suggests that this "Voice of God" is an allusion to Moses' role as a prophet.<ref name="Tye, 2012"/> Moreover, Kal-El's parents send him away in a vessel, delivering him to new adoptive parents in an alien culture in order to  save him from impending doom, just as Moses' parents do.<ref name="Tye, 2012"/> "The narratives of Krypton's birth and death borrowed the language of Genesis."<ref name="Tye, 2012"/>

On the other hand, Superman has been seen by others as being an analogy for Jesus, being a savior of humanity.<ref name="Sabin">{{cite book | last=Sabin | first=Roger | authorlink=Roger Sabin | year=1996 | title= Comics, Comix & Graphic Novels| edition=4th paperback | publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-3993-0 }}</ref><ref name="mythology" /><ref name="Tye, 2012"/><ref name="Newsweek">{{cite news |first= Steven |last= Waldman  |coauthors= Kress, Michael | title=Beliefwatch: Good Fight | url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2006/06/19/beliefwatch-good-fight.html | work=Newsweek |date= June 19, 2006 |accessdate=December 3, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref><ref>Skelton, Stephen.

Whilst the term Übermensch, was initially coined by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and translated by Shaw as Superman, it is unclear how influential Nietzsche and his ideals were to Siegel and Shuster.<ref name="mythology" /> Les Daniels has speculated that "Siegel picked up the term from other science fiction writers who had casually employed it", further noting that "his concept is remembered by hundreds of millions who may barely know who Nietzsche is."<ref name="TCS18"/> Others argue that Siegel and Shuster "could not have been unaware of an idea that would dominate Hitler's National Socialism.

Siegel and Shuster have themselves discussed a number of influences that impacted upon the character. Both were avid readers, and their mutual love of science fiction helped to drive their friendship. Siegel cited [[John Carter (character)|John Carter]] stories as an influence: "Carter was able to leap great distances because the planet Mars was smaller that the planet Earth; and he had great strength. I visualized the planet Krypton as a huge planet, much larger than Earth".<ref name="AND8" /> The pair were also avid collectors of comic strips in their youth, cutting them from the newspaper, with [[Winsor McKay]]'s ''[[Little Nemo]]'' firing their imagination with its sense of fantasy.<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031207221050/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=2 p.2].</ref> Shuster has remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style, whilst also noting a larger influence: "[[Alex Raymond]] and [[Burne Hogarth]] were my idols&nbsp;– also [[Milt Caniff]], [[Hal Foster]], and [[Roy Crane]]. But the movies were the greatest influence on our imagination: especially the films of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] Senior."<ref name="AND4">Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031208131136/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=4 p.4].</ref> Fairbanks' role as ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' was certainly an inspiration, as Shuster admitted to basing Superman's stance upon scenes from the movie.<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031208132241/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=7 p.7].</ref> The movies also influenced the storytelling and page layouts,<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031208131627/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=5 p.5].</ref> whilst the city of Metropolis was named in honor of the [[Fritz Lang]] motion picture of the [[Metropolis (film)|same title]].<ref name="AND8"/>

As part of the deal which saw Superman published in ''Action Comics'', Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company in return for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/entertainment-us-usa-superman-idUSBRE83G02F20120417 | title=Check that bought Superman rights for $130 sells for $160,000 | work=Reuters | date=April 16, 2012 | accessdate=June 29, 2012 | author=Goldberg, Barbara}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0h2K2Esun4sC&lpg=PA118&dq=%24130&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q=%24130&f=false | title=Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero | publisher=Random House Digital | year=2012 | accessdate=June 29, 2012 | author=Tye, Larry}}</ref><ref name="Heidi">{{cite news|author=MacDonald, Heidi|title=Inside the Superboy Copyright Decision|date=April 11, 2006|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6323787.html|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=December 8, 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5eX4MYcBN |archivedate= February 12, 2009 | deadurl = yes }}</ref> ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' reported in 1940 that the pair was each being paid $75,000 a year, a fraction of National Comics Publications' millions in ''Superman'' profits.<ref name = "TCJ26316"/> Siegel and Shuster renegotiated their deal, but bad blood lingered and in 1947 Siegel and Shuster sued for their 1938 contract to be made [[Void (law)|void]] and the re-establishment of their ownership of the intellectual property rights to Superman. The pair also sued National in the same year over the rights to Superboy, which they claimed was a separate creation that National had published without authorization. National immediately fired them and took their byline off the stories, prompting a legal battle that ended in 1948, when a New York court ruled that the 1938 contract should be upheld. However, a ruling from Justice J. Addison Young awarded Siegel the rights to Superboy. A month after the Superboy judgment the two sides agreed on a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. National paid Siegel and Shuster $94,000 to drop all claims. The pair also acknowledged in writing the company's ownership of Superman, attesting that they held rights for "all other forms of reproduction and presentation, whether now in existence or that may hereafter be created",<ref name="TCJ26313">Dean (2004), p. 13.</ref> but DC refused to re-hire them.<ref name="TCS73">Daniels (1998), p. 73.</ref>

In 1973 Siegel and Shuster again launched a suit claiming ownership of Superman, this time basing the claim on the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] which saw copyright granted for 28 years but allowed for a renewal of an extra 28 years. Their argument was that they had granted DC the copyright for only 28 years.

In 1975 after news reports of their pauper-like existences, [[Warner Communications]] gave Siegel and Shuster lifetime pensions of $20,000 per year and health care benefits. Jay Emmett, then executive vice president of Warner Bros., was quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as stating, "There is no legal obligation, but I sure feel there is a moral obligation on our part."<ref name="TCJ26316">Dean (2004), p. 16.</ref> Heidi MacDonald, writing for ''Publishers Weekly'', noted that in addition to this pension "Warner agreed that Siegel and Shuster would henceforth be credited as creators of Superman on all comics, TV shows and films".<ref name="Heidi"/>

The year after this settlement, 1976, the copyright term was extended again, this time for another 19 years for a total of 75 years. However, this time a clause was inserted into the extension to allow authors to reclaim their work, reflecting the arguments Siegel and Shuster had made in 1973. The [[Copyright Act of 1976|new act]] took effect in 1978 and allowed a reclamation window in a period based on the previous copyright term of 56 years. This meant the copyright on Superman could be reclaimed between 1994 to 1999, based on the initial publication date of 1938. Jerry Siegel having died in January 1996, his wife and daughter filed a copyright termination notice in 1999. Although Joe Shuster died in July 1992, no termination was filed at that time by his [[Estate (law)|estate]].<ref name="TCJ26317">Dean (2004), p. 17.</ref>

In 1998, the copyright was extended again with the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]. This time the copyright term was extended to 95 years with a further window for reclamation introduced. In January 2004 Mark Peary, nephew and legal [[heir]] to Joe Shuster's estate, filed notice of his intent to reclaim Shuster's half of the copyright, the termination effective in 2013.<ref name="TCJ26317"/> The status of Siegel's share of the copyright is now the subject of a legal battle. Warner Bros. and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve the issues raised by the termination notice, but these discussions were set aside by the Siegels and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. counter sued, alleging that the termination notice contains defects, among other arguments.<ref name="TWOS">{{cite web| url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/issues/insidecounsel/15_159/profiles/191-1.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070506063326/http://www.insidecounsel.com/issues/insidecounsel/15_159/profiles/191-1.html | archivedate=May 6, 2007 | title =The Woman Of Steel | accessdate =January 26, 2007 | last =Vosper | first =Robert| year =2005 | month =February | publisher=Inside Counsel | quote =DC isn't going to hand over its most valued asset without putting up one hell of a legal battle | deadurl = yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.newsarama.com/DC/Superman/Intro.htm | title =Inside The Siegel/DC Battle For Superman | accessdate =January 26, 2007 | last =Brady | first =Matt | date = March 3, 2005 | publisher=[[Newsarama]] | quote = While the complaint, response and counterclaim have been filed, no one even remotely expects a slam-dunk win for either side.

The 1980s saw radical revisions of the character. DC decided to remove the multiverse in a bid to simplify its comics line. This led to the rewriting of the [[back story]] of the characters DC published, Superman included. John Byrne rewrote Superman, removing many established conventions and characters from continuity, including Superboy and Supergirl. Byrne also re-established Superman's adoptive parents, [[Ma and Pa Kent|The Kents]], as characters.<ref>[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] (w)(p), [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]] (i).

After a confrontation with Brainiac that results in his father's death, Superman discovers the lost city of Kandor, which contains 10,000 Kryptonians. Their stay on Earth causes trouble, and the Kryptonians create their own planet, New Krypton. Eventually, New Krypton wages war against Earth. The two sides sustain major casualties and most of the Kryptonians are killed.

=== Personality ===
In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. The character was seen stepping in to attack and terrorize [[domestic violence|wife beaters]], profiteers, a [[lynch mob]], and gangsters, with rather rough edges and a looser moral code than audiences may be used to today.<ref name="60Y2223"/> Later writers have softened the character and instilled a sense of idealism and moral code of conduct. Although not as cold-blooded as the early [[Batman]], the Superman featured in the comics of the 1930s is unconcerned about the harm his strength may cause, tossing villainous characters in such a manner that fatalities would presumably occur, although these were seldom shown explicitly on the page. This came to an end late in 1940 when new editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing.<ref name="TCS42"/>

Today, Superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality and righteousness. He adheres to a strict moral code often attributed to the small-town American values with which he was raised.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Superman.html | title=The religion of Superman (Clark Kent / Kal-El) | work=Adherents.com | date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many citizens and other heroes but has stirred resentment and criticism among others, who refer to him as the "big blue [[boy scout]]." Superman can be rather rigid in this trait, causing tensions in the superhero community, notably with Wonder Woman (one of his closest friends) after she killed [[Maxwell Lord]],<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Greg Rucka|Rucka, Greg]] | Penciller = [[David Lopez (artist)|Lopez, David]] | Title = [[Wonder Woman]] | Volume =2 | Story = Affirmative Defense | Issue = 220 | Date = October 2005 | Publisher=DC Comics }}</ref> and [[Booster Gold]], who after an initial icy relationship with the Man of Steel, grew to respect him.<ref>''Action Comics'' #594 (1987)</ref>

Having lost his home world of Krypton, Superman is very protective of Earth, and especially of Clark Kent's family and friends.

=== Other versions ===
{{Main|Alternative versions of Superman}}
Both the multiverse established by the publishers in the 1960s and the [[Elseworlds]] line of comics established in 1989 have allowed writers to introduce variations on Superman. These have included differences in the nationality, race and morality of the character. Alongside such reimaginings, a number of characters have assumed the title of Superman, especially in the wake of "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline, wherein four newly introduced characters are seen to claim the mantle.<ref>Jurgens ''[[et al.]]''. ''The Return of Superman'' (1993).</ref> In addition to these, the [[Bizarro]] character created in 1958 is a weird, imperfect duplicate of Superman.<ref>Dooley, Dennis and Engle, Gary D. ''Superman at Fifty!'' (1988)</ref> Other members of Superman's family of characters have borne the ''Super-'' prefix, including [[Supergirl]], [[Krypto|Superdog]], and [[Superwoman]]. Outside comics published by DC, the notoriety of the Superman or "[[Übermensch]]" [[archetype]] makes the character a popular figure to be represented through an analogue in entirely unrelated continuities.

== Powers and abilities ==
{{Main|Powers and abilities of Superman}}
As an influential archetype of the superhero genre, Superman possesses extraordinary powers, with the character traditionally described as "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound", a phrase coined by Jay Morton and first used in the ''Superman'' radio serials and [[Max Fleischer]] animated shorts of the 1940s<ref>{{cite news | title= Obituaries of note | date= September 25, 2003 | work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | url= http://www.sptimes.com/2003/09/25/Worldandnation/Obituaries_of_note.shtml | publisher=[[Wire services]] | accessdate =December 8, 2006}}</ref> as well as the TV series of the 1950s. For most of his existence, Superman's famous arsenal of powers has included [[flight]], [[Superhuman strength|super-strength]], [[invulnerability]] to non-magical attacks, [[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman speed|super-speed]], vision powers (including [[X-ray vision|x-ray]], [[Energy blast|heat]]-emitting, telescopic, infra-red, and microscopic vision), super-hearing, and super-breath, which enables him to blow out air at freezing temperatures, as well as exert the propulsive force of high-speed winds.<ref name="60Y80">Daniels (1995), p. 80.</ref>

As originally conceived and presented in his early stories, Superman's powers were relatively limited, consisting of superhuman strength that allowed him to lift a car over his head, run at amazing speeds and leap one-eighth of a mile, as well as an incredibly dense body structure that could be pierced by nothing less than an exploding artillery shell.<ref name="60Y80"/> Siegel and Shuster compared his strength and leaping abilities to an ant and a grasshopper.<ref>{{cite comic| Writer = [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] | Artist =[[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]] | Story = A Scientific Explanation of Superman's Amazing Strength--! | Title = Superman | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = Summer 1939 | Publisher=[[National Periodical Publications]] }}</ref> When making the cartoons, the [[Fleischer Brothers]] found it difficult to keep animating him leaping and requested to DC to change his ability to flying; this was an especially convenient concept for short films, which would have otherwise had to waste precious running time moving earthbound Clark Kent from place to place.<ref>Cabarga, Leslie, [[Jerry Beck|Beck, Jerry]], [[Richard Fleischer|Fleischer, Richard]] (Interviewees). (2006). "First Flight: The Fleischer Superman Series" (supplementary DVD documentary). ''Superman II'' (Two-Disc Special Edition) [DVD]. [[Warner Bros.]].</ref> Writers gradually increased his powers to larger extents during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], in which Superman could fly to other worlds and galaxies and even across universes with relative ease.<ref name="60Y80"/> He would often fly across the solar system to stop meteors from hitting the Earth, or sometimes just to clear his head. Writers found it increasingly difficult to write Superman stories in which the character was believably challenged,<ref name="TCS133">Daniels (1998), p. 133.</ref> so DC made a series of attempts to rein the character in. The most significant attempt, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 rewrite, established several hard limits on his abilities: he barely survives a nuclear blast, and his space flights are limited by how long he can hold his breath.<ref name="AH96">{{cite journal | last =Sanderson | first =Peter | year =1986 | month =June | title = The End of History | journal=[[Amazing Heroes]] | issue =96 | issn =0745-6506 }}</ref> Superman's power levels have again increased since then, with Superman currently possessing enough strength to hurl mountains, withstand nuclear blasts with ease, fly into the sun unharmed, and survive in the vacuum of outer space without oxygen.

The source of Superman's powers has changed subtly over the course of his history. It was originally stated that Superman's abilities derived from his Kryptonian heritage, which made him eons more evolved than humans.<ref name="TCS42"/> This was soon amended, with the source for the powers now based upon the establishment of Krypton's gravity as having been stronger than that of the Earth. This situation mirrors that of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]]. As Superman's powers increased, the implication that all Kryptonians had possessed the same abilities became problematic for writers, making it doubtful that a race of such beings could have been wiped out by something as trifling as an exploding planet. In part to counter this, the Superman writers established that Kryptonians, whose native star [[Rao (comics)|Rao]] had been red, possessed superpowers only under the light of a yellow sun.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13556951/ | title =Sex and the Superman | accessdate =January 26, 2007 | last =Lundegaard | first =Erik | date = July 3, 2006 | publisher=[[msnbc.com]] | quote =Even his origin kept changing. Initially Krypton was populated by a race of supermen whose physical structure was millions of years more advanced than our own. Eventually the red sun/yellow sun dynamic was introduced, where Superman's level of power is dependent upon the amount of yellow solar radiation his cells have absorbed. }}</ref>

Superman is most vulnerable to green [[Kryptonite]], mineral debris from [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet. Exposure to green Kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and immobilizes him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. The only substance on Earth that can protect him from Kryptonite is lead, which blocks the radiation. Lead is also the only known substance that Superman cannot see through with his x-ray vision. Kryptonite was first introduced to the public in 1943 as a [[plot device]] to allow the radio serial voice actor, [[Bud Collyer]], to take some time off.<ref name="TIME14388"/> Although green Kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with its own effect.<ref name="TCS106107">Daniels (1998), pp. 106–107.</ref>

== Supporting cast ==

Superman's large cast of supporting characters includes [[Lois Lane]], perhaps the character most commonly associated with Superman, being portrayed at different times as his colleague, competitor, love interest and wife. Other main supporting characters include ''[[Daily Planet]]'' coworkers such as photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]] and editor [[Perry White]], Clark Kent's adoptive parents [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]], childhood sweetheart [[Lana Lang]] and best friend [[Pete Ross]], and former college love interest [[Lori Lemaris]] (a [[mermaid]]). Stories making reference to the possibility of Superman siring children have been featured both in and out of mainstream continuity.

Incarnations of [[Supergirl]], [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]], and Superboy have also been major characters in the mythos, as well as the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (of which Superman is usually a member). A feature shared by several supporting characters is [[alliteration|alliterative]] names, especially with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], Lois Lane, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Linda Lee]], Lana Lang, Lori Lemaris, and [[Lucy Lane]],<ref>{{Comic book reference | story=Superman's LL's [Text page] | title=Superman | issue=204 | date=February, 1968 | | publisher=DC Comics }}</ref> alliteration being common in early comics.

Team-ups with fellow comics icon [[Batman]] are common, inspiring many stories over the years. When paired, they are often referred to as the "World's Finest" in a nod to the name of the comic book series that features many team-up stories. In 2003, DC began to publish a new series featuring the two characters titled ''Superman/Batman''.

=== Enemies ===
{{Main|List of Superman enemies}}
Superman also has a [[rogues gallery]] of enemies, including his most well-known nemesis, [[Lex Luthor]], who has been envisioned over the years in various forms as both a [[Mad scientist|rogue scientific genius]] with a personal vendetta against Superman, and a powerful but corrupt CEO of a conglomerate called [[LexCorp]] who thinks Superman is somehow hindering human progress by his heroic efforts.<ref name="TCS160">Daniels (1998), p. 160.</ref> In the 2000s, he even becomes president of the United States,<ref>[[J.

[[Darkseid]], one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, is also a formidable nemesis in most post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] comics. Other important enemies who have featured in various incarnations of the character, from comic books to film and television include the fifth-dimensional imp [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], the reverse Superman known as [[Bizarro]] and the Kryptonian criminal [[General Zod]], among many others.

Superman became popular very quickly, with an additional title, ''Superman Quarterly'', rapidly added.

By 1940 the amount of merchandise available increased dramatically, with jigsaw puzzles, paper dolls, bubble gum and trading cards available, as well as wooden or metal figures. The popularity of such merchandise increased when Superman was licensed to appear in other media, and Les Daniels has written that this represents "the start of the process that media moguls of later decades would describe as 'synergy.'"<ref name="TCS50">Daniels (1998), p. 50.</ref> By the release of ''[[Superman Returns]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] had arranged a cross promotion with [[Burger King]],<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1534100/20060612/story.jhtml | title =The 'Superman' Fanboy Dilemma, Part 4: Come On Feel The Toyz | accessdate =January 16, 2007 | author=Karl Heitmueller | date =June 13, 2006 | format =Flash | publisher=MTV News | quote =Warner Bros. has "Superman Returns" licensing deals with Mattel, Pepsi, Burger King, Duracell, Samsung, EA Games and Quaker State Motor Oil, to name a few. }}</ref> and licensed many other products for sale.

The character of Superman has appeared in various media aside from comic books.

The first adaptation of Superman was as [[Superman (comic strip)|a daily newspaper comic strip]], which was launched on January 16, 1939. The strip ran until May 1966 and significantly, Siegel and Shuster used the first strips to establish Superman's background, adding details such as the planet Krypton and Superman's father, [[Jor-El]], concepts not yet established in the comic books.<ref name="TCS42"/> Following on from the success of this was the first radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', which premiered on February 12, 1940, and featured the voice of [[Bud Collyer]] as Superman. The series ran until March 1951. Collyer was also cast as the voice of Superman in a series of [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|''Superman'' animated cartoons]] produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] for theatrical release. Seventeen shorts were produced between 1941 and 1943. By 1948 Superman was back in the movie theatres, this time in a filmed serial, ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'', with [[Kirk Alyn]] becoming the first actor to portray Superman on screen. A second serial, ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'', followed in 1950.<ref name="TCS7576">Daniels (1998), pp. 75–76.</ref>

In 1951 a television series was commissioned, ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' starring [[George Reeves]], with the 25th and 26th episodes of the series being adapted from the theatrical release of the movie ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]''. The series ran for 104 episodes, from 1952 to 1958. The next adaptation of Superman occurred in 1966, when Superman was adapted for the stage in the Broadway musical ''[[It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman]]''.

Superman returned to movie theaters in 1978 with director Richard Donner's ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'', starring [[Christopher Reeve]].

The early 21st century brought an increased presence of Superman in live-action media. In 2001, the ''[[Smallville]]'' television series was launched, focusing on the adventures of Clark Kent as a teenager before he dons the mantle of Superman; [[Tom Welling]] stars as Clark. The series ended after ten seasons in May 2011. In 2006, [[Bryan Singer]] directed ''[[Superman Returns]]'' starring [[Brandon Routh]] as Superman. The film was presented as a loose sequel to the first two Christopher Reeve films. In 2007, Welling was in consideration for the role of Superman in the planned film ''[[Justice League Mortal|Justice League: Mortal]]'', to be directed by [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]].<ref name="JLMortal">{{cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/movies/01justice.html | title =A Film's Superheroes Face Threat of Strike | date =March 1, 2008 | accessdate =April 11, 2011 |work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply}}</ref> The film was to feature Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other prominent members of DC Comics' [[Justice League of America]].

=== Musical references, parodies, and homages ===
{{See also|Superman in popular culture#Music|l1=Superman in popular music}}
Superman has also featured as an inspiration for musicians, with songs by numerous artists from several generations celebrating the character. [[Donovan]]'s [[Billboard Hot 100]] topping single "[[Sunshine Superman]]" utilized the character in both the title and the lyric, declaring "Superman and [[Green Lantern]] ain't got nothing on me."<ref>[[Donovan]]. "[[Sunshine Superman]]". ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]''. [[Epic Records|Epic]], 1966.</ref> Folk singer/songwriter [[Jim Croce]] sung about the character in a list of warnings in the chorus of his song "[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim (song)|You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]", introducing the phrase "you don't tug on Superman's cape" into popular lexicon.<ref>[[Jim Croce]].

Parodies of Superman did not take long to appear, with ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' introduced in "The Mouse of Tomorrow" animated short in 1942.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Turner|title=Deputy Dawg |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |page=21 |date=August 8, 2006}}</ref> While the character swiftly took on a life of its own, moving beyond parody, other animated characters soon took their turn to parody the character. In 1943 [[Bugs Bunny]] was featured in a short, ''[[Super-Rabbit]]'', which sees the character gaining powers through eating fortified carrots. This short ends with Bugs stepping into a phone booth to change into a real "Superman" and emerging as a [[U.S. Marine]]. In 1956 [[Daffy Duck]] assumes the mantle of "Cluck Trent" in the short "[[Stupor Duck]]", a role later reprised in various issues of the ''Looney Tunes'' comic book.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.comics-db.com/comic-book/1046821-Looney_Tunes_97.html | title = Looney Tunes # 97 | accessdate =January 16, 2007 | publisher=Big Comicbook Database}}</ref> In the United Kingdom [[Monty Python]] created the character Bicycle Repairman, who fixes bicycles on a world full of Supermen, for a sketch in series of their BBC show.<ref>{{cite news | first=Mel | last=Clarke | title=The Pitch | work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | page=34 | date=August 1, 2004 }}</ref> Also on the BBC was the sit-com "[[My Hero (TV series)|My Hero]]", which presented Thermoman as a slightly dense Superman pastiche, attempting to save the world and pursue romantic aspirations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sally |last=Kinnes |title=The One To Watch |work=The Sunday Times |page=58 |date=January 30, 2000 }}</ref> In the United States, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' has often parodied the figure, with [[Margot Kidder]] reprising her role as Lois Lane in a 1979 episode. [[Jerry Seinfeld]], a noted Superman fan, filled his series ''[[Seinfeld]]'' with references to the character and in 1997 asked for Superman to co-star with him in a commercial for [[American Express]]. The commercial aired during the [[NFL playoffs, 1997-98|1998 NFL Playoffs]] and [[Super Bowl]], Superman animated in the style of artist [[Curt Swan]], again at the request of Seinfeld.<ref name="TCS185">Daniels (1998), p. 185.</ref>

Superman has also been used as reference point for writers, with [[Steven T. Seagle|Steven T. Seagle's]] graphic novel ''Superman: It's a Bird'' exploring Seagle's feelings on his own mortality as he struggles to develop a story for a Superman tale.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.ugo.com/channels/comics/features/itsabird/default.asp | title =Steven Seagle Talks ''It's a Bird'' | accessdate =January 16, 2007 | publisher=ugo.com | quote =the semi-autobiographical tale of Steven being given the chance to write a Superman comic but stumbling when he can't figure out how to relate to the character.

Superman is also mentioned in several films, including [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which [[Batman]] states: "That's why Superman works alone..." in reference to the many troubles caused by his partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and also in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', in which [[Aunt May]] gives her nephew [[Peter Parker]] a word of advice not to strain himself too much, as "You're not Superman, you know", among many others.

=== Literary analysis ===
Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut. The character's status as the first costumed superhero has allowed him to be used in many studies discussing the genre, [[Umberto Eco]] noting that "he can be seen as the representative of all his similars".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eco |first=Umberto |authorlink=Umberto Eco |editor=Jeet Heer & Kent Worcester |title=Arguing Comics |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-687-5|page=162 |chapter=The Myth of Superman |origyear=1962 }}</ref> Writing in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1971, [[Gerald Clarke]] stated: "Superman's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signalling the beginning of the end for the [[Horatio Alger myth]] of the self-made man." Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance, and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which "only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Gerald |last=Clarke |authorlink=Gerald Clarke|title=The Comics On The Couch |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842864,00.html | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |issn=0040-781X |pages=1–4 |date=December 13, 1971 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}</ref> Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman's partial role in exploring assimilation, the character's alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level.<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Arnold |authorlink=Andrew Arnold |title=The Hard Knock Life |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,1115061,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |issn=0040-781X |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |quote=much of The Quitter involves the classic American literary theme of assimilation.

[[File:Clark-Kent.png|thumb|left|Clark Kent, argued by [[Jules Feiffer]] to be the most innovative feature of Superman]]<!-- FAIR USE of Clark-Kent.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clark-Kent.png for rationale -->
A.C. Grayling, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of [[Al Capone]], through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell [[war bonds]],<ref name="60Y64">Daniels (1995), p. 64.</ref> and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the [[Cold War]] as being one where "matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions", and discusses events post [[9/11]], stating that as a nation "caught between the terrifying [[George W. Bush]] and the terrorist [[Osama bin Laden]], America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape".<ref>{{cite news |first=A C |last=Grayling |title=The Philosophy of Superman: A Short Course |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/23525/the-philosophy-of-superman.thtml |work=The Spectator |location=UK |id={{ISSN|0038-6952}} |date=July 8, 2006 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

[[Scott Bukatman]] has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman's ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis. He writes that the character "represented, in 1938, a kind of [[Le Corbusier|Corbusierian]] ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that 'Everything is known to us'."<ref name="MOG"/>

[[Jules Feiffer]] has argued that Superman's real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what "made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent." Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfillment,<ref>[[Jules Feiffer]] ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', (2003). [[Fantagraphics]]. ISBN 1-56097-501-6</ref> a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that "If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from" and Shuster supporting that as being "why so many people could relate to it".<ref>Andrae (1983), [http://web.archive.org/web/20031207220852/superman.ws/seventy/interview/?part=10 p.10].</ref>

[[Ian Gordon (historian)|Ian Gordon]] suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman he notes was very much part of that effort.<ref>[[Ian Gordon (historian)|Ian Gordon]] "Nostalgia, Myth, and Ideology: Visions of Superman at the End of the 'American Century"in Michael Ryan, ' 'Cultural Studies: An Anthology' '(2007).

''Comics as Philosophy'' (2005). Univ of Mississippi Press p92. ISBN 1-57806-794-4</ref> Gary Engle saw the "myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in [[American culture]]." He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the [[Western (genre)|Western]] as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants cultural heritage for the greater good.<ref name="Engle" /> Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued other aspects of the story reinforce the acceptance of the [[American dream]]. He notes that "the only thing capable of harming Superman is Kryptonite, a piece of his old home world."<ref name="Pevey" /> David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman's early stories portray a threat: "the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country."<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenemann|first=David|title=Adorno in America|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2007|page=180|isbn=0-8166-4809-3}}</ref> David Rooney, a [[critic|theater critic]] for ''The New York Times'', in his evaluation of the play, ''Year Zero'', considers Superman to be the "quintessential immigrant story...(b)orn on an alien planet, he grows stronger on Earth but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm."<ref name="Rooney">{{cite news|last=Rooney|first=David|title=Finding America, Searching for Identity|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/theater/reviews/03year.html|accessdate=June 11, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

=== Video games ===
{{Main|List of Superman video games}}
While Superman is largely considered to be the archetypal superhero, and the flagship character of DC Comics, he has enjoyed virtually no success in video games. Ever since 1978, when [[Superman (Atari game)|the first game]] was released on the [[Atari 2600]], numerous developers have tried at making a Superman game that was generally well-received, although none have succeeded. One of the most notorious examples is the [[Superman (1999 video game)|1999 game for the Nintendo 64]], simply titled "Superman" (although often erroneously called "Superman 64" due to the tradition of [[Nintendo 64|N64]] games putting the number "64" at the end of several titles), which is largely considered to be one of the worst games of all time.
