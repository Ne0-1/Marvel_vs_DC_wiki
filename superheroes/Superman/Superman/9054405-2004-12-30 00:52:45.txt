'''Superman''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[superhero]], created by [[Joe Shuster]] and [[Jerry Siegel]]. Superman first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]] #1'' in [[1938]], and eventually became the most popular [[comic book]] hero of all time.  He subsequently appeared in various [[radio]] serials, [[television]] series, and [[film|movies]]. Superman was born on the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] and was sent to [[Earth]] moments before the planet exploded. He arrived on Earth in Kansas and was discovered and adopted by a human couple. As he grew, he discovered that he possessed superhuman powers.  When not fighting the forces of evil as Superman, he lives disguised as Clark Kent, a mild-mannered reporter.  
 
''Superman'' is a [[loan translation]] deriving from [[German language|German]] ''[[Übermensch]]'', which has the same meaning but a more negative [[connotation]], as found in the works of [[Nietzche]].  

== Synopsis ==
[[Image:Action1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cover of ''[[Action Comics]] #1'', the first appearance of Superman.  Art by [[Joe Shuster]].]]
Superman's origins, abilities and relationships have changed over time. Editors and writers used the process of ''retroactive continuity'', or ''[[retcon]]'', to adjust to changes in popular culture, eliminate restrictive segments of the mythos, and permit contemporary storylines. These changes, while significant, permit the retention of the core elements that make Superman an iconic character.

The modern story of Superman's origin parallels that of other cultural [[hero]]es and religious figures who were spirited away as infants from places where they were in danger.

In the legend extant in the early [[1960s]], Superman was born on Krypton as Kal-El. His father, [[Jor-El (kryptonian)|Jor-El]], was a scientist and leader in Krypton society. One day, he learned that Krypton was doomed. He brought this news to the other leaders. But, they refused to warn their fellow Kryptonians, and forbade Jor-El to do so. For some reason, Jor-El not only agreed, but promised that neither he nor his wife [[Lara (kryptonian)|Lara]] would leave Krypton.  However, that promise did not extend to their infant son, Kal-El.  Moments before Krypton exploded, Jor-El launched Kal-El in a rocket ship, which he sent to Earth, knowing that the combination of the planet's yellow sun and its [[gravity]] would give the boy extraordinary physical powers. 

The now-three year old Kal-El was discovered in a field near [[Smallville]] by [[Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]]. (In the [[1950s]] television series, ''The Adventures of Superman,'' the Kents were named Sarah and Eben.) They named him [[Clark Kent|Clark]], Martha Kent's maiden name. Claiming he was an orphaned relative of Martha's, the Kents raised him on their farm. Because of how they found him, the Kents knew that Clark was not human, and feared that the authorities would take him from them should his abilities (a few of which he was beginning to discover) become public knowledge. Fortunately, Clark grew up without incident, and eventually moved to [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]].

In the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Superman comics ([[1940]]s to [[1985]]), Superman (as Kent) works as a reporter at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' newspaper.  Access to the ''Planet'''s news resources allowed Superman to learn of ongoing events where he could be of help.  Largely working on his own, his true identity was easily kept secret.  Fellow reporter [[Lois Lane]] is the object of Kent's/Superman's romantic affections.  Lane's affection for Superman and her rejection of  Kent's advances are a recurring theme in Superman comics, television, and movies. 

When crises arise, Kent quickly changes into Superman. In the television series, he often ducked into a telephone booth to make the transformation.  In the comic books he rarely did so, due to the booths' transparent windows.  Kent often changed in a storeroom in the Daily Planet building, often having to quickly improvise to find a way to change unnoticed.  In the first [[Christopher Reeve]] Superman movie, Kent, comically unable to use one of the newer open-kiosk pay phones, entered a revolving door and changed clothes while spinning within it at superspeed. Thus made invisible, he appeared to enter the building as Kent and exit seconds later as Superman.

In 1986, after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' series, DC Comics hired writer/artist [[John Byrne]] to recreate the Superman character and offer a fresh retelling of the Superman mythos. In this version, starting with the mini-series, ''[[The Man of Steel]]'', Superman&mdash;like all Kryptonians&mdash;was created through in-vitro fertilization on [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]]. While a fetus, he escaped Krypton's destruction in a spacecraft, and landed months later in [[Smallville]]. Effectively this Superman was "born" on Earth, and is a son of Earth as much as Krypton. He was adopted by the Kents and raised like a normal human. Clark's powers in this retelling developed gradually, beginning with his near-invulnerability, and he didn't fly until he was a teenager. After leaving Smallville, he travelled the world before settling in Metropolis, where this more worldly Clark went to work at the Daily Planet.

In this post-1986 series, and in the [[Lois and Clark]] television series, Clark Kent is more the ''real'' person, and Superman the [[secret identity]] that he presents to the world.  He adopts the secret identity to prevent his enemies from harming his family or friends.  People do not suspect that Superman is hiding his real identity because he wears no [[mask]]. The concept that Clark is the real man, shaped more by his parent's ethics than by his alien power, is a deliberate reversal of the earlier version. As in the original, Lois Lane is Clark Kent/Superman's love interest. The post 1986 Lois and Clark fall in love. Clark eventually tells her he is Superman, causing a strain in their relationship, but they eventually marry.

== Superman's abilities ==
Superman possesses extraordinary powers which render him, in the lead-in to the [[1950]]s television series, "faster than a speeding [[bullet]], more powerful than a [[locomotive]], and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound".  His powers were relatively limited in the 1940s and '50s stories, but grew to god-like powers by the 1980s.  With the 1986 re-creation, his powers were again somewhat diminished.

His powers include:

*Near-invulnerability. In the 1940s, "nothing less than a bursting artillery shell could break his skin"; by the 1970s he could fly through a star and shrug off a nuclear blast. In 1986, Superman was somewhat depowered.  Still able to withstand artillery shells, lasers, and even nuclear explosions, he would be killed if he flew into a star.  His powers have since increased, allowing him to fly into the sun unharmed. In addition, his immune system protects him from toxins and diseases.

*Vision-related powers (appeared in the 1950s and 1960s):
**[[X-ray]] [[vision]]: The ability to [[transparency (optics)|see through]] anything except [[lead]]. He can see things behind a wall as if the wall were not there, or  can "peel back" layer after layer of matter in his mind.  Opponents sometimes use lead lined constructs in an attempt to hide things from Superman.  In one "post-Crisis" story this trick backfired when Superman simply scanned the field for lead, which instantly stands out as the only opaque substance to his vision, and found the hidden item easily. 
**[[telescope|Telescopic]] vision: The ability to see very distant objects, without violating the laws of physics.
**Superman can also see the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]], allowing him to [[night-vision|see in the dark]].
**Microscopic vision: The ability to see extremely small objects and images.
**Heat vision: The ability to apply heat to a target by staring intensely at it with the conscious act of activating his power.  When depicted visually, the power is typically depicted as twin [[laser]] beams firing from the eyes.  These beams can be made invisible, allowing Superman to work undetected.
*Voice: Superman is a master [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]]; he used this once to rescue Lois from criminals. He is also a brilliant mimic, able to impersonate human voices or animal sounds.
*Superhearing: The ability to hear any sound at any volumn or pitch. The only Earth creature who can detect sounds at the frequency he can is a [[dog]] (70-100,000 kHz).
*The power of [[flight]], by force of will, which also allows him to maneuver precisely in any direction, as well as hover. Originally, Superman could jump 1/8 mile, only acquired the ability to fly in the later [[1940]]s.
*Superbreath: The ability to create [[hurricane]] force winds by blowing, and to chill his breath to freeze a target.
*Superspeed: The ability to move at an incredible speed, like [[The Flash]].  This includes running, but flying is more versatile.  The original Superman ran a mere 30 miles per hour, but became much faster in the 1950s.
*Superstrength: The exact magnitude of Superman's strength is unknown, it is generally accepted that he has at least Class 100, meaning he could lift at 100 tons under optimal conditions. However, most believe that his strength is greater than Class 100 and a few argue that he could potentially lift 100,000 tons.

From the [[1940s]] through the early [[1980s]], Superman's powers were unlimited: he could travel millions of light-years in brief periods of time; he could dive into stars unharmed; he could [[time travel|travel through time]] by moving at speeds faster than light; and he could move planets and lift any weight. He could even vibrate his body so fast, the vibrations rendered him "invisible" to the human eye. 

When Superman was re-created in [[1986]], he became more "vulnerable" and was no longer omnipotent. As in the original series, writers again gradually increased his powers. Since "coming back to life" (''[[The Death of Superman]]'') Superman can again survive nuclear blasts, though they leave him wounded and weakened, and he no longer flies faster than light. His strength too has increased. He again can move mountains, but can no longer travel through time under his own power.

===Vital statistics===
* Maximum Bench Press: 250,000 tons
* Maximum Speed: 60,000 mph (flight &#8211; atmosphere), 300,000,000 mph (flight &#8211; space, about half the speed of light), 30,000 mph (running)

====How it works====
Superman's powers derive from his Kryptonian biology and Earth's sun (a [[yellow star]]), and are likely increased by Earth's lesser gravity.  

Kryptonian mitochondria absorb certain wavelengths of the radiation emitted by solar fusion. Under a [[red sun]], this yields increased abilities, which are multiplied a thousand-fold by a yellow sun. The solar energy supplements respiration, such that when cellular materials (perhaps Kryptonian [[ATP]]) combine with glucose, they produce abilities beyond those of humans under a yellow sun. 

"K-ATP" is produced rapidly, enabling a Kryptonian to build up reserves that permit days of super-powered activity in the absence of sunlight. In addition, Krypton's gravity is 50-100 times stronger than Earth's, so Kryptonian cells are also much stronger and denser than a human's.  

Under a yellow sun, other factors contribute to invulnerability.  First, cell membranes and organelles become more resistant to harm; secondly, a bioelectric field surrounds the cells, making them thousands of times tougher.  This "aura" surrounds Superman's epidermis and teeth, and possibly his nails as well.  His hair is invulnerable too, but he does not need to have it cut, since Kryptonian hairs are pushed out when still short by new hairs.  When his cells become "supercharged" under a yellow sun, a Kryptonian becomes super-powered.  He is invulnerable to forces under 1 kt., and is harmed only by repeated blows of over 1 mt.  His brain and nervous system keep up with his enhanced speed, as they too are amplified by K-ATP. 

Superman's other senses are less linked to solar energy than his strength and speed.  Due to Krypton's thinner air, he can hear things no human can.  Solar energy magnifies its accuracy, allowing him to fine-tune it.  His taste, smell, and touch are equally acute.  He sees all wavelengths, from radio to X-rays, allowing him to detect thermal trails and other "invisible" things.

Superman's cells store vast amounts of yellow solar energy. He replenishes his supply even on cloudy days, and weakens only after a week without sunlight. Near a red sun, his powers would fail faster. Red solar radiation creates a chemical which does not lead to the super energy produced by K-ATP. Kryptonite exposure also stops the process that converts yellow sunlight into superpowers, leaving Superman immediately weakened. His powers return quickly once the kryptonite is removed. He seems to be building up immunity to kryptonite, and it is possible that its effect is as part psychological.

Earlier in his life, as in his battle with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Superman's solar energy supply was depleted by exertion.  More recent exertions caused less of a power drain, suggesting that he is now either storing more energy, or growing stronger under the yellow sun.  It is unknown whether higher energy stars might increase his powers even more.

== Weaknesses ==
There ''are'' actually some things Superman cannot do. Because he is not human, he cannot donate [[blood]], tissue, or organs. Procedures like [[surgery]] are impossible without special equipment. Due to the invunerability of his skin, he cannot blush or duplicate likewise facial expressions. Like humans, he needs food and water to survive. While writers have finally allowed Clark to marry Lois, they have steered clear of addressing the issue of whether Superman can father a child (in ''Lois and Clark'', they adopt a child that, like Clark, came from mysterious origins).

As a Kryptonian, he has one specific area of vulnerability. Since Krypton was destroyed, its remains have been spreading throughout the universe as [[kryptonite]], a crystalline substance which has several variants:

''Green'' is fatal to Superman if he is exposed to it long enough, and it immediately robs him of his powers

''Red'' has unpredictable effects on his psyche and powers

''Gold'' permanently removes his powers under Earth's sun (previous canon)

Other variants were introduced sporadically, but in the 1986 reinvention, these have been [[retcon|retconned]] out of existence.
Kryptonite was invented specifically for the Superman radio serial in order to permit Bud Collyer, the actor who was playing him, to take a vacation and thus allow another actor to portray the raspy-voiced Superman under the effects of Kryptonite poisoning.

Kryptonians are also vulnerable to magic, including wizards, magic-based monsters, or an ordinary person with a magic object. (In DC comics, "magic" is a type of [[energy]] that can be harnessed and controlled, as opposed to the more familiar meaning).

== Equipment ==
Given his abilities, personal equipment plays less of a role for Superman than for other superheroes.

The [[Fortress of Solitude]], in the Arctic in the [[Pre-Crisis]] version and in [[Antarctica]]  Post-Crisis, acts as Superman's getaway, although it has communications equipment for urgent messages. Originally the Fortress included laboratories, a private zoo of alien animals, a room for communication with the [[Phantom Zone]] with a projector to place or remove people from it, a Krypton Memorial, a trophy room, and a gym with custom exercise equipment. It also had tribute rooms to personal friends like [[Lois Lane]], [[Jimmy Olsen]], [[Batman]], and Clark Kent (to throw off suspicion) where Superman prepared special gifts in the event of his death.

Most importantly, the Fortress was where Superman stored the bottle city of [[Kandor]], a Kryptonian city shrunken and stolen by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] prior to the planet's destruction.  For years, he worked to reverse the city's condition, while also enjoying the opportunity to visit a native community where he was an honoured guest. The Post-Crisis version was created by the Kryptonian artifact, the Eradicator, when Superman tried to dispose of it in Antarctica.  The device created the Fortress which contains much of Krypton's technology, including artificially intelligent robots. Superman and fellow superhero Steel encased the Fortress in a [[tesseract]], permitting the Man of Steel to carry the Fortress wherever he travels. 

The early Superman had [[android]]s that could impersonate himself and his companions.  He largely abandoned them when pollution began to interfere with their functions.

For situations involving kryptonite, Superman had a collection of lead lined suits for protection.  If his powers were disabled or he needed stronger protection, he had his Supermobile, which could fly anywhere and use its powerful [[waldo]] arms to handle outside objects.  The Post-Crisis Superman has access to various equipment, weapons, and vehicles of Kryptonian design, including a large fighting [[mecha]] called a battlesuit.

Superman's costume was made from blankets from his rocketship, and shared his resistance to damage in a yellow sun environment.  His armour-like costume could also protect others.  While carrying passengers in flight, he wrapped them in his cape to protect them from air friction.  In the original version, Clark's spectacle lenses were made from two small pieces from his spaceship.  Since they were of Kryptonian origin, Clark could fire his heat vision through them without melting them. The post-Crisis Clark has to lift his glasses off his eyes when he uses his heat vision.  Superman sometimes carries spare change in his belt buckle. When he had Kandor in his possession, these improvisations were supplemented by the products of the professional tailors and lenscrafters available in the bottle city.  

== Personality and character ==
Originally, Superman's personality could be rough and destructive.  In one early story in which the government would not help  maintain low income areas unless a disaster occurred, Superman went on a rampage and created one.  As superhero stories became more oriented toward young readers, the writers moved toward his better known, "[[boy scout]]" persona. 

Despite the emphasis on Superman having powers "far beyond those of mortal men," his name referred also to his goodness.  While Jor-El sent Kal-El to Earth because he was convinced the human race had the capacity to be great and good if they wished to be, it is clear that Kal-El ''chose'' to become Superman and a force for good.

Superman has been willing to lay down his life or sacrifice his powers for good.  He rescues cats from trees and participates in community fund-raisers. He often acts behind the scenes and lets others receive the credit.  His modesty and humility catch his foes and critics off-guard, as they do not understand why he spends his life helping others and doing good.

Recent writers have attempted to deepen Superman's persona and provide a rationale for his goodness.  They reveal his self-doubts, and his fear that he might abuse his powers and become a monster, subject to no one.  He therefore makes it a point of submitting to authority, helping him to feel a restraint on his actions.  In an extraordinary show of trust and mutual respect, Superman has given Batman a ring of green kryptonite, so that if he ever lost his reason, posing a danger to himself or to humans, Batman could use the ring to defeat him.

In addition to getting rapid access to breaking news, a further motivation for Superman's becoming a reporter is that his physical abilities give him no unfair advantage in a field where the critical skills are intellectual in nature (although he is known for being a fast typist).  He has also written fiction in his spare time, including one published book, ''Under a Yellow Sun''.

Superman's lily-white persona has been mocked, ridiculed, and spoofed, especially in recent comic book history, when "grim and gritty" comics dominated the market. Superman may seem old-fashioned and even quaint compared to the "dark avengers" who command the lion's share of the market, but his appeal lives on, and he continues to be a driving force in the medium after more than sixty years.

== History ==
[[Image:superman14.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Superman #14'', dated January-February 1942.  Art by Fred Ray.]]
Superman was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] not as a hero, but as a villain.  Their short story "The Reign Of The Superman" concerned a bald-headed villain bent on dominating the world.  The story did not sell, forcing the two to reposition their character on the right side of the law.  In 1935, their Superman story was again rejected, but DC Comics printed another of their creations, Dr. Occult, who made his first appearance in ''New Fun Comics'' #6, October 1935.

The revised Superman first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1,  [[June]] [[1938]].  Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company for $130. DC copied the character without remuneration to the creators, while suing other companies for copying it. The ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' reported in 1941 that the pair was being paid $75,000 each per year, still a fraction of DC's Superman profits.  In 1946, when Siegel and Shuster sued for more money, DC fired them, prompting a legal battle that ended in 1948, when they accepted $200,000 and signed away any further claim to Superman or any character created from him.  DC soon took Siegel's and Shuster's names off the byline.

During a multimedia career spanning over sixty years, Superman has starred in every imaginable situation, throughout the universe, and in many eras of history. Facing a myriad of perils, his powers have increased to the point that he is nearly omnipotent. This poses a challenge for writers: "How does one write about a character who is nearly as powerful as [[God]]?" (Superman's Kryptonian name, Kal-El, resembles the Hebrew words for "all that God is") This problem contributed to a decline in Superman's popularity, especially during the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]], when [[Marvel Comics]] brought a new level of character development to mainstream comic books.  By the early [[1980s]], DC Comics had decided that a major change was needed to make Superman more appealing to current audiences.  Writer-artist [[John Byrne]] ''re-created'' Superman and re-started the series.  This [[1986]] [[retcon]] brought substantial changes to the character and met with varying success. Nevertheless, the re-launch of ''Superman'' comic books returned the character to the mainstream, again in the forefront of DC's titles.

Fans debate whether the more drastic changes were necessary. Two alterations have had long-term effects.  In the epic ''[[The Death of Superman]]'' storyline, the hero apparently died at the hands of supervillain [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. He returned from the dead to defeat Doomsday, though his "death" gave rise to a number of new characters and storylines. In [[1995]], Superman (or rather, Clark Kent) finally married [[Lois Lane]], and the two have had a happy marriage ... so far. Future editorial changes to the series may reverse some or all of these changes.

In 2003, DC Comics released a 12-issue maxiseries titled ''Superman: Birthright'', written by [[Mark Waid]] and penciled by Lenil Francis Yu; this was made into a retcon of Superman's origin, due to ''Superman #200''.

== Other characters ==
Familiar characters in Superman include friends and coworkers like: 

*''[[Lois Lane]]'': Superman's love interest, who is often portrayed as indifferent to Clark, but in love with Superman.  Actresses portraying Lois have included [[Noel Neill]], [[Phyllis Coats]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Teri Hatcher]], and [[Erica Durance]].
*''[[Jimmy Olsen]]'': Daily Planet photographer who often works with Lois and Clark, and has become a good friend to both.
*''[[Perry White]]'': Editor of the Daily Planet.
*''[[Lana Lang]]'': Television reporter who grew up in Smallville and shares Lois Lane's sometime obsession with trying to expose Clark Kent as Superman.
*''[[Pete Ross]]'': Clark Kent's childhood friend from Smallville; in Post-Crisis continuity, he  married Lana Lang, with whom he had a son named Clark. They later divorced.
*''[[Chloe Sullivan]]'': Clark's friend and Lois Lane's cousin in the ''[[Smallville (television series)|Smallville]]'' television series. She shares Lois' passion for journalism (she runs a high school newspaper called the Torch), as well as her romantic interest in Clark.  

He also has a [[rogues gallery]] of [[supervillain]] enemies, including:

*''[[Lex Luthor]]'': Pre-Crisis, arch-villain Lex Luthor was a friend of Clark from Smallville who becomes a [[mad scientist|criminal scientist]] with an all-consuming vendetta against Superman. Post-Crisis, the two met as adults (converted back with ''Birthright''), with Luthor the corrupt head of a mega corporation.  He was later elected [[President of the United States]]; he was removed from this position when his evil nature became apparent.
*''[[Darkseid]]'': A cruel and merciless alien who rules the planet [[Apokolips]] and only deals with Superman when it benefits his own agenda. 
*''[[Bizarro]]'': A grotesquely flawed duplicate of Superman who clumsily tries to emulate the original and causes a great deal of damage in the process.
*''[[Metallo]]'': A criminal [[cyborg]] who prefers using kryptonite as a power source, which makes him a deadly threat to Superman.
*''[[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]'': An extra-dimensional being with magical powers who delights in tormenting Superman and will only leave when Superman fulfills a challenge, usually making Mxy say his name backwards.
*''[[Brainiac_(comics)|Brainiac]]'': The pre-Crisis version is an alien [[android]] bent on conquest and Superman's death.  The post-Crisis version is an alien entity who is an organic being, later mechanical, with similar ambitions.
*''[[Phantom Zone]] Prisoners'': Pre-Crisis, these prisoners are kryptonian criminals who hate Superman, as the son of their prison's creator, and become extremely destructive when they  escape into Earth's yellow sun environment. Their leader is [[General Zod]].
*''[[Parasite_(comics)|Parasite]]'': A superpowered man who can absorb the powers, strength, and memories of any organic being, and wants Superman's power for himself.
*''[[Intergang]]'': A nationwide [[organized crime]] syndicate armed with weapons supplied in part by the extraterrestrial supervillain Darkseid.
*''[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]'': A mindless, impossibly powerful, raging monster that "killed" Superman during ''The Death of Superman'' storyline.
*''[[Imperiex]]'': An all-powerful force of nature whose purpose is destroying galaxies. Eventually, Superman, Steel, and Darkseid stop Imperiex by using Doomsday as an ally, and using a powerful weapon called the Entropy Aegis.

In Metropolis, Superman enjoys a close relationship with the Police Department. This especially applies to the Special Crimes Unit (SCU), a police unit that deals with superpowered threats, led by Captain [[Maggie Sawyer|Margaret Sawyer]], with Dan "Terrible" Turpin as her second-in-command.

There have been a number of characters called [[Superboy]]. The original Superboy, introduced in [[1944]], represented "the adventures of Superman when he was a boy."  This Superboy is no longer in publication, as it is now deemed that Clark Kent did not become a superhero until adulthood. A new Superboy character who is a [[clone]] of Superman was created in the early [[1990s]]; adventures featuring this character continue to be published.

Superman has a cousin from Krypton, [[Supergirl]].  Though she is killed in the comic book series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Supergirl was re-introduced in the retcon, but her history is confusing and convoluted. One such ''Supergirl'' called herself Cir-El, and believed herself to be the daughter of Superman and Lois Lane.

Originally Superman's human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, died when he reaches adulthood; the current version has them alive and well and regularly visited by Clark, who relies on them for advice in difficult times.

Superman has a pet dog, [[Krypto]], who has powers and abilities like his master's. In the original, Krypto is Kal-El's pet on Krypton who is accidentally sent to Earth in a test run for Kal-El's trip. Krypto has all the physical abilities of a Kryptonian in a yellow sun environment, as well as the intelligence of a human child. John Byrne's post-Crisis reboot first eliminated Krypto, but he was re-introduced after he followed Superman home from a false Krypton built as a trap by Brainiac 13.  This Krypto has normal canine intelligence.  This makes him too dangerous to keep outside the Fortress of Solitude without close supervision by a keeper like Superman.

== Cultural influences ==
[[Image:Stamp-ctc-superman.jpg|thumb|USPS stamp honoring Superman's first appearance]]
Both Superman's name and the premise of his character owe a debt to the concept of the [[Übermensch]], developed by the [[19th century]] philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and elaborated upon by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Additionally, Superman is believed to have been inspired in part by [[Philip Wylie]]'s 1930 [[science fiction]] novel ''Gladiator'', about a man whose superhuman strength inspires him to help the human race, but who is instead spurned by humanity precisely because of his power.  Other sources cited as inspirations include [[Doc Savage]] and [[The Shadow]].  Superman is a staple of American [[pop culture]].

DC Comics has [[copyright|copyrighted]] variations on the "super" theme, such as "superdog" and "supergal", to circumvent parody or product confusion.  Nevertheless, a great many imitations and parodies of Superman have appeared over the years.  One of the first Superman imitations, Fawcett Comics' [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], sparked legal action because of its similarities to Superman.  Well-known spoofs of Superman include [[Mighty Mouse]], [[Underdog]], and [[Super Goof]].

In the [[1990s]], comic book artist and writer [[Rob Liefeld]] created a Superman [[pastiche]] and starred him in his own comic book series, ''[[Supreme]].'' The series, published by Liefeld's [[Awesome Comics]], sold moderately well at first, but sales dwindled until the series was taken over with issue #41 by writer [[Alan Moore]]. Moore produced 22 issues of ''Supreme'' that paid homage to the classic "Silver Age" Superman.

One of the few Superman-like characters that DC comics allowed to stand without litigation is [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], from [[Marvel Comics]]'s superhero team, [[Squadron Supreme]]. The Squadron Supreme was created to do unofficial JLA/Avengers crossovers; the "new"  characters were thinly veiled versions of their DC JLA counterparts. Hyperion stood in for Superman, the Whizzer for The Flash, etc.  DC in turn introduced the "Assemblers of Angar", a thinly-veiled Avengers pastiche.  Hyperion has  been revamped in a new Marvel series, [[Supreme Power]], giving a new take on the Superman mythology.  

In 2004, the government of [[Sweden]] refused to allow a child to be named Stålmannen, which means ''Superman'' (literally: The Man of Steel).[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3701802.stm]

==Superman in popular music==	 
Superman has long been a popular subject for music, inspiring songs by artists ranging from [[The Kinks]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] of one generation through [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], and [[Spin Doctors]] to current performers like [[Eminem]] and [[Three Doors Down]].
