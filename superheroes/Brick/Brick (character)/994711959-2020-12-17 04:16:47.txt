'''Brick''' ('''Daniel "Danny" Brickwell''') is a [[DC Comics]] villain and enemy of [[Green Arrow]]. Although his origin has not been revealed, Brick is a [[metahuman]] with a reddish, stony skin that grants him invulnerability and super-strength. His success as an underworld kingpin is due to his brilliant criminal mind rather than his superhuman powers.

Daniel Brickwell appeared as a recurring character on [[The CW]] show ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', played by [[Vinnie Jones]].

==Publication history==
Brick first appeared in ''Green Arrow'' vol. 3, #40 and was created by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]].

==Fictional character biography==
Green Arrow had previously rallied [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]'s police and gangsters to confront a demonic power that had cut off the city from the outside world. In the ensuing battle, many lives were lost and a power vacuum was created in Star City's underworld. Into this stepped '''Daniel "Brick" Brickwell.'''

Brick was originally a low level henchman/enforcer for various mobsters in Star City and also ran his own street gang. However, he had a brilliant criminal mind and higher aspirations to go with it. In the wake of the demonic attack on Star City, he began to expand his gang's criminal activities, particularly drug sales, into areas left vacant by other criminal organizations.

His major success was to unite the various street gangs of Star City under his leadership. These low level criminals were previously denied access to many lucrative areas by more "up-market" mafioso, but once united under the leadership of Brick they became an overnight crime syndicate with greater manpower and resources than the now greatly weakened traditional organized crime families.

As his criminal empire grew, he came to the attention of Star City's police department, Green Arrow, and the council of mafia/gang leaders who represented the various criminal families of Star City. Brick was invited to a meeting of this council and told that his new criminal enterprise would be allowed to continue in Star City, but only if the Mafia were given a cut; his alternative was death. Brick had the house leveled by a missile. His invulnerability left him the sole survivor of the blast and the unopposed ruler of Star City's underworld.

Next, he killed the [[mayor]] and [[district attorney]] of Star City, using a suicide bomber. When he was arrested for the crime, he revealed that he had kidnapped the new mayor's infant daughter (having bribed her security detail) and would kill her if he was not released immediately. Green Arrow was brought in to search for the child, but was unable to find her; Brick's release seemingly proved that he is above the law.

Though unable to take Brick into custody, Green Arrow challenged Brick to a duel over who owns Star City. Not being able to best Brick in a test of strength, he shot a glue arrow into Brick's mouth, blocking his throat and suffocating him. Rather than allowing him to die, Green Arrow saved Brick, warning him that should he step too far out of line, next time he will die. Since this incident, his interference with law enforcement and the political figures of Star City has either ceased or vastly subsided.

Brick was responsible for hiring [[Deathstroke]] to blow up Green Arrow's first house as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Green Arrow'' vol. 3 #50 (July 2005)</ref>

In [[One Year Later]], after [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] and [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]] blew up most of Star City,<ref>''Green Arrow'' vol. 3 #60 (May 2006)</ref> Brick started fighting the crime that grew in the ruins of the ravaged city and the mutations that appeared in the "Glades"  However, it is later proved he is still the source of illegal activity in the Glades and that he is only fighting the crime that he does not approve of, particularly the drug killing his customers. He has recently teamed up with [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]].<ref>''Green Arrow'' vol. 3 #69 (February 2007)</ref>

Brick is later apparently killed by the obsessed [[Cupid (comics)|Cupid]], his dead body left as a "gift" for her beloved Green Arrow. Apparently surviving this experience, Brick relocates to San Francisco and is seen attempting to kidnap a young girl in order to extort money from her wealthy parents. Upon entering the child's bedroom at night, Brick is ambushed and knocked out by [[Teen Titan]] member [[Miss Martian]].<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #4 (December 2009)</ref>

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Brick is reintroduced as one of [[Richard Dragon]]'s group called the [[Longbow Hunters]], whose aim is to kill Green Arrow because of the $30 million bounty Dragon put out on him.<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #31. DC Comics.</ref>

Brick re-appears in Green Arrow comics following ''[[DC Rebirth]]''. He is a [[mercenary]] and member of the "Ninth Circle", an international criminal organization and bank alongside such assassins like [[Eddie Fyers]], [[Shado (comics)|Shado]] and [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]].<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 6 #10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Brick's primary power is his invulnerability. He is able to easily withstand a surface-to-air missile strike and numerous attacks from Green Arrow. He also has an unproven level of super-strength: he clearly outmatched Green Arrow, but he did not or could not win with a single hit. Brick is also a highly effective criminal leader. He was able to gain control of Star City's entire underworld, and has great influence over the legal authorities as well.

==In other media==
* Brick appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Khary Payton]]. In the beginning of the episode "Welcome to Happy Harbor", Brick's gun smuggling operation in the docks is thwarted by [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]]. He and his gang attack the hero, but are later defeated by him and the group ([[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], and [[Aqualad]]). In "Terrors", Brick was seen as an inmate at Belle Reve. He was part of [[Icicle Sr.]]'s plan to escape from Belle Reve. The breakout was interrupted by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] who defeated him and [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]]. In "Coldhearted", Brick was seen in Belle Reve's cafeteria serving cafeteria food to [[Count Vertigo]] while mocking him for his failure. In the ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'' episode "Private Security", Brick attempts to steal entire truckloads of virtual reality headsets only to be thwarted by Nightwing, Red Arrow, Arsenal and Guardian. In ''The Prize'', the audio play that is set between seasons 3 and 4, Brick has joined the [[Suicide Squad]].
* Brick appears in the "Green Arrow" segment of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].
* [[Vinnie Jones]] portrays Danny "Brick" Brickwell on [[The CW]] series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. His name was previously seen on Oliver's list in the first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/arrow-casts-vinnie-jones-villain-brick-danny-brickwell-1201334400/|title='Arrow' Casts Vinnie Jones as Comicbook Villain Brick (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Prudom|first=Laura|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref> Unlike the comics, he is portrayed as an English Caucasian man and is not a metahuman. He is a vicious gang leader that violates Starling City's government and plots to take over the Glades and is shown to be highly resilient to physical pain. His name, "Brick", is derived by the number of bullets he's taken and survived. He is also responsible for the death of [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Malcolm Merlyn]]'s wife, Rebecca, during an initiation of joining a criminal mob, the Orchid Bay Butchers, thus the cause for Malcolm's transformation into a ruthless villain and indirectly setting into motion the events of the series. In the show's third season, a trilogy of episodes where [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] is absent shows Brick taking control of the Glades, enforcing gang rule, but he was opposed by the Arrow's team, including [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]], [[Felicity Smoak]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] and the new addition [[Laurel Lance]], as the [[Black Canary]]. His gang rule was ended in an uprising led by Arsenal (Roy Harper) and the Black Canary, before Brick himself was ultimately defeated by Merlyn after he came close to killing him in retaliation for his wife's murder. Brick returns in Season 4 episode "Monument Point", where he joins [[H.I.V.E.]] after he escapes from [[Iron Heights]] with [[Damien Darhk]] and teamed up with [[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]] to take down Team Arrow, but was defeated and presumably arrested. In the episode "Inmate 4587," Brick is shown as an inmate at Slabside Maximum Security Prison. He and his fellow inmates [[Bronze Tiger]] and Derek Sampson take advantage of Oliver's incarceration. In the episode "The Longbow Hunters," Oliver cuts a deal with Brick to give him the identity of Ricardo Diaz's ally who put Brick up to attacking him. This deal involved Oliver framing an abusive prison guard for stabbing him. In the episode "Crossing Lines," Brick has Oliver Queen fight Derek Sampson in exchange for the person who had Derek and his fellow inmates attack him. After Oliver defeated Sampson and demanded that Brick honors his deal, he gets the answer out of Brick who states that an inmate in Slabside's Level 2 called the "[[Talia al Ghul|Demon]]" is working for Ricardo Diaz and that Brick just carried out the orders. This causes Oliver to do some events that got him transferred to Level 2 so that he can get close to the "Demon." He, Derek, and Bronze Tiger later witness Oliver be taken to Level 2. In the episode "The Slabside Redemption," Brick works with Ricardo Diaz when he takes over the prison and fights Oliver and Bronze Tiger. When trying to get out through the morgue, he is stabbed and killed by Stanley Dover, whom he previously antagonized for being seemingly timid and weak, only when dying to discover that Dover is actually dangerously sociopathic.
