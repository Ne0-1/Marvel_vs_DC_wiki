==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
[[Image:uxmen064.jpg|thumbnail|150px|left|Cover to ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #64. Art by Sal Buscema.]]
Shiro Yoshida was born to a mother who suffered [[radiation poisoning]] due to exposure to the [[atomic bomb]] dropped on [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. As a result, he was born in Agarashima, [[Japan]], a mutant possessing solar radiation powers.

Shiro's mother died of radiation poisoning when he was young and Shiro grew to hate the [[United States]], despite the influence of his father, an ambassador to the [[United Nations]] more tolerant of the US.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 62–63 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>  His greedy uncle Tomo inspired Shiro to take the identity of Sunfire and engage in a one-man battle against the U.S. As Sunfire, he attacked the [[United States Capitol]] and battled the X-Men. Later, he saw Tomo kill Shiro's father. Distraught, Sunfire killed Tomo and surrendered to the authorities.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #64</ref>

===Later life===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
In 1998, Marvel published a [[miniseries]] entitled ''[[Sunfire and Big Hero Six]]'' about Sunfire's brief membership in a new superhero team sanctioned by the Japanese government.

Sunfire's life became involved with the X-Men once again when [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] kidnapped Sunfire, as he was one of [[Apocalypse: The Twelve|the Twelve]], a group of unique mutants Apocalypse required to obtain the power to warp reality.

Later on, Sunfire became a member of [[X-Corporation]], a non-government organization devoted to the protection of mutant rights. Sunfire joined the Mumbai branch of X-Corp.

During the early story arcs of the latest edition of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', Sunfire attempted to combat the powerful villain known as [[Titannus]], a reject of the [[Super-Skrull]] program who had made his way to Earth after being brainwashed by an alien race to serve as their ultimate weapon. Attempting to contain Titannus, Sunfire summoned practically the entire Japanese army to confront him, but the powerful foe defeated Sunfire and the army with ease, and was only barely defeated by a new team that had been hastily assembled by [[Doctor Strange]] to combat this threat. 

===Rogue===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
[[Image:Sunld.png|Sunfire is critically injured in his battle with Lady Deathstrike. Art by Karl Moline.|thumb|150px|left]]
Later, it was revealed that Sunfire had worked with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] back when Sunfire was still working with Tomo and Rogue was a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Working with them was a girl called [[Blindspot]], who at the time was allied with the Brotherhood and who had the power to erase and restore memories. The four were on a mission to steal [[Lord Dark Wind]]'s (the father of [[Lady Deathstrike]]) [[adamantium]] bonding process. Mystique would later cut her ties with Blindspot, who she did not trust. Since she always erased her tracks once a contract ends, Blindspot wiped the minds of everyone who was involved so no one would remember her. 

Later, Blindspot discovered Lord Dark Wind wanted all four dead for trying to steal his adamantium process. Realizing how the others would be in danger, with no memory of the mission to steal Dark Wind's adamantium process, Blindspot went back to Japan to erase his memory of the ordeal. When she got there, she discovered that his daughter, who later became Deathstrike had already killed him. Blindspot was able to erase Deathstrike's memories as well.

Yet as Deathstrike was more machine than woman, she was able to restore her memories the same way one would a hard drive. Deathstrike kidnapped Blindspot, who released a photo of Sunfire, Rogue, and Mystique to attract their attention to save her. Though Mystique never came, Rogue joined Sunfire, whose reputation had been ruined by the photograph, in [[Tokyo]] to discover why they were framed and who was responsible. 
[[Image:Roguesunf.png|A weakened Sunfire, with Rogue and Blindspot. Art by Derec Donovan.|thumb]]
The two ran into Lady Deathstrike, who in a heated battle cut off Sunfire's legs, leaving him in critical condition. Rogue surrendered to Deathstrike, who imprisoned the two. There, Rogue met Blindspot, who restored Rogue's memories and explained to her what was going on. 

When Deathstrike discovered that the three were not actually responsible for stealing the adamantium, she went to kill them to destroy any evidence of what she had done. A weak Sunfire asked Rogue to absorb his powers so she could properly battle Deathstrike.  Rogue had previously lost the powers of [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]] that she had taken and was hesitant.  She worried that she would harm Sunfire, but Blindspot pushed her on Sunfire's face, causing her to absorb all his powers and possibly killing him. With it, Rogue now also contained Sunfire's personality, similar to how she also once had Danvers' personality within her. 

Sunfire's personality controlling her, Rogue went out to get revenge on Deathstrike, severely injuring the woman. The X-Men arrived in time to intervene, but Blindspot erased Rogue's memories of being an X-Man causing her to see her teammates as her enemies. After a brief altercation, Rogue's memories were restored and she told the X-Men what had happened to Sunfire. They went to where Rogue last saw Sunfire, but his body was missing, leading some of the X-Men to believe he was somehow still alive.

===Horseman of Apocalypse===
{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2009}}
[[Image:Sunfireapoc.PNG|125px|left|thumb|Sunfire as '''Famine''', one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s Horsemen. Art by [[Salvador Larroca]].]]
Sunfire lost his powers before [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and his X-Gene during that moment.

It is revealed that Sunfire had been rescued by a mysterious group of ninja, and taken to a hospital in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #182</ref>. After being revived from his coma, the world's leading specialist in [[prosthetic limb]]s, Masanori Kuzuya, offered him his services.  Before the reasoning behind the rescue could be revealed, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] appeared and offered Sunfire the chance for vengeance, as well as the recovery of his lost limbs and power, in return for his service as one of Apocalypse's new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]].  

Sunfire accepted, but after being chained away and locked in a prison while listening to the tortured screams of [[Gazer]] (another of the new Horsemen), Sunfire tried to escape. Unable to leave Gazer to his fate, Sunfire went back to free him. However, Gazer's transformation to the Horseman 'War' had already been completed and War attacked Sunfire. Captured again, Sunfire was transformed into the '''Horseman of Famine'''. When Apocalypse launched his attack on the X-Men, Sunfire caused an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. As he was fighting the X-Men, [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]] shot him down and Rogue, who recognized him, caught him as he fell. He was taken to the Medical Lab and [[Emma Frost]] entered his mind in an attempt to help him. When Apocalypse departed, he sent War to retrieve Famine, but Shiro broke free from Apocalypse's control and attacked War. 

Sunfire was last seen running off with the unconscious body of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], like him a former X-Men turned Horseman. At the temple where Sunfire first took Gambit, [[Mister Sinister]] told them, "I am glad you both feel able to move on from the past... for I am your future!".

===The Marauders===
{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2009}}
Sunfire is shown as a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] still in the form of Famine<ref>''[[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]]'' #vol. 2 200</ref>. Alongside Gambit, Sunfire attacks [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who destroys Providence. He subsequently attacks an escaping [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], but is taken down by Cannonball and is taken prisoner. Though Cannonball and Iceman consider interrogating Sunfire for information as to who he is working for, Cannonball decides against it, knowing that Sunfire would never confess. Instead, Iceman neutralizes Sunfire's artificial mutant abilities on a sub-atomic level using his own mutant abilities, while Cannonball fights him.

Sunfire is later held captive in the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] and is rescued by his fellow Marauders.

===Messiah Complex===
After being rescued by the Marauders, Sunfire joins fellow members [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Prism (comics)|Prism]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], [[Lady Mastermind]], and [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] when they travel to Cooperstown, Alaska to find the [[Hope Summers (comics)|baby]] but instead come across the [[Purifiers]] and they come to blows. He then participates in a battle alongside the Marauders and [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] against the X-Men.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The next time Sunfire is seen, he is with Gambit, [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]], and Malice at Eagle Plaza, Texas, taking on [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] for the Messiah baby. He is involved in the battle at [[Muir Island]] over the mutant baby's fate and is apparently knocked unconscious at some point, as it is revealed later that Bishop cauterized the wound of his severed arm by pressing it against Sunfire's unconscious but still flaming form.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

==Family==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
Shiro Yoshida (Sunfire) is the brother of Leyu Yoshida, alias the superheroine [[Sunpyre]], who shares his flame-based powers. He is also the cousin of Wolverine's late fiancée [[Mariko Yashida]] and her half-brother the [[Silver Samurai]].

Yashida and Yoshida seem to be different spellings of the same name. While in his first appearance Sunfire was called Shiro Yoshida, in the story arc that introduced his cousin, Mariko, his name was spelled Yashida and this version of the name was carried on in Mariko's next appearances.

==Powers and abilities==
Sunfire is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to absorb solar radiation, and convert it to ionize matter into a fiery [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state which bursts into flame when exposed to oxygen. He can release this energy though his hands as blasts of searing heat, deadly radiation, explosive concussive force, or simple flames. By ionizing the air around him, he can surround himself with an aura of heat intense enough to melt steel, or fly by focusing his aura downwards in a tight stream of ionized gas to propel him though the air like a rocket. Sunfire can see heat, by shifting his vision from visible light to [[infrared]].  Sunfire has the ability to form a psionic force field while using his plasma as protection from heat and radiation, both that of his own generation and that from outside sources.

Sunfire lost his powers to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] but after his transformation into Famine, a Horseman of Apocalypse, his powers were artificially returned through technological means, and he could now also use them to create flashes of light that affected the sections of the human brain which control hunger, causing any people who saw his light flashes to feel as if they were starving.

Shiro also seems to be quite an accomplished martial artist. He has displayed impressive hand to hand skills on several occasions and stated that he didn't need to employ his powers in order to defeat mere [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas. He is trained in karate and Japanese Samurai swordsmanship, and kendo. He is also an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers. He has at least peak human strength and endurance.

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
In ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Japan was destroyed by [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]], one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Shiro, a survivor of the massacre, was captured and given to [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] (the Horseman of Death), as a test subject for his experiments. Shiro's powers were pushed to their limits, causing his whole body to be set aflame, injuring him as a result. Shiro was rescued by the X-Men and joined them, taking on the codename Sunfire. Sunfire wore a containment suit to control his powers, although he was constantly on fire. Haunted by the destruction of his nation, Sunfire joined Rogue's task force of X-Men when they were sent to Chicago to fight Holocaust, who had begun a new series of Cullings.  The character design of the original Sunfire as Famine (see above) is virtually identical to the Age of Apocalypse incarnation of the character.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===''House of M''===
In ''[[House of M]]'', Sunfire became the Emperor of Japan. Under his rule, the country had prospered, though the poverty levels were extremely high among the baseline human population. In secret, Sunfire was one of the masterminds of Project: Genesis, a project sanctioned by the Japan branch of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with the goal of forcefully mutating baseline humans. When the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives-in-training dubbed the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] investigated a terrorist attack, they discovered the existence of Project: Genesis and its link to Emperor Sunfire. Sunfire lied to the Hellions and told them that Project: Genesis's purpose was to recycle organic waste into food for poor baseline humans.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===''Marvel Zombies''===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', a zombie version of Sunfire and [[Silver Samurai]] can be briefly seen slaughtering civilians, while the [[Silver Surfer]] travels the globe.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===''Ultimate Sunfire''===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #94, Sunfire appears as a member of [[Alpha Flight]]. His power levels enhanced by Banshee, the Ultimate version of the Mutant Growth Hormone, he squares off against new X-Man recruit [[Firestar]].
