'''Sunfire''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a temperamental, arrogant [[mutant]] who has been associated with the [[X-Men]].  He first appeared in ''X-Men'' volume 1 #64, and he joined the X-Men in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1975]]).

Sunfire (real name Shiro Yashida) was born to a mother who lived near [[Hiroshima, Hiroshima|Hiroshima]], [[Japan]] and was mildly irradiated when the [[United States]] dropped the [[atomic bomb]] on the city.  As a result, he was born a mutant, able to generate superheated [[plasma]].  He can also heat the air surrounding himself and control that air, allowing him to fly.  His sister, Leyu, possesses identical powers.

Shiro and Leyu's mother died of [[radiation poisoning]] when they were young, and as a result Shiro grew to hate Americans despite the influence of their US-friendly father, a diplomat.  Manipulated by his greedy uncle Tomo, Shiro attacked the [[United States Capitol]] and came into conflict with the X-Men, only to witness Tomo shooting his father in the back.  Distraught, he killed Tomo and gave himself up; the X-Men, realizing that Shiro had been used, let him return home.

Months later, [[Professor X]] recruited Shiro to join a new team of X-Men when the originals were kidnapped by Krakoa, the Living Island.  Shiro accompanied the fledgling X-Men on this mission, but resigned from the team afterwards.

Shiro fought alongside the X-Men several times over the years, although on a few occasions his temper and arrogance has led him to conflicts with other heroes, such as the [[Iron Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].

Sunfire is the cousin of Wolverine's late fianc√©e [[Mariko Yashida]] and her brother the [[Silver Samurai]].  Sunfire's sister Leyu joined the X-Men for a mission under the name of [[Sunpyre]].

In the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]] comics, the Sunfire from another timeline isn't Shiro, but a young Mariko Yashida. She replaced [[Magnus (comics)|Magnus]] on the team, when he died (''Exiles'' #2). When Sunfire got killed (''Exiles'' #37), their new teammate was [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], once again.
