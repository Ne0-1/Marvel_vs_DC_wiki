'''Hyathis''' (also known as '''Hyanthis''') is a [[fictional]] [[extraterrestial]] [[monarch]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' vol. 1 #3 (February 1961), and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]].

==Fictional character biography==
Hyathis is the ''Panala'' (Queen) of Alstair in the [[Antares]] solar system, Alstair shares the solar system with four other planets: '''Dhor''', '''Llarr''', and '''Mosteel''' which is farthest from Antares. Hyathis appears to be a ''Plant Elemental'' with empathic control over all plant life on Alstair. Alstairans are all plant/humanoid hybrids because they diverged from the common [[protozoa]]n evolutionary branch linking [[Flora]] an [[Fauna]] much later on than life did on [[Earth]]. All [[plant]] based Alstairans receive part of their nourishment from sunlight and have broad [[leaf|leaves]] instead of hair. The [[mold]] based Alstairans appear to pass on the mold infection with a [[vampire|vampiric]] bite, they also prefer darkness and seem to have stringy hair.

Hyathis is continuously at war with the three other planetary monarchs in the [[Antares]] solar system. '''[[Kanjar Ro]]''' dictator of the planet ''Dhor'', '''Kromm''' the metal skinned ruler of the planet ''Mosteel'', and '''Sayyar''' the [[lizard]]-like [[emperor]] of ''Llarr''. A few years ago this four-way conflict was temporarily ended when Kanjar Ro abducted members of the [[Justice League of America]], and used his '''Gamma Gong''' to force them to defeat the rulers of Alstair, Mosteel and Llarr.

Hyathis was defeated and captured by the combined power of [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]]. Eventually, the entire Justice League was able to trick and defeat Kanjar Ro, and all four rulers were marooned on a small planet.<ref>As seen in Justice League of America vol. 1 #3</ref> Later Hyathis' loyal Alstairan followers rescued her from the prison world, and took her to the planet [[Thanagar]]. Hyathis adapted Alstairan medicine to provide a workable cure for a deadly plague sweeping the planet. She required that the Thanagarians appoint her ''Empress of Thanagar'' before she would give them the cure. Hyathis transformed the Thanagarian people into a warlike race. This led the Thanagarian Empire to attempt conquest of the planet [[Rann|Rannagar]]. [[Hawkman]] was able put an end to the conflict. With the help of [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], Hawkman was also successful in deposing Hyathis.<ref>As seen in World's Finest Comics #272, 273</ref> Aggressive Thanagarian factions later freed Hyathis, and then launched a shadow war against [[Earth]]. Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]] were successful in halting these factions, but Hyathis escaped.<ref>As seen in World's Finest Comics #278</ref> 

Hyathis later attempted to overthrow the government of Rann by using her telepathy to turn an alien race called the ''Zaredians'' against the interplanetary law enforcers known as the [[Darkstars]]. The Zaredian attack created a diversion which allowed Hyathis to kidnap Aleea Strange, daughter of [[Adam Strange]]. Her plans where upset by the arrival of [[Superboy]] and the Ravers.<ref>As seen in Superboy and the Ravers #3, 4</ref>

===Current status===
Alstair now appears to be a jungle planet whose architecture is influenced by [[Aztec]] design. Hyathis recently met [[Zauriel]] agent of the [[Presence (comics)|Presence]] when the mystical [[Doctor Fate|Helmet of Fate]] landed on Alstair and was discovered by '''Okeontis''' (the "Demon in the Mold"). Okeontis represented a group mind that evolved from sentient mold on Alstair, and she used the Helmet of Fate to infect the populace with the "mold-mind".<ref>As seen in ''Helmet of Fate: Zauriel'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*Hyathis is a plant elemental from the planet Alstair. The people of Alstair are all hybrid plant humanoids but she has a closer connection to the Green. She can command any plant on Alstair to obey her will.
*She is able to breathe underwater.
*Hyathis is a powerful [[telepath]] and often uses this power to steal the advanced technical knowledge of other alien races.

==Other versions==
*Hyathis appeared in the May 2000 [[Creature Commandos]] maxi-series by [[Tim Truman]]. Here, she was slain by Tazzala of Korrl, a woman who called herself the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]]. While the Creature Commandos series was said to take place within main DC Universe continuity, Hyathis appeared alive in later comics; thus, the Creature Commandos version may be regarded as an alternate version. Alternate versions of Kanjar Ro, Kromm and Sayyar also appear in this series.
*Shayera Thal's ([[Hawkwoman]]) maternal grandmother and Thal Porvis' ex-wife was named ''Hyanthis''. Her only appearance was in [[Hawkworld]] vol. 2 #10. Apart from the name, she has no relation to Hyathis.
