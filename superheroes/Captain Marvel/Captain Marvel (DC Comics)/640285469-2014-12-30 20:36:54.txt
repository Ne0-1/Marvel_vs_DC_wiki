'''Shazam''', also known as '''Captain Marvel''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]], and in a number of television and video game adaptations. The character was created in 1939 by artist [[C. C. Beck]] and writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]], and first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 (February 1940), published by [[Fawcett Comics]].

Shazam is the alter ego of '''Billy Batson''', a boy who, by speaking the magic word "Shazam", can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength, speed, flight, and other abilities.  His name is an acronym of the six figures from whom his magical powers derive: [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]],  [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]].

Based on book sales, the character, then known as Captain Marvel, was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even [[Superman]],<ref name="TiptonMoviePoopShoot">{{cite web | last=Tipton | first=Scott | title=The World's Mightiest Mortal | work=Comics 101 | date=April 1, 2003 | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=I've always felt that it was this origin story and concept that made Captain Marvel instantly popular, to the point that it was outselling every comic on the stands for several years throughout the '40s.}}</ref><ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum">{{cite web | title=Comic Book Success Stories | work=The Museum of Comic Book Advertising | url=http://comicbookads.leafpublishing.com/hall-of-covers/cover-display2-page2.htm | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=By the middle of the decade, Captain Marvel had received a self-titled comic book, ''Captain Marvel's Adventures'' [sic],<!--the proper name of the publication is "Captain Marvel Adventures"--> which had a circulation that reached 1.3 million copies per month.

Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, partly because of a [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|copyright infringement suit from DC Comics]], alleging that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman.<ref name="settlement" /> In 1972, DC licensed the Marvel Family characters from Fawcett and returned them to publication, acquiring all rights to the characters by 1991.  DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their [[DC Universe]], and have attempted to revive the property several times with mixed success.

==Publication history==
<!--in-universe plot information needs moving into a Fictional biography section-->

===Development and inspirations===
[[Image:Whiz2.JPG|thumb|left|''Whiz Comics'' #2 (Feb. 1940), the first appearance of Captain Marvel. Cover art by [[C. C. Beck]].]]
After the success of [[DC Comics|National Comics]]' new superhero characters [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], [[Fawcett Publications]] started its own comics division in 1939, recruiting writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled ''Flash Comics''.  Besides penning stories featuring [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Lance O'Casey]], [[Scoop Smith]], and [[Dan Dare (Fawcett Comics)|Dan Dare]] for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure.

Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers.  Parker responded by creating a character he called "Captain Thunder".<ref name="JohnnyShazam">{{cite web | last=Hembeck | first=Fred | title=Johnny Thunder and Shazam! | work=The Hembeck Files | date=June 18, 2003 | url=http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/shazam2.html | accessdate=2005-06-22}}</ref> Staff artist [[C. C. Beck|Charles Clarence "C. C." Beck]] was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat [[cartoon]]y style that became his trademark.  "When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett’s first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were," Beck told an interviewer.  "We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times".<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/an-interview-with-c-c-beck/ "An Interview with C.C. Beck," ''Hogan's Alley'' #3, 1995]</ref>

The first issue of the comic book, printed as both ''Flash Comics'' #1 and ''Thrill Comics'' #1, had a low-print run in the fall of 1939 as an [[ashcan copy]] created for advertising and [[trademark]] purposes.  Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark "Captain Thunder," "Flash Comics," or "Thrill Comics," because all three names were already in use.  Consequently, the book was renamed ''Whiz Comics'', and Fawcett artist [[Pete Costanza]] suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to "Captain Marvelous," which the editors shortened to "Captain Marvel".  The [[Speech balloon|word balloon]]s in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as "Captain Marvel". ''Whiz Comics'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939.

====Inspiration====
Inspiration for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources.  His visual appearance was modeled after that of [[Fred MacMurray]], a popular American actor of the period,<ref name=FC1>{{cite book|last=Beck|first=C. C.|title=Fawcett Companion: The Best of FCA (Fawcett Collectors of America)|year=2001|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|location=Raleigh, NC|isbn=978-1-893905-10-8|pages=28–29|url=http://www.marvelfamily.com/faq/mfinspiration.aspx}}</ref> though comparisons to both [[Cary Grant]] and [[Jack Oakie]] were made, as well.<ref name=MarFam>{{cite web|title=Marvel Family Inspiration|url=http://www.marvelfamily.com/faq/mfinspiration.aspx|publisher=MarvelFamily.com|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> Fawcett Publications' founder, Wilford H. Fawcett, was nicknamed "Captain Billy," which inspired the name "Billy Batson" and Marvel's title, as well.<ref name=LN>{{cite web|title=Captain Marvel Earth's Mightiest Mortal|url=http://loknar54.com/JLA-CaptainMarvel.html|work=JLA|publisher=Loknar54.com|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> Fawcett's earliest magazine was titled ''[[Fawcett Publications|Captain Billy's Whiz Bang]]'', which inspired the title ''Whiz Comics''.<ref name=MF2>{{cite web|title=Shazam Fun Facts|url=http://www.marvelfamily.com/FunFacts/funfact.aspx?FFID=8|work=Fun Facts|publisher=MarvelFamily.com|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> In addition, Fawcett took several of the elements that had made Superman the first popular comic book superhero (super-strength and speed, science-fiction stories, a mild-mannered reporter alter ego) and incorporated them into Captain Marvel.  Fawcett's circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff, "Give me a Superman, only have his other identity be a 10- or 12-year-old boy rather than a man".<ref name="likeSupes">{{Cite book | editor-last=Hamerlinck | editor-first=P.C. | title=Fawcett Companion | publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | year=2001 | isbn=1-893905-10-1}}</ref>

====Alter ego====
[[Image:Whiz-comics-22-capt-marvel.jpg|right|thumb|''Whiz Comics'' #22 (Oct. 1941), featuring Captain Marvel and his young alter-ego, Billy Batson. Art by C.C. Beck.]]
As a result, Captain Marvel was given a 12-year-old boy named Billy Batson as his alter ego.  In the story of his origin printed in ''Whiz Comics'' #2, Billy, a homeless newsboy, is led by a mysterious stranger to a secret subway tunnel.  An odd subway car with no visible driver takes them to an underground tunnel with seven statues depicting the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man (Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness and Injustice): the lair of the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]].  The wizard shows that he has observed the hardship of Billy's life, and grants him the power to become the adult superhero Captain Marvel, just before a stone suspended above Shazam's head crushes him.  His ghost says he will give advice when a [[brazier]] is lighted.

In order to transform into Captain Marvel, Billy must speak the wizard's name, an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for the six legendary figures who agreed to grant aspects of themselves to a willing subject: the wisdom of [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], the strength of [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], the stamina of [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], the power of [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], the courage of [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]], and the speed of [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]].  Speaking the word produces a bolt of magic lightning which transforms Billy into Captain Marvel.  Speaking the word again reverses the transformation with another bolt of lightning.

Captain Marvel wore a bright red costume with gold trim and a yellow lightning bolt insignia on the chest.  The body suit originally included a partial [[Bib (garment)|bib]] front, but was changed to a one-piece skintight suit within a year (he partial bib would be restored to Captain Marvel's costume much later in the character's history, in 1994).  The costume also included a white-collared [[cape]] trimmed with gold flower symbols, usually asymmetrically thrown over the left shoulder and held around his neck by a gold cord. The cape was inspired by the ceremonial cape worn by the [[British nobility]],<ref name=DBB>{{cite web|title=PART ONE: The Captain and the Kid!|url=http://dialbforblog.com/archives/85/|work=blog archive|publisher=DialBforBlog.com|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> photographs of which appeared in newspapers in the 1930s.

====Introduction====
In addition to introducing the main character and his alter ego, Captain Marvel's first adventure in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil [[Doctor Sivana]], and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter.  Captain Marvel was an instant success, with ''Whiz Comics'' #2 selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum"/> By 1941, he had his own solo series, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', while he continued to appear in ''Whiz Comics'', as well as periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including ''Master Comics''.

===Fawcett years: The Marvel enemies, family, and allies===
Through his adventures, Captain Marvel soon gained a host of enemies.  His most frequent foe was [[Doctor Sivana]], a [[mad scientist]] who was determined to rule the world, yet was thwarted by Captain Marvel at every turn.  He had two non-evil children, the beautiful Beautia, who loved Captain Marvel, and the superstrong Magnificus.  Sivana's evil children, Georgia and Sivana, Jr., who were later introduced to the comics, resembled their father both physically and mentally.

Marvel's other villains included [[Adolf Hitler]]'s champion [[Captain Nazi]], and older Egyptian renegade Marvel named [[Black Adam]] (whose sole Golden Age appearance was in ''Marvel Family'' #1), an evil magic-powered brute named [[Ibac]], who gained powers from historical villains, and an artificially intelligent [[Nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] [[robot]] called [[Mister Atom]].

The most notorious Captain Marvel villains, however, were the nefarious [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] and his Monster Society of Evil, which recruited several of Marvel's previous adversaries.  The "Monster Society of Evil" story arc ran as a 25-chapter serial in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #22–46 (March 1943 – May 1945), with Mister Mind eventually revealed to be a highly intelligent, yet tiny, [[worm]] from another planet.

The Monster Society was the first criminal group in comics with members from past stories.  Among the group's members were Sivana, Ibac, and Captain Nazi, along with new foes including Herkimer the [[crocodile]] man and a multi-headed [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]].  Even Hitler, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Hideki Tōjō|Tojo]] were members, along with other Nazis. The Society tried many plans, such as trying to use Captain Nazi to steal magic fortune-telling pearls, using a film to intimidate the world, and even trying to use a giant cannon to blow holes in countries.  Mr. Mind was eventually executed in the electric chair for 186,744 murders at the end of the arc, but would be reintroduced decades later in DC Comics' ''Shazam!'' #2.

====Marvel Family====
In the early 1940s, Captain Marvel gained allies in the Marvel Family, a collective of superheroes with powers and/or costumes similar to Captain Marvel's.  (By comparison, Superman spin-off character [[Supergirl]] first appeared in 1959).  ''Whiz Comics'' #21 (September 1941) marked the debut of the [[Lieutenant Marvels]], the alter egos of three other boys (all also named Billy Batson) who found that, by saying "Shazam!" in unison, they, too, could become Marvels.

In ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (December 1941), a friend of Captain Marvel's named Freddy Freeman, mortally wounded by an attack from Captain Nazi, was given the power to become teenage boy superhero [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Captain Marvel, Jr.]], with a distinctive gold-on-blue version of the Marvel costume.  A year later in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 (December 1942), Billy and Freddy met Billy's long-lost twin sister Mary Bromfield, who discovered she could, by saying the magic word "Shazam," become the teenaged superheroine [[Mary Marvel]], who originally derived her powers from her own pantheon of female goddesses and benefactors rather than the figures who empowered Billy.

"Fat" Marvel, [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]], Lt. "Tall" Marvel, Lt. "Hillbilly" Marvel, and [[Mary Marvel]].  [[Uncle Marvel]] is seated at the piano in the background.]]
Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel, Jr., were featured as a team in a new comic series entitled ''The Marvel Family'', published alongside the other Captain Marvel-related titles, which now included ''Wow Comics'' featuring Mary, ''Master Comics'' featuring Junior, and both ''Mary Marvel Comics'' and ''Captain Marvel Jr. Comics''.  Non-super-powered Marvels—such as the "lovable [[Confidence trick|con artist]]" [[Uncle Marvel]] and his niece, Freckles Marvel—also sometimes joined the other Marvels on their adventures.  A [[funny animal]] spin-off, [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]], was created in 1942 for ''Fawcett's Funny Animals'' comics, and was later given a series of his own.

====Allies====
As with other superheroes, Captain Marvel had a number of non-powered friends and associates, as well, including Mr. Morris, Billy's employer at WHIZ radio; Joan Jameson, Billy's secretary (and one of the few people to know his secret identity); Beautia Sivana, Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult daughter, who had a crush on Captain Marvel and only periodically joined forces with her father (and usually by force); and Dexter Knox, an intelligent young scientist who lived in Billy's boarding house.  The most prolific of Captain Marvel's supporting characters at Fawcett was Mister [[Tawky Tawny]], an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tiger who had been fed a serum that allowed him to learn to speak and stand upright.<ref name="The Return of Mr.Tawny, SHAZAM: FROM THE FORTIES TO THE SEVENTIES,Harmony Books, 1977">''Shazam! From the Forties to the Seventies'' (1977, [[Harmony Books]], ISBN 0-517-53127-5).</ref>

The members of the Marvel Family often teamed up with the other Fawcett superheroes, including Ibis the Invincible, [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl]], Spy Smasher, [[Minute-Man]], and [[Mr. Scarlet]] and Pinky.  Among the many artists and writers who worked on the Marvel Family stories alongside C. C. Beck and main writer [[Otto Binder]] were [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], [[Mac Raboy]], Pete Costanza, [[Kurt Schaffenberger]], and [[Marc Swayze]].

===Copyright infringement lawsuit and cancellation===
{{See also|National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications}}
Through much of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium with his comics outselling all others, including those featuring Superman. In fact, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' sold fourteen million copies in 1944,<ref name="ComicBooksinLibraries">{{Cite news | last=Lavinie | first=Michael L. | title=Comic Books and Graphic Novels for Libraries: What to Buy | newspaper=Serials Review | volume=2 | issue=24 | page=34 | date=Summer 1998 | url=http://www.ugr.es/~alozano/Translations/ComicBooksinLibraries.pdf | format=PDF | quote=In 1944, the best-selling comic book title (''Captain Marvel Adventures'') sold more than fourteen million copies for the year.}}</ref> and was at one point being published bi-weekly with a circulation of 1.3 million copies an issue (proclaimed on the cover of issue #19 as being the "Largest Circulation of Any Comic Magazine").<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum"/> Part of the reason for this popularity included the inherent wish-fulfillment appeal of the character to children, as well as the [[humor]]ous and [[surrealism|surreal]] quality of the stories. Billy Batson typically narrated each Captain Marvel story, [[fourth wall|speaking directly to his reading audience]] from his WHIZ radio microphone, relating each story from the perspective of a young boy.

Detective Comics (later known as National Comics Publications, National Periodical Publications, and today known as [[DC Comics]]) sued both Fawcett Comics and Republic Pictures for [[copyright infringement]] in 1941, alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman.<ref name="NationalFawcettLawsuit">{{cite web | url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/191/594/91314/ | title=191 F.2d 594: National Comics Publications, Inc. v.

Although the judge presiding over the case decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement, DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their ''Superman'' daily [[Superman (comic strip)|newspaper strips]], and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss">{{Cite journal | last=Ingersoll | first=Bob | date=May 31, 1985 | title=The Law is a Ass (Installment #66) | journal=Comics Buyer's Guide | issue=602 | url=http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/law/back20001024.shtml | accessdate=June 19, 2005}} (Detailed summary of the cases and rulings related to ''National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publishing''.)</ref> As a result, the initial verdict, delivered in 1951, was decided in Fawcett's favor.

National appealed this decision, and Judge [[Learned Hand]] declared in 1952 that National's Superman copyright was in fact valid. Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement, but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements, and that the truth of this would have to be determined in a re-trial of the case. The judge therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss" />

Instead of retrying the case, however, Fawcett decided to settle with National out of court. The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regard to Captain Marvel. While ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' had been the top-selling comic series during World War II, it suffered declining sales every year after 1945 and by 1949 it was selling only half its wartime rate.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | year=2001 | title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | location=Baltimore | publisher=Johns Hopkins | isbn=0-8018-7450-5 | page=57}}</ref> Fawcett tried to revive the popularity of its assorted Captain Marvel series in the early 1950s by introducing elements of the horror comics trend that gained popularity at the time.<ref>Wright, p. 156.</ref>

''Whiz Comics'' had ended with issue #155 in June 1953, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' was canceled with #150 (November 1953), and ''The Marvel Family'' ended its run with #89 (January 1954).

===''Marvelman'' (and ''Miracleman'')===
{{Main|Marvelman}}
In the 1950s, a small British publisher, [[L. Miller and Son]], published a number of [[black-and-white]] reprints of American comic books, including the Captain Marvel series.  With the outcome of the ''National v. Fawcett'' lawsuit, L. Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off.  They requested the help of a British comic writer, [[Mick Anglo]], who created a thinly-disguised version of the superhero called [[Marvelman]].  Captain Marvel, Jr., was adapted to create Young Marvelman, while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman.  The magic word "Shazam!" was replaced with "Kimota" ("Atomik" spelled backwards).  The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's United Kingdom series with issue number #25.

Marvelman ceased publication in 1963, but was revived in 1982 by writer [[Alan Moore]] in the pages of ''Warrior Magazine''. Beginning in 1985, Moore's black-and-white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by [[Eclipse Comics]] under the new title ''[[Miracleman]]'' (as [[Marvel Comics]] objected to the use of "Marvel" in the title), and continued publication in the United States after ''Warrior'''s demise.  Within the [[Metatextuality|metatextual]] storyline of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Alan Moore and later ''Marvelman/Miracleman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]].  In 2009, Marvel Comics obtained the rights to the original 1950s ''Marvelman'' characters and stories.<ref name=CBR2>{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=CCI: Cup o' Joe – Marvelman at Marvel|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22203|work=Comic Books|publisher=ComicBookResources.com|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>

In 1966, [[M. F. Enterprises]] produced their own Captain Marvel: an [[Android (robot)|android]] superhero from another planet whose main characteristic was the ability to split his body into several parts, each of which could move on its own.  He triggered the separation by shouting "Split!" and reassembled himself by shouting "Xam!"  He had a young human ward named Billy Baxton.  This short-lived Captain Marvel was credited in the comic as being "based on a character created by [[Carl Burgos]]".<ref>{{comicbookdb|character|7827|Captain Marvel (M.F.)}}</ref>

===DC Comics revival: ''Shazam!''===
When superhero comics became popular again in the mid-1960s in what is now called the "[[Silver Age of Comic Books]]," Fawcett was unable to revive Captain Marvel, having agreed never to publish the character again (as part of settlement of the lawsuit).  [[Carmine Infantino]], publisher of DC Comics, licensed the characters from Fawcett in 1972, and DC began planning a revival.  Because Marvel Comics had by this time established ''Captain Marvel'' as a comic book trademark for [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|their own character]], DC was forced to publish their book under the name ''Shazam!''.<ref name="NRLostYearsPt3" />  Infantino attempted to give the ''Shazam!'' book the subtitle ''The Original Captain Marvel'', but a [[cease and desist]] letter from Marvel Comics forced them to change the subtitle to ''The World's Mightiest Mortal'' with ''Shazam!'' #15 (December 1974).<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1">{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/6771-an-oral-history-of-captain-marvel-the-shazam-years-pt-1.html | title=An Oral History of CAPTAIN MARVEL: The Shazam Years, pt. 1 | work=Newsarama | date=31 December 2010 | accessdate=14 September 2014 | author=Smith, Zack}}</ref> As all subsequent toys and other merchandise featuring the character was also required to use the "Shazam!" label with little to no mention of the name "Captain Marvel", the title has become so linked to Captain Marvel that many people took to identifying the character as "Shazam" instead of "Captain Marvel".<ref name="NameChange" />

The ''Shazam!'' comic series began with ''Shazam!'' #1, dated February 1973.  It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s.  The first story attempted to explain the Marvel Family's absence by stating that they, Dr. Sivana, Sivana's children, and most of the supporting cast had been accidentally trapped in [[suspended animation]] for 20 years when the Sivanas attempted to put the Marvels into suspended animation.  They finally broke free when the Suspendium globe moved towards the Sun.

[[Dennis O'Neil]] was the primary writer of the book.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 155 |quote = In 1972, DC acquired the rights to Captain Marvel and in 1973 they launched the series ''Shazam!'', which re-established the Captain Marvel mythos...Responsible for resurrecting the lightning-charged champion, writer Denny O'Neil and original artist C. C. Beck together explained Cap's absence.}}</ref> His role was later taken over by writers [[Elliot S. Maggin]] and [[E. Nelson Bridwell]].  [[C. C. Beck]] drew stories for the first 10 issues of the book before quitting due to creative differences.  [[Bob Oksner]] and Fawcett alumnus [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] were among the later artists of the title.

With DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] concept in effect during this time, the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of "Earth-S".  While the series began with a great deal of fanfare, the book had a lackluster reception.  The creators themselves had misgivings.  Beck said, "As an illustrator, I could, in the old days, make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings.  But I couldn't bring the new [Captain Marvel] stories to life no matter how hard I tried".<ref>{{Cite book | last=Benton | first=Mike | year=1989 | title=The Comic Book in America: An Illustrated History | location=Dallas | publisher=Taylor | isbn=0-87833-659-1 | page=77}}</ref>

''Shazam!'' was heavily [[Retroactive continuity|rewritten]] as of issue #34 (April 1978), with Bridwell providing more realistic stories, accompanied by similar art, the first issue by [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]] and [[Josef Rubinstein|Joe Rubinstein]], and thereafter by [[Don Newton]], a longtime fan of the character,<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Interview with Don Newton | journal=The Collector | issue=17 | first=Bill G. | last=Wilson | year=1969}}</ref> and Schaffenberger. Nevertheless, the next issue was the last one, though the feature was kept alive in a back-up position in the [[Dollar Comics]] formatted run of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (from #253, October/November 1978, to #282, August 1982, skipping only #271, which featured a full-length origin of the Superman-Batman team story). Schaffenberger left the feature after #259, and the inking credit subsequently varied.

When ''World's Finest Comics'' reverted to the standard 36 pages, leftover ''Shazam!'' material saw publication in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (#491–492, September–October 1982).  The remaining 11 issues of that run contained reprints, ''Shazam!'' represented by mostly Fawcett-era stories (left out of an all ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #500, and the final #503, where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs).  ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition (comics)|All-New Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (April 1978) featured a "Superman vs. Shazam!" story by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Dick Giordano]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Hamerlinck|first = P.C.|title = When Worlds Collide The Colossal-Sized Confrontation Between Superman and Captain Marvel|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 61|pages = 65–68|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = December 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/68932/ ''All-New Collectors' Edition'' #C-58] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> With their 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[limited series]], DC fully integrated the characters into the [[DC Universe]].  Prior to Crisis, the characters appeared a few times as guest stars in the [[Justice League of America]] series (vol. 1).

===Captain Marvel in the late 1980s===
The first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|post-Crisis]] appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries.  In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the [[Justice League]] in [[Keith Giffen]]'s and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]' relaunch of that title.  That same year (spinning-off from ''Legends''), he was given his own miniseries titled ''Shazam: The New Beginning''.  With this four-issue miniseries, writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy and]] [[Dann Thomas]], and artist Tom Mandrake, attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story.

The most notable change that Thomas, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain.  This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the Golden Age depiction, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.

This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology ''[[Action Comics Weekly]]'' #623–626 (October 25, 1988 – November 15, 1988).  At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new ''Shazam!'' ongoing series, which failed to materialize.

===''The Power of Shazam!''===
{{Main|The Power of Shazam!}}
DC finally purchased the rights to all of the Fawcett Comics characters in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 1994, because of the unpopular revision of the character from 1987's ''Shazam: The New Beginning'' miniseries, Captain Marvel was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] again and given a revised origin in ''The Power of Shazam!'', a painted [[graphic novel]] written and illustrated by [[Jerry Ordway]].  This story became Captain Marvel's official DC Universe origin story (with his appearances in ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' and ''Justice League'' still counting as part of this continuity).

Ordway's story more closely followed Captain Marvel's Fawcett origins, with only slight additions and changes.  For example, in this version of the origin, it is Black Adam (in his non-powered form of Theo Adam) who killed Billy Batson's parents, and the "mysterious stranger" who leads Billy to the subway tunnel with statues of the Sins, and the wizard Shazam is revealed to be the ghost of his father.  The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success, leading to a ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Dolan, p. 269: "Writer Jerry Ordway chronicled the further adventures of Billy Batson, the World's Mightiest Mortal, in the new ongoing effort ''The Power of Shazam!'', alongside artists Mike Manley and Peter Krause".</ref> That series reintroduced the Marvel Family and many of their allies and enemies into the modern-day DC Universe.

Marvel also appeared in [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]' critically acclaimed 1996 alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries.  Set 20 years in the future, ''Kingdom Come'' features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind-controlled pawn of an elderly [[Lex Luthor]].  Because he is one of the most powerful beings on Earth, his mere presence unnerves many of those around him and, brainwashed, he even sets out to cause what could lead to the end of the world.  However, Marvel ultimately sacrifices himself as an act of redemption and, as a figure of [[martyrdom]], becomes the symbol of a new world order.

In 2000, Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic novel, ''Shazam! Power of Hope'', written by [[Paul Dini]] and painted by [[Alex Ross]].

===Early-mid-2000s: ''JSA'', ''52'', and more===
Since the cancellation of the ''Power of Shazam!'' title in 1999, the Marvel Family has made appearances in a number of other DC comic books.  Black Adam became a main character in [[Geoff Johns]]' and [[David S. Goyer]]'s ''JSA'' series, which depicted the latest adventures of the [[Justice Society of America]].  Captain Marvel appeared regularly in ''JSA'' in 2003 and 2004, and appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the sequel to Miller's highly acclaimed graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''.  The ''[[Superman/Shazam: First Thunder]]'' mini-series, written by [[Judd Winick]] with art by [[Joshua Middleton|Josh Middleton]], and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post-''Crisis'' meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.

The Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, which began DC's efforts to retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise.  In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which preceded the ''Infinite Crisis'' event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the [[Rock of Eternity]], which is rebuilt by the Shadowpact, although he has trouble with the Sins imprisoned there when he hears their voices.  The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters and introduced Adam's "Black Marvel Family," consisting of Adam himself, his wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], her brother [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and Sobek.  The series chronicled Adam's attempts to reform after falling in love with Isis, only to launch the DC universe into [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] after she and Osiris are killed.  The Marvel Family appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series by [[Alex Ross]], [[Jim Krueger]], and Doug Braithwaite, published from 2005 to 2007.

===''The Trials of Shazam!''===
''The Trials of Shazam!'', a 12-issue maxi-series written by [[Judd Winick]] and illustrated by [[Howard Porter]] for the first eight issues, and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, was published from 2006 to 2008.  The series redefined the ''Shazam!'' property with a stronger focus on magic and mysticism.  ''Trials of Shazam!'' featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name ''Marvel'', while Captain Marvel, Jr., and Mary Marvel lose their powers.  A powerless Freddy Freeman is drafted to prove himself worthy to each of the six gods represented by the "Shazam" acronym so that he can become their new champion and herald under the name ''Shazam''.  However, a witch named Sabina attempts to take the power herself.

In the pages of the 2007–2008 ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless Mary Batson his powers, turning her into a more aggressive super-powered figure, less upstanding than the old Mary Marvel.  By the end of the series, as well as in DC's 2008–2009 ''[[Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God [[Desaad]], becomes a villainess, joining forces with Superman villain [[Darkseid]] and fighting both [[Supergirl]] and Freddy Freeman/Shazam, who turns her back using his lightning.

A three-issue arc in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) undid much of the ''Trials of Shazam!'' changes.  Issues 23 through 25 of ''Justice Society'' featured Black Adam and a resurrected Isis taking over the Rock of Eternity and robbing Billy Batson of his Marvel powers.  Billy calls the Justice Society to intervene, while Adam and Isis enlist the evil Mary Marvel to turn Billy into an evil Marvel as well.  By the end of the story arc, Adam realizes that Isis and the evil Batson siblings are out of control, and gives up his power to resurrect the wizard Shazam.  The angry wizard promptly takes back his powers from the others, threatening to also deal with Freddy Freeman/Shazam, who is absent from the story.

Billy and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC's 2009–2010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' saga in a one-shot special, ''The Power of Shazam!'' #48.  The siblings watch the rampage of the once-dead Osiris, now revived as an undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], on the Internet from their apartment.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #48 (January 2010)</ref> In 2011, DC published a one-shot ''Shazam!'' story written by Eric Wallace, in which the still-powerless Billy and Mary help Freddy/Shazam in a battle with the demoness [[Blaze (comics)|Blaze]].  Freddy would eventually have his powers stolen by Osiris in ''Titans'' #32 the same year.<ref>''Titans'' vol. 2 #32 (February 2011)</ref>

Eventually, the Wizard summons Billy, who is another unsuitable candidate, but Billy persuades the Wizard that perfectly good people "really don't exist". In desperation and seeing the "embers of good" within Billy, the dying Wizard passes on his powers and teaches Billy they can be accessed through the magic word "Shazam" when spoken with good intentions.  After saying the magic word, Billy is struck by a bolt of lightning which transforms him into Shazam, a super-powered being possessing super-strength, flight, and vast magical powers.  The Wizard dies and transports Shazam back to Earth, where Billy reveals his new secret to Freddy.

==Powers and abilities==
When Billy Batson says the magic word "Shazam!" and transforms into Shazam/Captain Marvel, he is granted the following powers:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''S''' || for the Wisdom of '''S'''olomon || As Shazam/Captain Marvel, Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge, including most known languages and sciences. He has [[eidetic memory|exceptional photographic recall]] and mental acuity, allowing him to read and decipher [[hieroglyph]]s, recall everything he has ever learned, and solve long mathematical equations. He also has a great understanding of divine phenomena in the mortal world. The wisdom of [[Solomon]] provides him with counsel and advice in times of need. In early Captain Marvel stories, Solomon's power also gave Marvel the ability to hypnotize people. 
|-
|'''H''' || for the Strength of '''H'''ercules || [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]]' power grants Shazam/Captain Marvel immense superhuman strength, making him one of DC Comics' strongest characters. He is able to easily bend steel, punch through walls, and lift massive objects (including whole continents, such as South America). In the comics, this strength has evolved to be more than that of superman.<ref name=HE>{{cite web|last=Cimino|first=John|title=SUPERMAN VS CAPTAIN MARVEL The Definitive Write Up on the Greatest Rivalry in Comics|url=http://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2011/05/superman-vs-captain-marvel.html|work=Blog Adventures|publisher=Hero-Envy.com|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>
|-
|'''A''' || for the Stamina of '''A'''tlas || Using [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]' stamina, Shazam/Captain Marvel can withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults, and heal from them. Additionally, he does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and can survive unaided in space when in Captain Marvel form. In some stories, the stamina of Atlas makes Captain Marvel nearly invulnerable.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
|-
|'''Z''' || for the Power of '''Z'''eus || [[Zeus]]' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Shazam/Captain Marvel, also enhances Marvel's other physical and mental abilities, and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks. The hero can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or other target. The magic lightning has several uses, such as creating apparatus, restoring damage done to the hero, and providing fuel for magic spells. The current-continuity version of Shazam is able to personally generate and control lightning for various uses. He also can use it readily from finger tips.
|-
|'''A''' || for the Courage of '''A'''chilles || This aspect gives Shazam/Captain Marvel the courage and bravery of [[Achilles]] and, in one story, it is claimed to give him fighting skills.<ref name="CMA 144">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #144</ref> In the ''[[The Trials of Shazam!|Trials of Shazam!]]'' mini-series, this was changed temporarily to Achilles' near invulnerability. It also aids the hero's mental fortitude against most mental attacks.
|-
|'''M''' || for the Speed of '''M'''ercury || By channeling [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'s speed, Shazam/Captain Marvel can move at superhuman speeds and fly, although in older comics he could only leap great distances and even out run Superman. This also gives Marvel the ability to fly to the Rock of Eternity by traveling faster than the speed of light.

Repeating the word "Shazam!" transforms Shazam/Captain Marvel back into Billy.<ref>Whiz Comics #2 (Feb 1940)</ref> Shazam/Captain Marvel also shares his powers with his Shazam Family/Marvel Family teammates; some stories depict the Shazam power as a finite source which would be divided in half or into thirds, depending upon how many Marvels were in active super-powered form at one time, weakening them accordingly.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #5, 7 (1996)</ref>

As he was transformed by magic lightning, Shazam/Captain Marvel is shown in several stories to be susceptible to both high-powered magic,<ref name="DOJref">Day of Vengeance #6 (2005)</ref> which can weaken or de-power him,<ref name="DOJref" /> and to significantly high voltages of electricity, which can revert him back to Billy Batson form.<ref>''The Marvel Family'' #10 (1947)</ref> Likewise, regular lightning strikes could transform Billy to Captain Marvel.<ref>''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #20</ref> The modern version of Captain Marvel is also vulnerable in that he possesses the immature personality of a teenager.<ref>''Shazam! The New Beginning'' #1 (1987)</ref>

The white-clad "Marvel" version of the character from ''The Trials of Shazam!'' also commands the various magical abilities once owned by the wizard Shazam. However, Marvel is required to remain on the Rock of Eternity and can only be away from the Rock for 24 hours at a time<ref>''The Trials of Shazam!'' #8 (2007)</ref>

In The New 52, Shazam's powers are altered slightly. The word "Shazam" does not cause a transformation if Billy does not want it to; he is able to use and manipulate magical lightning much more readily from his fingertips; and is able to use his magic in as-yet-unexplored ways, demonstrating on one occasion the power to conjure items.<ref>''Justice League'' #31 (2014)</ref>

==Other versions==

A significant number of "alternate" depictions of Shazam/Captain Marvel have appeared in DC publications since the 1970s.

===Captain Thunder (1974)===
In ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974), Superman found himself at odds with "Captain Thunder," a superhero displaced from another Earth and another time.  Thunder had been tricked by his archenemies in the Monster League of Evil into doing evil by a magic spell, and Thunder therefore was made to do battle with Superman.  Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel's original moniker, was a thinly veiled [[pastiche]] of Marvel—down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named "Willie Fawcett" (a reference to the publisher of the original Captain Marvel stories, Fawcett Comics), and a magic word ("Thunder!"), which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers.  He got his power from rubbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying "Thunder".  His powers came from Tornado (power), Hare (speed), [[Uncas]] (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight), and Ram (tenacity).  Superman held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell.

At the time of ''Superman'' #276, DC had been publishing ''Shazam!'' comics for two years, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications.  The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in ''Justice League of America'' #137, two years later (although he met [[Lex Luthor]] in ''Shazam!'' #15, November/December 1974).

===Captain Thunder (1982)===
In the early 1980s, a proposal for an updated Captain Marvel was submitted to DC by Roy Thomas, Don Newton, and Jerry Ordway.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} This version of the character, to be an inhabitant of DC's main Earth-One universe, rather than the Fawcett-based Earth-S universe, would have featured an African-American version of Billy Batson, who spoke the magic word "Shazam!" to become Captain Thunder, Earth-One's Mightiest Mortal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} This alternate version of the character was never used.

===Captain Thunder (2011): ''Flashpoint''===
The 2011 ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries featured an alternate timeline accidentally created by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], who then helped the heroes of this timeline to restore history.  One of those heroes is Captain Thunder – an alternative version of Captain Marvel who has six alter-egos, rather than one, and a scarred face as the result of a fight with [[Wonder Woman]], who in this timeline is a villain.

The six children – (collectively known as "S.H.A.Z.A.M") – each possess one of the six attributes of the power of Shazam and must say the magic word together to become Captain Thunder.  The six children consist of an Asian-American boy named Eugene Choi, who possesses the wisdom of Solomon; an overweight Latino boy named Pedro Peña, who possesses the strength of Hercules; Mary Batson, who possesses the stamina of Atlas; Freddy Freeman, who possesses the power of Zeus; Billy Batson, who possesses the courage of Achilles; and an African-American girl named Darla Dudley who possesses the speed of Mercury.  Pedro's pet tiger Tawny also transforms into a more powerful version of himself via the magic lightning, in a similar manner to [[He-Man]]'s pet [[Battle Cat]].<ref name="fp1">''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref>

The six children later transform into Captain Thunder to help Flash and his allies stop the war between [[Aquaman]]'s [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] army and Wonder Woman's [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] forces.  Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Flash's accomplice [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]], who is revealed to be a traitor.  Before the kids can reform Captain Thunder again, Billy is stabbed by the Amazon Penthesileia and killed.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref>

After the conclusion of the ''Flashpoint'' miniseries, the three new children from the ''Flashpoint'' timeline – Eugene, Pedro, and Darla – are incorporated into the DC Universe via the ''Shazam'' backup strip in ''Justice League'', appearing as Billy, Mary, and Freddy's foster siblings.

===''Elseworld's Finest''===
In the alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] book ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'' (1998), Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African American man.

===''The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===
In the dark alternate future shown in ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Captain Marvel is visibly aged, with receding white hair and glasses.  He is being blackmailed by Lex Luthor into working for him, to prevent Luthor from killing the captured Mary Marvel. During an alien attack on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out, and admits that Billy Batson – here, clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel, rather than simply transforming into him – died eight years ago of unspecified health problems. As a result, when he next speaks his word, he will cease to exist like any dream that no longer has anyone to remember it.  His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best, noting that it was nice existing, before he calls down his lightning and destroys himself.

===''Kingdom Come''===
The graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' depicts a possible future of the DC characters. In this version, Billy Batson is grown up, but the human hostility towards superheroes has made him uneasy, and he has not transformed into Captain Marvel for several years. Instead, he becomes a brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor, who uses Mister Mind's offspring to keep Batson in check and bend him to his will. Nevertheless, Batson's potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them, unsure whether it is Batson (whose adult appearance is identical to his Captain Marvel form) or Marvel that serves Luthor.

Events finally cause him to change back into Captain Marvel, and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world. When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb, Captain Marvel - spurred by Superman telling him that he is the only one capable of making the choice due to his ties to both humanity and the superhuman community - triggers his lightning to sacrifice himself and destroy the bomb while it is still airborne. The bomb's fallout kills a large number of heroes, but does cool the war-like attitudes of the survivors. Superman uses Marvel's cape as the symbol of a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]] in which humans and superhumans will now live in harmony.

===''52'' and Earth-5===
In the final issue of the maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (#52, May 2, 2007), a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities.  Among the parallel realities is one designated Earth-5.  As a result of Marvel Family foe [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-S, including the Marvel Family characters.

The Earth-5 Captain Marvel and Billy Batson appeared in the ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' miniseries, assisting Superman.<ref>''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #1 (August 2008)</ref> The miniseries established that these versions of Captain Marvel and Billy are two separate beings, and that Billy is a reporter for WHIZ Media, rather than a radio broadcaster.  The Earth-5 Captain Marvel reappeared in ''Final Crisis'' #7, along with an army of Supermen from across the Multiverse to prevent its destruction by Darkseid.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> The current post-''New 52'' [[DC Multiverse]] still retains an Earth-5, which was the setting of ''[[The Multiversity]]: Thunderworld #1'' (Feb 2015), a modernized take on the classic Fawcett/Pre-Crisis DC Marvel Family stories by writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Cameron Stewart]].<ref>{{cite web||last=Rogers|first=Vanetatitle=GRANT MORRISON on MULTIVERSITY: It's Going to 'F' People Up |url=http://www.newsarama.com/21741-grant-morrison-on-multiversity-it-s-going-to-f-people-up.html |date=July 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Vaneta|title=CAMERON STEWART Brings Back CAPTAIN MARVEL For THE MULTIVERSITY: THUNDERWORLD

===''Justice League: Generation Lost''===
A female version of Captain Marvel is shown as a member of an alternate-future Justice League in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''.  Little is revealed about her, other than the fact that her civilian name is Sahar Shazeen, and she is shown wielding a pair of swords during battle.  She and her teammates are ultimately killed by an army of [[OMAC (comics)|Omni Mind And Community (OMACs)]].<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14</ref>

===''Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil''===
A second Captain Marvel mini-series, ''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]'', written and illustrated by [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] (creator of ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''), was published in four 48-page installments between February and July 2007.  Smith's ''Shazam!'' miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, which updates and reimagines Captain Marvel's origin.<ref>{{cite web | last=Warmoth | first=Brian | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm | title=The Strategum of Smith (cached) | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date=February 7, 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-04 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070210063430/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm | archivedate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Smith's story features a younger-looking Billy Batson and Captain Marvel as separate personalities, as they were in the pre-1985 stories, and features a prepubescent Mary Marvel as Captain Marvel's sidekick, instead of the traditional teen-aged or adult version.  Dr. Sivana is [[Attorney General of the United States]], and Mister Mind looks more like a snake than a caterpillar.

===''Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!''===
An all-ages Captain Marvel comic, ''[[Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!]]'', debuted in July 2008 under DC's [[Johnny DC]] youth-oriented imprint, and was published monthly through December 2010.  Following the lead and continuity of Smith's version, it was initially written and drawn by [[Mike Kunkel]], creator of ''Herobear''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Pumpelly | first=Danny | date=August 11, 2007 | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11575 | title=WWC: DC New Worlds Order | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> [[Art Baltazar]] and [[Franco Aureliani]], of ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', took over as writers with issue #5, with Byron Vaughns as main artist until issue #13, when [[Mike Norton]] assumed his place for the remainder of the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2077 | title=Review: Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam! #14 | work=Comic Book Resources | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> Kunkel's version returns to the modern concept of having Captain Marvel retain Billy's personality, and also introduces new versions of Black Adam (whose alter ego, Theo Adam, is a child like Billy Batson in this version), [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]], the [[List of Marvel Family enemies (A-G)#Arson Fiend|Arson Fiend]], and Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel, Jr.

===Mazahs===
In the 2013&ndash;14 ''[[Forever Evil]]'' crossover event series, the [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-3|Alexander Luthor]] of [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]] is revealed as Mazahs, the Earth-3 version of Shazam.<ref name="Forever Evil 6">{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=Friend, Richard|colorist=Oback, Sonia|letterer=Leigh, Rob|story=Forever Evil Chapter Six: The Power of Mazahs!|title=Forever Evil|volume=1|issue=6|date=May 2014|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> In the story, the [[Crime Syndicate]] (analogues of the Justice League) have brought Alexander Luthor, their prisoner, with them to the Prime Earth where the Justice League and other heroes reside.

As soon as this is done, Alexander speaks the word, 'Mazahs', transforming himself into the muscular, highly powerful being Mazahs, and killing the Syndicate's speedster [[Johnny Quick]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> In the final issue of the series, it is revealed that Wonder Woman analogue [[Superwoman]] is in a relationship with Alexander and is responsible for tricking her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor's team, but the original Lex Luthor (having the same voice as Mazahs) manages to call down the lightning and transform Mazahs into his human form. Sealing Alexander's mouth, Lex stabs him with a knife, killing him.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref>

==Supporting cast==
{{Main|Marvel Family|List of Marvel Family enemies}}
Captain Marvel often fights evil as a member of a superhero team known as the Marvel Family, made up of himself and several other heroes: the wizard Shazam, who empowers the team; Captain Marvel's sister Mary Marvel; and Marvel's protégé, Captain Marvel, Jr. Before the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earth]]s'' miniseries, the Marvel Family also included part-time members such as Mary's non-powered friend "Uncle" Dudley ([[Uncle Marvel]]), Dudley's non-powered niece Freckles Marvel, a team of protégés (all of whose alter egos are named "Billy Batson") known as the [[Lieutenant Marvels]], and the pink rabbit version of Captain Marvel, [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]].

Over the course of his adventures, Captain Marvel has gained an extensive [[rogues gallery]], the most notable of whom include the evil mad scientist Doctor Sivana (and, pre-''Crisis'', the Sivana Family); Shazam's corrupted previous champion Black Adam, who has powers from Egyptian gods; Adolf Hitler's champion Captain Nazi; and the mind-controlling worm, Mister Mind, and his Monster Society of Evil.  Other Marvel Family foes include the evil robot Mister Atom; the "World's Mightiest Immortal" [[Oggar]], a god with magical powers, a former pupil of Shazam with cloven hooves, and a member of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], who was banished for an attempted rebellion; and Ibac and [[Sabbac]], demon-powered supervillains who transform by speaking magic words made up of beings who give them power, in a manner similar to Captain Marvel.

The Marvel Family's non-powered allies include Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult offspring, Beautia and Magnificus Sivana; Mister "Tawky" Tawny the talking tiger; WHIZ radio president and Billy's employer Sterling Morris; Billy's girlfriend Cissie Sommerly; Billy's school principal Miss Wormwood; and Mary's adoptive parents Nick and Nora Bromfield.

The New 52 version of Shazam has five foster siblings, with whom he can share his powers at will: Mary Batson, Freddy Freeman, Pedro Peña, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley.  Shazam can also share his powers with Tawny, a tiger at the local city zoo whom he considers family.<ref name="JL21" />

===Radio===
Around 1943 a radio serial of Captain Marvel was briefly broadcast (possible by either [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] or [[NBC]]) initially with Burt Boyar as Billy Batson. Boyar's faint memories in a 2011 interview was while the show was initially produced in New York it relocated after a month to Chicago; no further details about the show or transcriptions of it survived. Existence of the show was confirmed by historian [[Jim Harmon]] via recollections of old time radio fans who recalled hearing it when it aired plus period program listings.<ref>Hamerlinck, P.C. (June 2012) "The Boy Who Was Billy Batson: The Captain Marvel Radio Show Mystery". [[Alter Ego (magazine)|''Alter Ego'']] (TwoMorrows Publishing) (110): 75-79.</ref>

===Television===
Captain Marvel first came to television in 1974.  [[Filmation]] produced ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'', a live-action television show, which ran from 1974 to 1977 on [[CBS]].  From 1975 until the end of its run, it aired as one-half of ''The Shazam!/Isis Hour'', featuring Filmation's own ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' as a companion program.

Instead of directly following the lead of the comic, the ''Shazam!'' TV show took a more indirect approach to the character: Billy Batson/Captain Marvel, accompanied by an older man known simply as Mentor ([[Les Tremayne]]), traveled in a motor home across the US, interacting with people in different towns in which they stopped to save the citizens from some form of danger or to help them combat some form of evil.  With the wizard Shazam absent from this series, Billy received his powers and counsel directly from the six "immortal elders" represented in the "Shazam" name, who were depicted via animation: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. ''Shazam!'' starred [[Michael Gray (actor)|Michael Gray]] as Billy Batson, with both [[Jackson Bostwick]] (Season One) and John Davey (Seasons Two and Three) as Captain Marvel.<ref>{{IMDb title|0071050|Shazam!}}</ref> An adapted version of Isis, the heroine of ''The Secrets of Isis'', was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam's wife in the weekly comic book series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.

Shortly after the ''Shazam!'' show ended its network run, Captain Marvel (played by Garrett Craig) appeared as a character in a pair of low-budget, live-action comedy specials, produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] under the name ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' in 1979.  The specials also featured [[Howard Morris]] as Doctor Sivana, and [[Ruth Buzzi]] as Aunt Minerva, marking the first appearance of those characters in film or television.  Although Captain Marvel did not appear in Hanna-Barbera's long-running concurrent [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series ''[[Super Friends]]'' (which featured many of the other DC superheroes), he did appear in some of the merchandise associated with the show.

Filmation revisited the character three years later for an animated ''Shazam!'' cartoon, which ran on [[NBC]] from 1981 to 1982 as part of ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'' with Captain Marvel voiced by Burr Middleton.  The rest of the Marvel Family joined Captain Marvel on his adventures in this series, which were more similar to his comic-book adventures than the 1970s TV show.  Dr. Sivana, Mr. Mind, Black Adam, and other familiar Captain Marvel foes appeared as enemies.

Captain Marvel and/or Billy Batson made brief "cameo" appearances in two 1990s TV series.  Billy has a non-speaking cameo in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Obsession", while live actors portraying Captain Marvel make "cameo" appearances in both a dream-sequence within an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and in the [[Beastie Boys]]' music video for "Alive".

[[File:cmarvel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Captain Marvel battles Superman in the "Clash" episode of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
Captain Marvel's first formal appearance in a DC animated universe series, the name given to the animated DC Comics spin-off productions produced by [[Bruce Timm]] and/or [[Paul Dini]], was as the main guest star character of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Clash", originally aired in 2005 on [[Cartoon Network]].  Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Jerry O'Connell]] and Billy Batson voiced by [[Shane Haboucha]].  In this episode, Captain Marvel joins the Justice League, but his positive opinions about supervillain Lex Luthor's apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman. This tension eventually leads to an all-out battle between Marvel and Superman, which destroys Luthor's newest creation, Lexor City.  Marvel loses the battle to Superman.  Although Marvel is eventually proven to have been right all along, he is still understandably hurt by Superman's actions, and resigns from the Justice League in disgust, despite Superman's efforts to apologize, unaware that he was unwittingly a pawn in a plot by Luthor and [[Amanda Waller]] to damage Superman's image.

Four years later, Captain Marvel made seven appearances in Cartoon Network's ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' series, with Captain Marvel voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and Billy Batson voiced by [[Tara Strong]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://voiceactors.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/tara-strong-batman-chowder-drawn-together/ | title=Tara Strong on 'Batman', 'Chowder', 'Drawn Together' Movie | work=Voiceactors.wordpress.com | date=July 14, 2009 | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> After first appearing in the opening teaser to the episode "Death Race to Oblivion!", Marvel appeared in two episodes dedicated to his world during the show's second season.  "The Power of Shazam!" featured Captain Marvel/Billy Batson alongside the Sivana Family, Black Adam, the wizard Shazam, Aunt Minerva, and Mary Batson, while "The Malicious Mr. Mind" featured the Marvel Family, Sivana, Mr. Mind, and the Monster Society of Evil.  Captain Marvel also appears in the two-episode Season Two storyline "The Siege of Starro!", and the third season episodes "Night of the Batmen!" and "Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!"

Captain Marvel also appears as a recurring character in the ongoing DC Comics-based Cartoon Network series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' with Captain Marvel voiced by [[Rob Lowe]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/22/cci-shazam-rob-lowe-to-voice-captain-marvel-in-young-justice/ | title=CCI: Shazam! Rob Lowe to Voice Captain Marvel in Young Justice | work=Comic Book Resources | date=July 22, 2010 | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> and later by [[Chad Lowe]], while Billy Batson is voiced by [[Robert Ochoa]].  Depicted as a member of the Justice League, Marvel is introduced as the team's new "den mother" in the episode "Alpha Male" after [[Red Tornado]]'s disappearance.  At various times, he sometimes joins the teenage heroes of Young Justice on their missions.  In the series, Marvel often tries to treat the Team as peers (most of them actually being older than him), but since nobody knows his actual age, both the Team and the League see him as just another adult.  In the episode, "Misplaced," [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] magically cleaves the world into two – one for adults and one for children.  Captain Marvel's dual identity allows him to travel between the worlds and help both teams with a plot to stop the threat, revealing his secret identity in the process, leading to debate in the episode "Agendas" whether he should be removed from the League for not disclosing that he was really a 10-year-old boy.  In "Cornered," Billy Batson fights Despero at age 15 before turning into Captain Marvel.

In the popular TV series [[American Dad!|American Dad]], [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve Smith]] (one of the main characters) wears a Shazam T-Shirt, a direct reference to Captain Marvel.

===Video games===
Captain Marvel made his first official video game appearance as a playable character in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'',played by Stephan Scalabrino and voiced by [[Kevin Delaney (actor)|Kevin Delaney]], for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] game consoles.  In the story, Captain Marvel is among several DC superheroes teleported to the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' video game universe when the two universes merge, and characters from each franchise are forced to do battle.

Captain Marvel also appears as a "jump-in" hero character in the [[Wii]]/[[Nintendo DS]] adaptations of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold – The Videogame|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].

Captain Marvel appears in the [[MMORPG]] ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', in  ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]], available on PS3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Nintendo Wii, and Nintendo [[Wii U]], ''voiced by [[Travis Willingham]],<ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/video_games/news/?a=60211</ref> and as a playable character in ''[[Infinite Crisis (video game)|Infinite Crisis]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infinitecrisis.com/en/champions/shazam |title=Shazam |publisher=Infinite Crisis |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref>

As Shazam, the hero appears as a playable fighter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2013/feb/05/shazam-character-art-found-injustice-gods-among-us-website/ |title=Shazam character art found on the Injustice: Gods Among Us website, Ed Boon confirms DLC characters on Twitter |publisher=Eventhubs.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', voiced by Joey Naber.  In the beginning, Shazam is seen fighting Black Adam.  The alternate Shazam initially fights for Superman's oppressive regime, and even saves Superman's life, but eventually publicly challenges Superman's motives and is executed.  Yet his death is not in vain, as it causes the alternate Flash to defect to the insurgency with critical information.  In the Arcade Mode, Shazam's ending has the Justice League members that fought the regime get possessed by an alien force.  Shazam must rally the Marvel Family to defeat them. Shazam! reappears in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', where he is be able to change into his alter ego (Billy Batson) and back at will. This time, Shazam! is instantly on the console versions without downloadable content.

===Comic strips===
In 1943, C.C. Beck and writer Rod Reed prepared seven sample installments of a comic strip, but syndicates expressed no interest in it.  Reed suspected the DC lawsuit was the reason syndicates would not take on the property, for fear of becoming parties in the ongoing litigation.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Beck | first=C.C. | contribution=The Captain Marvel Daily Newspaper Strip | editor-last=Hamerlinck | editor-first=P.C. | title=The Fawcett Companion | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | year=2001 | pages=46–47}}</ref>

==Cultural impact==

===Captain Marvel vs. Superman in fiction===
[[Image:Supermanmarvel kingdomcome.jpg|thumb|Superman and Captain Marvel face off in the 1996 ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]
Captain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] in general.  The most notable contribution is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] comic book stories.  The two are often portrayed as equally matched and, while Marvel does not possess Superman's heat vision, x-ray vision or breath powers, the magic-based nature of his own powers are a weakness for Superman.

The National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in "[[Superduperman]]",<ref>Wright, p. 146.</ref> a satirical comic book story by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]] in the fourth issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (April/May 1953).  Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature.  Marbles' magic word is "SHAZOOM", which stands for '''S'''trength, '''H'''ealth, '''A'''ptitude, '''Z'''eal, '''O'''x (power of), '''O'''x (power of another), and '''M'''oney.  In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal.  Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.

While publishing its ''Shazam!'' revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name.  He apparently battles against a Monster League, who cast a spell to make him evil, but Superman helps him break free.<ref>''Superman'' #276 (June 1974)</ref> Two years later, ''Justice League of America'' #135–137 presented a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies.  It is in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first meet, albeit briefly.  [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] has caused Superman to go mad using [[red kryptonite]], meaning he and Marvel battle, but Marvel restores his mind to normal with lightning.

In ''Shazam!'' #30 (1977), Dr. Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh's steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of ''[[Action Comics]]''.  He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the robot is destroyed.

Notable later Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include ''[[All-New Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (1978), ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #36–37 (1984), and ''[[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]'' vol. 2, #102 (1995).  The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in ''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996) serves as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes.  The "Clash" episode of the DC-based animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which includes Captain Marvel as a guest character, features a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece.  By contrast, the depiction of the pair's first meeting in the ''Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder'' miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy's mentor when he learns the boy's true age.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Cimino|first = John|title = Superman vs. Captain Marvel The Definitive Write-Up on the Greatest Rivalry in Comics|journal= Back Issue!|issue = 66|pages = 69–77|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = August 2013}}</ref>

===Captain Marvel in popular culture===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
In pop culture, Billy Batson/Captain Marvel's magic word, "Shazam!", became a popular exclamation from the 1940s on, often used in place of an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]].  The most notable user of the word "Shazam!" in this form was [[Gomer Pyle]], a character from the 1960s [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and later ''[[Gomer Pyle USMC]]''.  In the 1961 movie ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', Baby John says that Captain Marvel does not need to use guns.  [[Foxxy Cleopatra]] in the 2002 film ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' is also fond of the word.

Captain Marvel is mentioned in a verse of the 1968 song "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]" by [[The Beatles]] in the line:  “So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes”.  This marks the only occasion in which a comic book character is mentioned in a Beatles song. In a scene of the movie ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', Paul McCartney shouts the word "Shazam!"

In the 2002 film adaptation of ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] tries a variety of catchphrases/magic words – among them "Shazam!" – in an attempt to activate his new-found web shooting abilities.  For many years, [[Phoenix Suns]] play-by-play announcer [[Al McCoy (announcer)|Al McCoy]] has said "Shazam!" when a Phoenix Sun player makes a three-point field goal, and has acknowledged that it came from Captain Marvel comics.

The [[Academy of Comic Book Arts]] named its [[Shazam Award]] in honor of the character.
