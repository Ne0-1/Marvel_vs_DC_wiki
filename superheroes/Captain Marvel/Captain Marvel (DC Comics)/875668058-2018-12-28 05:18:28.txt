'''Captain Marvel''', also known as '''Shazam''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|z|æ|m}}), is a fictional [[comic book]] [[superhero]] appearing in publications by the [[American comic book|American publisher]] [[DC Comics]]. Artist [[C. C. Beck]] and writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940), published by [[Fawcett Comics]]. He is the alter ego of '''Billy Batson''', a boy who, by speaking the magic word "'''SHAZAM'''" (acronym of six "immortal elders": [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]]), can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength, speed, flight and other abilities.

Based on book sales, the character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even [[Superman]].<ref name="TiptonMoviePoopShoot">{{cite web | last=Tipton | first=Scott | title=The World's Mightiest Mortal | work=Comics 101 | date=April 1, 2003 | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=I've always felt that it was this origin story and concept that made Captain Marvel instantly popular, to the point that it was outselling every comic on the stands for several years throughout the '40s. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050614004150/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | archivedate=June 14, 2005 | df= }}</ref><ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum">{{cite web | title=Comic Book Success Stories | work=The Museum of Comic Book Advertising | url=http://comicbookads.leafpublishing.com/hall-of-covers/cover-display2-page2.htm | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=By the middle of the decade, Captain Marvel had received a self-titled comic book, ''Captain Marvel's Adventures'' [sic],<!--the proper name of the publication is "Captain Marvel Adventures"--> which had a circulation that reached 1.3 million copies per month.

Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted into film, in a 1941 [[Republic Pictures]] [[film serial|serial]] titled ''[[Adventures of Captain Marvel]]''.

Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, partly because of a [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|copyright infringement suit from DC Comics]], alleging that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman.<ref name="settlement" /> In 1972, DC licensed the Marvel Family characters from Fawcett, and returned them to publication. By 1991, DC had acquired all rights to the characters. DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their [[DC Universe]] and has attempted to revive the property several times, with mixed success.

After the success of [[DC Comics|National Comics]]' new superhero characters [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], [[Fawcett Publications]] started its own comics division in 1939, recruiting writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled ''Flash Comics''. Besides penning stories featuring [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Lance O'Casey]], [[Scoop Smith]], and [[Dan Dare (Fawcett Comics)|Dan Dare]] for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure.<ref name="JohnnyShazam" />

Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called "'''Captain Thunder'''".<ref name="JohnnyShazam">{{cite web | last=Hembeck | first=Fred | title=Johnny Thunder and Shazam! | work=The Hembeck Files | date=June 18, 2003 | url=http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/shazam2.html | accessdate=2005-06-22}}</ref> Staff artist [[C. C. Beck|Charles Clarence "C. C." Beck]] was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat [[cartoon]]y style that became his trademark. "When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett’s first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were," Beck told an interviewer. "We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times".<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=http://cartoonician.com/an-interview-with-c-c-beck/ |title=An Interview with C. C. Beck &#124; Hogan's Alley |publisher=Cartoonician.com |date=2015-07-04 |accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>

The first issue of the comic book, printed as both ''Flash Comics'' #1 and ''Thrill Comics'' #1,<ref>{{gcdb issue|id=172914|title=Thrill Comics [ashcan] #1}}</ref> had a low-print run in the fall of 1939 as an [[ashcan copy]] created for advertising and [[trademark]] purposes. Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark "Captain Thunder", "Flash Comics", or "Thrill Comics", because all three names were already in use.  Consequently, the book was renamed ''Whiz Comics'', and Fawcett artist [[Pete Costanza]] suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to "Captain Marvelous", which the editors shortened to "Captain Marvel". The [[Speech balloon|word balloon]]s in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as "Captain Marvel".

====Introduction====
''Whiz Comics'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939. The comic's lead feature introduced audiences to Billy Batson, an orphaned 12-year-old boy who, by speaking the name of the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]], is struck by a magic lightning bolt and transformed into the adult superhero Captain Marvel. Shazam's name was an acronym derived from the six immortal elders who grant Captain Marvel his superpowers: [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]].

In addition to introducing the main character, his alter ego, and his mentor, Captain Marvel's first adventure in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil [[Doctor Sivana]], and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter with station WHIZ. Captain Marvel was an instant success, with ''Whiz Comics'' #2 selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum"/> By 1941, he had his own solo series, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', the premiere issue of which was written and drawn by [[Joe Simon]] & [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/issue/1178/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Captain Marvel Adventures #[1] |website=www.comics.org |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> Captain Marvel continued to appear in ''Whiz Comics'', as well as periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including ''[[Master Comics]]''.

Inspiration for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources. His visual appearance was modeled after that of [[Fred MacMurray]], a popular American actor of the period,<ref name=FC1>{{cite book |last=Beck |first=C. C. |title=Fawcett Companion: The Best of FCA (Fawcett Collectors of America) |year=2001 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, NC |isbn=978-1-893905-10-8 |pages=28–29 |url= http://www.marvelfamily.com/faq/mfinspiration.aspx}}</ref> though comparisons with both [[Cary Grant]] and [[Jack Oakie]] were made as well.<ref name=MarFam>{{cite web |title=Marvel Family Inspiration |url= http://www.marvelfamily.com/faq/mfinspiration.aspx |publisher=MarvelFamily.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> [[Fawcett Publications]]' founder, Wilford H.

Fawcett's circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff, "Give me a Superman, only have his other identity be a 10- or 12-year-old boy rather than a man".<ref name="likeSupes">{{Cite book | editor-last=Hamerlinck | editor-first=P.C. | title=Fawcett Companion: The Best of FCA (Fawcett Collectors of America) | location=Raleigh, NC | publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | year=2001 | isbn=978-1-893905-10-8}}</ref>

Through much of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium, and his comics outsold all others. ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' sold fourteen million copies in 1944,<ref name="ComicBooksinLibraries">{{Cite news | last=Lavinie | first=Michael L. | title=Comic Books and Graphic Novels for Libraries: What to Buy | newspaper=Serials Review | volume=2 | issue=24 | page=34 | date=Summer 1998 | url=http://www.ugr.es/~alozano/Translations/ComicBooksinLibraries.pdf | format=PDF | quote=In 1944, the best-selling comic book title (''Captain Marvel Adventures'') sold more than fourteen million copies for the year. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002164350/http://www.ugr.es/~alozano/Translations/ComicBooksinLibraries.pdf | archivedate=2005-10-02 | df= }}</ref> and was at one point being published bi-weekly with a circulation of 1.3 million copies an issue. Several issues of ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' included a blurb on their covers proclaiming the series the "Largest Circulation of Any Comic Magazine").<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum"/>

The franchise was expanded to introduce spin-off characters to Captain Marvel between 1941 and 1942.<ref name="ComicLaw" /> ''Whiz Comics'' #21 (1941) introduced the [[Lieutenant Marvels]]: three other boys named "Billy Batson" who could also become adult superheroes. [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]], the alter-ego of disabled newsboy Freddy Freeman, debuted in ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (1941). [[Mary Marvel]], alter-ego of Billy's twin sister Mary Batson, first appeared in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 (1942). In contrast to Captain Marvel and the Lieutenants, both Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. remained kids in superhero form, and were given their own eponymous books in addition to appearing as the lead features in ''Master Comics'' and ''[[Wow Comics]]'', respectively.<ref name="ComicLaw">{{Cite book  | last=Sergi| first=Joe | year=2015 | title=The Law for Comic Book Creators: Essential Concepts and Applications | location=Jefferson, North Carolina | publisher=McFarland |pages=44–53 | isbn=1-4766-1733-3}}</ref> Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Mary Marvel appeared together as a team in another Fawcett publication, ''The Marvel Family''.<ref name="ComicLaw" /> In addition, there was a [[funny animal]] spin-off character, [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]], which was created in 1942 for Fawcett's ''Funny Animals'' comic book and later given an eponymous series as well.<ref name="ComicLaw" />

With Bill Parker having been drafted into [[World War II]], chief writing duties on the Captain Marvel-related comics stories went to [[Otto Binder]] by 1942.<ref name="Binder01">{{Cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/2016-09-16/page-two-otto-binder-had-a-vision/ |title=Page Two: Otto Binder Had a Vision |last=Black |first=Louis |date=2016-09-16 |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> C.C.

{{See also|National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications}}
Detective Comics (later known as National Comics Publications, National Periodical Publications, and today known as [[DC Comics]]) sued both Fawcett Comics and Republic Pictures for [[copyright infringement]] in 1941, alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman (see [[National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.]]).<ref name="NationalFawcettLawsuit">{{cite web | url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/191/594/91314/ | title=191 F.2d 594: National Comics Publications, Inc. v.

(Circuit Judge)}}</ref> After seven years of litigation, the ''[[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications]]'' case went to trial in 1948. Although the presiding judge decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement, DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their ''Superman'' daily [[Superman (comic strip)|newspaper strips]], and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss">{{Cite journal | last=Ingersoll | first=Bob | date=May 31, 1985 | title=The Law is a Ass (Installment #66) | journal=Comics Buyer's Guide | issue=602 | url= http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/law/back20001024.shtml | accessdate=June 19, 2005}} (Detailed summary of the cases and rulings related to ''National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publishing''.)</ref> As a result, the initial verdict, delivered in 1951, went in Fawcett's favor.

National appealed this decision, and Judge [[Learned Hand]] declared in 1952 that National's Superman copyright was in fact valid. Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement, but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements, and this would have to be determined in a retrial. He therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss" />

Instead of retrying the case, however, Fawcett settled with National out of court. The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regard to Captain Marvel. While ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' had been the top-selling comic series during World War II, it suffered declining sales every year after 1945, and, by 1949, it was selling only half its wartime rate.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | year=2001 | title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | location=Baltimore | publisher=Johns Hopkins | isbn=0-8018-7450-5 | page=57}}</ref> Fawcett tried to revive the popularity of its Captain Marvel series in the early 1950s by introducing elements of the horror comics trend that had gained popularity at the time.<ref>Wright, p. 156.</ref>

''Whiz Comics'' had ended with issue #155 in June 1953, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' was canceled with #150 in November 1953, and ''The Marvel Family'' ended its run with #89 in January 1954. Hoppy the Marvel Bunny was sold to [[Charlton Comics]], where a few Fawcett-era stories from that strip were reprinted as ''Hoppy the Magic Bunny'', with all references to "Captain Marvel and "Shazam" removed.<ref name="ComicLaw" />

===''Marvelman'' / ''Miracleman''===
{{Main|Marvelman}}
In the 1950s, a small British publisher, [[L. Miller and Son]], published a number of [[black-and-white]] reprints of American comic books, including the Captain Marvel series. With the outcome of the ''National v. Fawcett'' lawsuit, L. Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer, [[Mick Anglo]], who created a thinly-disguised version of the superhero called [[Marvelman]]. Captain Marvel, Jr. was adapted to create Young Marvelman, while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman. The magic word "Shazam!" was replaced with "Kimota" ("Atomik" spelled backwards). The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's United Kingdom series with issue number #25.

''Marvelman'' ceased publication in 1963, but the character was revived in 1982 by writer [[Alan Moore]] in the pages of ''Warrior Magazine''. Beginning in 1985, Moore's black-and-white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by [[Eclipse Comics]] under the new title ''[[Miracleman]]'' (as [[Marvel Comics]] objected to the use of "Marvel" in the title), and continued publication in the United States after ''Warrior''{{'}}s demise.  Within the [[Metatextuality|metatextual]] story line of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Moore and later ''Marvelman/Miracleman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]]. In 2009, Marvel Comics obtained the rights to the original 1950s ''Marvelman'' characters and stories, obtaining the rights to the 1980s version and those reprints in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nycc-marvel-reprint-classic-alan-648083 |title=NYCC: Marvel to Reprint Classic Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman 'Miracleman' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48465 |title=NYCC: Cup O' Joe Announces Miracleman's Return |website=Comic Book Resources |date= 2013-10-12 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref>

{{Main|Captain Marvel (M. F. Enterprises)}}
In 1966, [[M. F. Enterprises]] produced their own Captain Marvel: an [[Android (robot)|android]] superhero from another planet whose main characteristic was the ability to split his body into several parts, each of which could move on its own. He triggered the separation by shouting "Split!" and reassembled himself by shouting "Xam!" He had a young human ward named Billy Baxton. This short-lived Captain Marvel was credited in the comic as being "based on a character created by [[Carl Burgos]]".<ref>{{comicbookdb |character |7827|Captain Marvel (M.F.)}}</ref> Legal issues with [[Marvel Comics]]  over the use of "Marvel" in the title led to M.F. ceasing publication after five issues, and accepting a $4500 settlement from Marvel.<ref name="slugfest">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/972386162 |title=Slugfest : inside the epic fifty-year battle between Marvel and DC |last=Tucker |first=Reed |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2017 |isbn=0306825473 |edition=  First |location=New York, NY |oclc=972386162}}</ref>

When superhero comics became popular again in the mid-1960s in what is now called the "[[Silver Age of Comic Books]]", Fawcett was unable to revive Captain Marvel, having agreed to never publish the character again as part of their 1953 settlement. Looking for new properties to introduce to the DC Comics line, DC publisher [[Carmine Infantino]] decided to bring the Captain Marvel property back into print, and in 1972 he licensed the characters from Fawcett.<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1" /> Because Marvel Comics had by this time established ''Captain Marvel'' as a comic book trademark for [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|their own character]], created and first published in 1967, DC published their book under the name ''Shazam!''<ref name="NRLostYearsPt3" /> Infantino attempted to give the ''Shazam!'' book the subtitle ''The Original Captain Marvel'', but a [[cease and desist]] letter from Marvel Comics forced them to change the subtitle to ''The World's Mightiest Mortal'', starting with ''Shazam!'' #15 (December 1974).<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1">{{cite web | url= http://www.newsarama.com/6771-an-oral-history-of-captain-marvel-the-shazam-years-pt-1.html | title=An Oral History of CAPTAIN MARVEL: The Shazam Years, pt. 1 | work=Newsarama | date=31 December 2010 | accessdate=14 September 2014 | author=Smith, Zack}}</ref> As all subsequent toys and other merchandise featuring the character have also been required to use the "Shazam!" label with little to no mention of the name "Captain Marvel", the title became so linked to Captain Marvel that many people took to identifying the character as "Shazam" instead of "Captain Marvel".<ref name="NameChange" />

The ''Shazam!'' comic series began with ''Shazam!'' #1 (Feb. 1973). It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s. [[Dennis O'Neil]] was the primary writer of the book.<ref>{{cite book |last=McAvennie |first= Michael | editor-last=Dolan | editor-first=Hannah |chapter= 1970s |title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 155 |quote = In 1972, DC acquired the rights to Captain Marvel and in 1973 they launched the series ''Shazam!'', which re-established the Captain Marvel mythos...Responsible for resurrecting the lightning-charged champion, writer Denny O'Neil and original artist C.

Beck]] drew stories for the first ten issues of the book before quitting due to creative differences. [[Bob Oksner]] and Fawcett alumnus [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] were among the later artists of the title. As per DC's agreement with Fawcett, DC paid Fawcett a licensing fee per issue, per page for each of the Fawcett characters who appeared, either in ''Shazam!'' or crossovers in other comic series.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" />

With DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] concept in effect during this time, the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of "Earth-S".<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1" /> The Fawcett material was still considered [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], with the Marvel Family's 20-year layoff explained in the comic as time spent in [[suspended animation]] due to Doctor Sivana.<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1" /> While the series began with a great deal of fanfare, the book had a lackluster reception.<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1" /> The creators themselves had misgivings.  Beck said, "As an illustrator, I could, in the old days, make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings.  But I couldn't bring the new [Captain Marvel] stories to life no matter how hard I tried".<ref>{{Cite book | last=Benton | first=Mike | year=1989 | title=The Comic Book in America: An Illustrated History | location=Dallas | publisher=Taylor | isbn=0-87833-659-1 | page=77}}</ref>

''Shazam!'' was heavily [[Retroactive continuity|rewritten]] as of issue #34 (April 1978), and Bridwell provided more realistic stories, accompanied by similar art; the first issue was drawn by [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]] and [[Josef Rubinstein|Joe Rubinstein]], and thereafter by [[Don Newton]], a longtime fan of the character,<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Interview with Don Newton | journal=The Collector | issue=17 | first=Bill G. | last=Wilson | year=1969}}</ref> and Schaffenberger. Nevertheless, the next issue was the last one, though the feature was kept alive in a back-up position in the [[Dollar Comics]]-formatted run of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (from #253, October/November 1978, to #282, August 1982, skipping only #271, which featured a full-length origin of the Superman-Batman team story).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsarama.com/8783-please-reprint-these-pt-2-specific-story-wishlist.html |title=Please Reprint These!

When ''World's Finest Comics'' reverted to the standard 36 pages, leftover ''Shazam!'' material saw publication in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (#491–492, September–October 1982).  The remaining 11 issues of that run contained reprints, with ''Shazam!'' represented by mostly Fawcett-era stories (left out of ''Adventure Comics'' #500 and the final #503, where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs).

Outside of their regular series and features, The Marvel Family characters also appeared as guest stars in the ''[[Justice League of America]]'' series, in particular issues #135-137 (vol. 1) for the "[[Crisis (DC Comics)|Crisis on Earth-S]]" story arc in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comics.org/issue/30279/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Justice League of America #135 |website=www.comics.org |access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (April 1978) featured a "Superman vs. Shazam!" story by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Dick Giordano]].<ref>{{cite journal |last = Hamerlinck |first = P.C. |title = When Worlds Collide: The Colossal-Sized Confrontation Between Superman and Captain Marvel |journal= [[Back Issue!]] |issue = 61 |pages = 65–68 |publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing |date = December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comics.org/issue/68932/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: All-New Collectors' Edition #C-58 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>

Captain Marvel, and often the Marvel Family, also co-starred with Superman in several issues of ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' written by [[Roy Thomas]].<ref name="ThomasIntro" /> Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of ''Shazam!'' and the [[Justice Society of America]] characters.<ref name="ThomasIntro">{{Cite book |title=Shazam: A New Beginning 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition [Introduction] |last=Thomas |first=Roy |publisher=DC Comics, Inc. |year=2017 |isbn=1401283128 |location=Burbank, CA |pages=5–6}}</ref><ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> The Marvels also guest starred in several issues of ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'', a series centered on the Justice Society and the other [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] characters written by Roy Thomas and his wife [[Dann Thomas|Dann]]. As ''All-Star Squadron'' was set during World War II, several events of the comic fell concurrent with and referenced the events of the original early-1940s Fawcett stories.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Thomas |first=Roy |date=Spring 2001 |title= Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here! |url=http://twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/08a-ss.html |volume=1 |access-date=2018-09-22 }}</ref> With their 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], DC fully integrated the characters into the [[DC Universe]].

===Captain Marvel in the late 1980s===
The first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|post-Crisis]] appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the [[Justice League]] in [[Keith Giffen]]'s and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from ''Legends''), he was given his own miniseries titled ''Shazam!: The New Beginning''. With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and [[Black Adam]] into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story.

The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsarama.com/g00/36243-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D&i10c.ua=1 |title=An Oral History of DC's CAPTAIN MARVEL/SHAZAM: The New Beginning Years |last=Smith |first=Zack |date=2017-09-05 |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051645/https://www.newsarama.com/g00/36243-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D&i10c.ua=1# |archive-date=2017-12-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>

This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology ''[[Action Comics Weekly]]'' #623–626 (October 25, 1988 – November 15, 1988), in which a [[Neo-Nazi]] version of Captain Nazi was introduced.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new ''Shazam!'' ongoing series.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> Though ''New Beginning'' had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas.<ref name="ThomasIntro" /> As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new [[Punk subculture|punk]]-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka "Spike") who was not Billy's sister, and an [[African-American]] take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the ''Shazam!'' project.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article">{{cite journal

Other attempts at reviving ''Shazam!'' were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], illustrator of ''Legends'' and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' (1986).<ref name="NRSecretShazam">{{cite web | url= http://www.newsarama.com/7118-an-oral-history-of-captain-marvel-secret-shazam.html | title=An Oral History of Captain Marvel: Secret Shazam | publisher= Newsarama.com | date=February 25, 2011 | accessdate=May 24, 2015 | author=Smith, Zack}}</ref>  None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's ''[[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]'' miniseries in 1991.

===''The Power of Shazam!''===
{{Main|The Power of Shazam!}}
In 1991, [[Jerry Ordway]] was given the ''Shazam!'' assignment, which he pitched as a painted [[graphic novel]] that would lead into a series, rather than starting the series outright.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> Ordway both wrote and illustrated the graphic novel, titled ''The Power of Shazam!'', which was released in 1994. ''Power of Shazam!'' [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] Captain Marvel again and gave him a revised origin, rendering ''Shazam! The New Beginning'' and the ''Action Comics Weekly'' story apocryphal while Marvel's appearances in ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' and ''Justice League'' still counted as part of the continuity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cereno |first1=Benito |title=The Evolution Of Shazam: Best Captain Marvel Stories By Decade |url=http://comicsalliance.com/evolution-of-captain-marvel-shazam/ |website=Comics Alliance |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905133700/http://comicsalliance.com/evolution-of-captain-marvel-shazam/ |archivedate=September 5, 2015 |df= }}</ref>

Ordway's story more closely followed Captain Marvel's Fawcett origins, with only slight additions and changes. The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success, leading to a ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Dolan, p. 269: "Writer Jerry Ordway chronicled the further adventures of Billy Batson, the World's Mightiest Mortal, in the new ongoing effort ''The Power of Shazam!'', alongside artists Mike Manley and Peter Krause".</ref> That series reintroduced the Marvel Family and many of their allies and enemies into the modern-day DC Universe.

Captain Marvel also appeared in [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]'s critically acclaimed 1996 alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries. Set 20 years in the future, ''Kingdom Come'' features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind-controlled pawn of an elderly [[Lex Luthor]]. In 2000, Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic novel, ''Shazam! Power of Hope'', written by [[Paul Dini]] and painted by [[Alex Ross]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsarama.com/36353-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html |title=An Oral History of DC's CAPTAIN MARVEL/SHAZAM: The Modern Years Part 1 |website=Newsarama |language=en |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>

===Early-mid-2000s: ''JSA'' and ''52''===
Since the cancellation of the ''Power of Shazam!'' title in 1999, the Marvel Family has made appearances in a number of other DC comic books.  Black Adam became a main character in [[Geoff Johns]]' and [[David S. Goyer]]'s ''JSA'' series, which depicted the latest adventures of the world's first superhero team, the [[Justice Society of America]], with Captain Marvel also briefly joining the team to keep an eye on his old nemesis. Captain Marvel also appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the sequel to Miller's highly acclaimed graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which culminated in his death. The ''[[Superman/Shazam: First Thunder]]'' miniseries, written by [[Judd Winick]] with art by [[Joshua Middleton|Josh Middleton]], and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post-''Crisis'' meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.
 
The Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, which began DC's efforts to retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise.  In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which preceded the ''Infinite Crisis'' event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the [[Rock of Eternity]]. The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters. ''52'' introduced Adam's "Black Marvel Family," which included Adam's wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], her brother [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and [[Sobek (comics)|Sobek]].  The series chronicled Adam's attempts to reform after falling in love with Isis, only to launch the DC universe into [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] after she and Osiris are killed.  The Marvel Family appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series by [[Alex Ross]], [[Jim Krueger]], and [[Doug Braithwaite]], published from 2005 to 2007.

===''The Trials of Shazam!''===
''The Trials of Shazam!'', a 12-issue maxi-series written by [[Judd Winick]] and illustrated by [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter]] for the first eight issues, and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, was published from 2006 to 2008.  The series redefined the ''Shazam!'' property with a stronger focus on magic and mysticism.  ''Trials of Shazam!'' featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name ''Marvel,'' while the former Captain Marvel, Jr., Freddy Freeman, attempts to prove himself worthy to become Marvel's champion under the name ''Shazam.''

In the pages of the 2007–2008 ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless [[Mary Batson]] his powers, turning her into a more aggressive super-powered figure, less upstanding than the old Mary Marvel.  By the end of the series, as well as in DC's 2008–2009 ''[[Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God [[Desaad|DeSaad]], becomes a villainess, joining forces with Superman villain [[Darkseid]] and fighting both [[Supergirl]] and Freddy Freeman/Shazam.

A three-issue arc in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) undid many of the ''Trials of Shazam!'' changes. Issues 23 through 25 of ''Justice Society'' featured Black Adam and a resurrected Isis defeating Marvel and taking over the Rock of Eternity. Adam and Isis recruit the now-evil Mary Marvel to help them in the ensuing fight against a now-powerless Billy Batson and the Justice Society.

Billy and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC's 2009–2010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' saga in a one-shot special, ''The Power of Shazam!'' #48.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #48 (Jan. 2010)</ref> In 2011, DC published a one-shot ''Shazam!'' story written by Eric Wallace, in which the still-powerless Billy and Mary help Freddy/Shazam in a battle with the demoness [[Blaze (comics)|Blaze]]. Freddy would eventually have his powers stolen by Osiris in ''Titans'' #32 the same year.<ref>''Titans'' vol. 2, #32 (Feb. 2011)</ref>

In 2011, DC Comics relaunched their entire comic book lineup, creating [[The New 52]] lineup of comics. The revamp began with a seven-issue miniseries, ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', which features an alternate timeline in which Billy Batson, Mary Batson, and Freddy Freeman are joined by three new kids, Eugene Choi, Pedro Peña, and Darla Dudley, as the "S!

The ''Shazam!'' feature concluded with ''Justice League'' #21, preceding DC's crossover storyline "[[Trinity War]]" which heavily features the Shazam mythos.

A mysterious man in a green cloak asks Billy to follow him into the subway station. A magic subway car painted in unusual shapes and colors escorts them to an underground throne room, which is inhabited by a very old man with a long beard and a white robe. As the man in green disappears, the old man on the throne explains to Billy that he is the Wizard Shazam, and has used the powers of "the gods" - [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]], hence the name "Shazam" - to fight evil for over 3,000 years. However, he has now grown too old to continue and is in need of a successor. The wizard explains that Billy was chosen due to his misfortune: he had been thrown out by a greedy uncle who stole his inheritance following the deaths of his parents (later retellings of the origin would also note that Billy was chosen for being "pure of heart").<ref name="Shazam011973" /> Ordered by the wizard to speak the name "Shazam," Billy is struck by a sudden bolt of lightning and transformed into a superpowered adult in a red costume with gold trim.<ref name="Whiz02">''Whiz Comics'' #2 (1940)</ref>
The Wizard Shazam declares the new hero "Captain Marvel" and orders him to carry on his work, as a stone block suspended above his throne falls upon him, killing him as prophesied.<ref name="Shazam011973">''Shazam!'' #1 (1973)</ref> The wizard would return - in later retellings of the origin story, immediately - as a [[ghost|spirit]] to serve as a mentor to Billy and Captain Marvel, summoned by lighting a torch on the wall of his lair.<ref name="Shazam011973" /> As a spirit, the Wizard Shazam lives at the [[Rock of Eternity]], a [[bicone]]-shaped rock formation situated at the nexus of time and space.<ref>''The Marvel Family'' #7 (1946)</ref> Later retellings of the Captain Marvel origin place Shazam's underground lair within the Rock.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #5 (1995)</ref> Saying the word "Shazam" allows Billy to summon the magic lightning and become Captain Marvel, while Captain Marvel can say the magic word himself to become Billy again.<ref name="Whiz02" />

Captain Marvel's first battle was with the mad scientist [[Doctor Sivana]], who becomes Captain Marvel's arch-enemy.<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #3-4 (1940)</ref> Billy Batson becomes a reporter and host for WHIZ Radio, his career allowing him to travel and investigate criminal activity.<ref name="WC03">''Whiz Comics'' #3a (1940)</ref> An adult daughter of Sivana's, Beautia, becomes an unwitting love interest for the shy Captain Marvel, despite her wavering allegiance to her evil father.<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #3b-10 (1940) - note that there are two issues of ''Whiz Comics'' numbered #3, as per ''The Shazam! Archives, Vol. 1'', due to a numbering error at Fawcett.</ref>

While the majority of Billy's adventures feature him as a solo hero, he also fought evil on a regular basis accompanied by several other kids who share his powers to make up a superhero team called the [[Marvel Family]] (later referred to as the ''Shazam Family'' due to the issues DC Comics faced over the "Marvel" and "Captain Marvel" trademarks). The first members of the family, introduced in ''Whiz Comics'' #21 (Sept. 1941) and used sparingly afterwards, were the [[Lieutenant Marvels]]: three other boys from various parts of the United States who are also named "Billy Batson" and discover that, if they all say "Shazam!" in unison, they can become adult superheroes as well.

In ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (Dec 1941), Captain Marvel saves Freddy Freeman, a boy who had been left for dead by the evil [[Captain Nazi]], and does for Freddy what the wizard did for him. By speaking the name "Captain Marvel," Freddy can become the superpowered [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]]. Unlike Billy, Freddy retains his 14-year-old appearance as a superhero.<ref name="CMWritingBible" /> ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 (Dec. 1942) introduced Billy and Freddy to Mary Bromfield, a rich girl who turns out to be Billy's long-lost twin sister. By saying the magic word "Shazam," Mary Bromfield becomes [[Mary Marvel]].<ref>Captain Marvel Adventures #18 (1942)</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Schelly | first=Bill | year=2016 | title=Otto Binder: The Life and Work of a Comic Book and Science Fiction Visionary | location=Berkeley, CA | publisher=North Atlantic Books | isbn=1623170389 | pages=89–91}}</ref> In the Fawcett and pre-1986 DC stories, Mary remained a teenager as Freddy did in Marvel form; Ordway's 1990s ''Power of Shazam!'' series made her superpowered form an adult like Billy's.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #4 (1995)</ref> The Marvel Family also included non-powered honorary members such as [[Uncle Marvel]], an old con man who pretended to be Mary's uncle, and Freckles Marvel, an honorary cousin.

===Later DC origins===
The basic elements of Billy Batson's and Captain Marvel's origin story remained more or less intact through 2012, with minor alterations over the years. Roy & Dann Thomas' 1987 miniseries ''Shazam! The New Beginning'' had a 15-year old Billy being forced to move in with Doctor Sivana, who in this version is the cruel uncle who throws Billy out into the street.<ref name="STNB" /> Jerry Ordway's 1994 ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel, which became the character's definite origin through 2011, featured a ten-year-old Billy being chosen as the Wizard Shazam's champion, due to the influence of his archaeologist parents; the mysterious stranger from magic subway car is the ghost of Billy's father in this version.<ref name="POSgraphicnovel">{{Cite book | authorlink=Jerry Ordway | last=Ordway | first=Jerry | year=1994 | title=The Power of Shazam! | location=New York | publisher=DC Comics | isbn=1-56389-153-0}}</ref> Both the Thomases' and Ordway's retellings of the origin directly tie the need for the Wizard Shazam to draft a younger replacement to the coming re-emergence of [[Black Adam]], the wizard's first champion from the days of ancient Egypt who became evil and was due to escape thousands of years of banishment.<ref>''Shazam! The New Beginning'' #1-2 (1987)</ref><ref name="POSgraphicnovel" />

Ordway's origin added the extra element of Black Adam's alter ego/descendant Theo Adam being the murderer of Billy's parents.<ref name="POSgraphicnovel" /> The subsequent ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series features Billy, now 14,<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #1 (March 1995)</ref> meeting his long-lost sister Mary and best friend Freddy Freeman<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #3 (May 1995)</ref> and establishing the Marvel Family as in the Fawcett comics.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #4-7 (1995)</ref> The Marvels' home base of Fawcett City is depicted as a city full of old-fashioned traditions and architecture, later establishing that the Wizard Shazam placed a spell on the city (broken in later issues) that slowed time to a crawl in 1955.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #11 (January 1996)</ref> This phenomenon was used to explain the Marvel Family's sometimes anachronistic approaches to life and heroism compared to many of their contemporary heroes in the DC Universe.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #16 (June 1996), ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' (2004)</ref>

In 2012, writer and then-DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns revised Billy Batson's origin for DC's ''New 52'' universe, also renaming the character's alter-ego as "Shazam" at this time. In his new origin story, Billy Batson is a moody and troubled 15-year-old foster child living in [[Philadelphia]] who has gone through several foster homes.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #7 (May 2012)</ref> At his newest foster home under Victor & Rosa Vázquez, Billy gains five foster siblings: "den mother" Mary Bromfield, trickster and pick-pocket Freddy Freeman, shy and quiet Pedro Peña, brainy Eugene Choi, and energetic Darla Dudley.<ref name="JL8">''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #8 (April 2012)</ref> When the evil Dr. Sivana unleashes the ancient magical warrior Black Adam from his tomb,<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #9 (July 2012)</ref> the Wizard of the Rock of Eternity – the last of a council of beings who once controlled magic – begins abducting candidates to assess them for the job of being his champion.  He dismisses each of them for not being pure of heart.<ref name="JL0">''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #0 (Nov. 2012)</ref><ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #2, 7 (May 2012)</ref>

Eventually, the Wizard summons Billy, who is another unsuitable candidate, but Billy persuades the Wizard that perfectly good people "really don't exist," and that, while he himself tried to be good, the world dragged Billy down to its level. In desperation and seeing the "embers of good" within Billy, the dying Wizard passes on his powers and teaches Billy they can be accessed through the magic word "Shazam" when spoken with good intentions.  After saying the magic word, Billy is struck by a bolt of lightning which transforms him into Shazam, a super-powered adult possessing super-strength, flight, and vast magical powers. The Wizard dies and Shazam is transported back to Earth, where Billy reveals his new secret to Freddy.  The two scheme to make money and score beer with Shazam's new powers, but Shazam is instead led to crime scenes where he is needed as a hero. Shazam and Freddy have a falling out when Shazam refuses to change back into Billy, and as soon as Freddy heads back home, Shazam is attacked by Black Adam.<ref name="JL0" /> Billy is saved only by mending his relationships with Freddy, Mary, Eugene, Pedro, and Darla. When Adam again attacks, unleashing the Seven Deadly Sins on downtown Philadelphia and threatening to kill the other kids, Billy shares his powers with them, who all become magic-powered adult superheroes (save for Darla, who remains a child).<ref name="JL21" /> Ultimately, Billy goads Adam into saying the magic word and transforming into his human form, at which point he promptly turns to dust.<ref name="JL21">''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #21 (2013)</ref> Although he'd contemplated running away, Billy decides to stay with his new family, having learned to be a better and more open person.<ref name="JL21" />

Commencing the "[[Trinity War]]" story line, Billy flies to Black Adam's home nation of [[Kahndaq]] to bury Adam's remains. Shazam's entry into the country is interpreted by the locals as illegal US entry into their territory. This leads to run-ins with both the independent Justice League and the US-sponsored Justice League of America (JLA), and a series of events that see the opening of [[Pandora's Box]], a portal to [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]] which brings the evil Justice League analogues of the [[Crime Syndicate]] to Earth-0.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #22-23 (2013)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #6 (2013)</ref> Following the successful defeat of the Crime Syndicate, Shazam is inducted into the League.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #30 (2014)</ref> While still a newcomer to the league, Billy has a number of new adventures while under the mentorship of [[Victor Stone|Cyborg]], who becomes one of his best friends.<ref name="Justice League #31 2014">''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #31 (2014)</ref>

After a year of living in the Vázquez home, Billy and his foster siblings have taken to having fun fighting crime around Philadelphia as The Shazam Family. While exploring the Rock of Eternity, Eugene finds a formerly sealed off area of the Rock: an abandoned train station leading to the seven realms of an unexplored world known as the Magic Lands.

==Powers and abilities==
The character obtains powers through a transformation from a human persona into a superpowered entity. When the human persona, Billy Batson, says the magic word "''Shazam!''", he becomes the superpowered Captain Marvel/Shazam.

Though the link to the specific mythological figures is de-emphasized in some modern-day stories, traditionally the letters in the name ''Shazam'' each represent a specific superhuman ability:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''S''' || for the Wisdom of '''S'''olomon || As Captain Marvel/Shazam, Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge and objective. He possesses an excellent mental acuity and nearly infallible wisdom, including an innate understanding of most known languages and sciences. He also has a great understanding of divine phenomena in the mortal world. The wisdom of [[Solomon]] provides him with counsel and advice in times of need. In early Captain Marvel stories, Solomon's power also gave Marvel the ability to hypnotize people.<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #18 (1941)</ref>
|-
|'''H''' || for the Strength of '''H'''ercules || [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]]' power grants Captain Marvel/Shazam superhuman strength comparable to that of the legendary demigod, making him one of DC Comics' strongest characters. He is able to easily bend steel in his bare hands, do the work of several laborers in half the time, toss semi trucks high into the air, punch through walls, and lift massive objects. In the comics, this strength has been compared to that of Superman and other godlike superheroes and villains.<ref name=HE>{{cite web |last=Cimino |first=John |title=SUPERMAN VS CAPTAIN MARVEL The Definitive Write Up on the Greatest Rivalry in Comics |url= http://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2011/05/superman-vs-captain-marvel.html |work=Blog Adventures |publisher=Hero-Envy.com |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> The strength of the Golden Age Captain Marvel was unlimited,<ref name="CMA 28">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #28 (1943)</ref><ref name="CMA 139">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #139 (1952)</ref> and the character was strong enough to move stars and planets.<ref name="CMA 28"/><ref name="CMA 95">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #95 (1943)</ref><ref name="CMA 98">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #98 (1943)</ref><ref name="CMA 138">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #138 (1952)</ref>
|-
|'''A''' || for the Stamina of '''A'''tlas || Using [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]' stamina, Captain Marvel/Shazam can withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults, and heal from them within seconds without any seeming discomfort. The stamina of Atlas also prevents him from getting tired and provides him with a supernaturally endowed [[metabolism]] preventing fatigue, thirst and hunger.<ref name="WFC 257">''World's Finest Comics'' #257 (1979)</ref>
|-
|'''Z''' || for the Power of '''Z'''eus || [[Zeus]]' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel/Shazam, also enhances Marvel's other physical and mental abilities, and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks.<ref name="WFC 254">''World's Finest Comics'' #254 (1979)</ref> The hero can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or other target.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996)</ref><ref>''Shazam!'' Vol. 1 #28 (1977)</ref> The magic lightning has several uses, such as creating apparatus, restoring damage done to the hero, and providing fuel for magic spells. The current-continuity version of Shazam is able to personally generate and control lightning for various uses. He also can use it readily from his fingertips.<ref name="JL0" />
|-
|'''A''' || for the Courage of '''A'''chilles || This aspect is mostly psychological and spiritual in nature. The courage of [[Achilles]] gives Captain Marvel/Shazam the courage and bravery of the legendary Greek hero. In one story it is claimed to also give him fighting skills.<ref name="CMA 144">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #144 (1953)</ref>  It also aids the hero's mental fortitude against most mental attacks.

|-
|'''M''' || for the Speed of '''M'''ercury || By channeling [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'s speed, Captain Marvel/Shazam can move at superhuman speeds and fly, although in older comics he could only leap great distances. The Captain Marvel of pre-1985 stories was also able to travel to the Rock of Eternity by flying faster than the speed of light.<ref>''The Marvel Family'' #7 (1947)</ref>

Jerry Ordway's 1990s ''The Power of Shazam!'' series also gave Billy the added ability to alter Captain Marvel's appearance to his will by visualizing alterations and then saying "Shazam!"<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #6, 15 (1995)</ref> Billy uses this ability to disguise himself as his "uncle" to work and cash checks,<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #6 (1995)</ref> and to turn his Captain Marvel costume into a spacesuit for a mission in space.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #15 (1996)</ref>
>
In the late 2000s, when Billy replaced the wizard and took on a white costume and the name of "Marvel", he commanded the various magical abilities once owned by the wizard. However, he was required to remain on the Rock of Eternity and could only be away from it for 24 hours at a time.<ref>''The Trials of Shazam!'' #8 (2007)</ref>

Since the 2011 reboot, Shazam's powers have been slightly altered. Speaking the magic word "Shazam" does not cause a transformation if Billy does not want it to, and can be used to cast magic spells other than the transformation.<ref name="JL0" /> He can share his magical powers and bestow unique powers onto members of his family, "family" in this case extending to chosen and foster relations, without weakening himself.<ref>''Justice League'' #20, 21 (2014)</ref> Shazam also demonstrates the ability to use magic in as-yet-unexplored ways, on one occasion using it to conjure items.<ref>''Justice League'' #31 (2014)</ref>

==Other versions==

A significant number of "alternate" depictions of Shazam/Captain Marvel have appeared in DC publications since the 1970s.

===Captain Thunder (1974)===
In ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974), Superman found himself at odds with "Captain Thunder", a superhero displaced from another Earth and another time.  Thunder had been magically tricked by his archenemies in the Monster League of Evil into committing evil himself, which led to his doing battle with Superman. Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel's original moniker, was a thinly veiled [[pastiche]] of Marvel—down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named "Willie Fawcett" (a reference to the publisher of the original Captain Marvel stories, Fawcett Comics), and a magic word ("Thunder!"), which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers. He got his power from rubbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying "Thunder". His powers came from Tornado (power), Hare (speed), [[Uncas]] (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight), and Ram (tenacity). Superman held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell.

At the time of ''Superman'' #276, DC had been publishing ''Shazam!'' comics for two years, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications. The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in ''Justice League of America'' #137, two years later (although he met [[Lex Luthor]] in ''Shazam!'' #15, November/December 1974).

===Captain Thunder (1982)===
In 1983, a proposal for an updated Captain Marvel was submitted to DC by Roy Thomas, Don Newton, and Jerry Ordway.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> This version of the character, to be an inhabitant of DC's main Earth-One universe, rather than the Fawcett-based Earth-S universe, would have featured an African-American version of Billy Batson named "Willie Fawcett" (as in the 1974 story), who spoke the magic word "Shazam!" to become Captain Thunder, Earth-One's Mightiest Mortal.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> This alternate version of the character was never used.

===Captain Thunder (2011): ''Flashpoint''===
The 2011 ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' comics miniseries, written by Geoff Johns with art by [[Andy Kubert]], featured an alternate timeline accidentally created by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], who then helped the heroes of this timeline to restore history.  One of those heroes is Captain Thunder – an alternative version of Captain Marvel who has six alter-egos, rather than one, and a scarred face as the result of a fight with [[Wonder Woman]], who in this timeline is a villain.

The six children, collectively known as "S.H.A.Z.A.M.", each possess one of the six attributes of the power of Shazam, and must say the magic word together to become Captain Thunder. They are: an Asian-American boy named Eugene Choi, who possesses the wisdom of Solomon; an overweight Hispanic boy named Pedro Peña, who possesses the strength of Hercules; the Caucasians Mary Batson, Freddy Freeman and Billy Batson, who possess the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, and the courage of Achilles, respectively; and an African-American girl named Darla Dudley who possesses the speed of Mercury. Pedro's pet tiger Tawny also transforms into a more powerful version of himself via the magic lightning.<ref name="fp1">''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref>

The six children later transform into Captain Thunder to help Flash and his allies stop the war between [[Aquaman]]'s [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] army and Wonder Woman's [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] forces. Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Flash's accomplice [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]], who is revealed to be a traitor. Before the kids can re-form Captain Thunder, Billy is stabbed by the Amazon Penthesileia and killed.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref>

After the conclusion of the miniseries, the three new children from the ''Flashpoint'' timeline – Eugene, Pedro, and Darla – were incorporated into the DC Universe via the ''Shazam!'' backup strip in ''Justice League'', appearing as Billy, Mary, and Freddy's foster siblings.<ref name="New52ShazamCAReview" />

===''Elseworld's Finest''===
In the alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] book ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'' (1998), the current Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African American man; in a flashback to the older Justice Society, he appears as Captain Marvel typically has, leading to the conclusion that there were two Captain Marvels.

===''The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===
In the dark alternate future shown in ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Captain Marvel is visibly aged, with receding white hair and glasses. Lex Luthor, who has captured Mary Marvel, coerces him into working for him by threatening to kill her. During an alien attack on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out, and admits that Billy Batson – here, clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel, rather than simply transforming into him – died eight years ago of unspecified health problems. As a result, when he next speaks his word, he will cease to exist, like any dream that no longer has anyone to remember it.  His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best, noting that it was nice existing, before he calls down his lightning and destroys himself.

===''Superman: Distant Fires''===
In the dark alternate future of the [[Elseworlds]] comic ''Superman: Distant Fires'' (1998), where most of humanity has been destroyed in nuclear war, an adult Billy Batson becomes obsessed with Wonder Woman when they become part of a small community of survivors of the holocaust, with most of the surviving superhumans having lost their powers or dealing with altered abilities. When the now-powerless Clark Kent joins their community, Batson's resentment of Superman becomes insanity, as he provokes his transformation into Captain Marvel despite use of this power causing damage to Earth.

===''Kingdom Come''===
The 1996 miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', written by [[Mark Waid]] with painted art by [[Alex Ross]], depicts a possible future of the DC characters. In this version, Billy Batson is an adult who now matches the appearance of his superhero identity. The human hostility towards superheroes has made him uneasy, and he has not transformed into Captain Marvel for several years. Batson has become the brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor, who uses Mister Mind's mind-controlling worm offspring to keep him in check and bend him to his will. Nevertheless, Batson's potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them, believing it is a non-costumed Captain Marvel that serves Luthor.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #3 (1996). DC Comics.</ref>

Events finally cause him to transform into Captain Marvel, and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world. When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb, Captain Marvel &ndash; spurred by Superman telling him that due to his ties to both humanity and the superhuman community, he is the only one capable of choosing which one to save &ndash; intercepts the bomb and summons his lightning to detonate it while it is still airborne, sacrificing himself to save as many lives as possible, both human and metahuman. The nuclear blast still kills a large number of heroes, but does cool the war-like attitudes of the survivors. Superman uses Marvel's cape as the symbol of a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]] in which humans and superhumans will now live in harmony.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996). DC Comics.</ref>

===Earth-5===
In ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #52 (May 2, 2007), a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities, one of which is designated Earth-5.  As a result of Marvel Family foe [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-S, including the Marvel Family characters.

The Earth-5 Captain Marvel and Billy Batson appeared, assisting Superman, in the ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' miniseries.<ref>''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #1 (August 2008)</ref> The miniseries established that these versions of Captain Marvel and Billy are two separate beings, and that Billy is a reporter for WHIZ Media, rather than a radio broadcaster.  The Earth-5 Captain Marvel reappeared in ''Final Crisis'' #7, along with an army of Supermen from across the Multiverse to prevent its destruction by Darkseid.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> Following [[The New 52]] Multiverse reboot, Earth-5 remains a Fawcett Comics-inspired setting, and is spotlighted in the comic book ''[[The Multiversity]]: Thunderworld #1'' (Feb 2015), a modernized take on the classic Fawcett ''Captain Marvel'' stories from writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Cameron Stewart]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |title=GRANT MORRISON on MULTIVERSITY: It's Going to 'F' People Up |url= http://www.newsarama.com/21741-grant-morrison-on-multiversity-it-s-going-to-f-people-up.html |date=July 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |title=CAMERON STEWART Brings Back CAPTAIN MARVEL For THE MULTIVERSITY: THUNDERWORLD |url= http://www.newsarama.com/23047-vivisecting-multiversity-cameron-stewart-brings-back-captain-marvel-for-thunderworld.html |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=December 30, 2014}}</ref>

===''Justice League: Generation Lost''===
A female version of Captain Marvel is shown as a member of an alternate-future Justice League in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''.  Little is revealed about her, other than the fact that her civilian name is Sahar Shazeen, and she is shown wielding a pair of swords during battle.  She and her teammates are ultimately killed by an army of [[OMAC (comics)|Omni Mind And Community (OMACs)]].<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14. DC Comics.</ref>

===''Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil''===
A Captain Marvel miniseries, ''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]'', written and illustrated by [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] (creator of ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''), was published in four 48-page installments between February and July 2007.  Smith's ''Shazam!'' miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, which updates and reimagines Captain Marvel's origin.<ref>{{cite web | last=Warmoth | first=Brian | url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm | title=The Strategem of Smith (cached) | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date=February 7, 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210063430/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm | archivedate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Smith's story features a younger-looking Billy Batson and Captain Marvel as separate personalities, as they were in the pre-1985 stories, and features a prepubescent Mary Marvel as Captain Marvel's sidekick, instead of the traditional teen-aged or adult versions. Dr. Sivana is [[Attorney General of the United States]], and Mister Mind looks more like a snake than a caterpillar.

===''Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!''===
An all-ages Captain Marvel comic, ''[[Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!]]'', debuted in July 2008 under DC's [[Johnny DC]] youth-oriented imprint, and was published monthly through December 2010.  Following the lead and continuity of Smith's ''Monster Society of Evil'' miniseries, it was initially written and drawn by [[Mike Kunkel]], creator of ''Herobear''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Pumpelly | first=Danny | date=August 11, 2007 | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11575 | title=WWC: DC New Worlds Order | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> [[Art Baltazar]] and [[Franco Aureliani]], of ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', took over as writers with issue #5, with Byron Vaughns as main artist until issue #13, when [[Mike Norton]] assumed his place for the remainder of the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2077 | title=Review: Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam! #14 | work=Comic Book Resources | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> Kunkel's version returns to the modern concept of having Captain Marvel retain Billy's personality, and also introduces new versions of Black Adam (whose alter ego, Theo Adam, is a child like Billy Batson in this version), [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]], the [[List of Marvel Family enemies (A-G)#Arson Fiend|Arson Fiend]], and Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel, Jr.

===Mazahs===
Mazahs is a corrupted alternate-universe version of Shazam, introduced in the 2013&ndash;14 ''[[Forever Evil]]'' DC Comics crossover event series. He is the super-powered alter-ego of [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-3|Alexander Luthor]] of [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=Friend, Richard|colorist=Oback, Sonia|letterer=Leigh, Rob|story=Forever Evil Chapter Six: The Power of Mazahs!|title=Forever Evil|volume=1|issue=6|date=May 2014|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> In the story, the [[Crime Syndicate]] (evil Earth-3 analogues of the Justice League) have brought Alexander Luthor, their prisoner, with them to the Prime Earth where the Justice League and other heroes reside. Prime Earth's [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Injustice League|his team]] sneak in to the Justice League Watchtower where the Syndicate has Alexander hostage, and remove the duct tape over his mouth, allowing Alexander to speak the magic word "Mazahs!" and transform into his muscular, highly powerful alter-ego. While Prime Earth's Shazam is known for sharing his powers with others, Mazahs kills other superbeings and takes their powers for his own, as when he kills the Syndicate's speedster [[Johnny Quick]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> In the final issue of the series, it is revealed that Earth-3's Wonder Woman analogue, [[Superwoman]], is in a relationship with Alexander and tricked her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor's team, but Prime Earth Lex Luthor (having the same voice as Mazahs) manages to call down the lightning, using a lightning-rod that Batman had retrieved to try and use against Johnny Quick based on his planned defense against the Flash, and transform Mazahs into his human form. Sealing Alexander's mouth, Lex stabs him with a knife, killing him.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

Superwoman later gives birth to Mazahs's child in ''Justice League'' #50, and uses the baby's power-stealing abilities - inherited from his father and by her using his magic word—to remove abilities the members the Prime-Earth Justice League had inherited from their time on [[Apokolips]] after the death of [[Darkseid]]. The story ends with the orphaned baby having absorbed both the [[Omega Effect]] from Lex Luthor as well as the [[Anti-Life Equation]] from Justice League associate [[Steve Trevor]], transforming him into a resurrected—yet still infantile—Darkseid.<ref>''Justice League'' #50 #7. DC Comics.</ref>

===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===
In the prequel comic to the 2013 video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Shazam joins Superman's Regime in establishing a new approach to ending crime. Similar to the Golden Age version, this Shazam is suggested to have two personalities: Billy Batson is a separate person from Shazam. In Year One he, like the Flash, is somewhat skeptical of Superman's intentions, as his actions are often immoral. Ultimately, Shazam decides to stay and support the Regime, devoted to its cause. He becomes the object of Harley Quinn's affection, being bound and gagged by her in Year Four.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bamsmackpow.com/2016/05/13/injustice-gods-among-us-year-five-chapter-21/ |title=Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year Five Chapter 21 Review |date=2016-05-13 |website=Bam Smack Pow |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> He is freed by [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] to join the Regime in combating the Amazon army and Greek gods, but just when they seem to be winning Zeus strips him of his powers, reverting him to Billy permanently.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/injustice-gods-among-us/256603/injustice-gods-among-us-deaths |title=The Many Deaths of Injustice: Gods Among Us |website=Den of Geek |language=en |access-date=2018-09-23}}</ref> He, Harley (for trying to help him), and Wonder Woman’s mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] are sent to the abyss of [[Tartarus (DC Comics)|Tartarus]] as punishment, though they escape and Billy is left out of the conflict without his powers. Eventually, Zeus is forced to return Billy's power after the [[Highfather]] of [[New Genesis]] intervenes in the conflict. In Year Five, Shazam's relationship with Harley is complicated when she confronts him about being in the Regime despite their growing tyranny.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

{{see also|Marvel Family}}
In the traditional ''Shazam!'' stories, Captain Marvel often fights evil as a member of a superhero team known as the Marvel Family, made up of himself and several other heroes: empowered by the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]]. The main core of the Marvel Family were Captain Marvel's sister [[Mary Marvel]], the alter-ego of Billy Batson's twin sister Mary Batson (adopted as Mary Bromfield), and Marvel's protégé, [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]], who was the alter-ego of Billy and Mary's best friend, the disabled newsboy Freddy Freeman. Before DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earth]]s'' comic book miniseries in 1985, the Marvel Family also included part-time members such as Mary's non-powered friend "Uncle" Dudley ([[Uncle Marvel]]) and three other protégés (all of whose alter egos are named "Billy Batson") known as the [[Lieutenant Marvels]]. A pink rabbit version of Captain Marvel, [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]], appeared in his own stories featuring a [[funny-animal]] cast.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/dc-marvel-family-shazam-hoppy-wonder-bunny/ |title=DC's Marvel Family Just Got Its Weirdest Member Back |date=2018-12-07 |website=CBR |language=en-US |access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>

The current-continuity version of Shazam has a Shazam Family made up of his five foster siblings, with whom he can share his powers at will: Mary Bromfield, Freddy Freeman, Pedro Peña, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley. Shazam can also share his powers with Tawny, a tiger at the local city zoo whom he considers family.<ref name="JL21" />

The Marvel Family's non-powered allies have traditionally included Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult offspring, Beautia and Magnificus Sivana; [[Mister Tawky Tawny|Mister "Tawky" Tawny]] the talking tiger; WHIZ radio president and Billy's employer Sterling Morris; and Billy's girlfriend Cissie Sommerly. The 1970s ''Shazam!'' series also included Sunny Sparkle, the "nicest boy in the world." Jerry Ordway's 1990s ''Power of Shazam!'' series also introduced Billy's school principal Miss Wormwood and Mary's adoptive parents Nick and Nora Bromfield. The New 52 reboot of ''Shazam!'' introduced the Shazam kids' foster parents, Victor and Rosa Vázquez.<ref name="JL8" />

===Enemies===
{{main|List of Marvel Family enemies}}
Over the course of his adventures, Captain Marvel/Shazam has gained an extensive [[rogues gallery]], the most infamous of whom include the evil [[mad scientist]] Doctor [[Thaddeus Bodog Sivana]]; Sivana's two teenaged children, Georgia and Sivana Jr. (collectively known with their father as The Sivana Family); Shazam's corrupted previous champion [[Black Adam]], who has powers from Egyptian gods; Adolf Hitler's champion [[Captain Nazi]]; and the mind-controlling worm, [[Mister Mind]], and his [[Monster Society of Evil]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74811870 |title=The Shazam!

===Live-action films===
The first filmed adaptation of Captain Marvel was produced in 1941.

===Direct-to-video animated films===
*Captain Marvel's first appearance in [[Warner Bros. Animation]]'s line of [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] direct-to-video films was a brief cameo in 2008's ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. The character had a more substantial role in the 2009 animated film ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', based on a ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' comic book arc in which Marvel battles Superman under orders from United States President Lex Luthor. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Corey Burton]].  An uncredited [[Rachael MacFarlane]] voiced Billy Batson.
*An evil version of Captain Marvel, named '''Captain Super''', has a minor role in the 2010 animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]].'' One of the film's main villains, and Captain Super's superior, is [[Superwoman]] of the [[Crime Syndicate]] of the alternate universe Earth-3, who in this film is an evil counterpart of Mary Marvel.
*Captain Marvel appears in a animated short film entitled ''[[Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam]],'' released on the ''DC Showcase Original Shorts Collection'' DVD compilation as part of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], 2010. [[Jerry O'Connell]] returns from the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated TV show as the voice of Captain Marvel, with Billy Batson voiced by [[Zach Callison]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1007/10/ | title=DC Showcase Animated Shorts | work=Comics Continuum | date=July 10, 2010 | accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Collura | first=Scott | url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/110/1108411p1.html | title=SDCC 10: DC Shorts Showcase | work=IGN | date=July 25, 2010 | accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Harvey | first=James | url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=884 | title=Main Cast, Crew Details for ''Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam'' | work=Worlds Finest Online | date=October 29, 2010 | accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>
*''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'', the 2013 animated adaptation of the alternate-universe comics story ''Flashpoint'' features Captain Thunder and the S! H! A! Z! A! M! kids as supporting characters. Pedro Peña and Billy Batson are voiced by [[Candi Milo]] and [[Jennifer Hale]] respectively, with '''Captain Thunder''' voiced by [[Steven Blum]].
*In 2014, the character – now renamed Shazam – appeared in the animated film ''[[Justice League: War]]''. Zach Callison reprised his role as Billy Batson, and Shazam is voiced by [[Sean Astin]]. Billy is depicted as living in a foster home with Freddy (voiced by [[Georgie Kidder]]) and Darla (voiced by [[Kimberly Brooks]]). A fan of high school football star Vic Stone (aka [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]), Billy gets to work alongside his hero as Shazam to help the Justice League fight [[Darkseid]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://nerdist.com/review-justice-league-war |title= Review: JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR {{!}} Nerdist |date= 2014-02-05 |website= Nerdist |language=en |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref> Shazam also appears in the sequel, ''[[Justice League: Throne of Atlantis]]'' (2015), voiced again by Sean Astin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lylesmoviefiles.com/2015/01/29/justice-league-throne-of-atlantis-review-aquaman-gets-the-throne-not-spotlight/ |title=Justice League:Throne of Atlantis review |date=2015-01-29 |website=Lyles Movie Files |language=en-US |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref> He does not appear in the animated film ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'' (2016), although his absence is mentioned by other Justice League members.

====1970s-1990s====
*Captain Marvel first came to television in 1974. [[Filmation]] produced ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'', a live-action television show, which ran from 1974 to 1977 on [[CBS]].<ref name="Shazam1974TV">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33898297 |title=Total television : the comprehensive guide to programming from 1948 to the present |last=1948- |first=McNeil, Alex, |date=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0140249168 |edition=  4th |location=New York |pages=748 |oclc=33898297}}</ref> From 1975 until the end of its run, it aired as one-half of ''The Shazam!/Isis Hour'', featuring Filmation's own ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' as a companion program.<ref name="Shazam1974TV" /><ref name="Isis1975TV">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33898297 |title=Total television : the comprehensive guide to programming from 1948 to the present |last=1948- |first=McNeil, Alex, |date=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0140249168 |edition=  4th |location=New York |pages=413 |oclc=33898297}}</ref>
*Instead of directly following the lead of the comics, the ''Shazam!'' TV show took a more indirect approach to the character: Billy Batson/Captain Marvel, accompanied by an older man known simply as Mentor ([[Les Tremayne]]), traveled in a motor home across the US, interacting with people in different towns in which they stopped to save the citizens from some form of danger or to help them combat some form of evil.  With the wizard Shazam absent from this series, Billy received his powers and counsel directly from the six "immortal elders" represented in the "Shazam" name, who were depicted via animation: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. ''Shazam!'' starred [[Michael Gray (actor)|Michael Gray]] as Billy Batson, with both [[Jackson Bostwick]] (season 1) and [[John Davey (actor)|John Davey]] (seasons 2 and 3) as Captain Marvel.<ref>{{IMDb title|0071050|Shazam!}}</ref> An adapted version of Isis, the heroine of ''The Secrets of Isis'', was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam's wife in the weekly comic book series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.
*Shortly after the ''Shazam!'' show ended its network run, Captain Marvel (played by Garrett Craig) appeared as a character in a pair of low-budget, live-action comedy specials, produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] under the name ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' in 1979.<ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= [[IGN]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p6.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref>  The specials also featured [[Howard Morris]] as Doctor Sivana, and [[Ruth Buzzi]] as Aunt Minerva, marking the first appearance of those characters in film or television.  Although Captain Marvel did not appear in Hanna-Barbera's long-running concurrent [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series ''[[Super Friends]]'' (which featured many of the other DC superheroes), he did appear in some of the merchandise associated with the show.
*Filmation revisited the character three years later for an animated ''Shazam!'' cartoon program, which ran on [[NBC]] from 1981 to 1982 as part of ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'' accompanied by ''[[Hero High]]''<ref name="KidSuperpower">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33898297 |title=Total television : the comprehensive guide to programming from 1948 to the present |last=1948- |first=McNeil, Alex, |date=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0140249168 |edition=  4th |location=New York |pages=450 |oclc=33898297}}</ref> Captain Marvel and Billy Batson were both voiced by Burr Middleton. The rest of the Marvel Family joined Captain Marvel on his adventures in this series, which were more similar to his comic-book adventures than the 1970s TV show.  Dr. Sivana, Mr. Mind, Black Adam, and other familiar Captain Marvel foes appeared as enemies.<ref name="KidSuperpower" />
*Captain Marvel and/or Billy Batson made brief "cameo" appearances in two 1990s TV series.  Billy has a non-speaking cameo in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Obsession", while live actors portraying Captain Marvel make "cameo" appearances in both a dream-sequence within an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and in the [[Beastie Boys]]' music video for "Alive".

*Captain Marvel's first formal appearance in a DCAU production was as the main guest star character of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Clash", originally aired in 2005 on [[Cartoon Network]]. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Jerry O'Connell]], and Billy Batson by [[Shane Haboucha]]. In this episode, Captain Marvel joins the Justice League, but his positive opinions about supervillain Lex Luthor's apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman. This tension eventually leads to an all-out battle between Marvel and Superman when Superman believes the generator Luthor built under a city is really a bomb.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/justice-league-unlimited-clash-1798180494 |title=Justice League Unlimited: "Clash" |last=Sava |first=Oliver |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |language=en-US |access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref> Despite Shazam having magical powers (a weakness of Superman), Superman defeats him when as Marvel says "SHAZAM!", Superman lifts Marvel over his head, causing the lightning to hit Marvel instead and turn him into Billy. Billy tries to say the magic word, but he only makes it to the Z before Superman slaps his hand on his mouth. Superman destroys the device, but its remains are examined and it turns out to really be a generator. Despite Superman trying to apologize, Captain Marvel quits the Justice League in disgust. At the end of the episode is revealed that Captain Marvel has been only used because the clash between the two superheroes was part of a big plot organized by Lex Luthor and Amanda waller to discredit Superman. Neither Captain Marvel nor Justice League find out about this, so the first doesn't comeback or makes peace with his former teammates.

===Radio===
In about 1943, a radio serial of Captain Marvel was briefly broadcast (possibly by either [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] or [[NBC]]) initially with Burt Boyar as Billy Batson. According to Boyar's faint memories in a 2011 interview, the show was initially produced in New York but after about a month relocated to Chicago; no further details about the show or transcripts of it survived. Existence of the show was confirmed by historian [[Jim Harmon]] via recollections of old time radio fans who recalled hearing it during original broadcasts, plus locating period program listings.<ref>Hamerlinck, P.C. (June 2012) "The Boy Who Was Billy Batson: The Captain Marvel Radio Show Mystery". [[Alter Ego (magazine)|''Alter Ego'']] (TwoMorrows Publishing) (110): 75-79.</ref>

===Comic strips===
In 1943, C. C. Beck and writer Rod Reed prepared seven sample installments of a comic strip, but syndicates expressed no interest in it.  Reed suspected that the DC lawsuit was the syndicates' reason, for fear of becoming parties in the ongoing litigation.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Beck | first=C.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Captain Marvel vs. Superman in fiction===

Captain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] in general.  The most notable contribution is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] comic book stories.  The two are often portrayed as equally matched and, while Marvel does not possess Superman's [[Heat vision (fiction)|heat vision]], X-ray vision or superhuman breath powers, the magic-based nature of his own powers are a weakness for Superman.

The National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in "[[Superduperman]]",<ref>Wright, p. 146.</ref> a satirical comic book story by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]] in the fourth issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (April/May 1953).  Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature.  Marbles' magic word is "SHAZOOM", which stands for '''S'''trength, '''H'''ealth, '''A'''ptitude, '''Z'''eal, '''O'''x (power of), '''O'''x (power of another), and '''M'''oney.  In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal.  Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.

While publishing its ''Shazam!'' revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name.  He apparently battles against a Monster League, who cast a spell to make him evil, but Superman helps him break free.<ref>''Superman'' #276 (June 1974)</ref> Two years later, ''Justice League of America'' #135–137 presented a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies.  It is in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first meet, albeit briefly. [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] has caused Superman to go mad using [[red kryptonite]], meaning he and Marvel battle, but Marvel restores his mind to normal with lightning.

In ''Shazam!'' #30 (1977), Dr. Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh's steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of ''[[Action Comics]]''.  He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the robot is destroyed.

Notable later Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include ''[[All-New Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (1978), ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #36–37 (1984), and ''[[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]'' vol. 2, #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in ''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996) serves as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes. The "Clash" episode of the DC-based animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which includes Captain Marvel as a guest character, features a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece. By contrast, the depiction of the pair's first meeting in the ''Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder'' miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy's mentor when he learns the boy's true age.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Cimino |first = John |title = Superman vs. Captain Marvel The Definitive Write-Up on the Greatest Rivalry in Comics |journal= Back Issue! |issue = 66 |pages = 69–77 |publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing |date = August 2013}}</ref>
