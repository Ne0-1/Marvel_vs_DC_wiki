'''Captain Marvel''' is a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] [[superhero]], originally published by [[Fawcett Comics]] and later by [[DC Comics]]. Created in 1939 by artist [[C. C. Beck]] and writer [[Bill Parker]], the character first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 (February 1940). With a premise that taps adolescent fantasy, Captain Marvel is the [[alter ego]] of '''Billy Batson''', a youth who works as a [[radio]] [[Journalist|news reporter]] and was chosen to be a champion of good by the [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]] [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]]. Whenever Billy speaks the wizard's name, he is instantly struck by a magic lightning bolt that transforms him into an adult superhero empowered with the abilities of six legendary figures.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Captain Marvel | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 70–71 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> Several friends and family members, most notably [[Marvel Family]] cohorts [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel Jr.]], can share Billy's power and become "Marvels" themselves.

Hailed as ''"The World's Mightiest Mortal"'' in his adventures, Captain Marvel was nicknamed ''"The Big Red Cheese"'' by arch-villain [[Doctor Sivana]], an epithet later adopted by Captain Marvel's fans. Based on sales, Captain Marvel was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, as his ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' comic book series sold more copies than ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' and other competing superhero books during the mid-1940s.<ref name="TiptonMoviePoopShoot">{{cite web | last =Tipton | first =Scott | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The World's Mightiest Mortal | work = | publisher = |date=2003-04-01 | url =http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | doi = | accessdate = 2005-06-17 }}Excerpt: "I’ve always felt that it was this origin story and concept that made Captain Marvel instantly popular, to the point that it was outselling every comic on the stands for several years throughout the '40s."</ref><ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum">{{cite web | last =The Museum of Comic Book Advertising | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Comic Book Success Stories | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://comicbookads.leafpublishing.com/hall-of-covers/cover-display2-page2.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2005-06-17 }}</ref> Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted to film, in a 1941 [[Republic Pictures]] [[film serial|serial]] titled ''[[Adventures of Captain Marvel]]''.

Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, due in part to a [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|copyright infringement suit from DC Comics]] alleging that Captain Marvel was an illegal infringement of Superman. In 1972, DC licensed the Marvel Family characters and returned them to publication, acquiring all rights to the characters by 1991. DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their [[DC Universe]], and have attempted to revive the property several times. However, Captain Marvel has not regained widespread appeal with new generations, although a ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'' live-action Saturday morning television series featuring the character ran for three seasons on [[CBS]] in the 1970s.

Because [[Marvel Comics]] trademarked their ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' comic book during the interim between the original Captain Marvel's Fawcett years and DC years, DC Comics is unable to promote and market their Captain Marvel/Marvel Family properties under that name. Since 1972, DC has instead used the trademark ''Shazam!'' as the title of their comic books and thus the name under which they market and promote the character. Consequently, Captain Marvel himself is frequently erroneously referred to as ''Shazam''.

===Development and inspirations===
[[Image:Whiz2.JPG|thumb|200px|''Whiz Comics'' #2 (February 1940), the first appearance of Captain Marvel. Cover art by C. C. Beck.]]
After the success of [[DC Comics|National Comics]]' new superhero characters [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], [[Fawcett Publications]] decided in 1939 to start its own comics division. Fawcett recruited writer Bill Parker to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled ''Flash Comics''. Besides penning stories featuring [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Lance O'Casey]], [[Scoop Smith]], and [[Dan Dare (Fawcett Comics)|Dan Dare]] for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure. Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called "Captain Thunder."<ref name="JohnnyShazam">{{cite web | last = Hembeck | first = Fred | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Johnny Thunder and Shazam! | work = | publisher = The Hembeck Files |date=2003-06-18 | url = http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/shazam2.html | doi = | accessdate = 2005-06-22 }}</ref> Staff artist Clarence Charles "C. C." Beck was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat [[cartoon]]y style that became his trademark.

The first issue of the comic book, printed as both ''Flash Comics'' #1 and ''Thrill Comics'' #1, had a low-print run in the fall of 1939 as an [[ashcan copy]] created for advertising purposes. Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark "Captain Thunder," "Flash Comics," or "Thrill Comics," because all three names were already in use. Consequently, the book was renamed ''Whiz Comics'', and Fawcett artist [[Pete Costanza]] suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to "Captain Marvelous", which the editors shortened to "Captain Marvel." The [[Speech balloon|word balloon]]s in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as "Captain Marvel." ''Whiz Comics'' #2, dated February 1940, was published in late 1939. Since it was the first of that title to actually be published, the issue is sometimes referred to as ''Whiz Comics'' #1, despite the issue number printed on it.

Inspirations for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources. His visual appearance was modeled after that of [[Fred MacMurray]], a popular American actor of the period. C. C. Beck's later versions of the character would resemble other American actors, including [[Cary Grant]] and [[Jack Oakie]]. Fawcett Publications' founder, Wilford H. Fawcett, was nicknamed "Captain Billy," which inspired the name "Billy Batson" and Marvel's title as well. Fawcett's earliest magazine was titled ''[[Fawcett Publications|Captain Billy's Whiz Bang]]'', which inspired the title ''Whiz Comics''. In addition, Fawcett adapted several of the elements that had made Superman, the first popular comic book superhero, popular (super strength and speed, science-fiction stories, a mild mannered reporter alter ego), and incorporated them into Captain Marvel. Fawcett's circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff, "give me a Superman, only have his other identity be a 10 or 12-year-old boy rather than a man."<ref name=" likeSupes">

As a result, Captain Marvel was given a twelve-year-old boy named Billy Batson as the alter ego. In the origin story printed in ''Whiz Comics'' #2, Billy, a homeless newsboy, is led by a mysterious stranger to a secret subway tunnel. An odd subway car with no visible driver takes them past Seven statues depicting the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man to the lair of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], who grants Billy the power to become the adult superhero Captain Marvel and shows him his life, after which a stone above Shazam's head crushes him, although his ghost says he will give advice when a brazier is lighted. In order to transform into Captain Marvel, Billy must speak the wizard's name, an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for the six various legendary figures who had agreed to grant aspects of themselves to a willing subject: the wisdom of [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]]; the strength of [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]]; the stamina of [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]]; the power of [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]]; the courage of [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]]; and the speed of [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]]. Speaking the word produces a bolt of magic lightning which transforms Billy into Captain Marvel; speaking the word again reverses the transformation with another bolt of lightning.

Captain Marvel wore a bright red costume, inspired by both military uniforms and [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] costumes as depicted in popular [[opera]]s, with gold trim and a lightning bolt insignia on the chest. The body suit originally included a buttoned [[lapel]], but was changed to a one-piece skintight suit within a year at the insistence of the editors (the current DC costume of the character has the lapel restored to it since 1994). The costume also included a white-collared [[cape]] trimmed with gold flower symbols, usually asymmetrically thrown over the left shoulder and held around his neck by a gold cord. The cape came from the ceremonial cape worn by the [[British nobility]], photographs of which appeared in newspapers in the 1930s.

In addition to introducing the main character and his alter ego, Captain Marvel's first adventure in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil [[Doctor Sivana]], and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter. Captain Marvel was an instant success, with ''Whiz Comics'' #2 selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum">{{cite web

Captain Marvel's circulation numbers exceeded National's Superman title and the rivalry between the companies led National to sue Fawcett for plagiarism."</ref> By 1941, he had his own solo series, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', while continuing to appear in ''Whiz Comics'' as well. He also made periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including ''Master Comics''.

===Fawcett years: the Marvel Family, allies, and enemies===
Through his adventures, Captain Marvel soon gained a host of enemies. His most frequent foe was [[Doctor Sivana]], a [[mad scientist]] who was determined to rule the world, yet was thwarted by Captain Marvel at every turn. He had two non-evil children, the beautiful Beautia who loved Captain Marvel, and superstrong Magnificus. Sivana's evil children, Georgia and Sivana, Jr., were later introduced to the comics, and they resembled their father both physically and mentally. Marvel's other villains included [[Adolf Hitler]]'s champion [[Captain Nazi]], an older Egyptian renegade Marvel called [[Black Adam]] (whose sole Golden Age appearance was in ''Marvel Family'' #1), an evil magic-powered brute named [[Ibac]], who gained powers from historical villains, and an artificially intelligent [[Nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] [[robot]] called [[Mister Atom]]. The most notorious Captain Marvel villains, however, were the nefarious [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] and his Monster Society of Evil, which recruited several of Marvel's previous adversaries. The "Monster Society of Evil" story arc ran as a twenty-five chapter serial in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #22–46 (March 1943 – May 1945), with Mister Mind eventually revealed to be a highly intelligent yet tiny [[worm]] from another planet. The Monster Society was the first criminal group in comics with members from past stories, including Sivana, Ibac, and Captain Nazi, along with new foes, like Herkimer the crocodile man and a multi-headed Hydra. Even Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo were members, along with other Nazis. The Society tried many plans, firstly trying to use Captain Nazi to steal magic fortune-telling pearls, using a film to intimidate the world, and even trying to use a giant cannon to blow holes in countries. Mr. Mind is eventually executed in the electric chair for 186,744 murders at the end of the arc, but would be reintroduced decades later in DC Comics' ''Shazam!'' #2.

In the early 1940s, Captain Marvel also gained allies in the Marvel Family, a collective of superheroes with powers and/or costumes similar to Captain Marvel's. (By comparison, Superman spin-off character [[Superboy]] first appeared in 1944, while [[Supergirl]] first appeared in 1959). ''Whiz Comics'' #21 (September 1941) marked the debut of the [[Lieutenant Marvels]], the alter egos of three other boys (all also named Billy Batson) who found that, by saying "Shazam!" in unison, they too could become Marvels. In ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (December 1941), a friend named Freddy Freeman, mortally wounded by an attack from Captain Nazi, was given the power to become teenage boy superhero Captain Marvel Jr. with a distinctive gold on blue version of the Marvel costume. A year later in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 (December 1942), Billy and Freddy met Billy's long-lost [[twin]] sister Mary Bromfield, who discovered she could, by saying the magic word "Shazam," become teenage superheroine Mary Marvel, although the pre-''Crisis'' Mary Marvel got her power from 'goddesses'.

"Fat" Marvel; [[Captain Marvel Jr.]]; Lt. "Tall" Marvel; Lt. "Hillbilly" Marvel; and [[Mary Marvel]]. [[Uncle Marvel]] can be seen seated at the piano in the background.]]
Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr. were featured as a team in a new comic series entitled ''The Marvel Family''. This was published alongside the other Captain Marvel-related titles, which now included ''Wow Comics'' featuring Mary, ''Master Comics'' featuring Junior, and both ''Mary Marvel Comics'' and ''Captain Marvel Jr. Comics''. Non-super-powered Marvels such as the "lovable [[Confidence trick|con artist]]" [[Uncle Marvel]] and his niece, Freckles Marvel, also sometimes joined the other Marvels on their adventures. A [[funny animal]] spin-off, [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]], was created in 1942 for ''Fawcett's Funny Animals'' comics, and later given a series of his own.

As with other superheroes, Captain Marvel had a number of non-powered friends and associates as well. These included Mr. Morris, Billy's employer at WHIZ radio; Joan Jameson, Billy's secretary (and one of the few people to know his secret identity); Beautia Sivana, Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult daughter who had a crush on Captain Marvel and only periodically joined forces with her father (and usually by force); and Dexter Knox, an intelligent young scientist who was a friend of Billy's friends. The most prolific of Captain Marvel's supporting characters at Fawcett was Mister Tawky Tawny, an anthropomorphic tiger who'd been fed a serum that allowed him to learn to speak and stand upright.

The members of the Marvel Family often teamed up with the other Fawcett superheroes, who included Ibis the Invincible, [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl]], Spy Smasher, [[Minute-Man]], and [[Mr. Scarlet]] & Pinky. Among the many artists and writers who worked on the Marvel Family stories alongside C. C. Beck and main writer [[Otto Binder]] were [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], [[Mac Raboy]], Pete Costanza, [[Kurt Schaffenberger]], and [[Marc Swayze]].

Through much of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium with his comics outselling all others, including those featuring Superman.

Billy Batson typically narrated each Captain Marvel story, [[fourth wall|speaking directly to his reading audience]] from his WHIZ radio microphone, relating each story from the perspective of a young boy.

Detective Comics (later known as National Comics Publications, National Periodical Publications, and today known as DC Comics) sued Fawcett Comics for [[copyright infringement]] in 1941, alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman. After seven years of litigation, the ''[[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications]]'' case went to trials court in 1948. Although the judge presiding over the case decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement, DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their ''Superman'' daily [[Superman (comic strip)|newspaper strips]], and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss">Ingersoll, Bob (31 May 1985).

Fawcett Publishing''.</ref> As a result, the initial verdict, delivered in 1951, was decided in Fawcett's favor.

National appealed this decision, and Judge [[Learned Hand]] declared in 1952 that National's Superman copyright was in fact valid. Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement, but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements, and that the truth of this would have to be determined in a re-trial of the case. The judge therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss" />

Instead of retrying the case, however, Fawcett decided to settle with National out of court. The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regards to Captain Marvel.

===''Marvelman'' (and ''Miracleman'')===
{{Main|Marvelman}}

In the 1950s, a small British publisher, [[L. Miller and Son]], published a number of black and white reprints of American comic books, including the Captain Marvel series. With the outcome of the ''National v. Fawcett'' lawsuit, L. Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer, [[Mick Anglo]], who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called ''[[Marvelman]]''. Captain Marvel Jr. was adapted to create ''Young Marvelman'', while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male ''Kid Marvelman''. The magic word "Shazam!" was replaced with "Kimota", "Atomik" backwards. The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's United Kingdom series with issue number 25.

Marvelman ceased publication in 1963, but was revived in 1982 by writer [[Alan Moore]] in the pages of ''Warrior Magazine''. Beginning in 1985, Moore's black and white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by Eclipse Comics under the new title ''[[Miracleman]]'' (as [[Marvel Comics]] now existed and objected to the use of ''Marvel'' in the title), and continued publication in the United States after ''Warrior'''s demise. Within the metatextual storyline of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Alan Moore and later ''Marvelman/Miracleman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]].

In 2009, [[Marvel Comics]] obtained the rights to the original 1950s ''Marvelman'' characters and stories.

===The M. F. Enterprises Captain Marvel===
In 1966, [[M. F. Enterprises]] produced their own Captain Marvel: an [[Android (robot)|android]] superhero from another planet whose main characteristic was the ability to split his body into several parts, each of which could move on its own. He triggered the separation by shouting "Split!" and reassembled himself by shouting "Xam!" He had a young human ward named Billy Baxton. This Captain Marvel, who didn't last long, was credited in the comic as being "based on a character created by [[Carl Burgos]]."<ref>{{comicbookdb|character|7827|Captain Marvel (M.F.)}}</ref>

===DC Comics' ''Shazam!'' revival===
When superhero comics became popular again in the mid-1960s in what is now called the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Fawcett was unable to revive Captain Marvel because in order to settle the lawsuit it had agreed never to publish the character again. Carmine Infantino, publisher of DC Comics, licensed the characters from Fawcett in 1972, and DC began planning a revival. Because Marvel Comics had by this time established ''Captain Marvel'' as a comic book trademark, DC published their book under the name ''Shazam!'' Since then, that title has become so linked to Captain Marvel that many people have taken to identifying the character as "Shazam" instead of his actual name.

The ''Shazam!'' comic series began with issue #1, dated February 1973. It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s. The first story attempted to explain the Marvel Family's absence by stating that they, Dr. Sivana, Sivana's children, and most of the supporting cast had been accidentally trapped in [[suspended animation]] for twenty years when the Sivanas attempted to put the Marvels into suspended animation, until finally breaking free when the Suspendium globe moved towards the Sun.

[[Dennis O'Neil]] was the primary writer of the book; his role was later taken over by writers [[Elliot S. Maggin]] and [[E. Nelson Bridwell]]. [[C. C. Beck]] drew stories for the first ten issues of the book before quitting due to creative differences; [[Bob Oksner]] and Fawcett alumnus [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] were among the later artists of the title.

With DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] concept in effect during this time, it was stated that the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of "Earth-S". While the series began with a great deal of fanfare, the book had a lackluster reception. The creators themselves had misgivings; Beck said, "As an illustrator I could, in the old days, make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings. But I couldn't bring the new [Captain Marvel] stories to life no matter how hard I tried."<ref>Benton, p. 77</ref> ''Shazam!'' was heavily revamped as of #34 (April 1978), with Bridwell providing more realistic stories, accompanied by similar art, the first issue by [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]] and [[Josef Rubinstein|Joe Rubinstein]], thereafter by a longtime fan of the character,<ref>"Interview With Don Newton", The Collector #17, Bill G. Wilson, 1969.</ref> [[Don Newton]] and Schaffenberger. Nevertheless, the next issue was the last one, though the feature was kept alive in a back-up position in a giant-formatted run of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (from #253, October–November 1978, to #282, August 1982, skipping only #271 which featured a full-length origin of the Superman-Batman team story). Schaffenberger left the feature after #259, and the inking credit subsequently varied. When ''WFC'' reverted to the standard 36 pages, leftover ''Shazam!'' material saw publication in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (#491, September 1982, and #492, October 1982); the remaining eleven issues of that run contained reprints, ''Shazam!'' represented by mostly Fawcett era stories (left out of an all ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #500, and the final #503, where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs). With their 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[limited series]], DC fully integrated the characters into the DC Universe. With the exception of an appearance by [[Lex Luthor]] in #15, (November–December 1974), the early, faithful-to-the-40s-comics versions never crossed over with the mainstream DC characters.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Captain Marvel in the late 1980s===
The first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|post-''Crisis'']] appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the [[Justice League]] in [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning-off from ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]''), he was also given his own miniseries titled ''Shazam! The New Beginning''. With this four-issue miniseries, writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy and]] [[Dann Thomas]] and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story.

The most notable change that Thomas, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. The Golden Age comics tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world.

This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story arc featured in the short-lived anthology ''[[Action Comics Weekly]]'' #623–626, released from October 25, 1988–November 15, 1988. At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new ''Shazam!'' ongoing series, which failed to materialize.

This story became Captain Marvel's official DC Universe origin story (with his appearances in ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' and ''Justice League'' still counting as part of this continuity).

Ordway's story more closely followed Captain Marvel's Fawcett origins, with only slight additions and changes. For example, in this version of the origin, it is Black Adam (in his non-powered form of Theo Adam) who killed Billy Batson's parents, and the "mysterious stranger" who leads Billy to the subway tunnel with statues of the Sins and the wizard Shazam is revealed to be the ghost of his father. The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success, leading to a ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999. That series reintroduced the Marvel Family, and many of their allies and enemies, into the modern-day DC Universe.

Marvel also appeared in [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]' critically acclaimed 1996 alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries. Set twenty years in the future, ''Kingdom Come'' features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind-controlled pawn of an elderly Lex Luthor. Being one of the most powerful beings on Earth, his mere presence unnerves many of those around him and, brainwashed, he even sets out to cause what could lead to the end of the world. However, Marvel ultimately sacrifices himself as an act of redemption and, as a figure of [[martyrdom]], becomes the symbol of a new world order.

In 2000, Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic novel, ''Shazam! Power of Hope'', written by [[Paul Dini]] and painted by [[Alex Ross]].

===''JSA'', ''52'', and other early/mid 2000s appearances===
[[Image:Marvel White Costume2.jpg|thumb|200px|Portion of a panel from ''The Trials of Shazam!'' #2 (November 2006) featuring Marvel, a revised version of the Captain Marvel character. Art by [[Howard Porter]].]]
Since the cancellation of the ''Power of Shazam!'' title in 1999, the Marvel Family have made appearances in a number of other DC comic books. Black Adam became a main character in [[Geoff Johns]] and [[David S. Goyer]]'s ''JSA'' series, which depicted the latest adventures of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Captain Marvel also appeared regularly in ''JSA'' in 2003 and 2004. He also appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the sequel to Miller's highly-acclaimed graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''.

The Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, which began DC's efforts to retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise. In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which preceded the ''Infinite Crisis'' event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the Rock of Eternity which is rebuilt by the Shadowpact, although he has trouble with the Sins imprisoned there as he hears their voices. The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters and introduced Adam's "Black Marvel Family", consisting of Adam himself, his wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], and her brother [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and Sobek. Marvel gave the amulet which was used to give Isis her powers. Marvel marries Adam and Isis. He helped battle Sabbac later on Halloween. The Marvel Family also appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series by [[Alex Ross]], [[Jim Krueger]], and Doug Braithwaite, published from 2005 to 2007. When Black Adam attacks the world in retaliation to the deaths of Osiris and Isis at the hands of the Four Horsemen, Captain Marvel is beaten by him, along with the rest of the Marvel family. He first asks the Egyptian gods to take Adam's powers but fails, then uses his lightning to change Adam back. He also changes Adam's magic word with the help of other mystics and he claims he will never tell anybody else.

===''The Trials of Shazam!'' and ''Final Crisis''===
''The Trials of Shazam!'', a 12-issue maxi-series written by [[Judd Winick]] and illustrated by [[Howard Porter]] for the first eight issues and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, began publication in August 2006. The series redefined the ''Shazam!'' mythos, the characters, and their place in the DC Universe. ''Trials of Shazam!'' featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name ''Marvel'', while Captain Marvel Jr. and Mary Marvel lose their powers. A powerless Freddy Freeman is then drafted to prove himself worthy to the individual six gods evident in the "Shazam" acronym so that he can become their new champion and herald under the name ''Shazam'', although a witch Sabina from the Council of Merlin attempts to take the power herself, as ordered by her father Merlin. Atlas is killed during the series by Sabina, but Apollo's healing replaces him. Marvel helps Freddy when he is trapped by the weight that Atlas bore.

In the pages of the 2007-2008 ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless Mary Batson his powers, turning her into a more villainous character. She evantually relinquishes the power and gets powers from the Olympians, but she is tempted by her old power. By the end of the series, as well as in DC's 2008-2009 ''[[Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God [[Desaad]], becomes a villain, joining forces with Superman villain [[Darkseid]] and fighting both [[Supergirl]] and Freddy Freeman/Shazam, who turns her back using his lightning.

===''Justice Society of America''===
The redesigned Marvel made a few appearances in various DC comics outside of ''The Trials of Shazam!'' maxi-series for two years before returning in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #23 in January 2009. ''Justice Society'' writer Geoff Johns collaborated with writer/artist Jerry Ordway to write a three-issue storyline that would again retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise.<ref>Whitworth, Jerry (Feb. 4, 2009). "Jerry Ordway on the Marvel Family". ''WizardUniverse.com''. Retrieved April 3, 2009. Excerpt: "This story could have filled more than three issues, as it is very ambitious in scope. But its goal is to help refocus the whole ''Shazam'' mythology..."</ref>

In the story, Marvel is ambushed by Black Adam and Isis, who are intent on taking over the Rock of Eternity. Isis robs Marvel of his powers by saying Shazam from a spell book to send lightning at him, and banishes a powerless Billy Batson back to Fawcett City, where he tries to contact Freddy, but instead contacts the Justice Society for help.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #23 (January 2009)</ref> Upon arriving at the Rock of Eternity with Billy, the Justice Society fights Black Adam and Isis.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #24 (February 2009)</ref> Billy is abducted by the now evil Mary Marvel, who shares her powers with him and turns him into an evil teenage Captain Marvel. The evil Billy and Mary join Adam and Isis in fighting the Justice Society. However, Adam switches sides when Isis sets into action her plan to kill off humanity and destroy modern civilization, firstly killing civilians of Khandaq. With the help of the Justice Society's [[Jay Garrick|Flash]] and the spirit of C.C Batson (Mary and Billy's father), the dead wizard Shazam's soul is retrieved from an underworld realm known as the Rock of Finality, and Adam gives up his powers to resurrect him from the statue he is imprisoned in. Shazam promptly takes his powers back from the other three Black Marvels, turns Adam and Isis into stone statues, and banishes Billy and Mary from the Rock of Eternity upon stating that they have failed him. He threatens to come after Freddy Freeman, as his powers come directly from the Gods.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #25 (March 2009)</ref> They are later seen walking the streets of Fawcett City while homeless and pondering the fate of their father's spirit.

Billy and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC's 2009/2010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' saga in a one-shot special, ''The Power of Shazam!'' #48. The siblings watch the rampage of the once-dead Osiris, now revived as an undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], on the internet from their apartment.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #48 (January 2010)</ref> The issue was written by [[Eric Wallace (writer)|Eric Wallace]], who will also write a ''Shazam!'' one-shot due for release in January 2011 featuring Billy, Mary, Freddy Freeman/Shazam, Osiris, and Blaze.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/shazam-dcu-interview-101022.html With a Magic Word, Wallace Brings the MARVELS Back to DC].

==Other appearances==
The ''[[Superman/Shazam: First Thunder]]'' miniseries, written by [[Judd Winick]] with art by [[Joshua Middleton|Josh Middleton]], and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post-''Crisis'' meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel. The meeting proves to be most amicable, with Superman noting that he is impressed to have an ally who may have similar powers to himself, but who is also far more resistant to the kind of magic attacks that he is vulnerable to. However, he is disturbed when he learns that the Captain is actually a child and agrees to Shazam's suggestion that he mentor the boy.

A second Captain Marvel miniseries, ''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]'', written and illustrated by [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] (creator of ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''), was published in four 48-page installments between February and July 2007. Smith's ''Shazam!'' miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, which updates and reimagines Captain Marvel's origin.<ref>{{cite web |last=Warmoth |first=Brian |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm |title=The Strategum of Smith (cached) |publisher=''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 4, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070210063430/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm |archivedate=February 10, 2007}}</ref> Smith's story features a younger looking Billy Batson and Captain Marvel as separate personalities, as they were in the pre-1985 stories, and features a prepubescent Mary Marvel as Captain Marvel's sidekick instead of the traditional teenaged or adult version. Dr. Sivana is [[Attorney General of the United States]], and Mr. Mind looks more like a snake than a caterpillar.

An all-ages Captain Marvel comic, ''[[Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!]]'', debuted in July 2008 under DC's [[Johnny DC]] youth-oriented imprint and was published monthly through December 2010. Following the lead and continuity of Smith's version, it was initially written and drawn by Mike Kunkel, creator of ''Herobear''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pumpelly |first=Danny |date=August 11, 2007 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11575 |title=WWC: DC New Worlds Order |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=August 26, 2007 }}</ref> [[Art Baltazar]] and Franco Aureliani, of ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', took over as writers with issue #5, with Byron Vaughns as main artist until issue 13, when [[Mike Norton]] assumed his place for the rest of the series.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2077</ref> Kunkel's version returns to the modern concept of having Captain Marvel retain Billy's personality, and also introduces new versions of Black Adam (whose alter ego, Theo Adam, is a child like Billy Batson in this version), King Kull, the Arson Fiend, and Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr.

==Powers and abilities==
When Billy Batson says the magic word "Shazam!" and transforms into Captain Marvel, he is granted the following powers:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
|'''S''' ||for the wisdom of '''S'''olomon ||As Captain Marvel, Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge, including most known languages and sciences. The wisdom of [[Solomon]] also provides him with counsel and advice in times of need. In early Captain Marvel stories, Solomon's power also gave Marvel the ability to hypnotize people. (Note that Solomon is the only figure in the list not taken from Greco-Roman mythology). Captain Marvel has exceptional photographic recall and mental acuity allowing him to read and decipher hieroglyphics, recall everything he has ever learned and solve long mathematical equations. Instantaneously, he can make intuitive guesses based on limited data; to the point his guesses are almost always correct; also he has a great understanding of divine phenomenon in the mortal world. Captain Marvel possesses an uncanny awareness of his circumstances that allows him to turn disadvantages into advantages. Through sheer power and magic he can hypnotize people for a length of time (undetermined). Only those of great willpower can overcome this ability. He can speak every language known to humans as well as ancient or dead languages and is able to understand aliens.
|-
|'''H''' ||for the strength of '''H'''ercules[[Hercules (DC Comics)|*]] ||[[Hercules]]' power grants Captain Marvel immense superhuman strength, making him one of DC Comics' most physically powerful characters; he is able to easily bend steel, punch through walls, and lift massive objects, (including whole continents like South America). In the comics, this strength has evolved in parallel to that of Superman.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
|-
|'''A''' ||for the stamina of '''A'''tlas ||Using [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]' stamina, Captain Marvel can withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults, and heal from them. Additionally, he does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe and can survive unaided in space when in Captain Marvel form.
|-
|'''Z''' ||for the power of '''Z'''eus ||[[Zeus]]' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel, also enhances Marvel's other physical and mental abilities, and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks. Marvel can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target. The magic lightning has several uses, such as creating apparatus, restoring damage done to Marvel, and acting as fuel for magic spells. It can also turn other Marvels back by striking them. It aids interdimensional travel at the Rock of Eternity.
|-
|'''A''' ||for the courage of '''A'''chilles ||This aspect gives Captain Marvel the courage of [[Achilles]]. In the ''[[Captain Marvel Jr.#The Trials of Shazam!|Trials of Shazam!]]'' miniseries, this was changed to the Greek hero's near invulnerability. It also aids Captain Marvel's mental fortitude against most mental attacks. 
|-
|'''M''' ||for the speed of '''M'''ercury ||By channeling [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'s speed, Captain Marvel can move at superhuman speeds and fly. This also gives Marvel the ability to fly to the Rock of Eternity by flying faster than the speed of light.
|}

Repeating the word "Shazam!" transforms Captain Marvel back into Billy. In ''Whiz Comics'' #11, Billy is shown to be able to summon up a ghostly version of Captain Marvel by whispering the word. Captain Marvel shares his powers with Marvel Family members Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. In pre-''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' stories, this had no detrimental effect on the heroes' abilities, while in DC's ''Power of Shazam'' series and irregularly afterward, the Shazam power was shown to be a finite source which would be divided in half or into thirds depending upon how many Marvels were in active super-powered form at one time.

As he was transformed by magic lightning, Captain Marvel was shown in several stories to be susceptible to both high-powered magic, which can weaken or de-power him, and to significantly high voltages of electricity or lightning to revert him back to Billy Batson form. The modern version of Captain Marvel is also vulnerable in the fact that he possesses the immature personality of a teenager.

The white-clad "Marvel" version of the character from the ''Trials of Shazam!'' series also possessed the commands of various magic abilities once owned by the wizard Shazam. However, Marvel was required to remain on the Rock of Eternity and could only be away from the Rock for twenty-four hours at a time.

==Other versions==
In the alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] book ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'' (1998), Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African American man.

===Captain Thunder===
In ''Superman'' (vol. 1) #276 (June 1974), Superman found himself at odds with '''Captain Thunder''', a superhero displaced from another Earth and another time. Thunder had been tricked by his archenemies in the Monster League of Evil into doing evil, and Thunder therefore was made to do battle with Superman. Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel's original moniker, was a thinly veiled pastiche of Marvel; down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named "'''Willie Fawcett'''" (a reference to the publisher of the original Captain Marvel stories, Fawcett Comics), and a magic word ("Thunder!") which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers. He got his power from rubbbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying 'Thunder.' He got his powers from Tornado (power), Hare (speed), Uncas (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight) and Ram (tenacity).

At the time of ''Superman'' #276, DC had been publishing ''Shazam!'' comics for two years, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications. The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 1) #137 two years later (although he met [[Lex Luthor]] in ''Shazam!'' #15, November–December 1974).

===''52'' and Earth-5===
In the final issue of the maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (#52, May 2, 2007) , a new [[Multiverse]] is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated Earth-5. As a result of Marvel Family foe [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-S, including the Marvel Family characters.

The Earth-5 Captain Marvel and Billy Batson appeared in the ''Final Crisis - Superman Beyond'' miniseries, assisting Superman. The miniseries established that these versions of Captain Marvel and Billy are two separate beings and that Billy is a reporter for WHIZ Media, rather than a radio broadcaster. The Earth-5 Captain Marvel re-appeared in ''Final Crisis'' #7 along with an army of Supermen from across the Multiverse to prevent its destruction by Darkseid.

===''Justice League: Generation Lost''===
A female version of Captain Marvel named '''Shazam''' is shown as a member of an alternate-future Justice League in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''. Little is revealed about her other than the fact that her civilian name is Sahar Shazeen, and she is shown wielding a pair of swords when in battle. She and her teammates are ultimately killed by an army of [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]].<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14</ref>

==Supporting cast==
{{Main|Marvel Family|List of Captain Marvel (DC Comics) enemies}}

Captain Marvel often fights evil as a member of a superhero team known as the Marvel Family, made up of himself and several other heroes: The wizard Shazam who empowers the team, Captain Marvel's sister Mary Marvel and Marvel's protégé Captain Marvel Jr. Before the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' maxi-series, the Marvel Family also included part-time members such as Mary's non-powered friend "Uncle" Dudley aka Uncle Marvel, Dudley's non-powered niece Freckles Marvel, a team of proteges (all of whose alter egos are named "Billy Batson") known as the Lieutenant Marvels, and the funny-animal pink rabbit version of Captain Marvel, Hoppy the Marvel Bunny.

Through his adventures, Captain Marvel gained an extensive rogues gallery, the most notable of whom include the evil mad scientist Doctor Sivana (and, pre-''Crisis'', the Sivana Family), Shazam's corrupted previous champion Black Adam, Adolf Hitler's champion Captain Nazi, and the mind-controlling worm Mister Mind and his Monster Society of Evil. Other Marvel Family foes include the evil robot Mister Atom, the "World's Mightiest Immortal" Oggar, a former pupil of Shazam with Cloven hooves, and Ibac and [[Sabbac]], demon-powered supervillains who transform by saying magic words made up of beings who give them power as Captain Marvel does.

The Marvel Family's non-powered allies include Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult offspring Beautia and Magnificus Sivana, Mister "Tawky" Tawny the talking tiger, WHIZ radio president and Billy's employer Sterling Morris, Billy's girlfriend Cissie Sommerly, Billy's school principal Miss Wormwood, and Mary's adoptive parents Nick and Nora Bromfield.

Captain Marvel's first appearance in Warner Bros.' line of DC Animated Universe direct-to-video films was a brief cameo in 2008's ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. The character had a more substantial role in the 2009 DTV animated film ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', based on a ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' comic book arc, in which Marvel battles Superman under orders from United States president [[Lex Luthor]]. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. An uncredited [[Rachael MacFarlane]] voiced Billy Batson.

The 2010 DTV animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' features a villainess named Superwoman, who is presented as an evil alternate universe version of Mary Marvel, complete with a "Super Family" of henchmen. The Captain Marvel analogue, "Captain Super", is voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]].

Captain Marvel appears in a short titled ''[[Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam]]'' (released on the ''DC Showcase Original Shorts Collection'' DVD compilation as part of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]]) with [[Jerry O'Connell]] reprising his role as Captain Marvel and Billy Batson voiced by Zach Callison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1007/10/|title=DC Showcase Animated Shorts|publisher=comicscontinuum.com|date=July 10, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Collura, Scott|url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/110/1108411p1.html|title=SDCC 10: DC Shorts Showcase|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=July 25, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Harvey|first=James|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=884|title=Main Cast, Crew Details For "Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam"|publisher=worldsfinestonline.com|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref>

===Television===
Captain Marvel first came to [[television]] in 1974. [[Filmation]] produced ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'', a live-action [[Television program|television show]] which ran from 1974 to 1977 on [[CBS]]. From 1975 until the end of its run, it aired as one-half of ''The Shazam!/Isis Hour'', featuring Filmation's own ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' as a companion program.

[[Image:Bostwick-shazam-captmarv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jackson Bostwick]] as Captain Marvel on CBS' ''Shazam!'' Saturday morning TV series.]]
Instead of following the original storyline of the comic, the ''Shazam!'' TV show took a more indirect approach to the character: Billy Batson/Captain Marvel, accompanied by an older man known simply as Mentor ([[Les Tremayne]]), traveled in an RV motor home across the USA, interacting with people in different towns they stopped in to save the citizens or help them combat evil. The wizard Shazam was absent from this series, and Billy received his powers and counsel directly from the six "immortal elders" represented in the "Shazam" name, who were depicted via animation: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. ''Shazam!'' starred [[Michael Gray (actor)|Michael Gray]] as Billy Batson, with both [[Jackson Bostwick]] (season one) and John Davey (seasons two and three) as Captain Marvel.<ref>http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0071050/, Retrieved on 2008/07/18.</ref> An adapted version of [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], the heroine of ''The Secrets of Isis'', was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam's wife in the weekly comic book series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.

Shortly after the ''Shazam!'' show ended its network run, Captain Marvel, played by Garrett Craig, appeared as a character in a pair of low-budgeted live-action comedy specials, produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] under the name ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' in 1978. The specials also featured [[Howard Morris]] as Doctor Sivana, and [[Ruth Buzzi]] as Aunt Minerva, marking the first appearance of those characters in film or television. Although Captain Marvel did not appear in Hanna-Barbera's long-running concurrent [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series ''[[Super Friends]]'' (which featured many of the other DC superheroes), he did appear in some of the merchandise associated with the show.

Filmation revisited the character three years later for an animated ''Shazam!'' cartoon, which ran on [[NBC]] from 1981 to 1982 as part of ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'' with Captain Marvel voiced by Burr Middleton. The rest of the Marvel Family joined Captain Marvel on his adventures in this series, which were more similar to his comic-book adventures than the 1970s TV show. Dr. Sivana, Mr. Mind, Black Adam, and other familiar Captain Marvel foes appeared as enemies.

Captain Marvel and/or Billy Batson made brief "cameo" appearances in two 1990s TV series. Billy has a non-speaking cameo in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Obsession", while live actors portraying Captain Marvel make "cameo" appearances in both a dream-sequence within an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and in the [[Beastie Boys]]' music video for "Alive".

[[File:cmarvel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Captain Marvel battles Superman in the "Clash" episode of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
Captain Marvel's first formal appearance in a [[DC animated universe|DC Animated Universe]] series, the name given to the animated DC Comics spin-off productions produced by [[Bruce Timm]] and/or [[Paul Dini]], was as the main guest star character of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Clash", originally aired in 2005 on [[Cartoon Network]]. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Jerry O'Connell]] and Billy Batson voiced by [[Shane Haboucha]]. In this episode, Captain Marvel joins the Justice League and is welcomed by most members, but his positive opinions about Lex Luthor's apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman, and this tension eventually leads to an all-out battle between Captain Marvel and Superman which destroys Luthor's newest creation, Lexor City. Luthor's apparent innocence and Superman's apparent mistake (although it was a plot by Luthor and Cadmus to destroy Superman's image) lead Captain Marvel to resign from the League, having become disgusted at them over their recent actions.

Four years later, Captain Marvel made three appearances in Cartoon Network's ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' series. He appears in the opening teaser to the episode "Death Race to Oblivion!" helping Batman battle the supervillain [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]]. A later episode in the same 2009-10 season, "The Power of Shazam!", was set in Fawcett City and featured Captain Marvel/Billy Batson, as well as the Sivana Family, Black Adam, the wizard Shazam, Aunt Minerva, and Mary Batson. In "The Siege of Starro! Part One", Captain Marvel helps Batman and fellow heroes B'wana Beast, Booster Gold, and Firestorm fight the Faceless Hunter and the Starros. In this series, Captain Marvel is voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and Billy Batson is voiced by [[Tara Strong]].<ref>[http://voiceactors.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/tara-strong-batman-chowder-drawn-together/ Tara Strong on ‘Batman,’ ‘Chowder,’ ‘Drawn Together’ Movie]</ref> Captain Marvel also appears in the DC Comics-based Cartoon Network series, ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', with his voice provided by [[Rob Lowe]].<ref>http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/22/cci-shazam-rob-lowe-to-voice-captain-marvel-in-young-justice/</ref>

===Video games===
Captain Marvel made his first official video game appearance as a playable character in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'' played by Stephan Scalabrino and voiced by [[Kevin Delaney (actor)|Kevin Delaney]], for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] game consoles. In the story, Captain Marvel is among several DC superheroes teleported to the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' video game universe when the two universes merge and characters from each franchise are forced to do battle. Marvel also appears as a playable character in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold – The Videogame]]'', voiced by Jeff Bennett, and is set to appear in DC's [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

===Comic strips===
In 1943, C.C. Beck and writer Rod Reed prepared seven sample installments of a comic strip. Syndicates expressed no interest in it; Reed suspected the DC lawsuit was why syndicates wouldn't take on the property, for fear of ending up as parties in the ongoing litigation.<ref>Beck, C.C. "The Captain Marvel Daily Newspaper Strip". Hamerlinck, P.C., editor. ''The Fawcett Companion''. TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001. pp.46-47</ref>

==Cultural impact==
===Captain Marvel vs. Superman in fiction===
[[Image:Supermanmarvel kingdomcome.jpg|thumb|Superman and Captain Marvel face off in the 1996 ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]
Captain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] in general. The most notable of these is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] comic book stories.

The National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in "Superduperman," a satirical comic book story by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]] in the fourth issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (April–May, 1953). In the parody, inspired by the Fawcett/DC legal battles,<ref>Wright, p. 146</ref> Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature. Marbles' magic word is "SHAZOOM", which stands for '''S'''trength, '''H'''ealth, '''A'''ptitude, '''Z'''eal, '''O'''x—power of, '''O'''x—power of another and '''M'''oney. In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles was greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal.

While publishing its ''Shazam!'' revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name. He apparently battled against a monster league.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #276 (June 1974)</ref> Two years later, ''Justice League of America'' #135-137 featured a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies. It was in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first met, albeit briefly. They battle due to King Kull using Red Kryptonite to fill Superman's mind with murderous rage, before Captain Marvel uses his lightning to restore Superman. They would later on meet teaming-up together in various titles such as ''[[DC Comics Presents]]''. Before this there was a three-issue storyline in which the Greek gods create a being called Zha-vam, with powers similar to Captain Marvel, and send him to battle Superman using his winged sandals of Mercury. Superman is able to defeat him by summoning up Atlas, and striking his Achilles heel. In Shazam #30 Sivana creates several steel creatures, like Magarac, and animals to destroy Pittsburgh's steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of Action comics. He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the Superman is destroyed.

Following this ''Justice League'' story, DC followed{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''Mad'''s cue and often pitted Captain Marvel and Superman against each other for any number of reasons, but usually as an inside joke to the characters' long battles in court; they are otherwise staunch allies. Notable Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include ''All-New Collectors' Edition'' #C-58 (1978), in "When Earths Collide", written by Gerry Conway with art by Rich Buckler & Dick Giordano. ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #36 & 37 (1984), and ''[[Superman (vol. 2)]]'' #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in ''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996) served as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] to turn against the other heroes. The "Clash" episode of the DC-based animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which included Captain Marvel as a guest character, featured a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece, which Superman wins when the lightning hits Marvel. By contrast, the depiction of the pair's first meeting in the ''Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder'' miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy's mentor when he learns the boy's true age. In contrast to [[Alex Ross]]' earlier depiction in ''Kingdom Come'', ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' has Captain Marvel rescuing Superman and then closely working with the Kryptonian to find a means to save [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]] who is running out of control.

===Captain Marvel in popular culture===
In pop culture, Billy Batson/Captain Marvel's magic word, "Shazam!", became a popular [[Ejaculation (grammar)|exclamation]] from the 1940s on, often used in place of an [[expletive]]. The most notable user of the word "Shazam!" in this form was [[Gomer Pyle]], a character from the 1960s [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and later ''[[Gomer Pyle USMC]]''. [[Foxxy Cleopatra]] from the 2002 film ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' is also fond of the word. In another 2002 movie, ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', Peter Parker shouts "Shazam!" while trying to control his powers. Then in the 2007 sequel ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' Peter Parker again uses the phrase while posing and celebrating, whilst receiving the key to New York City. In the Fox TV show ''[[Family Guy]]'', the phrase "Shazam!" is used by [[Peter Griffin]] whenever he is having sexual relations with his [[Lois Griffin|wife]] and shouts it out upon climax. In the aforementioned 1950 [[Columbia Pictures]] film, ''The Good Humor Man'' (see '''Film''' section, above), the kids of the local Captain Marvel Club's secret catchphrase isn’t “Shazam!” but instead “Niat-Pac Lev-Ram!” - that is, "Captain Marvel" pronounced backwards.

For many years, [[Phoenix Suns]] play-by-play announcer [[Al McCoy (announcer)|Al McCoy]] has said "Shazam!" when a Phoenix Sun player makes a three-point field goal. He has said that it came from Captain Marvel comics. In 1974, [[Modern Western square dance|Square Dance]] caller Deuce Williams wrote the call "Shazam".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ceder.net/def/shazam.php4?language=usa&level=C2| title = Shazam (C2) | last = Ceder | first = Vic| accessdate = 2009-10-15| publisher = Ceder.net}}</ref> It is a very quick call (taking one, or at most two beats of music) and can be thought of as a lightning strike.

Years after the character disappeared in 1953, the superhero was still used for allusions and jokes, in films such as ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', TV shows such as ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and songs such as "Shazam" (1960) by [[Duane Eddy]]. [[Elvis Presley]] was a fan of ''Captain Marvel, Jr.'' comic books as a child, and later styled his hair to look like Freddy Freeman's and based his stage jumpsuits and [[Memphis Mafia|TCB]] lightning logo on Captain Marvel Junior's costume and lightning-bolt insignia.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/85/| title = Elvis and Captain Marvel, Jr.| accessdate = 2006-09-13| last = Reed| first = Robby| date = | publisher = Dial B for Blog}}</ref> The [[Academy of Comic Book Arts]] named its [[Academy of Comic Book Arts#Shazam Award|Shazam Award]] in honor of the character's mythos. [[The Beatles]] mentioned Captain Marvel in their song "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]" (1968), and [[Paul McCartney]] shouts "Shazam" to the camera in the dressing room scene of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). The English footballer [[Bryan Robson]], who was [[captain (association football)|captain]] of [[Manchester United F.C.]] and [[England national football team|England]], was nicknamed "Captain Marvel".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={847FFC5F-947A-470D-A13B-E757FD63C2A8}&bioid=92137| title = Bryan Robson - Manchester United | last = Ceder | first = Vic| accessdate = 2009-12-28}}</ref>
