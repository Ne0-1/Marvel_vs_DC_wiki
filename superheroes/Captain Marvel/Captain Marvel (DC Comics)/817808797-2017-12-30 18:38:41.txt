'''Captain Marvel''', also known as '''Shazam''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|z|æ|m}}), is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Artist [[C. C. Beck]] and writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]]<nowiki/> created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940), published by [[Fawcett Comics]]. He is the alter ego of '''Billy Batson''', a boy who, by speaking the magic word "'''SHAZAM'''" (acronym of six "immortal elders": [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]]), can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength, speed, flight and other abilities. 

Based on book sales, the character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even [[Superman]].<ref name="TiptonMoviePoopShoot">{{cite web | last=Tipton | first=Scott | title=The World's Mightiest Mortal | work=Comics 101 | date=April 1, 2003 | url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=I've always felt that it was this origin story and concept that made Captain Marvel instantly popular, to the point that it was outselling every comic on the stands for several years throughout the '40s. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050614004150/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | archivedate=June 14, 2005 | df= }}</ref><ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum">{{cite web | title=Comic Book Success Stories | work=The Museum of Comic Book Advertising | url=http://comicbookads.leafpublishing.com/hall-of-covers/cover-display2-page2.htm | accessdate=2005-06-17 | quote=By the middle of the decade, Captain Marvel had received a self-titled comic book, ''Captain Marvel's Adventures'' [sic],<!--the proper name of the publication is "Captain Marvel Adventures"--> which had a circulation that reached 1.3 million copies per month.

Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, partly because of a [[National Comics Publications v.

==Publication history==

===Development and inspirations===
[[Image:Whiz2.JPG|thumb|Captain Marvel first appeared in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 (Feb. 1940); art by [[C. C. Beck]].]]
After the success of [[DC Comics|National Comics]]' new superhero characters [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], [[Fawcett Publications]] started its own comics division in 1939, recruiting writer [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]] to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled ''Flash Comics''. Besides penning stories featuring [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Lance O'Casey]], [[Scoop Smith]], and [[Dan Dare (Fawcett Comics)|Dan Dare]] for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure.<ref name="JohnnyShazam" />

Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called "'''Captain Thunder'''".<ref name="JohnnyShazam">{{cite web | last=Hembeck | first=Fred | title=Johnny Thunder and Shazam! | work=The Hembeck Files | date=June 18, 2003 | url=http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/shazam2.html | accessdate=2005-06-22}}</ref> Staff artist [[C. C. Beck|Charles Clarence "C. C." Beck]] was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat [[cartoon]]y style that became his trademark. "When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett’s first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were," Beck told an interviewer. "We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times".<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=http://cartoonician.com/an-interview-with-c-c-beck/ |title=An Interview with C.C. Beck &#124; Hogan's Alley |publisher=Cartoonician.com |date=2015-07-04 |accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>

The first issue of the comic book, printed as both ''Flash Comics'' #1 and ''Thrill Comics'' #1, had a low-print run in the fall of 1939 as an [[ashcan copy]] created for advertising and [[trademark]] purposes. Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark "Captain Thunder", "Flash Comics", or "Thrill Comics", because all three names were already in use.  Consequently, the book was renamed ''Whiz Comics'', and Fawcett artist [[Pete Costanza]] suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to "Captain Marvelous", which the editors shortened to "Captain Marvel". The [[Speech balloon|word balloon]]s in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as "Captain Marvel". ''Whiz Comics'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939.

Inspiration for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources. His visual appearance was modeled after that of [[Fred MacMurray]], a popular American actor of the period,<ref name=FC1>{{cite book |last=Beck |first=C. C. |title=Fawcett Companion: The Best of FCA (Fawcett Collectors of America) |year=2001 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, NC |isbn=978-1-893905-10-8 |pages=28–29 |url= http://www.marvelfamily.com/faq/mfinspiration.aspx}}</ref> though comparisons with both [[Cary Grant]] and [[Jack Oakie]] were made as well.<ref name=MarFam>{{cite web |title=Marvel Family Inspiration |url= http://www.marvelfamily.com/faq/mfinspiration.aspx |publisher=MarvelFamily.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> [[Fawcett Publications]]' founder, Wilford H. Fawcett, was nicknamed "Captain Billy", which inspired the name "Billy Batson" as well as Marvel's title.<ref name=LN>{{cite web |title=Captain Marvel Earth's Mightiest Mortal |url=http://loknar54.com/JLA-CaptainMarvel.html |work=JLA |publisher=Loknar54.com |accessdate=24 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Fawcett's earliest magazine was titled ''Captain Billy's Whiz Bang'', which inspired the title ''Whiz Comics''.<ref name=MF2>{{cite web |title=Shazam Fun Facts |url= http://www.marvelfamily.com/FunFacts/funfact.aspx?FFID=8 |work=Fun Facts |publisher=MarvelFamily.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> In addition, Fawcett took several of the elements that had made Superman the first popular comic book superhero (super-strength and speed, science-fiction stories, a mild-mannered reporter alter ego) and incorporated them into Captain Marvel. Fawcett's circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff, "Give me a Superman, only have his other identity be a 10- or 12-year-old boy rather than a man".<ref name="likeSupes">{{Cite book | editor-last=Hamerlinck | editor-first=P.C. | title=Fawcett Companion: The Best of FCA (Fawcett Collectors of America) | location=Raleigh, NC | publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | year=2001 | isbn=978-1-893905-10-8}}</ref>

====Introduction====
In addition to introducing the main character and his alter ego, Captain Marvel's first adventure in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil [[Doctor Sivana]], and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter. Captain Marvel was an instant success, with ''Whiz Comics'' #2 selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum"/> By 1941, he had his own solo series, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', while he continued to appear in ''Whiz Comics'', as well as periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including ''Master Comics''.

===Copyright infringement lawsuit and cancellation===
{{See also|National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications}}
Through much of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium, and his comics outsold all others. ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' sold fourteen million copies in 1944,<ref name="ComicBooksinLibraries">{{Cite news | last=Lavinie | first=Michael L. | title=Comic Books and Graphic Novels for Libraries: What to Buy | newspaper=Serials Review | volume=2 | issue=24 | page=34 | date=Summer 1998 | url=http://www.ugr.es/~alozano/Translations/ComicBooksinLibraries.pdf | format=PDF | quote=In 1944, the best-selling comic book title (''Captain Marvel Adventures'') sold more than fourteen million copies for the year. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002164350/http://www.ugr.es/~alozano/Translations/ComicBooksinLibraries.pdf | archivedate=2005-10-02 | df= }}</ref> and was at one point being published bi-weekly with a circulation of 1.3 million copies an issue (proclaimed on the cover of issue #19 as being the "Largest Circulation of Any Comic Magazine").<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum"/> Part of the reason for this popularity included the inherent wish-fulfillment appeal of the character to children, as well as the [[humor]]ous and [[surrealism|surreal]] quality of the stories. Billy Batson typically narrated each Captain Marvel story, [[fourth wall|speaking directly to his reading audience]] from his WHIZ radio microphone, relating each story from the perspective of a young boy.

The franchise was expanded to introduce teen spin-off characters to Captain Marvel (who, unlike Billy, remained kids in superhero form)<ref name="ComicLaw" /> In late 1941 and in 1942, new characters were introduced with Captain Marvel's sidekick [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]] in ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (1941) and his sister [[Mary Marvel]] in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18. Both Captain Marvel, Jr. and Mary Marvel were given their own eponymous books in addition to appearing as the lead features in ''Master Comics'' and ''Wow Comics'', respectively.<ref name="ComicLaw">{{Cite book  | last=Sergi| first=Joe | year=2015 | title=The Law for Comic Book Creators: Essential Concepts and Applications | location=Jefferson, North Carolina | publisher=McFarland | isbn=1-4766-1733-3}}</ref> Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Mary Marvel appeared together in another publication, ''The Marvel Family''.<ref name="ComicLaw" />

Detective Comics (later known as National Comics Publications, National Periodical Publications, and today known as [[DC Comics]]) sued both Fawcett Comics and Republic Pictures for [[copyright infringement]] in 1941, alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman.<ref name="NationalFawcettLawsuit">{{cite web | url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/191/594/91314/ | title=191 F.2d 594: National Comics Publications, Inc. v.

(Circuit Judge)}}</ref> After seven years of litigation, the ''[[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications]]'' case went to trial in 1948. Although the presiding judge decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement, DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their ''Superman'' daily [[Superman (comic strip)|newspaper strips]], and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss">{{Cite journal | last=Ingersoll | first=Bob | date=May 31, 1985 | title=The Law is a Ass (Installment #66) | journal=Comics Buyer's Guide | issue=602 | url= http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/law/back20001024.shtml | accessdate=June 19, 2005}} (Detailed summary of the cases and rulings related to ''National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publishing''.)</ref> As a result, the initial verdict, delivered in 1951, went in Fawcett's favor.

National appealed this decision, and Judge [[Learned Hand]] declared in 1952 that National's Superman copyright was in fact valid. Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement, but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements, and this would have to be determined in a retrial. He therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss" />

Instead of retrying the case, however, Fawcett settled with National out of court. The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regard to Captain Marvel. While ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' had been the top-selling comic series during World War II, it suffered declining sales every year after 1945, and, by 1949, it was selling only half its wartime rate.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | year=2001 | title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | location=Baltimore | publisher=Johns Hopkins | isbn=0-8018-7450-5 | page=57}}</ref> Fawcett tried to revive the popularity of its Captain Marvel series in the early 1950s by introducing elements of the horror comics trend that had gained popularity at the time.<ref>Wright, p. 156.</ref>

Feeling that this decline in the popularity of superhero comics meant that it was no longer worth continuing the fight,<ref>{{cite web | last=Gore | first=Matthew H. | url=http://www.leylander.org/intercom/marvelman/ | title=The Origins of Marvelman | accessdate=2016-08-12 | quote=With avenues of appeal still open but their outcome obvious after the first court ruled for National Periodicals, Fawcett Publications settled out of court in late 1953.

''Whiz Comics'' had ended with issue #155 in June 1953, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' was canceled with #150 (November 1953), and ''The Marvel Family'' ended its run with #89 (Jan. 1954).

===''Marvelman'' / ''Miracleman''===
{{Main article|Marvelman}}
In the 1950s, a small British publisher, [[L. Miller and Son]], published a number of [[black-and-white]] reprints of American comic books, including the Captain Marvel series. With the outcome of the ''National v. Fawcett'' lawsuit, L. Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer, [[Mick Anglo]], who created a thinly-disguised version of the superhero called [[Marvelman]]. Captain Marvel, Jr., was adapted to create Young Marvelman, while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman. The magic word "Shazam!" was replaced with "Kimota" ("Atomik" spelled backwards). The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's United Kingdom series with issue number #25.

''Marvelman'' ceased publication in 1963, but the character was revived in 1982 by writer [[Alan Moore]] in the pages of ''Warrior Magazine''. Beginning in 1985, Moore's black-and-white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by [[Eclipse Comics]] under the new title ''[[Miracleman]]'' (as [[Marvel Comics]] objected to the use of "Marvel" in the title), and continued publication in the United States after ''Warrior''{{'}}s demise.  Within the [[Metatextuality|metatextual]] story line of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Moore and later ''Marvelman/Miracleman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]]. In 2009, Marvel Comics obtained the rights to the original 1950s ''Marvelman'' characters and stories,<ref name=CBR2>{{cite web |last=Phegley| first=Kiel |title=CCI: Cup o' Joe – Marvelman at Marvel |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22203 |work=Comic Books |publisher=ComicBookResources.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> obtaining the rights to the 1980s version and those reprints in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nycc-marvel-reprint-classic-alan-648083 |title=NYCC: Marvel to Reprint Classic Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman 'Miracleman' |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48465 |title=NYCC: Cup O' Joe Announces Miracleman's Return |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= 2013-10-12 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref>

===M. F. Enterprises===
In 1966, [[M. F. Enterprises]] produced their own Captain Marvel: an [[Android (robot)|android]] superhero from another planet whose main characteristic was the ability to split his body into several parts, each of which could move on its own. He triggered the separation by shouting "Split!" and reassembled himself by shouting "Xam!" He had a young human ward named Billy Baxton. This short-lived Captain Marvel was credited in the comic as being "based on a character created by [[Carl Burgos]]".<ref>{{comicbookdb |character |7827|Captain Marvel (M.F.)}}</ref>

===DC Comics revival: ''Shazam!''===
When superhero comics became popular again in the mid-1960s in what is now called the "[[Silver Age of Comic Books]]", Fawcett was unable to revive Captain Marvel, having agreed to never publish the character again as part of their 1953 settlement. Looking for new properties to introduce to the DC Comics line, DC publisher [[Carmine Infantino]] decided to bring the Captain Marvel property back into print, and in 1972 he licensed the characters from Fawcett.<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1" />  Because Marvel Comics had by this time established ''Captain Marvel'' as a comic book trademark for [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|their own character]], created and first published in 1967, DC published their book under the name ''Shazam!''<ref name="NRLostYearsPt3" />  Infantino attempted to give the ''Shazam!'' book the subtitle ''The Original Captain Marvel'', but a [[cease and desist]] letter from Marvel Comics forced them to change the subtitle to ''The World's Mightiest Mortal'', starting with ''Shazam!'' #15 (December 1974).<ref name="NRShazamYearsPt1">{{cite web | url= http://www.newsarama.com/6771-an-oral-history-of-captain-marvel-the-shazam-years-pt-1.html | title=An Oral History of CAPTAIN MARVEL: The Shazam Years, pt. 1 | work=Newsarama | date=31 December 2010 | accessdate=14 September 2014 | author=Smith, Zack}}</ref> As all subsequent toys and other merchandise featuring the character have also been required to use the "Shazam!" label with little to no mention of the name "Captain Marvel", the title became so linked to Captain Marvel that many people took to identifying the character as "Shazam" instead of "Captain Marvel".<ref name="NameChange" />

The ''Shazam!'' comic series began with ''Shazam!'' #1 (Feb. 1973). It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s. [[Dennis O'Neil]] was the primary writer of the book.<ref>{{cite book |last=McAvennie |first= Michael | editor-last=Dolan | editor-first=Hannah |chapter= 1970s |title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 155 |quote = In 1972, DC acquired the rights to Captain Marvel and in 1973 they launched the series ''Shazam!'', which re-established the Captain Marvel mythos...Responsible for resurrecting the lightning-charged champion, writer Denny O'Neil and original artist C.

Beck]] drew stories for the first ten issues of the book before quitting due to creative differences. [[Bob Oksner]] and Fawcett alumnus [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] were among the later artists of the title.

With DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] concept in effect during this time, the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of "Earth-S".  While the series began with a great deal of fanfare, the book had a lackluster reception.  The creators themselves had misgivings.  Beck said, "As an illustrator, I could, in the old days, make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings.

''Shazam!'' was heavily [[Retroactive continuity|rewritten]] as of issue #34 (April 1978), and Bridwell provided more realistic stories, accompanied by similar art; the first issue was drawn by [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]] and [[Josef Rubinstein|Joe Rubinstein]], and thereafter by [[Don Newton]], a longtime fan of the character,<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Interview with Don Newton | journal=The Collector | issue=17 | first=Bill G. | last=Wilson | year=1969}}</ref> and Schaffenberger. Nevertheless, the next issue was the last one, though the feature was kept alive in a back-up position in the [[Dollar Comics]]-formatted run of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (from #253, October/November 1978, to #282, August 1982, skipping only #271, which featured a full-length origin of the Superman-Batman team story). Schaffenberger left the feature after #259, and the inking credit subsequently varied.

When ''World's Finest Comics'' reverted to the standard 36 pages, leftover ''Shazam!'' material saw publication in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (#491–492, September–October 1982).  The remaining 11 issues of that run contained reprints, with ''Shazam!'' represented by mostly Fawcett-era stories (left out of ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #500 and the final #503, where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs).  ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (April 1978) featured a "Superman vs. Shazam!" story by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Dick Giordano]].<ref>{{cite journal |last = Hamerlinck |first = P.C. |title = When Worlds Collide: The Colossal-Sized Confrontation Between Superman and Captain Marvel |journal= [[Back Issue!]] |issue = 61 |pages = 65–68 |publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing |date = December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comics.org/issue/68932/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: All-New Collectors' Edition #C-58 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref> With their 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], DC fully integrated the characters into the [[DC Universe]].  Prior to Crisis, the characters had appeared a few times as guest stars in the [[Justice League of America]] series (vol. 1).

===Captain Marvel in the late 1980s===
The first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|post-Crisis]] appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the [[Justice League]] in [[Keith Giffen]]'s and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from ''Legends''), he was given his own miniseries titled ''Shazam!: The New Beginning''. With this four-issue miniseries, writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy and]] [[Dann Thomas]] and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and [[Black Adam]] into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story. Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of ''Shazam!'' and the [[Justice Society of America]] characters.<ref name="ThomasIntro">{{Cite book |title=Shazam: A New Beginning 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition [Introduction] |last=Thomas |first=Roy |publisher=DC Comics, Inc. |year=2017 |isbn=1401283128 |location=Burbank, CA |pages=5-6}}</ref><ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> Before the ''Crisis'', Thomas wrote several of the ''DC Comics Presents'' stories featuring the Marvel Family.<ref name="ThomasIntro" />

The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsarama.com/g00/36243-an-oral-history-of-dc-s-captain-marvel-shazam-the-new-beginning-years.html?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D&i10c.ua=1 |title=An Oral History of DC's CAPTAIN MARVEL/SHAZAM: The New Beginning Years |last=Smith |first=Zack |date=2017-09-05 |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref>

This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology ''[[Action Comics Weekly]]'' #623–626 (October 25, 1988 – November 15, 1988), in which a [[Neo-Nazi]] version of Captain Mazi was introduced.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new ''Shazam!'' ongoing series.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> Though ''New Beginning'' had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas.<ref name="ThomasIntro" /> As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new [[Punk subculture| punk]]-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka "Spike") who was not Billy's sister, and an [[African-American]] take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the ''Shazam!'' project.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article">{{cite journal

Other attempts at reviving ''Shazam!'' were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], illustrator of ''Legends'' and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' (1986).<ref name="NRSecretShazam">{{cite web | url= http://www.newsarama.com/7118-an-oral-history-of-captain-marvel-secret-shazam.html | title=An Oral History of Captain Marvelo: Secret Shazam | publisher= Newsarama.com | date=February 25, 2011 | accessdate=May 24, 2015 | author=Smith, Zack}}</ref>  None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's ''[[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]'' miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with Fawcett Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" />

===''The Power of Shazam!''===
{{Main article|The Power of Shazam!}}
In 1991, [[Jerry Ordway]] was given the ''Shazam!'' assignment, which he pitched as a painted [[graphic novel]] that would lead into a series, rather than starting the series outright.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> Ordway both wrote and illustrated the graphic novel, titled ''The Power of Shazam!'', which was released in 1994. ''Power of Shazam!'' [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] Captain Marvel again and gave him a revised origin, rendering ''Shazam! The New Beginning'' and the ''Action Comics Weekly'' story apocryphal while Marvel's appearances in ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' and ''Justice League'' still counted as part of the continuity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cereno |first1=Benito |title=The Evolution Of Shazam: Best Captain Marvel Stories By Decade |url=http://comicsalliance.com/evolution-of-captain-marvel-shazam/ |website=Comics Alliance |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905133700/http://comicsalliance.com/evolution-of-captain-marvel-shazam/ |archivedate=September 5, 2015 |df= }}</ref>

Ordway's story more closely followed Captain Marvel's Fawcett origins, with only slight additions and changes. The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success, leading to a ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Dolan, p. 269: "Writer Jerry Ordway chronicled the further adventures of Billy Batson, the World's Mightiest Mortal, in the new ongoing effort ''The Power of Shazam!'', alongside artists Mike Manley and Peter Krause".</ref> That series reintroduced the Marvel Family and many of their allies and enemies into the modern-day DC Universe.

Captain Marvel also appeared in [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]'s critically acclaimed 1996 alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries. Set 20 years in the future, ''Kingdom Come'' features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind-controlled pawn of an elderly [[Lex Luthor]]. Because he is one of the most powerful beings on Earth, his mere presence unnerves many of those around him and, brainwashed, he even sets out to cause what could lead to the end of the world. However, Marvel ultimately sacrifices himself as an act of redemption and, as a figure of [[martyrdom]], becomes the symbol of a new world order.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 2000, Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic novel, ''Shazam! Power of Hope'', written by [[Paul Dini]] and painted by [[Alex Ross]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Early-mid-2000s: ''JSA'', ''52'', and more===
Since the cancellation of the ''Power of Shazam!'' title in 1999, the Marvel Family has made appearances in a number of other DC comic books.  Black Adam became a main character in [[Geoff Johns]]' and [[David S. Goyer]]'s ''JSA'' series, which depicted the latest adventures of the [[Justice Society of America]], with Captain Marvel also briefly joining the team to keep an eye on his old nemesis. He also appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the sequel to Miller's highly acclaimed graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which culminated in his death. The ''[[Superman/Shazam: First Thunder]]'' miniseries, written by [[Judd Winick]] with art by [[Joshua Middleton|Josh Middleton]], and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post-''Crisis'' meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.
 
The Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, which began DC's efforts to retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise.  In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which preceded the ''Infinite Crisis'' event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the [[Rock of Eternity]]. The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters and introduced Adam's "Black Marvel Family" which included Adam's wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], her brother [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and [[Sobek (comics)|Sobek]].  The series chronicled Adam's attempts to reform after falling in love with Isis, only to launch the DC universe into [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] after she and Osiris are killed.  The Marvel Family appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series by [[Alex Ross]], [[Jim Krueger]], and [[Doug Braithwaite]], published from 2005 to 2007.

===''The Trials of Shazam!''===
''The Trials of Shazam!'', a 12-issue maxi-series written by [[Judd Winick]] and illustrated by [[Howard Porter]] for the first eight issues, and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, was published from 2006 to 2008.  The series redefined the ''Shazam!'' property with a stronger focus on magic and mysticism.  ''Trials of Shazam!'' featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name ''Marvel,'' while the former Captain Marvel, Jr., Freddy Freeman, attempts to prove himself worthy to become Marvel's champion under the name "Shazam."

In the pages of the 2007–2008 ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless [[Mary Batson]] his powers, turning her into a more aggressive super-powered figure, less upstanding than the old Mary Marvel.  By the end of the series, as well as in DC's 2008–2009 ''[[Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God [[Desaad|DeSaad]], becomes a villainess, joining forces with Superman villain [[Darkseid]] and fighting both [[Supergirl]] and Freddy Freeman/Shazam.

A three-issue arc in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) undid much of the ''Trials of Shazam!'' changes. Issues 23 through 25 of ''Justice Society'' featured Black Adam and a resurrected Isis taking over the Rock of Eternity. Adam and Isis recruit the now-evil Mary Marvel to help them in the ensuing fight against a now-powerless Billy Batson and the Justice Society.

Billy and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC's 2009–2010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' saga in a one-shot special, ''The Power of Shazam!'' #48.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #48 (Jan. 2010)</ref> In 2011, DC published a one-shot ''Shazam!'' story written by Eric Wallace, in which the still-powerless Billy and Mary help Freddy/Shazam in a battle with the demoness [[Blaze (comics)|Blaze]]. Freddy would eventually have his powers stolen by Osiris in ''Titans'' #32 the same year.<ref>''Titans'' vol. 2, #32 (Feb. 2011)</ref>

The ''Shazam!'' feature concluded with ''Justice League'' #21, preceding DC's crossover "[[Trinity War]]" storyline which heavily features the Shazam mythos.

==Fictional character biography==
===Fawcett/Early DC origin===
''Whiz Comics'' #2 (Feb. 1940) introduces Billy Batson, a homeless 12- (later 14-) year-old [[Newspaper hawker|newsboy]]<ref name="CMWritingBible">{{Cite book | editor-last=Hamerlinck | editor-first=P.C. | title=Fawcett Companion: The Best of FCA (Fawcett Collectors of America) | location=Raleigh, NC | publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | year=2001 | isbn=1-893905-10-1 | pages=28-29}}</ref> who sleeps in the subway station of his home city (later referred to in DC publications as [[Fawcett City]]<ref name="POSgraphicnovel" />). A mysterious man in a green cloak asks Billy to follow him into the subway station, where a magic subway car painted in unusual shapes and colors escorts them to an underground throne room, which is inhabited by a very old man with a long beard and a white robe. As the man in green disappears, the old man on the throne explains to Billy that he is the Wizard Shazam, and has used the powers of "the gods" - [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]], hence the name "Shazam" - to fight evil for over 3,000 years. However, he has now grown too old to continue and is in need of a successor. The wizard explains that Billy was chosen due to his misfortune: he had been thrown out by a greedy uncle who stole his inheritance following the deaths of his parents (later retellings of the origin would also note that Billy was chosen for being "pure of heart").<ref name="Shazam011973" /> Ordered by the wizard to speak the name "Shazam," Billy is struck by a sudden bolt of lightning and transformed into a superpowered adult in a red costume with gold trim.<ref name="Whiz02">''Whiz Comics'' #2 (1940)</ref>

The Wizard Shazam declares the new hero "Captain Marvel" and orders him to carry on his work, as a stone block suspended above his throne falls upon him, killing him as prophesied.<ref name="Shazam011973">''Shazam!'' #1 (1973)</ref> The wizard would return - in later retellings of the origin story, immediately - as a [[ghost|spirit]] to serve as a mentor to Billy and Captain Marvel, summoned by lighting a torch on the wall of his lair.<ref name="Shazam011973" /> As a spirit, the Wizard Shazam lives at the [[Rock of Eternity]], a [[bicone]]-shaped rock formation situated at the nexus of time and space.<ref>''The Marvel Family'' #7 (1946)</ref> Later retellings of the Captain Marvel origin place Shazam's underground lair within the Rock.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #5 (1995)</ref> Saying the word "Shazam" allows Billy to summon the magic lightning and become Captain Marvel, while Captain Marvel can say the magic word himself to become Billy again.<ref name="Whiz02" />

Archives, Vol. 1'', due to a numbering error at Fawcett.</ref>

While the majority of Billy's adventures feature him as a solo hero, he also fought evil on a regular basis accompanied by several other kids who share his powers to make up a superhero team called the [[Marvel Family]] (later referred to as the ''Shazam Family'' due to the issues DC Comics faced over the "Marvel" and "Captain Marvel" trademarks). The first members of the family, introduced in ''Whiz Comics'' #21 (Sept. 1941) and used sparingly afterwards, were the [[Lieutenant Marvels]]: three other boys from various parts of the United States who are also named "Billy Batson" and discover that, if they all say "Shazam!" in unison, they can become adult superheroes as well.

In ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (Dec 1941), Captain Marvel saves Freddy Freeman, a boy who had been left for dead by the evil [[Captain Nazi]], and does for Freddy what the wizard did for him. By speaking the name "Captain Marvel," Freddy can become the superpowered [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]]. Unlike Billy, Freddy retains his 14-year-old appearance as a superhero.<ref name="CMWritingBible" /> ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 (Dec. 1942) introduced Billy and Freddy to Mary Bromfield, a rich girl who turns out to be Billy's long-lost twin sister.

===Later DC origins===
The basic elements of Billy Batson's and Captain Marvel's origin story remained more or less intact through 2012, with minor alterations over the years. Roy & Dann Thomas' 1987 miniseries ''Shazam! The New Beginning'' had a 15-year old Billy being forced to move in with Doctor Sivana, who in this version is the cruel uncle who throws Billy out into the street.<ref>''Shazam! The New Beginning'' #1 (1987)</ref> Jerry Ordway's 1994 ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel featured a ten-year-old Billy being chosen as the Wizard Shazam's champion, due to the influence of his archaeologist parents; the mysterious stranger from magic subway car is the ghost of Billy's father in this version.<ref name="POSgraphicnovel">{{Cite book | authorlink=Jerry Ordway | last=Ordway | first=Jerry | year=1994 | title=The Power of Shazam! | location=New York | publisher=DC Comics | isbn=1-56389-153-0}}</ref> Both the Thomases' and Ordway's retellings of the origin directly tie the need for the Wizard Shazam to draft a younger replacement to the coming re-emergence of [[Black Adam]], the wizard's first champion from the days of ancient Egypt who became evil and was due to escape thousands of years of banishment.<ref>''Shazam! The New Beginning'' #1-2 (1987)</ref><ref name="POSgraphicnovel" /> Ordway's origin added the extra element of Black Adam's alter ego/descendant Theo Adam being the murderer of Billy's parents.<ref name="POSgraphicnovel" />

In 2012, writer and DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns revised Billy Batson's origin for DC's ''New 52'' universe, also renaming the character's alter-ego as "Shazam" at this time. In his new origin story, Billy Batson is an arrogant and troubled 15-year-old foster child living in [[Philadelphia]] who has gone through several foster homes.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #7 (May 2012)</ref> At his newest foster home, he gains five foster siblings: Mary Bromfield, Freddy Freeman, Pedro Peña, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #8 (April 2012)</ref> When the evil Dr. Sivana unleashes the ancient magical warrior Black Adam from his tomb,<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #9 (July 2012)</ref> the Wizard of the Rock of Eternity – the last of a council of beings who once controlled magic – begins abducting candidates to assess them for the job of being his champion.  He dismisses them all for not being pure of heart.<ref name="JL0">''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #0 (Nov. 2012)</ref><ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #2, 7 (May 2012)</ref>

Eventually, the Wizard summons Billy, who is another unsuitable candidate, but Billy persuades the Wizard that perfectly good people "really don't exist". In desperation and seeing the "embers of good" within Billy, the dying Wizard passes on his powers and teaches Billy they can be accessed through the magic word "Shazam" when spoken with good intentions.  After saying the magic word, Billy is struck by a bolt of lightning which transforms him into Shazam, a super-powered being possessing super-strength, flight, and vast magical powers.  The Wizard dies and transports Shazam back to Earth, where Billy reveals his new secret to Freddy.  The two scheme to make money with Shazam's new powers, until Shazam is attacked by Black Adam.<ref name="JL0" /> Billy is saved only by sharing his powers with his foster siblings, who all become magic-powered adult superheroes (save for Darla, who remains a child).<ref name="JL21" /> Ultimately, Billy goads Adam into saying the magic word and transforming into his human form, at which time he promptly turns to dust.<ref name="JL21">''Justice League ''#21 (2013)</ref>

Commencing the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, Billy flies to Black Adam's home nation of [[Kahndaq]] to bury Adam's remains. Shazam's entry into the country is interpreted by the locals as illegal US entry into their territory. This leads to run-ins with both the independent Justice League and the US-sponsored Justice League of America (JLA), and a series of events that see the opening of [[Pandora's Box]], a portal to [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]] which brings the evil Justice League analogues of the [[Crime Syndicate]] to Earth-0.<ref>''Justice League'' #22-23 (2013)</ref><ref>''Justice of America'' #6 (2013)</ref> Following the successful defeat of the Crime Syndicate, Shazam is inducted into the League.<ref>''Justice League'' #30 (2014)</ref> While still a newcomer to the league, Billy has a number of new adventures while under the mentorship of [[Victor Stone|Cyborg]].<ref name="Justice League #31 2014">''Justice League'' #31 (2014)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
The character obtains powers through a transformation from a human persona into a superpowered entity. When the human persona, Billy Batson, says the magic word "''Shazam!''", he becomes the superpowered Captain Marvel/Shazam.

Though the link to the specific mythological figures is de-emphasized in many modern-day stories, traditionally the letters in the name ''Shazam'' each represent a specific superhuman ability:

In some stories, the stamina of Atlas makes Captain Marvel/Shazam nearly invulnerable in the same way as Superman and similar characters in that he is almost completely impervious to harm from such things as bullets, blades, fire, chemicals, and explosions.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The stamina of Atlas also prevents him from getting tired and provides him with a supernaturally endowed [[metabolism]] preventing fatigue, thirst and hunger.<ref name="WFC 257">''World's Finest Comics'' #257</ref> 
|-
|'''Z''' || for the Power of '''Z'''eus || [[Zeus]]' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel/Shazam, also enhances Marvel's other physical and mental abilities, and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks. The hero can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or other target. The magic lightning has several uses, such as creating apparatus, restoring damage done to the hero, and providing fuel for magic spells. The current-continuity version of Shazam is able to personally generate and control lightning for various uses. He also can use it readily from his fingertips.<ref name="WFC 254">''World's Finest Comics'' #254</ref>

|'''A''' || for the Courage of '''A'''chilles || This aspect is mostly psychological and spiritual in nature. The courage of [[Achilles]] gives Captain Marvel/Shazam the courage and bravery of the legendary Greek hero. This magic stems from the [[Styx]], endowing Captain Marvel/Shazam with an omnipresent presence of good will and inner harmony that protects him from doubt, renders him impervious to intimidation or forces of personality, and comforts him even in the most hopeless of times. In one story it is claimed to also give him fighting skills.<ref name="CMA 144">''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #144</ref> In the ''[[The Trials of Shazam!|Trials of Shazam!]]'' miniseries, this was changed temporarily to Achilles' near-invulnerability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} It also aids the hero's mental fortitude against most mental attacks.

|'''M''' || for the Speed of '''M'''ercury || By channeling [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'s speed, Captain Marvel/Shazam can move at superhuman speeds and fly, although in older comics he could only leap great distances. The Captain Marvel of pre-1985 stories was also able to travel to the Rock of Eternity by flying faster than the speed of light.

In classic stories, simply saying the word "Shazam!" transformed Billy into Captain Marvel and back again,<ref>Whiz Comics #2 (Feb 1940)</ref> a caveat that extended to accidental utterances, recording playbacks, and so forth.<ref>Shazam! #4 (1973)</ref> When Captain Marvel shared his powers with his Marvel Shazam Family teammates, it was depicted as a finite source which would be divided into halves, thirds, or further depending upon how many Marvels were super-powered at one time, and weakening them accordingly.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #5, 7 (1996)</ref>

Captain Marvel/Shazam is not completely invulnerable. In several stories, he is shown to be susceptible to high-powered magic,<ref name="DOJref">Day of Vengeance #6 (2005)</ref> which can weaken or de-power him,<ref name="DOJref" /> and, in some older stories, to significantly high voltages of lightning or electricity, which would revert him back to Billy Batson form.<ref>''The Marvel Family'' #10 (1947)</ref> Later depictions also show his childlike innocence and immaturity to be a significant weakness.<ref>''Shazam! The New Beginning'' #1 (1987)</ref>

In the late 2000s, when Billy replaced the wizard and took on a white costume and the name of "Marvel", he commanded the various magical abilities once owned by the wizard. However, he was required to remain on the Rock of Eternity and could only be away from it for 24 hours at a time.<ref>''The Trials of Shazam!'' #8 (2007)</ref>

Since the 2011 reboot, Shazam's powers have been slightly altered. The word "Shazam" does not cause a transformation if Billy does not want it to; he is able to use and manipulate magical lightning much more readily from his fingertips; able to share his magical powers and bestow unique powers onto those he chooses, without weakening himself but disrupting the enchantments cast.<ref>''Justice League'' #20 (2014)</ref> He also demonstrates the ability to use magic in as-yet-unexplored ways, on one occasion using it to conjure items.<ref name="Justice League #31 2014"/>

==Other versions==

A significant number of "alternate" depictions of Shazam/Captain Marvel have appeared in DC publications since the 1970s.

===Captain Thunder (1974)===
In ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974), Superman found himself at odds with "Captain Thunder", a superhero displaced from another Earth and another time.  Thunder had been magically tricked by his archenemies in the Monster League of Evil into, and thus into doing battle with Superman. Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel's original moniker, was a thinly veiled [[pastiche]] of Marvel—down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named "Willie Fawcett" (a reference to the publisher of the original Captain Marvel stories, Fawcett Comics), and a magic word ("Thunder!"), which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers. He got his power from rubbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying "Thunder". His powers came from Tornado (power), Hare (speed), [[Uncas]] (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight), and Ram (tenacity). Superman held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell.

At the time of ''Superman'' #276, DC had been publishing ''Shazam!'' comics for two years, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications. The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in ''Justice League of America'' #137, two years later (although he met [[Lex Luthor]] in ''Shazam!'' #15, November/December 1974).

===Captain Thunder (1982)===
In 1983, a proposal for an updated Captain Marvel was submitted to DC by Roy Thomas, Don Newton, and Jerry Ordway.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> This version of the character, to be an inhabitant of DC's main Earth-One universe, rather than the Fawcett-based Earth-S universe, would have featured an African-American version of Billy Batson named "Willie Fawcett" (as in the 1974 story), who spoke the magic word "Shazam!" to become Captain Thunder, Earth-One's Mightiest Mortal.<ref name="AlterEgo9Article" /> This alternate version of the character was never used.

===Captain Thunder (2011): ''Flashpoint''===
The 2011 ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries featured an alternate timeline accidentally created by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], who then helped the heroes of this timeline to restore history.  One of those heroes is Captain Thunder – an alternative version of Captain Marvel who has six alter-egos, rather than one, and a scarred face as the result of a fight with [[Wonder Woman]], who in this timeline is a villain.

The six children, collectively known as "S.H.A.Z.A.M.", each possess one of the six attributes of the power of Shazam, and must say the magic word together to become Captain Thunder. They are: an Asian-American boy named Eugene Choi, who possesses the wisdom of Solomon; an overweight Hispanic boy named Pedro Peña, who possesses the strength of Hercules; the white Mary Batson, who possesses the stamina of Atlas; Freddy Freeman, also white, who possesses the power of Zeus; Billy Batson, also white, who possesses the courage of Achilles; and an African-American girl named Darla Dudley who possesses the speed of Mercury. Pedro's pet tiger Tawny also transforms into a more powerful version of himself via the magic lightning.<ref name="fp1">''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref>

The six children later transform into Captain Thunder to help Flash and his allies stop the war between [[Aquaman]]'s [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] army and Wonder Woman's [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] forces. Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Flash's accomplice [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]], who is revealed to be a traitor. Before the kids can re-form Captain Thunder, Billy is stabbed by the Amazon Penthesileia and killed.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref>

After the conclusion of the ''Flashpoint'' miniseries, the three new children from the ''Flashpoint'' timeline – Eugene, Pedro, and Darla – were incorporated into the DC Universe via the ''Shazam!'' backup strip in ''Justice League'', appearing as Billy, Mary, and Freddy's foster siblings.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===''Elseworld's Finest''===
In the alternate universe [[Elseworlds]] book ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'' (1998), the current Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African American man; in a flashback to the older Justice Society, he appears as Captain Marvel typically has, leading to the conclusion that there were two Captain Marvels.

===''The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===
In the dark alternate future shown in ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Captain Marvel is visibly aged, with receding white hair and glasses. Lex Luthor, who has captured Mary Marvel, coerces him into working for him by threatening to kill her. During an alien attack on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out, and admits that Billy Batson – here, clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel, rather than simply transforming into him – died eight years ago of unspecified health problems. As a result, when he next speaks his word, he will cease to exist, like any dream that no longer has anyone to remember it.  His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best, noting that it was nice existing, before he calls down his lightning and destroys himself.

===''Kingdom Come''===
The graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' depicts a possible future of the DC characters. In this version, Billy Batson is grown up, but the human hostility towards superheroes has made him uneasy, and he has not transformed into Captain Marvel for several years. Instead, he becomes a brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor, who uses Mister Mind's offspring to keep Batson in check and bend him to his will. Nevertheless, Batson's potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them, unsure whether it is Batson (whose adult appearance is identical to his Captain Marvel form) or Marvel that serves Luthor.

Events finally cause him to change back into Captain Marvel, and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world. When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb, Captain Marvel &ndash; spurred by Superman telling him that due to his ties to both humanity and the superhuman community, he is the only one capable of making the choice &ndash; triggers his lightning to sacrifice himself and destroy the bomb while it is still airborne. The bomb's fallout kills a large number of heroes, but does cool the war-like attitudes of the survivors. Superman uses Marvel's cape as the symbol of a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]] in which humans and superhumans will now live in harmony.<ref>Kingdom Come #4</ref>

===Earth-5===
In the final issue of the maxi-series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (#52, May 2, 2007), a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities, one of which is designated Earth-5.  As a result of Marvel Family foe [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-S, including the Marvel Family characters.

The Earth-5 Captain Marvel and Billy Batson appeared, assisting Superman, in the ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' miniseries.<ref>''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #1 (August 2008)</ref> The miniseries established that these versions of Captain Marvel and Billy are two separate beings, and that Billy is a reporter for WHIZ Media, rather than a radio broadcaster.  The Earth-5 Captain Marvel reappeared in ''Final Crisis'' #7, along with an army of Supermen from across the Multiverse to prevent its destruction by Darkseid.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> Following [[The New 52]] Multiverse reboot, Earth-5 remains a Fawcett Comics-inspired setting, and is spotlighted in the comic book ''[[The Multiversity]]: Thunderworld #1'' (Feb 2015), a modernized take on the classic Fawcett ''Captain Marvel'' stories from writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Cameron Stewart]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |title=GRANT MORRISON on MULTIVERSITY: It's Going to 'F' People Up |url= http://www.newsarama.com/21741-grant-morrison-on-multiversity-it-s-going-to-f-people-up.html |date=July 28, 2014 |accessdate=December 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |title=CAMERON STEWART Brings Back CAPTAIN MARVEL For THE MULTIVERSITY: THUNDERWORLD |url= http://www.newsarama.com/23047-vivisecting-multiversity-cameron-stewart-brings-back-captain-marvel-for-thunderworld.html |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=December 30, 2014}}</ref>

===''Justice League: Generation Lost''===
A female version of Captain Marvel is shown as a member of an alternate-future Justice League in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''.  Little is revealed about her, other than the fact that her civilian name is Sahar Shazeen, and she is shown wielding a pair of swords during battle.  She and her teammates are ultimately killed by an army of [[OMAC (comics)|Omni Mind And Community (OMACs)]].<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14</ref>

===''Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil''===
A second Captain Marvel miniseries, ''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]'', written and illustrated by [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] (creator of ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''), was published in four 48-page installments between February and July 2007.  Smith's ''Shazam!'' miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, which updates and reimagines Captain Marvel's origin.<ref>{{cite web | last=Warmoth | first=Brian | url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm | title=The Strategem of Smith (cached) | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date=February 7, 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210063430/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm | archivedate=2007-02-10}}</ref> Smith's story features a younger-looking Billy Batson and Captain Marvel as separate personalities, as they were in the pre-1985 stories, and features a prepubescent Mary Marvel as Captain Marvel's sidekick, instead of the traditional teen-aged or adult version.  Dr. Sivana is [[Attorney General of the United States]], and Mister Mind looks more like a snake than a caterpillar.

===''Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!''===
An all-ages Captain Marvel comic, ''[[Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!]]'', debuted in July 2008 under DC's [[Johnny DC]] youth-oriented imprint, and was published monthly through December 2010.  Following the lead and continuity of Smith's version, it was initially written and drawn by [[Mike Kunkel]], creator of ''Herobear''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Pumpelly | first=Danny | date=August 11, 2007 | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11575 | title=WWC: DC New Worlds Order | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> [[Art Baltazar]] and [[Franco Aureliani]], of ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', took over as writers with issue #5, with Byron Vaughns as main artist until issue #13, when [[Mike Norton]] assumed his place for the remainder of the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2077 | title=Review: Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam! #14 | work=Comic Book Resources | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> Kunkel's version returns to the modern concept of having Captain Marvel retain Billy's personality, and also introduces new versions of Black Adam (whose alter ego, Theo Adam, is a child like Billy Batson in this version), [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]], the [[List of Marvel Family enemies (A-G)#Arson Fiend|Arson Fiend]], and Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel, Jr.

===Mazahs===
Mazahs is a corrupted alternate-universe version of Shazam, introduced in the 2013&ndash;14 ''[[Forever Evil]]'' DC Comics crossover event series. He is the super-powered alter-ego of [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-3|Alexander Luthor]] of [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]].<ref name="Forever Evil 6">{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=Friend, Richard|colorist=Oback, Sonia|letterer=Leigh, Rob|story=Forever Evil Chapter Six: The Power of Mazahs!|title=Forever Evil|volume=1|issue=6|date=May 2014|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> In the story, the [[Crime Syndicate]] (evil Earth-3 analogues of the Justice League) have brought Alexander Luthor, their prisoner, with them to the Prime Earth where the Justice League and other heroes reside. Prime Earth's [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Injustice League|his team]] sneak in to the Justice League Watchtower where the Syndicate has Alexander hostage, and remove the duct tape over his mouth, allowing Alexander to speak the magic word "Mazahs!" and transform into his muscular, highly powerful alter-ego. While Prime Earth's Shazam is known for sharing his powers with others, Mazahs kills other superbeings and takes their powers for his own, as when he kills the Syndicate's speedster [[Johnny Quick]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> In the final issue of the series, it is revealed that Earth-3's Wonder Woman analogue, [[Superwoman]], is in a relationship with Alexander and tricked her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor's team, but Prime Earth Lex Luthor (having the same voice as Mazahs) manages to call down the lightning, using a lightning-rod that Batman had retrieved to try and use against Johnny Quick based on his planned defense against the Flash, and transform Mazahs into his human form. Sealing Alexander's mouth, Lex stabs him with a knife, killing him.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref>

Superwoman later gives birth to Mazahs's child in ''Justice League'' #50, and uses the baby's power-stealing abilities - inherited from his father and by her using his magic word—to remove abilities the members the Prime-Earth Justice League had inherited from their time on [[Apokolips]] after the death of [[Darkseid]]. The story ends with the orphaned baby having absorbed both the [[Omega Effect]] from Lex Luthor as well as the [[Anti-Life Equation]] from Justice League associate [[Steve Trevor]], transforming him into a resurrected—yet still infantile—Darkseid.<ref>''Justice League'' #50 #7</ref>

===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===
In the prequel comic to the video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Shazam joins Superman's Regime in establishing a new approach to ending crime. Similar to the Golden Age version, this Shazam is suggested to have two personalities: Billy Batson is a separate person from Shazam. In Year One he, like the Flash, is somewhat skeptical of Superman's intentions, as his actions are often immoral; one chapter particularly focuses on his contradicting views on the matter. Ultimately, Shazam decides to stay and support the Regime, devoted to its cause. Years Two and Three see him helping to fight, respectively, the Green Lantern Corps and the magic users that Batman recruits for his Insurgency. He becomes the object of Harley Quinn's affection, being bound and gagged by her in Year Four. He is freed by [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] to join the Regime in combating the Amazon army and Greek gods, but just when they seem to be winning Zeus strips him of his powers, reverting him to Billy permanently. He, Harley (for trying to help him), and [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] are sent to [[Tartarus (DC Comics)|Tartarus]] as punishment, though they escape and Billy is left out of the conflict without his powers. Eventually, Zeus is forced to return Billy's power after the [[Highfather]] intervenes in the conflict. In Year Five Shazam's relationship with Harley is complicated when she confronts him about being in the Regime despite their growing tyranny, Shazam defending his presence with the Insurgency by arguing that he acts as a moral compass to stop the others going too far.

In game, Captain Marvel appears with the Flash in Atlantis to discuss the treaty between the city and the regime with Aquaman. They are instead confronted by an alternate version of the sea king and are both defeated in the ensuing battle. Captain Marvel is later seen fighting the resistance and stops Lex Luthor from using a kryptonite laser to kill Superman, enabling the latter to kill him in retribution. Later at the Fortress of Solitude, Batson speaks out against Superman's plans to wipe out other cities, stating that the Regime has finally gotten out of hand. Superman soon kills him with his heat vision, challenging anyone else to oppose him before his body is taken away by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]].

==Supporting cast==
{{Main article|Marvel Family|List of Marvel Family enemies}}

In the traditional ''Shazam!'' stories, Captain Marvel often fights evil as a member of a superhero team known as the Marvel Family, made up of himself and several other heroes: the wizard Shazam, who empowers the team; Captain Marvel's sister Mary Marvel; and Marvel's protégé, Captain Marvel, Jr. Before the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earth]]s'' miniseries, the Marvel Family also included part-time members such as Mary's non-powered friend "Uncle" Dudley ([[Uncle Marvel]]), Dudley's non-powered niece Freckles Marvel, and a team of protégés (all of whose alter egos are named "Billy Batson") known as the [[Lieutenant Marvels]]. A pink rabbit version of Captain Marvel, [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]], appeared in his own stories featuring a [[funny-animal]] cast.

Over the course of his adventures, Captain Marvel has gained an extensive [[rogues gallery]], the most notable of whom include the evil mad scientist Doctor Sivana (and, pre-''Crisis'', the Sivana Family); Shazam's corrupted previous champion Black Adam, who has powers from Egyptian gods; Adolf Hitler's champion Captain Nazi; and the mind-controlling worm, Mister Mind, and his Monster Society of Evil.  Other Marvel Family foes include the evil robot Mister Atom; the "World's Mightiest Immortal" [[Oggar]], a god with magical powers who had been a former pupil of Shazam; and Ibac and [[Sabbac]], demon-powered supervillains who transform by speaking magic words made up of beings who give them power in a manner similar to Captain Marvel.

The Marvel Family's non-powered allies have traditionally included Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult offspring, Beautia and Magnificus Sivana; Mister "Tawky" Tawny the talking tiger; WHIZ radio president and Billy's employer Sterling Morris; and Billy's girlfriend Cissie Sommerly. Jerry Ordway's ''Power of Shazam!'' series also introduced Billy's school principal Miss Wormwood and Mary's adoptive parents Nick and Nora Bromfield.

The current-continuity version of Shazam has five foster siblings, with whom he can share his powers at will: Mary Batson, Freddy Freeman, Pedro Peña, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley.  Shazam can also share his powers with Tawny, a tiger at the local city zoo whom he considers family.<ref name="JL21" />

===Direct-to-video animated films===
* Captain Marvel's first appearance in [[Warner Bros. Animation]]'s line of [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] direct-to-video films was a brief cameo in 2008's ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. The character had a more substantial role in the 2009 animated film ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', based on a ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' comic book arc in which Marvel battles Superman under orders from United States president Lex Luthor. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Corey Burton]].  An uncredited [[Rachael MacFarlane]] voiced Billy Batson.
* In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' an evil Earth 3 version of Captain Marvel named "Captain Super" appears.
* Captain Marvel appears in an animated short film entitled ''[[Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam]]'' (released on the ''DC Showcase Original Shorts Collection'' DVD compilation as part of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]]) with [[Jerry O'Connell]] reprising his role as Captain Marvel and Billy Batson voiced by [[Zach Callison]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1007/10/ | title=DC Showcase Animated Shorts | work=Comics Continuum | date=July 10, 2010 | accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Collura | first=Scott | url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/110/1108411p1.html | title=SDCC 10: DC Shorts Showcase | work=IGN | date=July 25, 2010 | accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Harvey | first=James | url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=884 | title=Main Cast, Crew Details for ''Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam'' | work=Worlds Finest Online | date=October 29, 2010 | accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>
* Captain Thunder and the S.H.A.Z.A.M. kids appear in the animated movie adaptation of ''Flashpoint'', ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'', with Pedro Peña and Billy Batson voiced by [[Candi Milo]] and [[Jennifer Hale]], and Captain Thunder voiced by [[Steven Blum]].
* In 2014, the character – now renamed Shazam – appeared in the animated film ''[[Justice League: War]]''. Zach Callison reprised his role as Billy Batson, and Shazam is voiced by [[Sean Astin]]. Billy is living in a foster home and is a fan of Vic "Victory" Stone. After stealing Vic's jersey, Billy takes notice that something is lurking in his backyard. Taking a bat, he yells "SHAZAM!" and smacks the Parademon away. He heads to S.T.A.R. labs, where he is shocked to find Vic turned into Cyborg; they both join the other heroes in trying to blind Darkseid and send his troops home. Forced to use the blast of his transformation to recharge the boom tube, Billy asks Cyborg to keep his identity secret.
* Shazam appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: Throne of Atlantis]]'', voiced again by Sean Astin. Unlike Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern, who prefer to work solo, Shazam frequents the Hall of Justice to see Cyborg. He appears to have meddled with the sign above the door to have his goofy team name, given it was being taken down. At the end of the film, he suggests Aquaman's codename based on the gossip on the internet.
* Shazam himself does not appear in ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'', although his absence is mentioned by other Justice League members.

===Radio===
In about 1943, a radio serial of Captain Marvel was briefly broadcast (possibly by either [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] or [[NBC]]) initially with Burt Boyar as Billy Batson. According to Boyar's faint memories in a 2011 interview, the show was initially produced in New York but after about a month relocated to Chicago; no further details about the show or transcripts of it survived. Existence of the show was confirmed by historian [[Jim Harmon]] via recollections of old time radio fans who recalled hearing it during original broadcasts, plus locating period program listings.<ref>Hamerlinck, P.C. (June 2012) "The Boy Who Was Billy Batson: The Captain Marvel Radio Show Mystery". [[Alter Ego (magazine)|''Alter Ego'']] (TwoMorrows Publishing) (110): 75-79.</ref>

===Television===
{{unreferenced section|more|date=October 2015}}

* Captain Marvel first came to television in 1974. [[Filmation]] produced ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'', a live-action television show, which ran from 1974 to 1977 on [[CBS]]. From 1975 until the end of its run, it aired as one-half of ''The Shazam!/Isis Hour'', featuring Filmation's own ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' as a companion program.

[[Image:Bostwick-shazam-captmarv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jackson Bostwick]] as Captain Marvel on CBS' ''Shazam!'' Saturday morning TV series.]]

Instead of directly following the lead of the comic, the ''Shazam!'' TV show took a more indirect approach to the character: Billy Batson/Captain Marvel, accompanied by an older man known simply as Mentor ([[Les Tremayne]]), traveled in a motor home across the US, interacting with people in different towns in which they stopped to save the citizens from some form of danger or to help them combat some form of evil.  With the wizard Shazam absent from this series, Billy received his powers and counsel directly from the six "immortal elders" represented in the "Shazam" name, who were depicted via animation: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. ''Shazam!'' starred [[Michael Gray (actor)|Michael Gray]] as Billy Batson, with both [[Jackson Bostwick]] (season 1) and John Davey (seasons 2 and 3) as Captain Marvel.<ref>{{IMDb title|0071050|Shazam!}}</ref> An adapted version of Isis, the heroine of ''The Secrets of Isis'', was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam's wife in the weekly comic book series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.

Shortly after the ''Shazam!'' show ended its network run, Captain Marvel (played by Garrett Craig) appeared as a character in a pair of low-budget, live-action comedy specials, produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] under the name ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' in 1979. The specials also featured [[Howard Morris]] as Doctor Sivana, and [[Ruth Buzzi]] as Aunt Minerva, marking the first appearance of those characters in film or television.  Although Captain Marvel did not appear in Hanna-Barbera's long-running concurrent [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series ''[[Super Friends]]'' (which featured many of the other DC superheroes), he did appear in some of the merchandise associated with the show.

*Filmation revisited the character three years later for an animated ''Shazam!'' cartoon, which ran on [[NBC]] from 1981 to 1982 as part of ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'' with Captain Marvel voiced by Burr Middleton.  The rest of the Marvel Family joined Captain Marvel on his adventures in this series, which were more similar to his comic-book adventures than the 1970s TV show.  Dr. Sivana, Mr. Mind, Black Adam, and other familiar Captain Marvel foes appeared as enemies.
*Captain Marvel and/or Billy Batson made brief "cameo" appearances in two 1990s TV series.  Billy has a non-speaking cameo in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Obsession", while live actors portraying Captain Marvel make "cameo" appearances in both a dream-sequence within an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and in the [[Beastie Boys]]' music video for "Alive".

[[File:cmarvel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Captain Marvel fights Superman in the "Clash" episode of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]

* Captain Marvel's first formal appearance in a DC animated universe series, the name given to the animated DC Comics spin-off productions produced by [[Bruce Timm]] and/or [[Paul Dini]], was as the main guest star character of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Clash", originally aired in 2005 on [[Cartoon Network]]. Captain Marvel was voiced by [[Jerry O'Connell]], and Billy Batson by [[Shane Haboucha]]. In this episode, Captain Marvel joins the Justice League, but his positive opinions about supervillain Lex Luthor's apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman. This tension eventually leads to an all-out battle between Marvel and Superman, who are both unaware that Marvel is unwittingly a pawn in a plot by Luthor and [[Amanda Waller]] to damage Superman's image.{{cn|date=December 2016}}
* Captain Marvel made seven appearances in Cartoon Network's ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' series, with Captain Marvel voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and Billy Batson by [[Tara Strong]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://voiceactors.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/tara-strong-batman-chowder-drawn-together/ | title=Tara Strong on 'Batman', 'Chowder', 'Drawn Together' Movie | work=Voiceactors.wordpress.com | date=July 14, 2009 | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> After first appearing in the opening teaser to the episode "Death Race to Oblivion!", Marvel appeared in two episodes dedicated to his world during the show's second season. "The Power of Shazam!" featured Captain Marvel/Billy Batson alongside the Sivana Family, Black Adam, the wizard Shazam, Aunt Minerva, and Mary Batson, while "The Malicious Mr. Mind" featured the Marvel Family, Sivana, Mr. Mind, and the Monster Society of Evil.  Captain Marvel also appears in the two-episode season 2 storyline "The Siege of Starro!", and the third season episodes "Night of the Batmen!" and "Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!"
* Captain Marvel also appeared as a recurring character in the ongoing DC Comics–based Cartoon Network series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (2011–present), with Captain Marvel voiced by [[Rob Lowe]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/22/cci-shazam-rob-lowe-to-voice-captain-marvel-in-young-justice/ | title=CCI: Shazam! Rob Lowe to Voice Captain Marvel in Young Justice | work=Comic Book Resources | date=July 22, 2010 | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> and later by [[Chad Lowe]], while Billy Batson is voiced by [[Robert Ochoa]]. Depicted as a member of the Justice League, Marvel is introduced as the team's new "den mother" in the episode "Alpha Male" after [[Red Tornado]]'s disappearance. At various times, he sometimes joins the teenage heroes of Young Justice on their missions. Billy is 10 years old in his season 1 appearances, and 15 in season 2 which takes place five years later. 
* Shazam, Billy Batson, and several of their supporting characters appear in three one-minute ''Shazam!'' ''[[DC Nation Shorts|DC Nation]]'' cartoon shorts produced in 2014 as interstitials for Cartoon Network's Saturday morning programming.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://geektyrant.com/news/shazam-3-short-films-courage-stamina-and-wisdom |title=SHAZAM! 3 Short Films — Courage, Stamina, and Wisdom |work=GeekTyrant |first=Free |last=Reyes |date=September 3, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref> Featuring designs inspired by the 1930s [[Fleischer Studios]] ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons, the three shorts — "Courage", "Wisdom", and "Stamina" — feature Tara Strong reprising her role as the voice of Billy Batson and [[David Kaye]] voicing Shazam.
* Shazam appears as a guest character in the 2016 Cartoon Network animated TV series ''[[Justice League Action]]'', with Shazam and Billy Batson both voiced by [[Sean Astin]]. Billy Batson first appears in "Classic Rock" where he is summoned by the Wizard to help fight Black Adam at the Rock of Eternity. In the episode "Abate and Switch," Batman brings Billy Batson to where the Justice League are fighting Black Adam and Brothers Djinn members [[Demons Three|Abnegazar, Rath, and Nyorlath]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/december-15-2016-new-justice-league-action-clip-shazam-slam/ |title=December 15, 2016: New “Justice League Action” Clip – “Shazam Slam” |date=2016-12-15 |website=Superman Homepage}}</ref>

===Video games===
* Captain Marvel made his first official video game appearance as a playable character in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', played by Stephan Scalabrino and voiced by [[Kevin Delaney (actor)|Kevin Delaney]], for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] game consoles.

===Comic strips===
In 1943, C.C. Beck and writer Rod Reed prepared seven sample installments of a comic strip, but syndicates expressed no interest in it.  Reed suspected that the DC lawsuit was the syndicates' reason, for fear of becoming parties in the ongoing litigation.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Beck | first=C.C. | contribution=The Captain Marvel Daily Newspaper Strip | editor-last=Hamerlinck | editor-first=P.C. | title=The Fawcett Companion | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | year=2001 | pages=46–47}}</ref>

Captain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] in general.  The most notable contribution is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] comic book stories.  The two are often portrayed as equally matched and, while Marvel does not possess Superman's heat vision, x-ray vision or breath powers, the magic-based nature of his own powers are a weakness for Superman.

The National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in "[[Superduperman]]",<ref>Wright, p. 146.</ref> a satirical comic book story by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]] in the fourth issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (April/May 1953).  Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature.  Marbles' magic word is "SHAZOOM", which stands for '''S'''trength, '''H'''ealth, '''A'''ptitude, '''Z'''eal, '''O'''x (power of), '''O'''x (power of another), and '''M'''oney.  In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal.  Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.

While publishing its ''Shazam!'' revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in ''Superman'' #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name.  He apparently battles against a Monster League, who cast a spell to make him evil, but Superman helps him break free.<ref>''Superman'' #276 (June 1974)</ref> Two years later, ''Justice League of America'' #135–137 presented a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies.  It is in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first meet, albeit briefly. [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] has caused Superman to go mad using [[red kryptonite]], meaning he and Marvel battle, but Marvel restores his mind to normal with lightning.

In ''Shazam!'' #30 (1977), Dr. Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh's steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of ''[[Action Comics]]''.  He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the robot is destroyed.

Notable later Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include ''[[All-New Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-58 (1978), ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #36–37 (1984), and ''[[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]'' vol. 2, #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in ''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996) serves as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes. The "Clash" episode of the DC-based animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which includes Captain Marvel as a guest character, features a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece. By contrast, the depiction of the pair's first meeting in the ''Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder'' miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy's mentor when he learns the boy's true age.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Cimino |first = John |title = Superman vs. Captain Marvel The Definitive Write-Up on the Greatest Rivalry in Comics |journal= Back Issue! |issue = 66 |pages = 69–77 |publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing |date = August 2013}}</ref>
