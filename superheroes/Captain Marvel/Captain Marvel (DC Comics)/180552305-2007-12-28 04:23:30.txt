'''Captain Marvel''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], originally published by [[Fawcett Comics]] and later by [[DC Comics]]. Created in 1939 by artist [[C. C. Beck]] and writer [[Bill Parker]], the character first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 (February 1940). With a premise that taps adolescent fantasy, Captain Marvel is the [[alter ego]] of '''Billy Batson''', a youth who works as a [[radio]] [[Journalist|news reporter]] and was chosen to be a champion of good by the [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]] [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]]. Whenever Billy speaks the wizard's name, he is instantly struck by a magic lightning bolt that transforms him into an adult superhero empowered with the abilities of six mythical figures. Several friends and family members, most notably [[Marvel Family]] cohorts [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]], can share Billy's power and become "Marvels" themselves. 

Hailed as "The World's Mightiest Mortal" in his adventures, Captain Marvel was nicknamed "The Big Red Cheese" by archvillain [[Doctor Sivana]], an epithet later adopted by Captain Marvel's fans. Based on sales, Captain Marvel was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, as his ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' comic book series sold more copies than ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' and other competing superhero books during the mid-1940s.<ref name="TiptonMoviePoopShoot".>{{cite web | last =Tipton | first =Scott  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The World's Mightiest Mortal | work = | publisher =  | date= 2003-04-01 | url =http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/6.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2005-06-17 }}Excerpt: "I’ve always felt that it was this origin story and concept that made Captain Marvel instantly popular, to the point that it was outselling every comic on the stands for several years throughout the '40s."</ref><ref name=”ComicSuccessMuseum”>{{cite web | last =The Museum of Comic Book Advertising | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Comic Book Success Stories | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://comicbookads.leafpublishing.com/hall-of-covers/cover-display2-page2.htm | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2005-06-17 }}</ref> Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted to film, in [[1941 in film|1941]] (''[[Adventures of Captain Marvel|The Adventures of Captain Marvel]]'').

Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, due in part to a [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|copyright infringement suit from DC Comics]] alleging that Captain Marvel was an illegal infringement of Superman. In 1972, DC licensed the Marvel Family characters and returned them to publication, acquiring all rights to the characters by 1991.<ref name="DCbought">{{cite newsgroup |author=[[Mark Waid]] |date=[[1995-01-04]] |accessdate=2007-07-06 | id=3efse3$pi6$1@mhade.production.compuserve.com |newsgroup=rec.arts.comics.misc |title=Re: HELP!! FAWCETT question |url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.misc/msg/7fdeded4362dc255}}</ref> DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their [[DC Universe]], and have attempted to revive the property several times. However, Captain Marvel has not regained widespread appeal with new generations, although a 1970s ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'' live-action television series featuring the character was popular.

Because [[Marvel Comics]] trademarked their ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' comic book during the interim between the original Captain Marvel's Fawcett years and DC years, DC Comics is unable to promote and market their Captain Marvel/Marvel Family properties under that name. Since 1972, DC has instead used the trademark ''Shazam!'' as the title of their comic books and thus the name under which they market and promote the character. Consequently, Captain Marvel himself is sometimes erroneously referred to as Shazam.

==Publication history==
===Development and inspirations===
[[Image:Capt-marvel-flash-comics.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Flash Comics'' [[ashcan copy|ashcan edition]] featuring Captain Marvel as "Captain Thunder", cover art by [[C. C. Beck]].]]

After the success of [[DC Comics|National Comics]]' new superhero characters [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], [[Fawcett Publications]] decided in 1939 to start its own comics division. Fawcett recruited writer Bill Parker to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled ''Flash Comics''. Besides penning stories featuring [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Golden Arrow (comics)|Golden Arrow]], [[Lance O'Casey]], [[Scoop Smith]] and [[Dan Dare (Fawcett Comics)|Dan Dare]] for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure. Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called "Captain Thunder."<ref name="JohnnyShazam">{{cite web | last = Hembeck | first = Fred | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Johnny Thunder and Shazam! | work =  | publisher = The Hembeck Files  | date=  2003-06-18 | url = http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/shazam2. | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2005-06-22 }}</ref> Staff artist Clarence Charles "C. C." Beck was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat [[cartoon]]y style that became his trademark.

The first issue of the comic book, printed as both ''Flash Comics'' #1 and ''Thrill Comics'' #1, had a low-print run in the fall of 1939 as an [[ashcan copy]] created for advertising purposes. Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark "Captain Thunder," "Flash Comics," or "Thrill Comics," because all three names were already in use. Consequently, the book was renamed ''Whiz Comics'', and Fawcett artist [[Pete Costanza]] suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to "Captain Marvelous," which the editors shortened to "Captain Marvel." The [[Speech balloon|word balloon]]s in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as "Captain Marvel." ''Whiz Comics'' #2, dated February 1940, was published in late 1939. Since it was the first of that title to actually be published, the issue is sometimes referred to as ''Whiz Comics'' #1, despite the issue number printed on it.

Inspirations for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources. His visual appearance was modeled after that of [[Fred MacMurray]], a popular [[United States|American]] [[actor]] of the period. C. C. Beck's later versions of the character would resemble other American actors, including [[Cary Grant]] and [[Jack Oakie]]. Fawcett Publications' founder, Wilford H. Fawcett, was nicknamed "Captain Billy," which inspired the name "Billy Batson" and Marvel's title as well. Fawcett's earliest magazine was titled ''[[Fawcett Publications|Captain Billy's Whiz Bang]]'', which inspired the title ''Whiz Comics''. In addition, Fawcett adapted several of the elements that had made Superman, the first popular comic book superhero, popular (super strength and speed, science-fiction stories, a mild mannered reporter alter ego), and incorporated them into Captain Marvel. Fawcett's circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff, "give me a Superman, only have his other identity be a 10 or 12-year-old boy rather than a man."<ref name=” likeSupes”>

As a result, Captain Marvel was given a twelve-year-old boy named Billy Batson as an alter ego. In the origin story printed in ''Whiz Comics'' #2, Billy, a homeless newsboy, is lead by a mysterious stranger to a secret subway tunnel. An odd subway car with no visible driver takes them to the lair of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], who grants Billy the power to become the adult superhero Captain Marvel. In order to transform into Captain Marvel, Billy must speak the wizard's name, an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for the six various legendary figures who had agreed to grant aspects of themselves to a willing subject: the wisdom of [[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]]; the strength of [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]]; the stamina of [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]]; the power of [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]]; the courage of [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]]; and the speed of [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]]. Speaking the word produces a bolt of magic lightning which transforms Billy into Captain Marvel; speaking the word again reverses the transformation with another bolt of lightning.

Captain Marvel wore a bright red costume, inspired by both military uniforms and [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] costumes as depicted in popular [[opera]]s, with gold trim and a lightning bolt insignia on the chest. The body suit originally included a buttoned [[lapel]], but was changed to a one-piece skintight suit within a year at the insistence of the editors (the current DC costume of the character has the lapel restored to it). The costume also included a white-collared [[cape]] trimmed with gold flower symbols, usually asymmetrically thrown over the left shoulder and held around his neck by a gold cord. The cape came from the ceremonial cape worn by the [[British honors system|British nobility]], photographs of which appeared in newspapers in the 1930s.

In addition to introducing the main character and his alter ego, Captain Marvel's first adventure in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil [[Doctor Sivana]], and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter. Captain Marvel was an instant success, with ''Whiz Comics'' #2 selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name="ComicSuccessMuseum">{{cite web

Captain Marvel's circulation numbers exceeded National's Superman title and the rivalry between the companies led National to sue Fawcett for plagiarism."</ref> By 1941, he had his own solo series, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', while continuing to appear in ''Whiz Comics'' as well. He also made periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including ''Master Comics''.

===Fawcett years: the Marvel Family, allies, and enemies===

"Hillbilly" Marvel; and [[Mary Marvel]]. [[Marvel Family|Uncle Marvel]] can be seen seated at the piano in the background.]]

Through his adventures, Captain Marvel soon gained a host of enemies. His most frequent foe was [[Doctor Sivana]], a [[mad scientist]] who was determined to rule the world, yet was thwarted by Captain Marvel at every turn. Marvel's other villains included [[Adolf Hitler]]'s champion [[Captain Nazi]], an older Egyptian renegade Marvel called [[Black Adam]], an evil magic-powered brute named [[Ibac]], and an artificially intelligent [[nuclear energy|nuclear-powered]] [[robot]] called [[Mister Atom]]. The most notorious Captain Marvel villains, however, were the nefarious [[Mister Mind]] and his Monster Society of Evil, which recruited several of Marvel's previous adversaries. The "Monster Society of Evil" story arc ran as a twenty-five chapter serial in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #22–46 (March 1943 – May 1945), with Mister Mind eventually revealed to be a highly intelligent yet tiny [[worm]] from another planet.

In the early 1940s, Captain Marvel also gained allies in the Marvel Family, a collective of superheroes with powers and/or costumes similar to Captain Marvel's. (By comparison, Superman spin-off character [[Superboy]] first appeared in 1944, while [[Supergirl]] first appeared in 1959). ''Whiz Comics'' #21 (September 1941) marked the debut of the [[Lieutenant Marvels]], the alter egos of three other boys (all also named Billy Batson) who found that, by saying "Shazam!" in unison, they too could become Marvels. In ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (December 1941), a friend named Freddy Freeman, mortally wounded by an attack from Captain Nazi, was given the power to become teenage boy superhero Captain Marvel, Jr. A year later in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 (December 1942), Billy and Freddy met Billy's long-lost [[twin]] sister Mary Bromfield, who discovered she could, by saying the magic word "Shazam," become teenage superheroine Mary Marvel.

Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. were featured as a team in a new comic series entitled ''The Marvel Family''. This was published alongside the other Captain Marvel-related titles, which now included ''Wow Comics'' featuring Mary, ''Master Comics'' featuring Junior, and both ''Mary Marvel Comics'' and ''Captain Marvel, Jr. Comics''. Non-super-powered Marvels such as the "lovable [[Confidence trick|con artist]]" [[Marvel Family|Uncle Marvel]] and his niece, Freckles Marvel, also sometimes joined the other Marvels on their adventures. A [[funny animal]] character, [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]], was created in 1942 and later given a spin-off series of his own.

The members of the Marvel Family often teamed up with the other Fawcett superheroes, who included Ibis the Invincible, [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl]], Spy Smasher, [[Minute-Man]], and [[Mr. Scarlet]] and Pinky. Among the many artists and writers who worked on the Marvel Family stories alongside C. C. Beck and main writer [[Otto Binder]] were [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], [[Mac Raboy]], Pete Costanza, [[Kurt Schaffenberger]], and [[Marc Swayze]].

Through much of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden age of comic books]], Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium with his comics outselling all others, including those featuring Superman. In fact, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' sold fourteen million copies in 1944,<ref name=”ComicBooksinLibraries”>

Billy Batson typically narrated each Captain Marvel story, [[fourth wall|speaking directly to his reading audience]] from his WHIZ radio microphone, relating each story from the perspective of a young boy.

National Comics Publications (today known as DC Comics) sued Fawcett Comics for [[copyright infringement]] in 1941, alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman. After seven years of litigation, the ''[[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications]]'' case went to trials court in 1948. Although the judge presiding over the case decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement, DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their ''Superman'' daily [[Superman (comic strip)|newspaper strips]], and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss">Ingersoll, Bob ([[31 May]] [[1985]]). "The Law is a Ass" Installment #66. Comics Buyer's Guide issue #602. Retrieved from http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/law/back20001024.shtml on [[19 June]] [[2005]]. Detailed summary of the cases and rulings related to ''National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publishing''.</ref> As a result, the initial verdict, delivered in 1951, was decided in Fawcett's favor.

National appealed this decision, and Judge [[Learned Hand]] declared in 1952 that National's Superman copyright was in fact valid. Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement, but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements, and that the truth of this would have to be determined in a re-trial of the case. The judge therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination.<ref name="IngersollLawisAss" />

Instead of retrying the case, however, Fawcett decided to settle with National out of court. The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regards to Captain Marvel.

''Whiz Comics'' had ended with issue #146 in June 1952, ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' was cancelled with #150 (November 1953), and ''The Marvel Family'' ended its run with #89 (January 1954).

===''Marvelman'' (and ''Miracleman'')===
In the 1950s, a small [[Great Britain|British]] publisher, [[L. Miller and Son]], published a number of black and white reprints of American comic books, including the Captain Marvel series. With the outcome of the ''National v. Fawcett'' lawsuit, L. Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer, [[Mick Anglo]], who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called ''[[Marvelman]]''. Captain Marvel, Jr. was adapted to create ''Young Marvelman'', while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male ''Kid Marvelman''. The magic word "Shazam!" was replaced with "Kimota", "Atomic" backwards. The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's [[United Kingdom]] series with issue number 25.

Marvelman ceased publication in 1963, but was revived in 1982 by writer [[Alan Moore]] in the pages of ''Warrior Magazine''. Moore's black and white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by Eclipse Comics under the new title ''[[Miracleman]]'' beginning in 1985, and continued publication in the United States after ''Warrior'''s demise. Within the metatextual storyline of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Alan Moore and later ''Marvelman/Miracleman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]].

===DC Comics' ''Shazam!'' revival===
[[Image:Shazam-no-1.jpg|thumb|200px|''Shazam!'' #1 (February 1973) was Captain Marvel's first appearance in a DC Comics publication. Art by [[C. C. Beck]], [[Nick Cardy]], and [[Murphy Anderson]].]]

When superhero comics became popular again in the mid-1960s in what is now called the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of comics]], Fawcett was unable to revive Captain Marvel because in order to settle the lawsuit it had agreed never to publish the character again. Eventually, they licensed the characters to DC Comics in 1972, and DC began planning a revival. Because Marvel Comics had by this time established its own claim to the use of ''Captain Marvel'' as a comic book title, DC published their book under the name ''Shazam!'' Since then, that title has become so linked to Captain Marvel that many people have taken to identifying the character as "Shazam" instead of his actual name.

The ''Shazam!'' comic series began with issue #1, dated February 1973. It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s. The first story attempted to explain the Marvel Family's absence by stating that they, the Sivanas, and most of their supporting cast had been accidentally trapped in [[suspended animation]] for twenty years until finally breaking free.

[[Dennis O'Neil]] was the primary writer of the book; his role was later taken over by writers Elliott S! Maggin and E. Nelson Bridwell. C. C. Beck drew stories for the first ten issues of the book before quitting due to creative differences; [[Bob Oksner]], Fawcett alumnus [[Kurt Schaffenberger]], and [[Don Newton]] were among the later artists of the title.

With DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] concept in effect during this time, it was stated that the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of "Earth-S". While the series began with a great deal of fanfare, the book had a lackluster reception. The creators themselves had misgivings; Beck said, "As an illustrator I could, in the old days, make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings. But I couldn't bring the new [Captain Marvel] stories to life no matter how hard I tried."<ref>Benton, p. 77</ref> ''Shazam!'' was canceled with issue #35 (June 1978) and relegated to a back-up position in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (from #253, October-November 1978, to #282, August 1982, skipping only #271 which featured a full-length origin of the Superman-Batman team story) and ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (from #491, September 1982, through #498, April 1983; only #491 and #492 featured original stories however, the rest containing Fawcett era reprint stories). With their 1985 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC fully integrated the characters into the DC Universe.

===Captain Marvel in the late 1980s===
The first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|post-Crisis]] appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the [[Justice League]] in [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]' relaunch of that title. That same year, he was also given his own miniseries titled ''Shazam! The New Beginning''. With this four-issue miniseries, writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy and Dann Thomas]] and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story.

The most notable change that Thomas, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. The Golden Age comics, on the other hand, tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities. This change would remain for most future uses of the character, as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world.

===''The Power of Shazam!''===

{{main|The Power of Shazam!}}

DC finally purchased the rights to all of the Fawcett Comics characters in 1991.<ref name="DCbought"/> In 1994, the unpopular revision of the character from the ''Shazam! The New Beginning'' was retconned again and given a revised origin in ''The Power of Shazam!'', a painted [[graphic novel]] written and illustrated by [[Jerry Ordway]]. This story became Captain Marvel's official DC Universe origin story (with his appearances in ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' and ''Justice League'' still counting as part of this continuity).

Ordway's story more closely followed Captain Marvel's Fawcett origins, with only slight additions and changes. For example, in this version of the origin, it is Black Adam (in his non-powered form of Theo Adam) who killed Billy Batson's parents. The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success, leading to a ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999. That series reintroduced the Marvel Family, and many of their allies and enemies, into the modern-day DC Universe.

Marvel also appeared in [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]'s critically acclaimed miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]''. Set thirty years in the future, ''Kingdom Come'' features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind-controlled pawn of an elderly Lex Luthor. In 2000, Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic novel, ''Shazam! Power of Hope'', written by [[Paul Dini]] and painted by [[Alex Ross]].

===Trials of Shazam and Beyond===
[[Image:Marvel White Costume2.jpg|thumb|200px|Portion of a panel from ''The Trials of Shazam'' #2 (November 2006) featuring Marvel. Art by [[Howard Porter]].]]
Since the cancellation of the ''Power of Shazam!'' title in 1999, the Marvel Family have made sporadic appearances in a number of other DC comic books. Black Adam became a main character in [[Geoff Johns]] and [[David S. Goyer]]'s ''JSA'' series which depicted the latest adventures of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Captain Marvel also appeared regularly in ''JSA'' in 2003 and 2004.

The Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, which was used by DC editorial to retool the ''Shazam!'' franchise. In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' limited series, which preceded the ''Infinite Crisis'' event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the Rock of Eternity. The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly [[Limited series|maxi-series]] ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters. The Marvel Family also appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted [[limited series]] ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' by [[Alex Ross]], [[Jim Krueger]], and Doug Braithwaite, published from 2005 to 2007. Currently, Mary Marvel is a featured character in DC's sequel to ''52'', a weekly series entitled ''[[Countdown (comics)|Countdown]]''.


===Other appearances===
A four-issue Captain Marvel/Superman limited series, ''Superman/Shazam: First Thunder'', was published between September 2005 and March 2006. The miniseries, written by [[Judd Winick]] with art by [[Joshua Middleton|Josh Middleton]], depicted the first meeting between the two heroes. ''The Trials of Shazam!'', a 12-issue limited series also written by Winick and illustrated by [[Howard Porter]], began publication in August 2006. The series is reimagining the ''Shazam'' mythos, the characters and their place in the DC Universe. ''Trials of Shazam!'' features Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name '''Marvel''', while Freddy Freeman attempts to prove himself worthy to the individual gods so that he can become their new champion and herald under the name '''Shazam'''.

A second Captain Marvel limited series, ''[[Monster Society of Evil|Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil]]'', written and illustrated by [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] (creator of ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''), was published in four 48-page installments between February and July 2007. Smith's ''Shazam!'' mini-series, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, which updates and re-imagines Captain Marvel's origin. According to Smith, the story is in continuity and takes the place of the character's previously established origins as depicted in the ''The Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel.<ref>Warmoth, Brian. "[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003354486.cfm The Strategum of Smith]". ''Wizard'' magazine. Retrieved March 4, 2007. Excerpt: "The Monster Society of Evil goes back to Batson’s early years, and Smith has ensured the book won’t be labeled an alternate history or imaginary tale. 'When I was asked to do it, I was asked to relaunch Captain Marvel, and I have a clause in my contract saying that this is continuity,' Smith states. 'This is continuity. This is not an All-Star version.'"</ref> However, this has not been confirmed by any secondary sources. 

A new Captain Marvel comic, ''Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!'', is set to debut in early 2008 under DC's [[Johnny DC]] youth-oriented imprint. It will be written and drawn by Mike Kunkel.<ref>Pumpelly, Danny (August 11, 2007). "[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11575 WWC: DC NEW WORLDS ORDER]". ComicBookResources.com.

When Billy Batson says the magic word "Shazam" and is transformed into Captain Marvel, he is granted the following powers:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''S''' ||for the wisdom of '''S'''olomon ||As Captain Marvel, Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge. The wisdom of [[Solomon]] also gives Marvel [[clairvoyance]] and provides him with counsel and advice in times of need. In early Captain Marvel stories, he also had knowledge of all languages and sciences, ancient and modern, and could hypnotize people as well, through this power. (Note that Solomon is the only figure in the list not taken from Greco-Roman mythology.)
|-
|'''H''' ||for the strength of '''H'''ercules[[Hercules (DC Comics)|*]] ||Captain Marvel has incredible amounts of super strength, and is able to easily bend steel, punch through walls, and lift massive objects. Marvel's strength is enough that he has fought beings such as Superman and Wonder Woman to a standstill.
|-
|'''A''' ||for the stamina of '''A'''tlas ||Using [[Atlas]]' endurance, Captain Marvel can withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults. Additionally, he does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe and can survive unaided in space when in Captain Marvel form.
|-
|'''Z''' ||for the power of '''Z'''eus ||[[Zeus]]' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel, also enhances Marvel's other physical and mental abilities, grants magic resistance against all magic spells and attacks, as well as allowing for interdimensional travel. Marvel can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target. The magical lightning has many uses, including creating apparatus, restoring damage done to Marvel, or acting as fuel for magical spells.
|-
|'''A''' ||for the courage of '''A'''chilles ||Like the wisdom, this aspect is primarily psychological, and gives Marvel superhuman amounts of inner strength on which to draw. In the recent ''Trials of Shazam!'' series, this quality has been changed to represent [[Achilles]]' near absolute invulnerability.
|-
|'''M''' ||for the speed of '''M'''ercury ||By channeling Mercury's speed, Captain Marvel can move at greater than supersonic speeds, and fly at greater than light speed through outer space. With Judd Winick's ''Trials of Shazam!'' series, Marvel has also gained the ability to wield magic and cast spells, heal himself and others.<ref>''Outsiders: Five of a Kind'' #2 - Katana/Shazam</ref> These additional abilities are also attributed to the god [[Mercury]].

Captain Marvel often fights evil as a member of a superhero team known as the Marvel Family, made up of himself and several other heroes: The wizard Shazam who empowers the team, Captain Marvel's sister Mary Marvel and Marvel's protégé Captain Marvel, Jr. Before the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the Marvel Family also included part-time members such as Mary's non-powered friend "Uncle" Dudley aka Uncle Marvel, Dudley's non-powered niece Freckles Marvel, a team of proteges (all of whose alter egos are named "Billy Batson") known as the Lieutenant Marvels, and the funny-animal pink rabbit version of Captain Marvel, Hoppy the Marvel Bunny.

Through his adventures, Captain Marvel gained an extensive rogues gallery, the most notable of whom include the evil mad scientist Doctor Sivana (and, pre-Crisis, the Sivana Family), Shazam's corrupted previous champion Black Adam, Adolph Hitler's champion Captain Nazi, and the mind-controlling worm Mister Mind and his Monster Society of Evil. Other Marvel Family foes include the evil robot Mister Atom, the "World's Mightiest Immortal" Oggar, and Ibac and [[Sabbac]], demon-powered supervillains who transform by magic as Captain Marvel does.

The Marvel Family's non-powered allies include Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult offspring Beautia and Magnificus Sivana, Mister "Tawky" Tawny the talking tiger, WHIZ radio president and Billy's employer Sterling Morris, Billy's girlfriend Cissie Sommerly, Billy's school principal Miss Wormwood, and Mary's adoptive parents Nick and Nora Bromfield.

===''The Adventures of Captain Marvel'' film serial===
The first filmed adaptation of Captain Marvel was produced in 1941. ''The Adventures of Captain Marvel'', starring [[Tom Tyler]] in the title role and Frank Coglan, Jr. as Billy Batson, was a twelve-part [[film]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] produced by [[Republic Pictures]] in 1941. Often ranked among the finest examples of the form, its release made Captain Marvel the first superhero to be depicted in film. Whitey Murphy, a supporting character in the serial, found his way into Fawcett's Captain Marvel stories, and elements of the serial's plot were later worked into DC's ''The Power of Shazam'' continuity. ''The Adventures of Captain Marvel'' (which, ironically, was originally pitched to National Comics as a Superman film serial) marked the first appearance of a comic book superhero in film, predating [[Fleischer Studios]]' ''[[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]]'' cartoons by six months. <ref name="witney">Witney, William. ''In a Door, Into a Fight, Out a Door, Into a Chase: Moviemaking Remembered by the Guy at the Door''. (McFarland & Company) ISBN 0786422580</ref>

===On 1970s and 1980s television===
Over thirty years later, Filmation produced ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|Shazam!]]'', a live-action [[Television program|television show]] which ran from 1974 to 1977 on [[CBS]]. From 1975 until the end of its run, it aired as one-half of ''The Shazam!/Isis Hour'', featuring Filmation's own ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' as a companion program. The ''Shazam!'' TV show was a more indirect approach to the character; it told of Billy Batson/Captain Marvel making road trips, instead of flying across the USA to combat evil. ''Shazam!'' starred Michael Gray as Billy Batson, with both [[Jackson Bostwick]] (season one) and John Davey (seasons two and three) as Captain Marvel. An adapted version of [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], the heroine of ''The Secrets of Isis'', was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam's wife in the weekly comic book series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. 

Shortly after the ''Shazam!'' show ended its network run, Captain Marvel, played by Garrett Craig, appeared as a character in a pair of low-budgeted live action comedy specials, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions under the name ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' in 1978. The specials also featured [[Howard Morris]] as Doctor Sivana, and [[Ruth Buzzi]] as Aunt Minerva, marking the first appearance of those characters in film or television. Filmation revisited the character a few years later for an animated ''Shazam!'' cartoon, which ran on [[NBC]] from 1981 to 1982 as part of the ''[[Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam!]]''. The rest of the Marvel Family joined Captain Marvel on his adventures in this series, which were more similar to his comic-book adventures than the 1970s TV show. Dr. Sivana, Mr. Mind, Black Adam, and other familiar Captain Marvel foes appeared as enemies.

Although Captain Marvel did not appear in Hanna-Barbera's long-running [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series ''[[Super Friends]]'' (which featured many of the other DC superheroes),  he did appear in some of the merchandise associated with the show. <ref>[http://namtab.com/aquablog/sharpeners.gif]</ref> 

===Other appearances===
Billy Batson has a non-speaking cameo in the episode "Obsession" from the [[Kids' WB]]'s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Actors portraying Captain Marvel make "cameo" appearances in both a dream-sequence from an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and in the [[Beastie Boys]]' music video for "Alive". In 2005, Captain Marvel guest starred in the [[June 11]], [[2005]] episode of [[Cartoon Network]] animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The episode, entitled "Clash", featured [[Jerry O'Connell]] as the voice of Captain Marvel, with [[Shane Haboucha]] as Billy Batson. A climactic fight sequence between Captain Marvel and Superman pays homage to Superman/Captain Marvel battle from [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]' ''[[Kingdom_Come_(comic_book)|Kingdom Come]]'' mini-series.

===Motion picture===
[[New Line Cinema]] is currently developing a ''Shazam!'' live-action feature film, with [[Peter Segal]] (''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]],'' ''[[50 First Dates]]'') as director and [[Michael Uslan]] as producer. Formerly based on a screenplay by William Goldman & Bryan Goluboff, ''Shazam!'' is now being written by [[John August]]. <ref>Poupard, L. Vincent (May 14, 2007).

==Cultural impact==
===Captain Marvel vs. Superman in fiction===
[[Image:Supermanmarvel kingdomcome.jpg|thumb|Superman and Captain Marvel face off in the 1996 DC limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]''. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]
Captain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] in general. The most notable of these is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] comic book stories. 
 
The fictional Superman/Captain Marvel rivalry was parodied in "Superduperman," a satirical comic book story by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]] in the fourth issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (April-May, 1953). In the parody, inspired by the Fawcett/DC legal battles,<ref>Wright, p. 146</ref> Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature. Marbles' magic word is "SHAZOOM", which stands for '''S'''trength, '''H'''ealth, '''A'''ptitude, '''Z'''eal, '''O'''x—power of, '''O'''x—power of another and '''M'''oney. In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles was greedy and money-grubbing.
 
While publishing its ''Shazam!'' revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a ''Superman'' story featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name.<ref>''Superman'' #276 (first series, June 1974)</ref> Later, they followed ''Mad'''s cue and often pitted Captain Marvel and Superman against each other for any number of reasons, but usually as an inside joke to the characters' long battles in court, they are otherwise staunch allies. Notable Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include ''All-New Collectors' Edition'' #C-58 (1979), ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #37 (1984), and ''Superman'' #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in ''Kingdom Come'' #4 (1996) served as the climax of that miniseries. The "Clash" episode of the DC-based animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which included Captain Marvel as a guest character, featured a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece.

===Influences upon future comic book characters===
Captain Marvel was the first major comic book hero to have a young alter ego{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. Although kid superheroes had generally been neglected before Marvel's introduction, kid sidekicks soon became commonplace shortly after Marvel's success: [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] was paired with [[Batman]] in May 1940, and [[Captain America]] was introduced with sidekick [[Bucky]] in March 1941. The idea of a young boy who transformed into a superhero proved popular enough to inspire a number of superheroes who undergo similar transformations, including Marvel Comics' [[Darkhawk]], [[Malibu Comics]]' [[Prime (comics)|Prime]], and animated/[[action figure]] superheroes such as [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[Moby Dick and the Mighty Mightor|Mighty Mightor]] and [[Samson & Goliath|Young Samson]], [[Mattel]]/[[Filmation]]'s [[He-Man]], and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Television]]'s [[Freakazoid!|Freakazoid]]. Other heroes, including Marvel Comics' [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and (for a time) Marvel's version of Captain Marvel, undergo similarly magical transformations from a weak human form to a god-empowered form.
 
The [[Image Comics]] character [[Mighty Man (Image Comics)|Mighty Man]], created by [[Erik Larsen]] and appearing primarily in Larsen's series ''The [[Savage Dragon]]'', is an obvious homage to Captain Marvel. Similarities run deep, from MM's initial secret identity being a young boy with an [[alliteration|alliterative]] name ("Bobby Berman") to his greatest foe being a mad scientist named "Dr. Nirvana".

===Captain Marvel in popular culture===
In pop culture, Billy Batson/Captain Marvel's magic word, "Shazam!", became a popular [[Ejaculation (grammar)|exclamation]] from the 1940s on, often used in place of an [[expletive]]. The most notable user of the word "Shazam!" in this form was [[Gomer Pyle]], a character from the 1960s [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. [[Foxxy Cleopatra]] from the 2002 film ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' is also fond of the word. In another 2002 movie, ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', the character Peter Parker shouts "Shazam!" while trying to control his powers. On the animated TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'', [[Peter Griffin]] exclaims "Shazam!" whenever he climaxes.
 
Even more than ten years after the character first disappeared, the superhero was still used for allusions and jokes, in films such as ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', TV shows such as ''[[The Monkees]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and ''[[American Dad!]]'', and songs such as "Shazam" (1960) by [[Duane Eddy]]. [[Elvis Presley]] was a fan of ''Captain Marvel, Jr.'' comic books as a child, and later styled his hair to look like Freddy Freeman's and based his stage jumpsuits and [[Memphis Mafia|TCB]] lightning logo on Captain Marvel Junior's costume and lightning-bolt insignia. The [[Academy of Comic Book Arts]] named its [[Shazam Award]] in honor of the character's mythos. [[The Beatles]] mentioned Captain Marvel in their song "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]" (1968).
