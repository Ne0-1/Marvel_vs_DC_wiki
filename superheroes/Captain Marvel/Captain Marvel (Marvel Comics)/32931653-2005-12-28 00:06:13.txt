:''For the [[Fawcett Comics]] character now owned by [[DC Comics]], see [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)]].''

A number of [[comic book]] [[superhero|superheroes]] by [[Marvel Comics]] have been called '''Captain Marvel'''. The first of these was created during a hiatus of the original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], after [[Fawcett Comics]] ceased publication in the 1950s. <!--Following is speculation that needs citation or quote, even in a footnote, from someone in a position to say this definitiely:  these comic book characters have been created by Marvel primarily to protect its trademark rights. Marvel's initial use of a "Captain Marvel" character was apparently triggered by--> Another comics company, [[M.F. Enterprises]], had published an unrelated Captain Marvel in title in 1966.

==Mar-Vell==

The first of these was an [[Extraterrestrial life | alien]] military officer, '''Captain Mar-Vell''' of the [[Kree]] Imperial Militia, who had been sent to observe the planet [[Earth]], which was of great interest to the Empire for its resource potential.  Eventually he rebelled , after having realised the intentions of his superiors, and took allegiance with Earth while the Kree Empire branded him a traitor.  Thence independent, the Captain fought to protect Earth from all menaces.  Captain Mar-Vell was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gene Colan]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #12 (Dec. 1967).

He would later be revamped by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]].  Having been punished with exile in the [[Negative Zone]], the only way Mar-Vell could temporarily leave was to convince a young man, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], to wear special metal wristbands called Nega-Bands which allowed the two to switch places for a limited amount of time, not unlike the situation with the original [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].  He was also given superpowers and a more standard superheroic costume. 

With the title's sales still middling, Marvel allowed [[Jim Starlin]] to conceptually revamp the character, although his appearance was unchanged.  Mar-Vell was freed and then became an appointed cosmic champion of space in general, the "Protector of the Universe" appointed by the cosmic entity [[Eon (comics)|Eon]].  Together, Mar-Vell and Rick continued the battle against evil, most notably battling the Death-worshipping [[Thanos]], a [[mutant]] member of the [[Eternals|Titans]] of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]'s [[moon]] [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].  Mar-Vell became a close ally of the Titans, and one of their number, Elysius, became his lover.

However, this career was cut short because of an earlier incident in which Mar-Vell stopped the villain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] from stealing a canister of deadly [[nerve gas]].  The canister leaked, and, although Mar-Vell was able to re-seal the container, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose; due to his alien metabolism, he was not killed instantly, but rather contracted incurable [[cancer]].  He died from this cancer on Titan in the presence of the Marvel Universe's superhero community, as chronicled in Marvel's first large-format [[graphic novel]], ''The Death of Captain Marvel''.

==Monica Rambeau==

The second Captain Marvel was '''Monica Rambeau''', an [[African American]] [[Coast Guard]] lieutenant from [[New Orleans]] who possesses the power to transform herself into any form of [[energy]].  She briefly had her powers altered so that she could not transform, but instead generated a personal force field.  She has been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], at one point having served as their leader.  She went by the name '''Photon''' for quite some time, until Genis adopted the Photon name and thus, acquired her super-hero name for the second time. Genis and Monica discussed this and decided on the name '''Pulsar''' for Monica.

==Genis-Vell==

The third Captain Marvel was [[Genis-Vell]], the genetically-engineered son of Mar-Vell and his lover Elysius, created from the late Mar-Vell's cell samples and artificially aged to physical, if not emotional, maturity.  Genis, like his father, wears the Nega-Bands, possessed Cosmic Awareness and was, for a time, bonded with [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. For a time, he went insane and threatened the universe, and recently joined the Thunderbolts under the name '''Photon'''.

==Phyla-Vell==

The most recent Captain Marvel is '''Phyla-Vell''', Genis-Vell's younger sister.  Her name is a [[taxonomy|taxonomical]] pun on the part of [[Peter David]], who created the character.  Phyla was created when Genis, an only child, recreated the universe and, in doing so, created various anomalies which resulted in his mother being restored to life and his sister coming into existence. She was last seen romancing [[Moondragon]].

==The Next Captain Marvel?==
In a November 2005 interview [[http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays26.html]], Marvel editor [[Joe Queseda]] revealed there will be a new Captain Marvel, and that the character whom it will be is already in play.
