''For the [[DC Comics]] character, use [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)]].''
----
A number of [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es by [[Marvel Comics]] have been called '''Captain Marvel'''.

Created in the hiatus of the original Captain Marvel after [[Fawcett Comics]] ceased publication in the [[1950s]], these comic book characters were created by Marvel partially to take advantage of the fact that the character name was available for trademarking.

==Mar-Vell==
The first of these was an alien Military Officer, '''Captain Mar-Vell''' of the Kree Imperial Militia, who had been sent to observe the planet Earth, which was of great interest to the Empire for its resource potential. Eventually, he realized the intentions of his superiors and rebelled, taking  allegiance with Earth while the Kree Empire branded him a traitor.

Thence independent, the Captain fought to protect Earth from all menaces.

Later, he was punished with exile in the Negative Zone. The only way he could temporarily leave was to convince a young man, Rick Jones, to wear special metal wristbands called Nega-Bands which allowed the two to switch places for a limited amount of time, much like the situation with the original [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Together, the pair continued the battle against evil.

Eventually Mar-Vell was freed and then became an appointed cosmic champion of space in general. However, this career was cut short because of an earlier incident when he stopped a villain from stealing a canister of deadly [[nerve gas]]. The canister leaked, and, although Mar-Vell was able to re-seal the container, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose (due to his alien metabolism, he was not killed instantly, but rather contracted incurable [[cancer]]).

He died on [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn's]] moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], in the presence of Marvel Universe's superhero community (as chronicled in Marvel's first regular [[graphic novel]], ''The Death of Captain Marvel'').

==Successors==
The second Captain Marvel is '''Monica Rambeau'''; an [[African-American]] woman who possesses the power to transform herself into any form of [[energy]]. She has been a member of [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], at one point having served as their leader.  She currently goes by the name "Photon".

The third Captain Marvel is '''Genis-Vell'''; the genetically engineered son of Mar-Vell and the [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] [[Eternals|Eternal]] Elysius. Genis, like his father, wears the Nega-Bands and was, for a time, bonded with Rick Jones.

The fourth Captain Marvel is '''Phyla-Vell''', Genis-Vell's younger sister.
