'''Captain Marvel''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s, [[superhero]]es appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character history==
===Mar-Vell===
{{main|Mar-Vell}}

The first of these is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] military officer, '''Captain Mar-Vell''' of the [[Kree]] Imperial Militia, who is sent to observe the planet [[Earth]]. Mar-Vell eventually wearies of his superiors' malign intent and allies himself with Earth as the Kree Empire brands him a traitor.  From then on, Mar-Vell fights to protect Earth from all threats.  Captain Mar-Vell was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gene Colan]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #12 (Dec. 1967).

He would later be revamped by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]].  Having been exiled to the Negative Zone by the Supreme Intelligence, the only way Mar-Vell can temporarily escape is to exchange atoms with [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] by means of special wristbands called Nega-Bands.  He is also given superpowers and his Kree military uniform is replaced with a form fitting costume. 

With the title's sales still fledgling, Marvel allowed [[Jim Starlin]] to conceptually revamp the character, although his appearance was little changed.  Mar-Vell is freed from the Negative Zone and becomes a cosmic champion, the "Protector of the Universe" appointed by the cosmic entity [[Eon (comics)|Eon]].  Together, Mar-Vell and Rick continue to battle against evil, most notably battling the Death-worshipping [[Thanos]]. Mar-Vell became a close ally of the Titans, and one of their number, [[Elysius]], became his lover.

However, his career was cut short when he developed inoperable cancer, the result of an earlier exposure to toxic [[nerve gas]] during a battle with [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]. He died from this cancer on Titan in the presence of the Marvel Universe's superhero community, as chronicled in Marvel's first large-format [[graphic novel]], ''The Death of Captain Marvel''.  

In ''Civil War: The Return'', when Tony Stark, Hank Pym, and Reed Richards began construction on a prison within the Negative Zone, their activities caused a wrinkle in space-time. Encountering the wrinkle in the past, Captain Marvel touched it and was transported through time to the Negative Zone in the present day. Initially unsure of how to approach the situation, the heroes revealed Mar-Vell's history to him but also offered him a place in this new future as a warden for their prison, at least until, as the Sentry implicated, Mar-Vell would return to his past. Shaken by the experience and realization of his own fate, Mar-Vell nevertheless took up the Nega Bands once more to serve as Captain Marvel. Mar-Vell was plucked out of space/time after his battle with Nitro but before he started to show signs of his illness.

===Young Avengers Mar-Vell===
In a flashback shown in the [[Young Avengers]] series, Captain Mar-Vell was captured together with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] by the Super-Skrull. However, the Skrull emperor's daughter, princess [[Anelle]] fell in love with him and together they conspired to overthrow the emperor and bring an end to the Kree-Skrull war.

They freed the Super-Skrull, whom the emperor had imprisoned for supposedly planning a coup.  The Super-Skrull posed as Mar-Vell to allow him to escape. Princess Anelle was later killed when Galactus devoured her homeworld, but not before giving birth to the half-Kree/half-Skrull boy who would later be known as Teddy Altman, a.k.a. [[Hulkling]].

===Monica Rambeau===

{{main|Monica Rambeau}}
The second Captain Marvel is '''Monica Rambeau''', a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] lieutenant from [[New Orleans]] who possesses the power to transform herself into any form of [[energy]].  Her powers where briefly altered so that she can not transform to energy, but instead generates a personal force field. Sometime later, the Stranger returned her energy transformation abilities. She is a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], at one point serves as their leader.  She uses the name '''Photon''' for quite some time, until Genis-Vell adopts the same name. Genis-Vell and Monica discuss this and Monica decides on the name '''Pulsar'''.

Rambeau later joins H.A.T.E. (the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort) in the new series titled ''[[Nextwave|NEXTWAVE]]''. In this series created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]], H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond CorporationÂ©) forms a team to fight the Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. Members include Monica Rambeau, a man known only as [[The Captain (comics)|"The Captain"]],  [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], and [[Elsa Bloodstone]].

===Genis-Vell===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Captain Marvel vol 4 cover 1.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Art by [[ChrisCross]].]] -->
{{main|Genis-Vell}}
The third Captain Marvel is [[Genis-Vell]], the genetically-engineered son of Mar-Vell and his lover Elysius, created from the late Mar-Vell's cell samples and artificially aged to physical, if not emotional, maturity.  Genis, like his father, wears the Nega-Bands, possesses Cosmic Awareness and is, for a time, bonded with [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. Although the pair do not get along at first, they eventually become good friends.  However, Genis goes insane and threatens to destroy the universe.

After dying and resurrecting himself - with the secret aid of [[Baron Helmut Zemo]] - Genis-Vell joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] under the name '''Photon'''. However, in accelerating his resurrection, Zemo links Genis to the ends of time, causing a degenerative effect on the universe.  To prevent the inevitable destruction of all existence, Zemo scatters pieces of Genis-Vell's body through time and the [[Darkforce]] Dimension.

===Phyla-Vell===

{{main|Phyla-Vell}}
The fourth Captain Marvel is '''Phyla-Vell''', Genis-Vell's younger sister.  Her name is a [[taxonomy|taxonomical]] pun on the part of [[Peter David]], who created the character.  Phyla is created when Genis, an only child, recreates the universe and, in doing so, creates various anomalies which result in his mother being restored to life and his sister coming into existence. She is last seen romancing [[Moondragon]].

Phyla-Vell appears in the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' event, fighting alongside [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'s [[United Front (comics)|United Front]] in an effort to stop the destructive armies of [[Annihilus]]. She becomes the new [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] after the original one is killed by Annihilus.[http://www.newsarama.com/NYCC/2007/Marvel/cup_o_joe.html]

Phyla has superhuman strength. She can fire energy blasts, fly, and act like an "energy sponge", absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. Phyla also has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Captain Marvel===

{{main|Mahr Vehl}}
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] miniseries ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'' introduces a renegade Kree who has been surgically altered to look human and sent to earth by his people to observe its destruction by the entity [[Galactus|Gah Lak Tus]], but defects to help the humans. He wears a specially designed combat suit that is activated by his wristwatch. The Kree technology in the suit gives Mahr Vehl increased strength and allows him to fly, create energy shields, turn invisible, view different fields of the light spectrum, and fire energy blasts through the totalkannon located on his lower arm.

His real name is Pluskommander (literal translation of +Commander) Geheneris Halason Mahr Vehl; a reference to both Mar-Vell and Genis-Vell. As with the [[Marvel Universe]] character of [[Mar-Vell]], he assumes the identity of Dr. Philip Lawson, a scientist working on the space program. He is currently dating the Ultimate version of [[Carol Danvers]].  The name 'Captain Marvel' arises as a mispronunciation by General Nick Fury and Carol Danvers.  Only the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] have bothered to learn how to pronounce his name correctly.

== Ruins==
In  the two issue Warren Ellis Limited series  Ruins.  Captain Marvel is one of the many Kree prisoners, in a  Kree Reservation in Nevada.  The reservation was placed deliberately  on top of  a former nuclear test site.   As a result  of this the majority of the  Kree are suffering  from various forms of cancers and tumours including Mar-Vell  who is the Kree's spokesperson. Mar-vell  gives an interview to Daily Bugle reporter Phil Sheldon regarding the failed  Kree invasion of Earth. Mar-vel recounts how his ship was made vulnerable  to a nuclear strike when their cloaking and  sheilding  was affected by cosmic radiation  from a deceased Silver Surfer.

===Fantastic Four: The End===
In the limited series, ''Fantastic Four: The End'', the superheroine formerly known as [[Kismet (comics)|Kismet]] (now under the name of Ayesha) has apparently taken over the Captain Marvel mantle in the not-too-distant future.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four: The End]]'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref>
