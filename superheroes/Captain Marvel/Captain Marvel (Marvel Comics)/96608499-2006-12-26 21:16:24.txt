'''Captain Marvel''' is the name of several [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]es.

==Mar-Vell==
:''Main article: [[Mar-Vell]]''

The first of these is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] military officer, '''Captain Mar-Vell''' of the [[Kree]] Imperial Militia, who is sent to observe the planet [[Earth]]. Mar-Vell eventually wearies of his superiors' malign intent and allies himself with Earth as the Kree Empire brands him a traitor.  From then on, Mar-Vell fights to protect Earth from all threats.  Captain Mar-Vell was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gene Colan]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #12 (Dec. 1967).

He would later be revamped by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]].  Having been exiled to the Negative Zone by the Supreme Intelligence, the only way Mar-Vell can temporarily escape is to exchange atoms with [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] by means of special wristbands called Nega-Bands.  He is also given superpowers and his Kree military uniform is replaced with a form fitting costume. 

With the title's sales still middling, Marvel allowed [[Jim Starlin]] to conceptually revamp the character, although his appearance was little changed.  Mar-Vell is freed from the Negative Zone and becomes a cosmic champion, the "Protector of the Universe" appointed by the cosmic entity [[Eon (comics)|Eon]].  Together, Mar-Vell and Rick continue to battle against evil, most notably battling the Death-worshipping [[Thanos]]. Mar-Vell became a close ally of the Titans, and one of their number, Elysius, became his lover.

However, his career is cut short when he develops inoperable cancer, the result of an earlier exposure to toxic [[nerve gas]]. He dies from this cancer on Titan in the presence of the Marvel Universe's superhero community, as chronicled in Marvel's first large-format [[graphic novel]], ''The Death of Captain Marvel''. Unlike most superhero comic characters who appear to die but somehow find their way back, Captain Marvel has remained dead.

==Pulsar==

:''Main article: [[Monica Rambeau]]''
The second Captain Marvel is '''Monica Rambeau''', a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] lieutenant from [[New Orleans]] who possesses the power to transform herself into any form of [[energy]].  Her powers are briefly altered so that she can not transform to energy, but instead generates a personal force field.  She is a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], at one point serves as their leader.  She uses the name '''Photon''' for quite some time, until Genis-Vell adopts the same name. Genis-Vell and Monica discuss this and Monica decides on the name '''Pulsar'''.

Rambeau later joins H.A.T.E. (the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort) in the new series titled ''[[Nextwave|NEXTWAVE]]''. In this series created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]], H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation©) forms a team to fight the Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. Members include Monica Rambeau, a man known only as "The Captain",  [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], and [[Elsa Bloodstone]].

==Genis-Vell==

:''Main article: [[Genis-Vell]]''
The third Captain Marvel is [[Genis-Vell]], the genetically-engineered son of Mar-Vell and his lover Elysius, created from the late Mar-Vell's cell samples and artificially aged to physical, if not emotional, maturity.  Genis, like his father, wears the Nega-Bands, possesses Cosmic Awareness and is, for a time, bonded with [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. Although the pair do not get along at first, they evenutally become good friends.  However, Genis goes insane and threatens to destroy the universe.

After dying and resurrecting himself - with the secret aid of [[Baron Helmut Zemo]] - Genis-Vell joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] under the name '''Photon'''. However, in accelerating his resurrection, Zemo links Genis to the ends of time, causing a degenerate effect on the universe.  To prevent the inevitable destruction of all existence, Zemo scatters pieces of Genis-Vell's body through time and the [[Darkforce]] Dimension.

==Phyla-Vell==

The fourth Captain Marvel is '''Phyla-Vell''', Genis-Vell's younger sister.  Her name is a [[taxonomy|taxonomical]] pun on the part of [[Peter David]], who created the character.  Phyla is created when Genis, an only child, recreates the universe and, in doing so, creates various anomalies which result in his mother being restored to life and his sister coming into existence. She is last seen romancing [[Moondragon]].

Phyla-Vell appears in the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' event, fighting alongside [[Nova (comics)|Nova's]] [[United Front (comics)|United Front]] in an effort to stop the destructive armies of [[Annihilus]].

Phyla has superhuman strength. She can fire energy blasts, fly, and act like an "energy sponge", absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. Phyla also has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.

==Ultimate Captain Marvel==
:''Main Article:  [[Mahr Vehl]]''
[[Image:Ultimate_Captain_Marvel.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Mahr Vehl]]<br> Art by [[Steve McNiven]].]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] miniseries ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'' introduces a renegade Kree who has been surgically altered to look human and sent to earth by his people to observe its destruction by the entity [[Galactus|Gah Lak Tus]], but defects to help the humans. He wears a specially designed combat suit that is activated by his wristwatch. The Kree technology in the suit gives Mahr Vehl increased strength and allows him to fly, create energy shields, turn invisible, view different fields of the light spectrum, and fire energy blasts through the totalkannon located on his lower arm.

His real name is Pluskommander (literal translation of +Commander) Geheneris Halason Mahr Vehl; a reference to both Mar-Vell and Genis-Vell. As with the [[Marvel Universe]] character of [[Mar-Vell]], he assumes the identity of Dr. Philip Lawson, a scientist working on the space program. He is currently dating the Ultimate version of [[Carol Danvers]].  The name 'Captain Marvel' arises as a mispronunciation by General Nick Fury and Carol Danvers.  Only the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] have bothered to learn how to pronounce his name correctly.
