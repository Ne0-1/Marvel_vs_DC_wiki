'''Spidercide''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] and [[cloning|clone]] of [[Spider-Man]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].

==Character history==

During the [[Clone Saga]], in addition to [[Ben Reilly]] and [[Kaine]], a third significant clone of Spider-Man was introduced. While he seemingly died, in denial of his clone status, during a battle with Spider-Man, Ben and Kaine, [[Scrier]] recovered his remains and reanimated him, granting him the ability to turn into other materials and shapes in the process. While he returned to the [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]] thereafter, his loyalty was always to Scrier, and he ultimately betrayed the Jackal in the end, sending a copy of all of the Jackal's data to Scrier and turning on the Jackal when he found out, before apparently dying of a fall from the top of the [[Daily Bugle]] building.

==Powers and abilities==
Spidercide possesses all of [[Spider-Man]]'s powers. In addition, he could also shapeshift, turn his body into a semi-liquid form and grow and shrink in size.
