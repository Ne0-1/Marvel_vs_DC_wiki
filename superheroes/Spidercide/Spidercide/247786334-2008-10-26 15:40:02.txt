'''Spidercide''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] and [[cloning|clone]] of [[Spider-Man]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
During the [[Clone Saga]], in addition to [[Ben Reilly]] and [[Kaine]], a third significant clone of Spider-Man was introduced: Spidercide. He was a red herring that was introduced to make him seem to be the real Peter Parker who was locked in a pod for roughly five years. While still in denial of the fact that he was a clone, he died during a battle with Spider-Man, Ben, and Kaine. [[Scrier]] recovered his remains and reanimated him, granting him the ability to turn into other materials and shapes in the process. While he returned to the [[Jackal (Marvel comics)|Jackal]] thereafter, his loyalty was always to Scrier from that point on. He later mortally wounded Kaine by impaling him through the chest, causing an enraged Ben Reilly to throw him into a power grid, electrocuting and seemingly killing him. But his new powers allowed him to regenerate, and he came back once more. He ultimately betrayed the Jackal in the end, sending a copy of all of the Jackal's data to Scrier. The Jackal found out and tried to kill him, and Spidercide was once again incapacitated when he fell off the top of the [[Daily Bugle]] building. His body was taken away by police and placed in a state of suspended animation to keep him from returning again. Unlike most comic book characters who are put into suspended animation only to later return, Spidercide was never seen again.

==Powers and abilities==
Spidercide possesses all of [[Spider-Man]]'s powers. In addition, he could also shapeshift, turn his body into a semi-liquid form and grow and shrink in size. Because of this, his body is extremely durable, and he can regenerate even after being pushed to the brink of death. As with many of Spider-Man's other clones, Spidercide doesn't trigger Spider-Man's Spider Sense (though Spider-Man doesn't trigger his either).

==In other media==
===Video Games===
In the [[video game]] [[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]], the phantoms in some stages look exactly like Spidercide.
