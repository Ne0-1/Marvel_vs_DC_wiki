'''Spyke''' ('''Evan Daniels''') is a [[fictional character|character]] who was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]] in the [[animated television series|animated series]] ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. Created by writer [[Bob Skir]] and artist [[Steven E. Gordon]], he first appeared in "Speed And The Spyke", episode #5 (December 9, 2000), where he was voiced by [[Neil Denis]].

Spyke is an African American high-school freshman with the [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] ability to project spikes out of his body.

The character was originally created as a way to diversify the show's X-Men roster. It was important to the show's creators, [[The WB Television Network|the WB network]] (who ran the show) and [[Marvel Comics]] to have an African American in the show. According to the show's [[Television producer|producer]] [[Boyd Kirkland]], turning [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] (the first Black male X-Man) into a teenager would not have worked.<ref>"[http://news.toonzone.net/2000/oct/20/spyke.php Milk: It Does a Body Good]", http://www.toonzone.net/, posted October 20, 2000, accessed October 26, 2006.</ref> Initially, Spyke was intended to be the team's muscle and looked closer to how he looked in season four, but Marvel decided they didn't like the "monster" angle and he was given a much more normal look{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. He was originally intended to be called Armadillo and have [[cornrow]]s{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. He has similar powers to [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], a pre-existing character, though Kirkland says this was not intentional.<ref>"[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0012/08/index.htm X-MEN: EVOLUTION'S SPYKE VS.

==Character biography==
Evan Daniels was born in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York]] to an unnamed father and [[Vivian Daniels]]. His mutant powers are first noticed at his high school basketball game by his Aunt Ororo (aka [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] a longtime member of the [[X-Men]]), and his teammate Pietro. The next night Storm, along with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]], approached Evan's parents about his mutant powers and attending [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School]]. Evan angrily declines on his own behalf and leaves.

He goes to his school to catch the thief who keeps breaking into his locker. It is revealed that Pietro is not only the thief, but a mutant with super speed powers. Pietro, who renames himself [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], breaks into all the lockers in the school and lets Evan take the heat as he escapes prosecution. Only when [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] uses his pull to help Evan get out of prison does he join the X-Men and the school under the code name Spyke. Spyke settles the score with Quicksilver when he, Cyclops, and Jean defeat the speedy mutant. Spyke is cleared of all charges when he catches Quicksilver's arrogant confession on tape.

During his tenure with the X-Men, Spyke didn't want any special treatment from anyone at the school because he was Storm's nephew. Though he liked being an X-Man and thought of them as his family, Spyke at times acted selfishly and inconsiderate of others. Spyke would goof around in class and on at least one occasion ditched school mid-class to go skateboarding with his human friends. He also was late for several training exercises in the [[Danger Room]] resulting in him getting reprimanded by Storm and causing several X-Kids to fail in their training exercise because Spyke was not there to back them up. If not for him saving Storm's life from the [[Hungan (TV character)|Hungan]], Spyke would have been sent home to his parents due to his lack of concern for school and DR training.

After he and the other X-Men were discovered to be mutants, Spyke grew angry at how they were being treated. After drinking Pow-R8, an energy drink that was toxic to mutants even by touching it, Spyke found out he could not retract or fully control his spikes. After seeing how cruelly he was treated because of his condition, Spyke joined the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] (a group of mutants who could not "pass" for human and so were driven underground) because he wanted to fight for mutants who looked different from normal humans. Storm did not take this well and tried to convince Spyke to come back, but he refused. When he returned later in the series he had mutated even further, and now most of his upper body was covered by [[armadillo]]-type bone-plates except for his face and below the waist. During this time, Spyke began using his powers to fight against humans who were attempting to commit [[hate crime]]s against the Morlocks and mutants in general. These actions eventually led to him being the target of a group of anti-mutant biggots, led by [[Duncan Matthews]]. Attacking him with electrical mining guns, Spyke was cornered. But the Morlocks and X-Men stepped in and defeated Duncan and his accomplices, who were arrested by the police shortly after the battle was over. When Storm tried to persuade him once again to return to the institute, Spyke said the Morlocks needed him more and chose to remain with them.

He later helped out in destroying the Pyramids surfaced by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Spyke is last seen in a group photo with the X-Men, the [[New Mutants]] and their unaffiliated allies. In this photo he is wearing the bottom half of his X-Men costume, which may mean he has finally returned to the X-Men.

==Powers and abilities==
Spyke can extend or retract [[bone]] spikes that grow inside his body. He may shoot them out or bring them out to grab and hold. He also needs to drink milk to replace the calcium that he loses when using his powers.<ref>"[http://news.toonzone.net/2000/oct/20/spyke.php Milk: It Does a Body Good]", http://www.toonzone.net/, posted October 20, 2000, accessed October 26, 2006.</ref> Spyke, an expert [[Skateboarding|skateboarder]], integrated his skateboarding prowess into battles. He also has to have an accelerated healing rate to seal the wounds caused by projecting his spikes.

In the later episodes as his mutation evolved, Spyke gained the ability to light the ends of the spikes on fire and his stength is slightly higher than an average human's . He  now also has protective plates form around his body. However, he is unable to  retract his plates. He also gained the ability to extend small spikes on his feet to scale and stick to walls.  In this form, Spyke no longer uses his skateboard.

==Other versions==
===616 Universe===
David Munroe Jr. was born in New Jersey to an unknown father and the sister of Storm's father. Vivian named her son David, after Ororoâ€™s father, who had died too soon. Unfortunately, she later became a drug addict and eventually died of HIV, leaving young David in the care of his loving grandparents. As of yet David, still in his early teens, hasn't manifested any mutant powers, and has only recently met Storm in this universe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==In other media==
After the show ended, Spyke appeared in the [[X-Men: Evolution]] comic based on the series. He has now appeared in the [[X-Men]] mainstream continuity. In the comics he has a deep relationship with Kitty Pryde (unlike the animated series.)

*A character with similar powers is seen in the feature film, [[X-Men: The Last Stand]].  Fan speculation identifies this character as an adult version of Spyke. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The character in the film is a member of the Brotherhood, and fights Wolverine before being stabbed by his claws. This Spyke is not African-American. The character's name was never mentioned in the film, but is credited as 'Spike' in the credits, played by [[Lance Gibson]].
