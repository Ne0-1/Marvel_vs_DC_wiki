'''Spyke''', real name Evan Daniels, is a fictional character from the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' [[animated television series]]. He is a mutant that can project [[bone]] spikes out of his body. He may shoot them out or bring them out to grab and hold. In the later episodes as his mutation evolved, Spyke gained the ability to light the ends of the spikes on fire. He can now also make protective plates around his body.

Later into the series, Spyke found out he could not retract his spikes, so he became exposed as a mutant to the public. After seeing how cruel the world can be, Spyke joined the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] (a mutant street gang) because he wanted to fight for mutants that look different from normal humans. Spyke's Aunt Ororo (aka [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], a longtime member of the X-Men) did not take this well and tried to convince Spyke to come back but he refused. When he returned later in the series we see he has mutated even further, and now most of his body is covered by [[armadillo]]-type bone-plates.

He was voiced by [[Neil Denis]].

Some have pointed out the similarities Spyke has to the comicbook character [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], a pre-existing character with similar powers. Though the show's creators say this wasn't intentional.

Following the debut of Spyke on ''X-Men: Evolution'', several similar characters appeared near-simultaneously in the X-Men comic books.  A student at the [[Xavier Institute]] named Spike appeared in ''[[New X-Men]]'' #126, and a member of [[X-Force]] (later [[X-Statix]]) named [[Spike (comics)|The Spike]] was introduced in ''X-Force'' #121.
