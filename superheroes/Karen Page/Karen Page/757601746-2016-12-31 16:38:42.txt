'''Karen Page''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' series, the longest running love interest for the title character.

Karen Page is currently played by [[Deborah Ann Woll]] in the Netflix original series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Marvel's Daredevil]]'' as part of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], she first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964).

==Character overview==
In her first appearances, Karen is the secretary for the law firm of Daredevil's [[alter ego]] Matt Murdock, and the mutual love interest of both Murdock and his partner [[Foggy Nelson]]. Her relationship with Murdock hits a downward spiral when he reveals his secret identity to her in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #57 (October 1969), setting off a long break-up which concluded with her departure from the series in issue #86 (April 1972). Within these final stories, she trades her profession of secretary to become a film actress.

After three years absence from published stories, Page returned for a considerable stint as a supporting character in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'', starting with vol. 2 #13 (August 1975) and continuing through to #26 (October 1977). During this time, a crossover with ''Daredevil'' #138 afforded her a brief return appearance in the series where she got her start. A 1978 appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' would prove the character's last showing for over seven years.

Karen Page returned in the award-winning ''Daredevil'' #227 (February 1986), in a story that would ultimately restore her earlier role as Daredevil's love interest. Writer [[Ann Nocenti]] gave considerably more development to their relationship, and even had Page acting as a sidekick to Daredevil for the first time in issue #259, in which she goes undercover to help take down a child pornography ring. She was again dropped from the series in issue #263 (February 1989) for another long-term breakup from Murdock, but this time was brought back just two years later, for ''Daredevil'' #294 (July 1991).

Page is killed by Daredevil's adversary [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in ''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #5, (March 10, 1999).

===''Daredevil''===

====Season 1====
Karen is first introduced in season 1 of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]''. While working as a secretary at Union Allied Construction, she comes across evidence of corruption, prompting [[Wilson Fisk]] to have her framed for stabbing a coworker to death in her apartment. After two further failed attempts on her life, [[Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]] intervene and are able to exonerate her, and hire her on as their secretary. Seeking justice for her coworker's death, Karen begins her own crusade to expose Fisk and other corruption in Hell's Kitchen with the help of ''New York Bulletin'' reporter [[Ben Urich]]. When Fisk's right hand James Wesley discovers that Karen and Urich have visited Fisk's mother, he kidnaps her outside her apartment, drives her to a warehouse, and attempts to blackmail her into silence. Karen grabs Wesley's gun and shoots him to death as he receives a call from Fisk. She becomes traumatized by the incident, having nightmares of Fisk coming to seek revenge on her.

====Season 2====
Karen continues to work with Nelson & Murdock as their secretary and legal advocate, although she is still haunted by Wesley's death. When the Punisher targets Grotto, the sole survivor of one of his massacres at a hospital, Karen helps him flee despite being shot at by the Punisher. After the Punisher's arrest, she and Matt briefly begin dating, before his double-life as Daredevil causes him to falter in contributing to Frank Castle's trial and finds [[Elektra Natchios]] in his bed when she tells him about it. Karen is one of the few understanding and sympathetic towards Frank's actions, and tries to uncover the truth about what happened with the backing of Urich's editor Mitchell Ellison. Her efforts land her a job at the ''Bulletin'', after Nelson & Murdock closes as the result of infighting between Matt and Foggy. In the season finale, Matt reveals his secret identity to Karen.
