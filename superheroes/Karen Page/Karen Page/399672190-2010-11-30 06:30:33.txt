'''Karen Page''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' series created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]]. She first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964).

==Character overview==
In her first appearances, Karen is the secretary for the law firm of Daredevil’s [[alter ego]] Matt Murdock. Karen and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] have been Daredevil’s most prominent love interests.

Like most aspects of the Daredevil mythos, her character grew darker and more three-dimensional when writer/artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] oversaw the comic book in the early 1980s. Karen became a [[heroin]] addict who sells Daredevil’s [[secret identity]], causing him innumerable problems. In subsequent years, she redeems herself, but is killed by Daredevil's [[supervillain|adversary]] [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in ''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #5 (March 1998).

==Fictional character history==
Karen makes her debut in ''Daredevil'' #1. [[Foggy Nelson]] hires her to be the secretary for his and [[Matt Murdock]]’s new law firm, Nelson and Murdock. Karen is beautiful, young, innocent, and naïve. She is infatuated with Matt from the moment they meet, but she also soon becomes mesmerized by the Daredevil, Matt’s crime fighting [[alter ego]].

Karen's father, Doctor Paxton Page, fakes his own kidnapping and death so that he can assume the guise of the villain "[[Death's-Head (comics)|Death's-Head]]." Karen returns to her parents' home to investigate her father’s disappearance. Daredevil follows her. In the ensuing battle between Daredevil and Death’s Head, Death’s Head spills a vat of molten [[cobalt]] over Daredevil, but realizes that Karen is endangered. This brings him back to his senses, and he pushes Daredevil and Karen to safety. He appears to die in this act of self-sacrifice, when he is coated in the molten cobalt.

After the battle with Death’s Head, Daredevil reveals his true identity to Karen. She is conflicted, as she is in love with both Matt the man and Daredevil the hero. She constantly fears for Matt’s safety, but he cannot give up fighting crime. Karen eventually leaves him and moves to [[California]] to pursue an acting career. She finds work as an actress in a daytime [[soap opera]].

Karen then becomes addicted to heroin and starts making [[pornography|pornographic]] movies. In the "Born Again" story arc, Karen, in need of a fix, sells Daredevil's secret identity to a drug dealer, who in turn sells it to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Karen is forced to return to New York, where she meets up again with Matt. He helps Karen beat her addiction and straighten up her life.  Karen eventually resumes her relationship with Matt.

During the [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] storyline, Karen, who has set up household with Matt, discovers that he's been having a torrid affair with Mary (although he was manipulated into it) and she and Matt break up again. They eventually reunite, however. She becomes an [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] activist and even assists Daredevil and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] each in fighting crime on separate occasions. At this point she becomes a radio show host under the name “Paige Angel.” She eventually realizes that she is too dependent on Matt and that her past is a constant barrier between them. Karen leaves Matt to accept a talk show host position in [[Los Angeles]].

While in California, Karen has a routine blood test as part of an insurance policy application. The [[supervillain]] [[Mysterio]] disguises himself as a doctor, performs the blood test, and tells her that she is [[HIV]] positive as part of his plan to destroy Daredevil before he himself dies of a brain tumor. Devastated, Karen returns to New York and tells Matt that she is HIV positive. Later, during a fight between Daredevil and Bullseye, Karen is murdered by Bullseye. She dies in Daredevil’s arms. She is the second love of Matt Murdock's life to be killed by Bullseye (though Elektra was ultimately resurrected).

After Mysterio's death, a conversation with [[Spider-Man]] leads Daredevil to realize that the infant he's saved represents something positive that has come of the whole affair. He gives the baby up for adoption to a couple in [[New Jersey]]. Before he leaves, Matt names the baby after Karen, and hopes that her new parents will allow the occasional visit from her "Uncle Matt".

==Other appearances==
Karen also appears in an issue of the comic book ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' alongside [[Johnny Blaze]] as an actress in the same film where Johnny is hired as a stuntman. After a scene is interrupted by The Uncanny Orb, Karen's stuntwoman, Katy Milner, confides in Johnny about Karen's history of "unhappy romances" including the ones with Matt Murdock and Phil Hickock. Later on, Karen herself falls under the Orb's control.

In ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #46, Karen Page is offered a role on [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' TV show]] which was on its first season at the time. She is kidnapped by three ex-stuntmen on the show, but is saved by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who is looking for his own TV show, and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who is annoyed at having a show about him.

==In other media==
In the [[Daredevil (film)|film adaptation of ''Daredevil'']], Karen Page is portrayed by [[Ellen Pompeo]]. Most of her scenes were deleted from the final theatrical cut, but they can be seen in the ''Daredevil'' Director's Cut [[DVD]].
