'''Karen Page''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil]]'' series.  She was a secretary at the Nelson & Murdock law firm where Matt Murdock (Daredevil) worked, and was romantically involved with him, becoming close enough to her that he revealed his dual identity to her.

{{spoiler}}
Eventually she moved away and, when [[Frank Miller]] reintroduced her for his "Born Again" story arc, she had become a [[heroin]] addict, a [[porn star]] and a [[prostitute]].  In need of a fix, she sold Daredevil's secret identity to a drug dealer, who in turn sold it to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin of Crime]]; she was forced to return to New York, where she met up again with Daredevil, cleaned up her life, and eventually resumed a relationship with Murdock.  The reltaionship again did not last, and she returned to her acting career. During Kevin Smiths' "Guardian Devil" arc, she returned, having been diagonosed HIV positive as a result of her previous addictions and prostitute lifestyle. When she attempted to help Murdock preserve the life of a child under attack, the [[assassin]] [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] killed her during a battle in ''Daredevil v2, #5''.
