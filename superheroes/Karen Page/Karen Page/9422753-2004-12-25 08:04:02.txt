'''Karen Page''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]]'' series.  She was a secretary at the Nelson & Murdock law firm where Matt Murdock (Daredevil) worked, and was romantically involved with him, becoming close enough to her that he revealed his dual identity to her.  Eventually she moved away and, through undisclosed circumstances, became a [[heroin]] addict, a [[porn star]] and a [[prostitute]].  In need of a fix, she sold Daredevil's secret identity to a drug dealer, who in turn sold it to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin of Crime]]; she was forced to return to New York, where she met up again with Daredevil, cleaned up her life, and eventually resumed a relationship with Murdock.  This relationship continued for several years until she was attacked by the [[assassin]] [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and killed.
