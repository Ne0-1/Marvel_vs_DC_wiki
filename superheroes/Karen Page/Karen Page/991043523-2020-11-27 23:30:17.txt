'''Karen Page''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is also [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s longest-running love interest.

Karen Page was portrayed by [[Deborah Ann Woll]] in the [[Marvel Television]] productions ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'' on [[Netflix]] for the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], she first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=265}}</ref>

==Character overview==
In her first appearances, Karen is the secretary for the law firm of Daredevil's [[alter ego]] Matt Murdock, and the mutual love interest of both Murdock and his partner [[Foggy Nelson]]. Her relationship with Murdock hits a downward spiral when he reveals his secret identity to her in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #57 (October 1969), setting off a long break-up which concluded with her departure from the series in issue #86 (April 1972). Within these final stories, she trades her profession of secretary to become a film actress.

After three years absence from published stories, Karen returned for a considerable stint as a supporting character in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'', starting with vol. 2 #13 (August 1975) and continuing through to #26 (October 1977). During this time, a crossover with ''Daredevil'' #138 afforded her a brief return appearance in the series where she got her start. A 1978 appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' would prove the character's last showing for over seven years.

Karen returned in ''[[Born Again (comics)|Born Again]]'', the award-winning storyline beginning in ''Daredevil'' #227 (February 1986) that would ultimately restore her earlier role as Daredevil's love interest. Writer [[Ann Nocenti]] gave considerably more development to their relationship, and even had Karen acting as a sidekick to Daredevil for the first time in issue #259, in which she goes undercover to help take down a child pornography ring. She was again dropped from the series in issue #263 (February 1989) for another long-term breakup from Murdock, but this time was brought back just two years later, for ''Daredevil'' #294 (July 1991).

Karen is killed by Daredevil's adversary [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in ''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #5, (March 10, 1999).

==Fictional character biography==
Karen Page is hired to be the secretary by [[Foggy Nelson]] for the new law firm Nelson and Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil'' #1</ref> She is infatuated with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] from the moment they meet. When Matt introduces her to the adventuring, wisecracking aspect of his personality, in the guise of his "twin brother" Mike, she finds herself equally charmed by this side of Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil'' #25–26</ref>

Dr. Paxton Page (Karen's father) fakes his own kidnapping and death in order to assume the guise of the villain [[Death's Head]]. Karen returns to her parents' home in Fagan Corners, [[Vermont]], to investigate her father's disappearance. Daredevil follows her. In the ensuing battle between Daredevil and Death's Head, Death's Head spills a vat of molten [[cobalt]] over Daredevil, but realizes that Karen is endangered. This brings Paxton back to his own senses, pushing Daredevil and Karen to safety. He appears to die in this act of self-sacrifice, when he is coated in the molten cobalt. After the battle with Death's Head, Daredevil's true identity is revealed to Karen.<ref>''Daredevil'' #56–57</ref> She constantly fears for Matt's safety, but Daredevil cannot give up fighting crime. Karen eventually leaves Matt and moves to [[California]] to pursue an acting career. She finds work as an actress in a daytime [[soap opera]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Karen appears alongside [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] in a film. After a scene is interrupted by The Uncanny Orb, Katy Milner (Karen's stuntwoman) confides in Johnny about Karen's history of "unhappy romances" including the ones with Murdock and Phil Hickock. Later on, Karen herself falls under the Orb's control.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Karen is offered a role on [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' TV show]] which was on its first season at the time. She is kidnapped by three ex-stuntmen on the show, but is saved by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (who is looking for his own TV show), and the [[Hulk]] (who is annoyed at having this show).<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #46</ref>

Karen becomes addicted to heroin and starts making [[pornography|pornographic]] movies.<ref name="Daredevil #227">''Daredevil'' #227</ref> In need of a fix, she sells Daredevil's secret identity to a drug dealer who in turn sells this to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]. Karen is forced to return to New York,<ref name="Daredevil #227"/> where she meets up again with Matt. Matt helps Karen beat her addiction, and they resume their relationship and begin sharing an apartment.<ref>''Daredevil'' #232</ref>

Realizing that Matt is incomplete without work as a lawyer, Karen founds a free drug and legal clinic, where she counsels drug addicts and Matt provides legal advice and "ghost lawyering".<ref>''Daredevil'' #248</ref> The clinic is destroyed during a [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|demonic invasion of Manhattan]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #262</ref> and Karen discovers hours later that Matt has been having an affair with [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]]. These combined blows leave her psychologically lost, and she runs away.<ref>''Daredevil'' #263</ref>

She becomes an [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] activist,<ref>''Daredevil'' #294</ref> assists Daredevil and the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] in fighting crime on separate occasions, and reluctantly begins dating Matt. At this point, she becomes a radio show host under the name "'''Paige Angel'''". She eventually realizes that she is too dependent on Matt and that her past is a constant barrier between them. Karen leaves Matt to accept a talk show host position in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

While in California, Karen has a routine blood test as part of an insurance policy application. The [[supervillain]] [[Mysterio]], as part of a plan to psychologically destroy Daredevil for one last scheme,<ref name="Daredevil vol. 2 #7">''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> disguises himself as a doctor, performs the blood test, and tells her that she is [[HIV]] positive. Devastated, Karen returns to New York and tells Matt about the diagnosis. Using another disguise, Mysterio suggests to Karen that her infection is due to an infant that Matt is currently protecting as the child 'really' the Antichrist, but Matt forces her to acknowledge that she is just trying to avoid facing her own responsibility for her state. Later, during a fight between Daredevil and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], Karen is murdered by Bullseye when she moves to intercept a billy-club thrown at Daredevil's head and is impaled in the heart.<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Devastated by Karen's death, Matt briefly contemplates suicide but is given new strength to keep going by remembering some of their times together, such as when she convinced Matt to take a night off on his birthday and when she said that she didn't want Daredevil to quit as she always felt safer knowing the vigilante was out there.<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #6</ref> After Mysterio's role in the scheme is revealed and the villain commits suicide,<ref name="Daredevil vol. 2 #7"/> Matt attempts and fails to give Karen's eulogy, finding himself overwhelmed at the memory of her loss. Initially bitter at Karen dying simply so that Mysterio could feel better about himself, a later conversation with [[Spider-Man]] helps Daredevil realize that the infant he's saved represents something positive that has come of the whole affair. The baby is given up for adoption to a couple in [[New Jersey]]. Before leaving, Matt names the baby after Karen and hopes that her new parents will allow the occasional visit from her "Uncle Matt".<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
In the ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' comic 'What If Karen Page Had Lived?", Karen is narrowly saved from death when Bullseye hits her in the shoulder rather than the head. However, driven by his rage at the fear of losing her rather than his focused grief when he actually lost her, Matt beats the Kingpin to death for his part in Mysterio's scheme, and is subsequently arrested. When Matt is sentenced to 44 years in the Raft for the crime, Karen leaves town and disappears. Matt assumes that she had become severely depressed and may have killed herself. He never sees her again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1473/what_if_karen_page_had_lived_2004|title=What if Karen Page Had Lived?
