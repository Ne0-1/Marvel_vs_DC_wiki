'''Karen Page''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been a regular cast member of Marvel's ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' series, and is the longest-running love interest for the title character.

Karen Page is played by [[Deborah Ann Woll]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], first as a main character in ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', and later as a main cast member in ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'' and a recurring character in ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], she first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April [[1964 in comics|1964]]).

==Character overview==
In her first appearances, Karen is the secretary for the law firm of Daredevil's [[alter ego]] Matt Murdock, and the mutual love interest of both Murdock and his partner [[Foggy Nelson]]. Her relationship with Murdock hits a downward spiral when he reveals his secret identity to her in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #57 (October 1969), setting off a long break-up which concluded with her departure from the series in issue #86 (April 1972). Within these final stories, she trades her profession of secretary to become a film actress.

After three years absence from published stories, Karen returned for a considerable stint as a supporting character in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'', starting with vol. 2 #13 (August 1975) and continuing through to #26 (October 1977). During this time, a crossover with ''Daredevil'' #138 afforded her a brief return appearance in the series where she got her start. A 1978 appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' would prove the character's last showing for over seven years.

Karen returned in ''[[Born Again (comics)|Born Again]]'', the award-winning storyline beginning in ''Daredevil'' #227 (February 1986) that would ultimately restore her earlier role as Daredevil's love interest. Writer [[Ann Nocenti]] gave considerably more development to their relationship, and even had Karen acting as a sidekick to Daredevil for the first time in issue #259, in which she goes undercover to help take down a child pornography ring. She was again dropped from the series in issue #263 (February 1989) for another long-term breakup from Murdock, but this time was brought back just two years later, for ''Daredevil'' #294 (July 1991).

Karen is killed by Daredevil's adversary [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in ''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #5, (March 10, 1999).

==Fictional character biography==
[[Foggy Nelson]] hires Karen Page to be the secretary for the new law firm Nelson and Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil'' #1</ref> She is infatuated with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] from the moment they meet. When he introduces her to the adventuring, wisecracking aspect of his personality, in the guise of his "twin brother" Mike, she finds herself equally charmed by this side of him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #25–26</ref>

Karen's father, Dr. Paxton Page, fakes his own kidnapping and death so that he can assume the guise of the villain [[Death's Head]]. Karen returns to her parents' home in Fagan Corners, [[Vermont]] to investigate her father's disappearance. Daredevil follows her. In the ensuing battle between Daredevil and Death's Head, Death's Head spills a vat of molten [[cobalt]] over Daredevil, but realizes that Karen is endangered. This brings him back to his senses, and he pushes Daredevil and Karen to safety. He appears to die in this act of self-sacrifice, when he is coated in the molten cobalt. After the battle with Death's Head, Daredevil reveals his true identity to Karen.<ref>''Daredevil'' #56–57</ref> She constantly fears for Matt's safety, but he cannot give up fighting crime. Karen eventually leaves him and moves to [[California]] to pursue an acting career. She finds work as an actress in a daytime [[soap opera]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Karen becomes addicted to heroin and starts making [[pornography|pornographic]] movies.<ref name="Daredevil #227">''Daredevil'' #227</ref> In need of a fix, she sells Daredevil's secret identity to a drug dealer, who in turn sells it to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].

He helps Karen beat her addiction, and they resume their relationship and begin sharing an apartment.<ref>''Daredevil'' #232</ref>

Realizing that Matt is incomplete without his work as a lawyer, Karen founds a free drug and legal clinic, where she counsels drug addicts and Matt provides legal advice and "ghost lawyering".<ref>''Daredevil'' #248</ref> The clinic is destroyed during [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|a demonic invasion of Manhattan]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #262</ref> and hours later Karen discovers that Matt has been having an affair with [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].

She becomes an [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography]] activist,<ref>''Daredevil'' #294</ref> assists Daredevil and the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] in fighting crime on separate occasions, and reluctantly begins dating Matt. At this point she becomes a radio show host under the name "Paige Angel." She eventually realizes that she is too dependent on Matt and that her past is a constant barrier between them. Karen leaves Matt to accept a talk show host position in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

While in California, Karen has a routine blood test as part of an insurance policy application. The [[supervillain]] [[Mysterio]] - as part of his plan to psychologically destroy Daredevil for his last scheme<ref name="Daredevil vol. 2 #7">''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> disguises himself as a doctor, performs the blood test, and tells her that she is [[HIV]] positive as part of his plan to destroy Daredevil before he himself dies of a brain tumor. Devastated, Karen returns to New York and tells Matt that she is HIV positive. Later, during a fight between Daredevil and Bullseye, Karen is murdered by Bullseye when she moves to intercept a billy-club thrown at Daredevil's head and is impaled in the heart.<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Matt is so devastated by Karen's death that he briefly contemplates suicide, but is given new strength to keep going when he remembers some of their times together, such as when she convinced him to take a night off on his birthday and when she told him that she didn't want him to quit as Daredevil as she always felt safer knowing he was out there.<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #6</ref> After Mysterio's role in the scheme is revealed and he commits suicide,<ref name="Daredevil vol. 2 #7"/> Matt attempts and fails to give Karen's eulogy, finding himself overwhelmed at the memory of her loss. Initially bitter at Karen dying simply so that Mysterio could feel better about himself, a later conversation with [[Spider-Man]] helps Daredevil realize that the infant he's saved represents something positive that has come of the whole affair. He gives the baby up for adoption to a couple in [[New Jersey]]. Before he leaves, Matt names the baby after Karen and hopes that her new parents will allow the occasional visit from her "Uncle Matt."<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
In the ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' comic 'What If Karen Page Had Lived?", Karen is narrowly saved from death when Bullseye hits her in the shoulder rather than the head. However, driven by his rage at the fear of losing her rather than his focused grief when he actually lost her, Matt beats the Kingpin to death for his part in Mysterio's scheme, and is subsequently arrested. When Matt is sentenced to 44 years in the Raft for the crime, Karen leaves town and disappears. Matt assumes that she had become severely depressed and may have killed herself. He never sees her again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1473/what_if_karen_page_had_lived_2004|title=What if Karen Page Had Lived?
