'''Karen Page''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' series, the longest running love interest for the title character. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], she first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964).

==Character overview==
In her first appearances, Karen is the secretary for the law firm of Daredevil’s [[alter ego]] Matt Murdock, and the mutual love interest of both Murdock and his partner [[Foggy Nelson]]. Her relationship with Murdock hits a downward spiral when he reveals his secret identity to her in ''Daredevil'' #57 (October 1969), setting off a long break-up which concluded with her departure from the series in issue #86 (April 1972). Within these final stories, she trades her profession of secretary to become a film actress.

After three years absence from published stories, Page returned for a considerable stint as a supporting character in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'', starting with vol. 2 #13 (August 1975) and continuing through to #26 (October 1977). During this time, a crossover with ''Daredevil'' #138 afforded her a brief return appearance in the series where she got her start. However, a 1978 appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' would prove the character's last showing for over seven years.

Karen Page returned in the award-winning ''Daredevil'' #227 (February 1986), in a story that would ultimately restore her earlier role as Daredevil's love interest. Writer [[Ann Nocenti]] gave considerably more development to their relationship, and even had Page acting as a sidekick to Daredevil for the first time in issue #259, in which she goes undercover to help take down a child pornography ring. She was again dropped from the series in issue #263 (February 1989) for another long-term breakup from Murdock, but this time was brought back just two years later, for ''Daredevil'' #294 (July 1991).

Page is killed by Daredevil's adversary [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in ''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #5, (March 10, 1999).
