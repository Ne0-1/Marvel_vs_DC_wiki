The first Scarlet Spider was NOT as many believe a clone of [[Spider-Man]] created by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]. He was actually the original Peter Parker, but believed himself to be a clone. The Jackal created the clone to fight and defeat the original Spider-Man, but since the clone and Peter both shared the same memories they confused themselves in the battle. They assumed the winner must be the original Peter Parker and the actual Spider-Man. However, the clone actually won and went on through the years as Spider-Man. Since the original Peter lost the fight, he was left for dead and was dumped into a smoke stack of a factory. He escaped and assumed the alias of Ben Reilly. The name is a combination of his Uncle's first name and his Aunt's madien name. He wandered around aimlessly for five years. He returned to Spider-Man's home of New York, and found himself once again wanting to be a hero. He fashioned his own costume, and became the Scarlet Spider. He fought alongside his "brother" Spider-Man, and proved himself to be such a great hero, that Spider-Man asked him to watch over the city, while he and his wife tried to start a family. When his name was smeared by a second evil Scarlet Spider, he assumed the identity of Spider-Man, until his death at the hands of [[Norman Osborne]].

==Joe Wade==

An undercover FBI agent assigned to investigate the new [[Lady Octopus|Doctor Octopus]], Carolyn Trainer, Joe Wade was discovered and forced to undertake a virtual reality graft. Carolyn turned him into a hard-light holographic duplicate of the Scarlet Spider, in order to ruin his name. In his Scarlet Spider guise, Joe was actually trapped in a virtual reality chamber, and his thoughts powered the hologram. Despite the fact that his mind powered the hologram, Joe was unable to stop himself from commiting acts of violence. When the real Scarlet Spider, Ben Reilly attacked Doctor Octopus's lair, he damaged the machine while Joe was still inside. The damage to the virtual reality chamber caused the grafts to malfucntion, and Joe became a real mechanized Scarlet Spider with amazing powers. As the new Scarlet Spider, Joe was superhumanly strong and fast, he had claws on his fingertips and could fire webbing from his wrists, crawl up walls, and fire laser 'stingers' from his eyes.It took both Ben Reilly (in the guise of Spider-Man) and the [[New Warriors]] to stop the cybernetic Scarlet Spider, and the FBI put him in custody and had him undergo medical treatments to remove the technology.

In the [[MC2]], Felicity Hardy took the identity of Scarlet Spider to both be a partner to [[Spider-Girl]], and to irritate her mother [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]]. While she had no actual powers, she used her amazing gymnastic talent and martial arts skills, along with an array of spider-themed weaponry to fight crime, until several near death experiences caused her to give up the identity.
