'''Blastaar''', sometimes called the '''Living Bomb-Burst''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]].

==Character biography==

Blastarr is an opponent of the [[Fantastic Four]], who lives in the [[Negative Zone]]. Blastaar is an enemy of [[Annihilus]], another enemy of the Fantastic Four. He is a member of a race known as the Balurrians. He is also huge and stands roughly 6'6" and weighs 520 pounds.

==Powers and abilities==
Blastarr has vast superhuman strength, enabling him to lift (press) 50 tons under optimal conditions. Blastaar is ''incredibly'' resistant to injury; conventional weapons and even ballistic missiles could have no effect on him. His superhuman constitution can withstand extreme variations in temperature (from 200° below zero to 11,000° Fahrenheit) and pressure (from 0 to 10 Earth atmospheres). He is virtually tireless. He can live without nourishment for several weeks and survive in the vacuum of space by inducing himself into a state of hibernation.

He is capable of self propelled flight at escape velocity (25,000 miles per hour) and can project blasts of concussive force from his hands powerful enough to penetrate 6-inch thick titanium overlayed steel. His blasts have a range of 1,000 feet. He uses the same concussive force blasts to give him flight(he launces himself like a rocket) and remain flying almost indefinitely.

He is also highly trained in the arts of warfare of and by his race and has access to technology such as starships and powerful plasma-based weapons. Most often, however, he only uses his powers without augmentation.
