'''Blastaar''', sometimes called the '''Living Bomb-Burst''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. Blastaar is an opponent of the [[Fantastic Four]] and lives in the [[Negative Zone]]. Blastaar is an enemy of [[Annihilus]], another Fantastic Four villain. 

==Character biography==

He is a member and king of a [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race known as the Balurrians. He ruled ruthlessly until his subjects rose against him. Blastaar was locked up in a special containment suit and set adrift in outer space in the [[Negative Zone]]. When he broke loose he sighted [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], who had been exploring the Negative Zone and followed him back to Earth. He fought with the [[Sandman]] and Reed Richard's group of superheroes, the [[Fantastic Four]] but was driven back to the Negative Zone. 

Over the following years Blastaar would repeatedly return to Earth to conquer it and fight the Fantastic Four many times, as well as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other Marvel superheroes. He returned to the throne of Baluur and started to conquer Negative Zone, only opposed by [[Annihilus]], another conqueror living in the Negative Zone. The two have teamed up at times, but usually they are fierce enemies. Blastaar's son [[Burstaar (comics)|Burstaar]] has helped his father, but has his own ambitions and allied himself with the [[Kree]].

{{spoilers}}

With Annihilus' current expansion into the [[Marvel Universe]] in the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]], it remains to be seen whether his rival Blastaar will be involved as well. Annihilation-editor Andy Schmidt,   however, has been ambivalent on Blastaar's involvement with Annihilation.

==Powers and abilities==

Blastarr has superhuman strength and is incredibly resistant to injury; conventional weapons and even ballistic missiles could have no effect on him. His superhuman constitution can withstand extreme variations in temperature and pressure. He is virtually tireless. He can live without nourishment for several weeks and survive in the vacuum of space by inducing himself into a state of hibernation.

He is capable of self propelled flight at escape velocity and can project blasts of concussive force from his hands. He uses the same concussive force blasts to give him flight (he launches himself like a rocket) and remain flying almost indefinitely. His energy blasts can temporarily disrupt the molecular integrity of the [[Eternals]].

He is also highly trained in the arts of warfare of and by his race and has access to technology such as starships and powerful plasma-based weapons. Most often, however, he only uses his powers without augmentation.
