'''Zauriel''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]].

Zauriel was an angel of the Eagle Host in Heaven. He was assigned by The Presence (i.e. [[God]]) as a [[guardian angel]]. He protected the souls of various people over the centuries including [[Cleopatra]], [[Mona Lisa]], and [[Joan of Arc]]. Eventually, he fell in love with one of his charges. To be with her he gave up his immortality (though still having wings and certain powers like the ability to part oceans) and appeared on Earth.

He first appeared in JLA #6.  Since then, he joined the [[Justice League]] as their spiritual advisor.
