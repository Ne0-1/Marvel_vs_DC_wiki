'''Hurricane''' is a name used by many different [[fictional characters]] appearing in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

The characters are unrelated and include a western [[gunslinger]], [[superhero]]s, and [[supervillain]]s. 

==Harry Kane==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hurricane1.jpg|thumb|90px|right|Hurricane]] -->
'''Hurricane''' ('''Harry Kane''') was an enemy of the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and had super speed gained from drinking an Indian shaman's potion, which enabled him to outdraw many of his opponents in a gun fight (first seen in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #70, 1964). He fought the Two-Gun Kid several times, but was ultimately defeated each time.  Later, the time travelling [[West Coast Avengers]] battled Hurricane and the group of outlaws he belonged to.  He battled [[Tigra]], but was taken into custody.  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Dick Ayers]].

==Makkari==
{{Main|Makkari (comics)}}

The [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] character Hurricane was [[retcon]]ned as an identity of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] Makkari.

==Albert Potter==
<!-- [[Hurricane (Albert Potter)]] links here -->
'''Hurricane''' ('''Albert Potter''') was an enemy of [[Captain Britain]] and a former [[meteorologist]]. A weather experiment gave him strong weather and energy manipulating powers.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/hurrcan3.htm Hurricane (Albert Potter)] at the Handbook to the Appendix of the Marvel Universe</ref> He initially clashed with [[Captain Britain]], but was defeated and incarcerated in Darkmoor Prison.

While jailed, Potter agreed to participate in medical experiments. Doctor Samuel Merrick used him as one of the first test subjects for  his Gene Match Device (GMD), rewriting Potter's DNA to include genetic material from a soldier ant. The process was intended to enhance Potter's abilities, but seemingly killed him.<ref name="gd2">''Gene Dogs'' #2 (Nov. 1993)</ref>.

Hurricane's body was stolen by the [[Mys-Tech]] organisation, who later revived and healed him, intending to use Potter as a catspaw in their conflict with Otomocorp and the S.T.O.R.M. anti-terrorist team known as the [[Gene Dogs]]. Hurricane was sent to recover a Gene Scanner device from S.T.O.R.M. headquarter - the device had initially been stolen from Mys-Tech by Otomocorp's Q7 Strike Force, but had then been seized by S.T.O.R.M.'s Gene Dogs. 

Hurricane easily succeeded in this task (also capturing Doctor Merrick, who had created the Gene Dogs by using a later version of the GMD process he used on Hurricane) but was then betrayed by his new associates - Mys-Tech had booby-trapped the device and always intended that Otomocorp should seize it, so arranged this by leaking Hurricane's location to Otomocorp. Hurricane was then beaten and defeated by the Q7 team.

However, Potter escaped and took control of Q7 after realising that the GMD process had not been a complete failure - it had successfully enhanced his energy control powers, and had also granted him "hive mind" abilities patterned on the soldier ant, allowing him to mentally control others.<ref name="gd3">''Gene Dogs'' #3 (Dec. 1993)</ref> Despite this, in ''Gene Dogs'' #4 he was eventually defeated by the combined forces of the Q7 and Gene Dogs teams.

Albert Potter is considered a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

==Dark Riders==
'''Hurricane''' was a member of the second incarnation of the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. He first appeared in Cable #17.

===Fictional character biography===
He was a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with the power to summon force-ten gale winds, which he normally used to disorient his victims while the other [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]] battled hand-to-hand.  During their first mission, the Dark Riders faced off against a few of the [[X-Men]], and Hurricane jumped at the opportunity to face [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].  They battled, and Storm eventually defeated him. Later, Storm pushed Hurricane's strong winds away and [[Gauntlet (Inhuman)|Gauntlet]] was ready to kill him for failing twice. Fortunately, [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] didn't want Hurricane dead and he stayed with the Dark Riders.<ref>''Cable'' Vol.1 #17-19</ref> 

Hurricane was one of the Riders who broke [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] out of prison, and the two seemed to have some anger towards each other though they had just met.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol.2 #93-95</ref> During the adamantium bonding process on [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Hurricane was killed when Wolverine rejected the adamantium, exploding the tank and sending shards of adamantium everywhere.  Hurricane was stabbed with hundreds of adamantium shards and died instantly.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol.2 #100</ref>

Hurricane, along with several of his fellow Dark Riders, is resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#The Transmode Virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XFv3i21">''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #21, January 2010</ref>  The story is ongoing.

==''Civil War''==
A new Hurricane character was introduced in the [[Civil War: The Initiative]] one-shot. Not much is known about this character, except that he has an inhuman resistance to damage and an unusual intellect which he used to design his own special "gear", which apparently grants him his powers. It is also mentioned that Hurricane had only been a super-hero for nine months and three days when the story began. As an unregistered superhuman, he was confronted by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. In turn, the Thunderbolts fought and practically crippled Hurricane. The Thunderbolts later apparently exposed Hurricane to the public, and what became of him afterwards is unknown.

The character is referred to as "Hurricane II" during the issue, and appears to be an updated version of Albert Potter's character.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Hurricane===
This '''Hurricane''' is a character in the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], a woman with super-human speed (gained from surgery) from [[North Korea]]. She is a member of [[The Liberators (Marvel Comics)|The Liberators]], an international counterpart of [[The Ultimates]]. The Liberators invade the USA, killing thousands. She is defeated when Quicksilver pushed her past her limits, destroying her in an instant. She first appeared in ''Ultimates'' vol. 2 #9 (January, 2006).
