'''Hurricane''' is a name used by four different [[fictional characters]] appearing in the [[comic  books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

The four characters are unrelated - a western [[gunslinger]], a [[superhero]] and two [[supervillains]]. 

==Hurricane I==

'''Hurricane I''' (real name '''Harry Kane''') was an enemy of the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and had super speed gained from drinking an Indian shaman's potion, which enabled him to outdraw many of his opponents in a gun fight (first seen in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #70, 1964). He fought the Two-Gun Kid several times, but was ultimately defeated each time.  Later, the time travelling [[West Coast Avengers]] battled Hurricane and the group of outlaws he belonged to.  He battled [[Tigra]], but was taken into custody.  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Dick Ayres]].

==Hurricane II==

==Hurricane III==
'''Hurricane III''' (real name '''Albert Potter''') was an enemy of [[Captain Britain]] and a former [[meteorologist]]. A weather experiment gave him strong weather and energy manipulating powers[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/hurrcan3.htm]

==Hurricane IV==

'''Hurricane IV''' was a member of the second incarnation of the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]].  He was a [[mutant]] with the power to summon force-ten gale winds, which he normally used to disorient his victims while the other [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]] battled hand-to-hand.  During their first mission, the Dark Riders faced off against a few of the [[X-Men]], and Hurricane jumped at the opportunity to face [[Storm (comics)|Storm]].  They battled, and Storm eventually defeated him.  Later, Storm pushed Hurricane's strong winds away and [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] was ready to kill him for failing twice.  Fortunately, [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] didn't want Hurricane dead and he stayed with the Dark Riders.  Hurricane was one of the Riders who broke [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] out of prison, and the two seemed to have some anger towards each other though they had just met.  During the adamantium bonding process on [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Hurricane was killed when Wolverine rejected the adamantium, exploding the tank and sending shards of adamantium everywhere.  Hurricane was stabbed with hundreds of adamantium shards and died instantly.

==Other versions==
