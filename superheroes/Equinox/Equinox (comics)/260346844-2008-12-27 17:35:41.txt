==Fictional character biography==
Equinox is a youth who continually undergoes "thermal transitions" so that part of his body is always aflame and part of his body is covered with ice.  Equinox has superhuman strength and can generate both intense [[heat]] and extreme cold similarly to the heroes the [[Human Torch]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] (with whom he first battled).<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #23</ref> He has also come into conflict with a number of other [[superhero]]es, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]],<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 1) #59-60</ref> and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #147.</ref>

Afterwards, Equinox joined Vil-Anon, a twelve-step program dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' (vol. 2) #12</ref>

===Civil War/Initiative===
Equinox appeared during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event and when the registration law was announced, he wanted to leave the country again. He contacted [[Vienna (comics)|Vienna]] to make him a new fake identity, but he did not know Vienna was secretly working for the [[Heroes for Hire]], who later apprehended Equinox and several other super villains.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

Equinox is next seen as a member of the Montana team of the [[Fifty State Initiative]], [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], alongside [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], [[Think Tank (comics)|Think Tank]], and Spinner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
Equinox was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator and attacked his teammates. The Skrull-Equinox not only had the abilities of Firestar and Iceman to match the real Equinox' powers, he also had some of Spider-Man's abilities. He froze Hardball, [[Ryder (comics)|Ryder]] & Riot (of the [[Skrull Kill Krew]]) in ice and broke the glass over Think Tank's brain. The Skrull-Equinox was sniped in the head by Cloud 9 using adamantium bullets.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>
