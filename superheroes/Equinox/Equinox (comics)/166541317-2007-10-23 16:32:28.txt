==Fictional character biography==
Equinox is a youth who continually undergoes "thermal transitions" so that part of his body is always aflame and part of his body is covered with ice.  Equinox has superhuman strength and can generate both intense [[heat]] and extreme cold similarly to the heroes the [[Human Torch]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] (with whom he first battled). He has also come into conflict with a number of other [[superhero]]es, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].
