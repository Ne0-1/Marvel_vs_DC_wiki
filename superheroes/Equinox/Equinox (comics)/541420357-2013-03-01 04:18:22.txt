Equinox's powers were similar to the heroes the [[Human Torch]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], with whom he first battled.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #23</ref> He also came into conflict with the [[superhero]]es [[Spider-Man]], [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], during which his origin was revealed, the three heroes managing to apparently cure him using technology conceived by his mother and constructed in the [[Baxter Building]] while the [[Fantastic Four]] were away.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 1) #59-60 (July–Aug. 1977)</ref>

Years later, he fought the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #147</ref>

Afterwards, Equinox joined Vil-Anon, a twelve-step program dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' (vol. 2) #12</ref>

Equinox appeared during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event and when the registration law was announced, he wanted to leave the country again. He contacted [[Vienna (comics)|Vienna]] to make him a new fake identity, but he did not know Vienna was secretly working for the [[Heroes for Hire]], who later apprehended Equinox and several other super villains.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

Equinox is next seen as a member of the Montana team of the [[Fifty State Initiative]], [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], alongside [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], Think Tank, and Spinner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storryline, Equinox was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator and attacked his teammates. The Skrull-Equinox not only had the abilities of [[Firestar]] and Iceman to match the real Equinox' powers, he also had some of Spider-Man's abilities. He froze [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], Ryder and Riot (of the [[Skrull Kill Krew]]) in ice and broke the glass over Think Tank's brain. The Skrull-Equinox was sniped in the head by [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] using adamantium bullets.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>

Due to his criminal past, Norman Osborn chooses his team between the ones assembled by Stark to help some others Initiative Teams to apprehend the seceding Heavy Hitters team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Equinox was seen on a rampage. Spider-Man uses his own version of [[Green Goblin]]'s glider and bombs to defeat Equinox.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Equinox possesses both pyrokinesis and cryokinesis as well as super-strength and durability. He continually undergoes "thermal transitions" so that part of his body is always aflame and part of his body is covered with ice. The strain of these powers has driven him increasingly insane over time.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Equinox has superhuman strength and can generate both intense [[heat]] and extreme cold.
