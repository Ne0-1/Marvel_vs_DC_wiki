==Fictional character biography==
Equinox is an African-American youth who gained superhuman powers due to accidental exposure to his father's malfunctioning equipment after a lab accident.  His powers were similar to the heroes the [[Human Torch]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], with whom he first battled.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #23</ref> He has also come into conflict with a number of other [[superhero]]es, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]],<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 1) #59-60</ref> and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #147.</ref>

Afterwards, Equinox joined Vil-Anon, a twelve-step program dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' (vol. 2) #12</ref>

===Civil War/Initiative===
Equinox appeared during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event and when the registration law was announced, he wanted to leave the country again. He contacted [[Vienna (comics)|Vienna]] to make him a new fake identity, but he did not know Vienna was secretly working for the [[Heroes for Hire]], who later apprehended Equinox and several other super villains.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
{{main|Secret Invasion}}
Equinox was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator and attacked his teammates. The Skrull-Equinox not only had the abilities of [[Firestar]] and Iceman to match the real Equinox' powers, he also had some of Spider-Man's abilities. He froze [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], Ryder and Riot (of the [[Skrull Kill Krew]]) in ice and broke the glass over Think Tank's brain. The Skrull-Equinox was sniped in the head by [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] using adamantium bullets.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>

After the invasion is over, the real Equinox is seen, although mis-coloured, in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> Equinox has since retaken active service with the Freedom Force. Due to his criminal past, Norman Osborn chooses his team between the ones assembled by Stark to help some others Initiative Teams to apprehend the seceding Heavy Hitters team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Equinox possesses both pyrokinesis and cryokinesis as well as super-strength and durability. He continually undergoes "thermal transitions" so that part of his body is always aflame and part of his body is covered with ice. The strain of these powers has driven him increasingly insane over time.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Equinox has superhuman strength and can generate both intense [[heat]] and extreme cold.

==In other media==
