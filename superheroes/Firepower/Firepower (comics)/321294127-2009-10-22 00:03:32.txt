Jack Taggert worked on an experimental pilotable suit for Project: Firepower for [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s rival [[Edwin Cord]]. It would be designed to take out any threat to the United States as a cover-up to stop riots. When it came to Iron Man's [[Armor Wars]], Jack Taggart piloted the suit to stop him. Jack Taggert used the armor to train in the desert taking out some jets and tanks. When it came to the fight against Iron Man, the Firepower suit withstood Iron Man's attacks and did a sneak attack in a canyon. When he placed a Negator Pack on Firepower, Ironman discovered that the Firepower suit, while based on his Stark Armor designs, had been modified based on analysis of his previously-used negator packs to render it immune. The wounded Iron Man retreated to a Stark Enterprise helicopter flying overhead. Tony removed his suit and threw it out of the helicopter so that Firepower would think that Iron Man is dead.

During Iron Man's "apparent death," Edwin had Firepower threaten the Marsten Manufacturing group to turn down Stark's bid, attack Acutech, and attack Tony Stark and his workers. Finally having enough of Firepower, Iron Man confronted him in an upgraded suit with new weapons. Iron Man managed to bring Firepower down. In a last ditch attempt to win, Firepower set the Terminax missile to explode in thirty seconds, hoping Iron Man would try to stop it and be killed. The backpack that housed the missile was damaged and wouldn't allow it to exit. Jack pleaded with Iron Man to free him from his armor but Iron Man said that it was impossible. With an E.M.P., Iron Man managed to slow down the countdown enough to deactivate the timer. Jack Taggert then said that others will kill Iron Man like he had, resulting in Tony ripping the Firepower suit apart. Stunned, Jack stated that Iron Man said he couldn't take him out of the armor. Iron Man then coldly responded to him that he had lied.

==Powers and abilities==
Firepower’s armour provides him with a high degree of protection from energy and physical attacks. He strength, reflexes and endurance have all been enhanced by his armour and he can fly at sub-sonic speeds. The suit is also air conditioned to prevent discomfort for the operator. The Firepower armour contains a vast array of sensors and an impressive array of weapons including: surface-to-air missiles, heat beam lasers, mini-grenades and arm-mounted concussive cannons. The armour contains a small tactical nuclear missile known as ‘Terminax’.  Described as a "two-ton tuxedo" by Jack Taggart, the suit was extremely large and its wearer had to be lifted into it with a special crane.

==Other media==
===Television===
* In the two-part animated "Armor Wars" adaption of [[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]], Firepower (voiced by [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]]) was an automaton built by [[Justin Hammer]] to take down Iron Man. Because it was Hammer Industry Property, Iron Man's Negator Pack doesn't work on it. Iron Man faked his death, but returned in a new armor when it started to attack properties of Stark Industry. After preventing it's missile from going off, Iron Man used his suit to hack into the remains of Firepower to learn that Justin Hammer was behind the armored villains using his Stark Armor designs.
