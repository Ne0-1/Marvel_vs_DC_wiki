'''Madame Web''' is a fictional [[supporting character]] in the [[Spider-Man]] [[comic book]] [[book series|series]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Cassandra Webb''' was born in [[Salem, Oregon]].  She is a [[paralysis|paralyzed]], [[blindness|blind]], [[telepathy|telepathic]], [[clairvoyant]], and [[precognition|precognitive]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]]. She was originally stricken with [[myasthenia gravis]], a baffling disease that gradually erodes the central nervous system, and was connected to a [[life support system]] designed by her husband, which included a series of tubes shaped like a spider-web. She knows Spider-Man's secret identity and helps him from time to time. However, she has also contacted him for assistance on occasion, such as when [[Black Tom Cassidy]] dispatched the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] to capture her in the hope that her psychic powers would help them defeat the [[X-Men]], only for her to nearly die after Juggernaut separated her from her life-support system and Juggernaut to subsequently be trapped in a vat of wet cement.

She is also the grandmother of the fourth [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Charlotte Witter]]. During the "Gathering of the Five" ceremony, Webb was restored to youth and had her myasthenia gravis cured. At one point in time Webb served as a mentor of sorts to the third Spider-Woman, the young [[Mattie Franklin]], though Franklin has retired as of late. 

Madame Web has resurfaced as of ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #26 (Part 4 of "Feral") and her psychic powers are intact after ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]''. However, since ''House of M'' (in which she did appear young) she seems to have regained her aged appearance, though the myasthenia gravis remains gone; this could indeed be taken as an effect of ''Decimation''.

==Powers and abilities==
Madame Web possesses psychic abilities including telepathy, clairvoyance, and [[prescience]]. She can also perform psychic surgery and appear to others in spirit (astral) form. After the Gathering of the Five ceremony, she apparently has the gift of immortality.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
Madame Web has passed away in the [[MC2]] universe, but her reputation has inspired an entire temple of prophetic acolytes.

===Ultimate Madame Web===
Madame Web has appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.  In issue #102, she is part of the psych team that plans to change [[Ultimate Spider-Woman]]'s memories (the Spider-Woman of this reality being merely a female [[Cloning|clone]] of Spider-Man).  She appears in a wheelchair (implying paralysis) and blind, similar to the classic version.  However, she is younger than that version of the character.

===House of M===
Webb also appeared during ''[[House of M]]'' as a therapist employed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

===Madam Web===
"Madam (sic) Web" is also the name of a character from one of the many [[Hostess (brand)|Hostess]] snack cake advertisements featuring super-heroes in the 1970s and 80's. She has web-spinning powers and is a "love crazed fiend" for Spider-Man, but ultimately prefers [[Twinkie]]s.[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/madamweb.htm]

===Avataars===
A version of Madame Web makes a brief appearance in the heroic fantasy world of ''[[Avataars: Covenant of the Shield]]'' as "the Widow of the Web", a spider-goddess who grants Webswinger (the Spider-Man parallel) his powers.

==In other media==
===Animated series===
[[Image:Madamewebanimated.png|thumbnail|Animated '''Madame Web''', as she appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|Animated Series]]''.]]
Madame Web appeared in the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|''Spider-Man'' animated series]]. She was voiced by [[Joan Lee]], the wife of the creator of Spider-Man, [[Stan Lee]]. On the cartoon she had a recurring role giving Spider-Man cryptic yet always vital advice and eventually led him to the [[Beyonder]]. Instead of being a mutant, Madame Web was a cosmic entity of great mystical power (dwarfing Dr. Strange's powers). So apparently, she had no human origin.

In the series, Web first appeared in a [[cameo]] in the third season's premiere episode, "[[Doctor Strange (Spider-Man: Animated Series)|Doctor Strange]]". She made a full appearance in the next episode, "[[Make a Wish (Spider-Man: Animated Series)|Make a Wish]]", introducing herself and revealing her knowledge of Spider-Man's life and secret identity. In the series, her role was typically to act as cryptic adviser to Spider-Man, offering him strange clues and riddles that would ultimately help him, as well as supposedly training him for the upcoming 'Ultimate Battle'. Spider-Man's relationship with Madame Web was reluctant as he wanted to live his life autonomously, whereas she insisted he would need her knowledge for the upcoming difficulties. The pair did separate for a while, but she returned when the 'Ultimate Battle' (analogous to the [[Secret Wars]]) occurred. During this appearance, she revealed that she and the Beyonder had been testing multiple alternate Spider-Men to help resolve a crisis caused by the [[Spider-Carnage]] of an alternate universe, whose actions had led to the destruction of all reality; Madam Web and the Beyonder had managed to rewind time to stop the destruction from ever taking place, but required the aid of the Spider-Men to stop it happening again. After the Spider-Carnage had been defeated, Web briefly took Spider-Man to the real world to have a brief conversation with Stan Lee, and subsequently departed with him to search for [[Mary Jane Watson]], who had vanished into a dimensional rift earlier in the series.

===Video games===
*Madame Web appears in the Spider-Man [[Questprobe]] game.
*In the video game [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] may mock [[Spider-Man]] during the game's races by saying, "Madame Web is faster than you, and I don't even get the reference!", an allusion to the fact that Madame Web did not exist in the Ultimate universe at that point.
