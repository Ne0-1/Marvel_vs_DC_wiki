'''Madame Web''' is a fictional [[supporting character]] in the [[Spider-Man]] [[comic book]] [[book series|series]]. 

== Character History ==
'''Cassandra Webb''' is a [[paralysis|paralyzed]], [[blindness|blind]], [[telepathy|telepathic]], and [[precognition|precognitive]] [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]]. She was originally stricken with [[myasthenia gravis]], a baffling disease that gradually erodes the central nervous system, and was connected to a [[life support system]] designed by her husband, which included a series of tubes shaped like a spider-web. She knows Spider-Man's secret identity and helps him from time to time. She is also the grandmother of the fourth [[Spider-Woman]], [[Charlotte Witter]].

During the "Gathering of the Five" ceremony, Webb was restored to youth and had her myasthenia gravis cured. She recently seems to have regained her aged appearance, though the myasthenia gravis remains gone.

At one point in time Webb served as a mentor of sorts to the third Spider-Woman, the young [[Mattie Franklin]], though Franklin has retired as of late. 

Web also appeared during ''[[House of M]]'' as a therapist employed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

Madame Web has resurfaced as of ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #26 (Part 4 of "Feral") and her psychic powers are intact after ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]''.

== Other versions of Madame Web==
===Ultimate Madame Web===
Madame Web has appeared in [[Ultimate Spider-man]].  In issue #102, she is part of the psych team that is meant to change [[Ultimate Spider-Woman]]'s memories.  She is shown in a wheelchair (implying paralysis) and blind, similar to the classic version.  This version is also younger than the classic version.
===Madam Web===
"Madam (sic) Web" is also the name of a character from one of the many [[Hostess]] snack cake advertisements featuring super-heroes in the 1970's and 80's. She has web-spinning powers and is a "love crazed fiend" for Spider-Man, but ultimately prefers [[Twinkie]]s.[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/madamweb.htm]

== Appearances in other media ==
===Animated Series===
Web appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. She was voiced by Joan Lee, the wife of the creator of Spider-Man, [[Stan Lee]]. On the cartoon she had a recurring role giving Spider-Man cryptic yet always vital advice and eventually led him to the [[Beyonder]]. Instead of being a mutant, Madame Web was a cosmic entity of great mystical power.  So apparently, she had no human origin.

In the series, Web first appeared in a cameo in the third season's premiere episode. She made a full appearance the next week, introducing herself and revealing her knowledge of Spider-Man's life and secret identity. In the series, her role was typically to act as cryptic adviser to Spider-Man, offering him strange clues and riddles that would ultimately help him, as well as supposedly training him for the upcoming 'Ultimate Battle'. Spider-Man's relationship with Madame Web was reluctant as he wanted to live his life autonomously, whereas she insisted he would need her knowledge for the upcoming difficulties. The pair did separate for a while, but she returned when the 'Ultimate Battle' (analogous to the [[Secret Wars]]) occurred.

===Video Game===
In the video game [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] may mock [[Spider-Man]] during the game's races by saying, "Madame Web is faster than you, and I don't even get the reference!", a pun on the fact that Madame Web did not exist in the Ultimate universe at that point.

==Trivia==
Cassandra Webb is likely named in reference to the [[Cassandra]] of Greek mythology, sister of Hector of Troy. This Cassandra also had [[precognition|precognitive powers]].
