'''Madcap''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' #307 (July 1985).  He has clashed with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], [[Spider-Man]], the [[Power Pack]], [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] and [[She-Hulk]].

==Concept and creation==
Madcap first appeared in ''Captain America'' #307 (July 1985), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]].

Most of the villains [[Mark Gruenwald]] introduced in ''[[Captain America]]'' were created to symbolize aspects of contemporary American culture and the world political situation. Gruenwald stated, "Madcap represents purposelessness, the disaffected youth of today who thinks 'What's the reason for doing anything?' The ultimate dropout generation."<ref>{{cite news | first = Dwight Jon | last = Zimmerman | date = January 1988 | title = Mark Gruenwald | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | page = 15 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Madcap (true name unknown) was originally a deeply religious young man. On the way to a picnic with his family and church community, their bus collides with a tanker truck full of Compound X07 (an experimental nerve agent developed by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]). Everyone aboard the bus, including his parents and sister Katy, are killed, leaving him as the only survivor, his body mixing with the Compound. When being told of the deaths of all his friends and family, his mind shatters, his belief in a [[rationality|rational universe]] swept away.

Leaving the hospital, he attempts [[suicide]] by throwing himself in front of traffic. He is injured but the wounds heal almost instantly. This pushes him further over the edge. After purchasing a toy [[soap bubble]] pistol from a dime store and donning a garish clown costume stolen from the Ace Costume Shop, the newly christened Madcap sets out to convince others that life is entirely without reason. Spewing absurdist [[philosophy]], he runs rampant through the streets of [[Manhattan]], causing mass chaos and a riot. [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] tries to stop him, but Madcap uses his madness-inducing powers on him as well.<ref>''Captain America'' #307</ref> Nomad recovers, tracks Madcap to a shack in an old fairground at [[Coney Island]], and defeats him there.<ref>''Captain America'' #309</ref>

Madcap is confined to a mental hospital, but escapes. He gets back into costume and breaks up a shipment of illegal arms organized by the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]]. In the course of the fight he meets Dollar Bill, who runs a Manhattan [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] show. The two film "a day in the life of a superhero", interrupted when Madcap is abducted by the Rose's underlings. Taken to a warehouse, Madcap is tied up, beaten, and assaulted with an axe. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] intervenes, but in the subsequent fight the warehouse is burned down, and Madcap ignores Daredevil's repeated appeals to get out of the fire. When his body is found, Madcap is declared legally dead, but slowly returns to life while in the [[morgue]]. He returns to Dollar Bill's show.<ref>''Daredevil'' #234</ref>

While watching an episode of the show, a bored [[Katie Power]] and [[Franklin Richards]] of [[Power Pack]] decide that Madcap would be someone with whom they could go on an "adventure." Madcap agreed, but his idea of adventure was to cause chaos and confusion all over town and even go head-on to confront armed bank robbers. Katie and Franklin disapproved of his irreverent attitude, but it did teach the two pre-adolescents a lesson in responsibility.<ref>''Power Pack'' #34</ref>

Madcap encounters [[She-Hulk]] and she defeats him on a day when she was trying to have a quiet walk in the park.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #9; This appearance has a more comical tone. The ''[[Sensational She-Hulk]]'' series was a satirical comment on comics; She-Hulk and other characters often break the [[fourth wall]] and address the writers and artists directly. The actual continuity of this issue is ambiguous.</ref> Madcap is later captured by Vice and Triphammer of the [[Power Tools (comics)|Power Tools]] on the order of Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. He is rescued by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #29</ref>

Madcap is asked by the [[Impossible Man|Impossible Woman]] to teach her daughter Impia how to have fun. As part of his demonstration, Madcap uses his powers on [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Impossible Man Summer Vacation Spectacular'' #1</ref>

Madcap exercises his power at [[Grand Central Station]]. By the time Ghost Rider arrives, the entire station is rampant with people murdering each other and killing themselves. Ghost Rider saves whoever he can, then beats Madcap and subjects him to the Penance Stare. Madcap feels all the pain he has caused his victims and likes it: it is the first real sensation he had felt in some time and he vows to continue, in order to experience the Stare again.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #33</ref> He later tries to escape from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], a prison for superhumans. He is stopped by [[Citizen V]].<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual'' 1997</ref>

[[Silver Sable]], leader of the country of [[Symkaria]], hired a team of super-powered heroes to help protect a mad scientist from capture by the group [[Heroes for Hire]]. Sable believed that one of her employees was the aforementioned Nomad but soon discovered she had hired Madcap instead. The teams confronted each other in the monastery of St. Eboar's, deep in Symkaria. [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] and Madcap learned that the other was hard to injure and, delighted, fought on that basis. Deadpool was overwhelmed and teleported out. Madcap, despite his chaotic nature, obeyed orders, guarding [[Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing]]. His bad [[Monty Python]] routines were interrupted by Deadpool, who temporarily defeated him with a blow that seemingly snapped his neck. He returned minutes later to battle Deadpool once again.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #10-11</ref> The entire incident, plus more, turned out to be engineered by the villain [[Master (comics)|Master of the World]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Madcap was among those considered by [[Blackout (comics)#Blackout|Blackout]] and the [[Deacon (comics)|Deacon]] to help them assassinate the [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #33</ref> He then works on a mission to kill Ghost Rider.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #2</ref>

Madcap later appears as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] at the time when the [[Secret Avengers]] raid Bagalia to recruit [[Taskmaster]] to their side.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

Prior to the [[Secret Invasion]], Madap once again encounters Deadpool, and in the midst of an altercation with Daredevil and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the two are reduced to a large pile of ash by Thor's lightning.  Though it initially seems that only Deadpool regenerates and survives, he eventually realizes that the two had actually regenerated as one being, with Madcap becoming one of the "voices" within Deadpool's head (explaining the appearance of a new, "extra" voice in Deadpool's appearances in ''[[Wolverine: Origins]]'' and ''Deadpool'' vol. 3).  After Madcap's personality fully asserts itself enough to use his own powers in a later altercation with Thor and [[Luke Cage]], Deadpool convinces Madcap to manipulate the two affected heroes into tearing Deadpool's body in half, with one half regenerating fully as Deadpool, and the other as Madcap.<ref name="DPA1">''Deadpool Annual'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Madcap possesses two [[List of comic book superhero powers|superpowers]], as a result of the mutagenic effects of his exposure to Compound X07.

* He [[Healing factor|heals from any physical injury instantly]], and even if he sustains enough damage to kill him (such as being flattened or having his neck snapped), or destroy him (such as being incinerated), he will immediately [[resurrection|resurrect]]. Somehow linked to this is a total inability to perceive [[pain]]. It is not known whether he can regenerate severed body parts, because he usually reattaches severed parts of his body simply by holding them to the correct portion of his body. His rapid healing ability also gives him phenomenal endurance, as his body both eliminates fatigue poisons and heals muscle damage caused by overexertion almost instantaneously.

* Madcap has a specialized form of insanity-inducement that immediately affects those he makes eye contact with. He wears a garish purple-and-yellow costume and uses a distracting toy soap bubble-gun, called a "fun-gun" &mdash; to draw the attention of others towards him, so they can meet his gaze. He has the ability to stimulate the inhibition centers in other people's brains. People affected by his power act in a [[drunkenness|euphoric, outlandish, uninhibited manner]] that verges on or becomes insanity and can end up killing themselves. Madcap cannot control how the person acts. The duration of the state seems to be approximately 15â€“30 minutes, though Madcap risks making a person "pleasantly loony" permanently if he makes additional eye contact with them. This power can interact unpredictably with individuals already affected with mental instability; for example, exposure initially seemed to have no affect on Deadpool, but then resulted in his experiencing a brief period of clarity and sanity.<ref name=DPA1 />
