'''Madcap''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], whose story begins with his entire community heading to a church picnic, when they are killed as their bus collides with a tanker truck full of an experimental nerve agent. Madcap was the only survivor. He was taken to the hospital, where he awakened to discover all other passengers on the bus had been killed, shattering his belief in a [[rational universe]].  Exiting the [[hospital]], he attempted to commit [[suicide]] by throwing himself in front of moving traffic, but found his injuries almost instantaneously healed, pushing him further over the edge.  Madcap then equipped himself with a soap bubble pistol and set out to convince others that life is entirely without reason.  In addition to being able to heal near instantaneously from virtually any injury, Madcap can temporarily cause other people to behave [[insane|insanely]], this ability effective on anyone who makes eye contact with him for an unknown period of time.
