'''Madcap''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He first appeared in ''Captain America'' #307 (July 1985).  He has clashed with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], the [[Power Pack]], [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] and [[She-Hulk]].

==Fictional character biography==
Although his true name is yet to be revealed, Madcap was originally a deeply religious young man. One day he, his family and members of their church community were on their way to a picnic when their bus collided with a tanker truck full of Compound X07, an experimental nerve agent developed by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Everyone aboard the bus, including his parents and sister Katy, were killed, leaving him as the only survivor, his body mixing with the Compound. He was taken to a nearby [[hospital]]. When being told of the deaths of all his friends and family, the deeply religious man's mind shattered. His belief in a [[rationality|rational universe]] was swept away.

Leaving the hospital, he attempted to commit [[suicide]] by throwing himself in front of moving traffic. He was injured but the wounds healed almost instantly. This pushed him further over the edge. After purchasing a toy [[soap bubble]] pistol from a dime store and donning a garish clown costume stolen from the Ace Costume Shop, the newly-christened Madcap set out to convince others that life is entirely without reason.

His first battle was with [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], who was at the time [[Captain America]]'s sidekick. This occurred when Madcap, now a prankster spewing absurdist [[philosophy]], ran rampant through the streets of [[Manhattan]] causing mass chaos and a riot. Upon first confronting him, Madcap invited Nomad to "knock some sense" into him; Nomad punched him, dislocating Madcap's jaw. Madcap then popped his jaw painlessly back into place and made his escape, driving Nomad himself crazy in the process. Like the other people in the area, Nomad ran around, acting crazy and making puns and silly jokes. In the course of the experience, he even saw himself in a store window slowly turning into Captain America. This convinced him that it was time to get out of Cap's flat and shadow and make his own mark on the world by bringing Madcap down.

Nomad tracked Madcap to a shack in an old fairground at [[Coney Island]] and tricked him into believing that he was espousing Madcap's view that life was nothing but absurd. When Madcap resumed driving people crazy, Nomad subdued and captured him. Having gained confidence from the fight, Nomad would part from Captain America on friendly terms and venture on a hero career of his own.<ref>''Captain America'' #307, 309</ref>

Madcap was incarcerated in a mental hospital but escaped, got back into costume and broke up a shipment of illegal arms organized by [[Richard Fisk|the Rose]]. In the course of the fight he met Dollar Bill, who ran a Manhattan [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] show. The two were filming "a day in the life of a superhero" when Madcap was abducted by criminals following the Rose's order to kill him. Taken to a warehouse, Madcap was tied up and beaten through with an axe. Being indestructible, he just took the attacks in his stride. At that moment [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] intervened, but in the fight that followed the warehouse was burned down, along with Madcap who simply ignored Daredevil's repeated appeals to get out of the blazing inferno. When his body was found, Madcap was declared legally dead, but slowly returned to life while in the [[morgue]]. He returned to Dollar Bill and persuaded him to change the name of his show to the "Madcap Mystery Hour."<ref>''Daredevil'' #234</ref>

It was while watching an episode of the show that a bored [[Katie Power]] and [[Franklin Richards]] of [[Power Pack]] decided that Madcap would be someone with whom they could go on an "adventure." Madcap agreed, but his idea of adventure was to cause chaos and confusion all over town and even go head-on to confront armed bank robbers. Katie and Franklin disapproved of his irreverent attitude, but it did teach the two pre-adolescents a lesson in responsibility.<ref>''Power Pack'' #34</ref>

At one point, Madcap encountered [[She-Hulk]] and she defeated him on a day when she was trying to have a quiet walk in the park.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #9; This appearance has a more comical tone. Writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and his successors used the ''[[Sensational She-Hulk]]'' series as a satirical comment on comics and She-Hulk and other characters were often shown breaking the [[fourth wall]] and addressing the writers and artists directly about their work. When she gets fed up with Madcap in her book, She-Hulk quite literally rips out a panel where he is featured and shreds it. The actual continuity of this event is ambiguous.</ref>

Madcap was later captured by Vice and Triphammer of the [[Power Tools (comics)|Power Tools]] on the order of Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. He was rescued by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #29</ref>

Madcap was then asked by the [[Impossible Man|Impossible Woman]] to teach her daughter Impia how to have fun. As part of his demonstration, Madcap used his powers on [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Impossible Man Summer Vacation Spectacular'' #1</ref>

Madcap, after a self-monologue in which he stabbed himself to no avail, decided he must show everyone that life is a joke. He went to [[Grand Central Station]] and began by causing a security guard to go mad. The guard, laughing, shot several people. By the time Ghost Rider arrived, the entire station was rampant with people murdering each other and killing themselves. Ghost Rider saved whoever he could, including a baby from an incoming train, then beat Madcap and subjected him to the Penance Stare. Madcap felt all the pain he had caused his victims and he liked it: it was the first real sensation he had felt in some time and he vowed to continue, in order to experience the Stare again, no matter how many people would be hurt.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #33</ref> He would later try to escape from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], a prison for superhumans. He was stopped by [[Citizen V]].<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual'' 1997</ref>  

[[Silver Sable]], leader of the country of [[Symkaria]], hired a team of super-powered heroes to help protect a mad scientist from capture by the group [[Heroes for Hire]]. Sable believed that one of her employees was the aforementioned Nomad but soon discovered she had hired Madcap instead. The teams confronted each other in the monastery of St. Eboar's, deep in Symkaria. [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] and Madcap learned that the other was hard to injure and, delighted, fought on that basis. Deadpool was overwhelmed and teleported out. Madcap, despite his chaotic nature, obeyed orders, guarding [[Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing]]. His bad [[Monty Python]] routines were interrupted by Deadpool, who temporarily defeated him with a blow that seemingly snapped his neck. He returned minutes later to battle Deadpool once again.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 1 #10-11</ref> The entire incident, plus more, turned out to be engineered by the villain [[Master (comics)|Master of the World]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Madcap was among those considered by [[Blackout (comics)#Blackout|Blackout]] and the Deacon to help them assassinate the [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #33</ref> He is now working on a mission to kill Ghost Rider.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Madcap possesses two [[List of comic book superhero powers|superpowers]], as a result of the mutagenic effects of his exposure to Compound X07.  

*The first is his fantastic rate of [[Healing factor|regeneration and recovery]]: he heals from any physical injury instantly, and even if he sustains enough damage to kill him (such as being flattened or having his neck snapped), or destroy him (such as being incinerated), he will immediately [[resurrection|resurrect]].  Somehow linked to this is a total inability to perceive [[pain]]. It is not known whether he can regenerate severed body parts, because he usually reattaches severed parts of his body simply by holding them to the correct portion of his body. Apparently, he can regenerate brain cells, since he survived a bullet wound to the center of his forehead with no apparent permanent damage. Madcap has even returned to life after being declared legally dead by regenerating damage to his heart muscle, and to his brain since brain cells deteriorate rapidly after death. Apparently Madcap's healing ability does not extend to the damage to most of his nerve endings, rendering him incapable of feeling pain and giving him unknown limitations on his senses of touch and taste.

*Madcap's second power is a specialized form of insanity-inducement that immediately affects those he makes eye contact with.  It is for this reason that he wears his garish purple-and-yellow costume and uses a distracting toy soap bubble-gun, called a "fun-gun" &mdash; to draw the attention of others towards him, so they can meet his gaze.  He has the ability to stimulate the inhibition centers in other people's brains. People affected by his power act in a [[drunkenness|euphoric, outlandish, uninhibited manner]] that verges on or becomes insanity and can end up killing themselves.  Madcap cannot control ''how'' the person acts.  This can lead to extreme peril if the affected person decides to, for example, [[tap dance]] up the on-ramp of an [[freeway|interstate]].  The duration of the state seems to be approximately 15–30 minutes, though Madcap risks making a person "pleasantly loony" permanently if he makes additional eye contact with them.  Madcap uses his bubble-gun to mislead people into thinking that it causes the effects he induces psionically in his victims' minds.
