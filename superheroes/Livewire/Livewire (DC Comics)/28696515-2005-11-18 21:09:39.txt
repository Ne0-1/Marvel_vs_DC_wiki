'''Livewire''' (real name Leslie Willis) is a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]].  She first appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', and will soon appear in the comics as well.

==Character History==
===Animated series===
[[Image:Livewire.gif|thumb|90px|left|Livewire, in the animated series.|thumb]]
Leslie Willis was once [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most controverisal [[Shock jock|shock jocks]].  No one was immune to her venomous words, not even [[Superman]].

One evening during a severe [[thunderstorm]], Willis was hosting a [[rock concert]] in honor of her anniversary working at the radio station in Cenntenial Park in downtown Metropolis.  Ignoring the public safety concerns by Metropolis authorities, and the changeable skies, Willis demanded the show to go on.

It was about that time Superman showed up to help the police.  Willis' fans showed support for her by throwing stuff at the Man of Steel, when suddenly, lightning struck the stage, setting it on fire.  When Superman pushed Willis to safety, [[lightning]] struck both of them, transfering some of Superman's powers to Willis and changing her appearance.

When Willis woke up, she saw that her skin had turned ghostly white and her hair stood on end.  She accused Superman for the injuries she had suffered from the accident she created.  She was about to throw a clock-radio at the TV on which she had seen Superman talking to reporters about the accident when the radio suddenly turned on.  It was not plugged into the wall, there were no batteries in it.  She discovered she could manipulate [[electricity]].

Willis then escaped from the hospital by turning herself into an electric current.  Confronting Superman, she had rearranged the electrons of the hospital gown she was wearing into a black leotard with a lightning bolt down the front and black boots.

She had a short-lived aliance with [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and later had an alliance with [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]].

Leslie Willis is loosely based on shock jock [[Howard Stern]].  [[Lori Petty]] voiced Livewire in ''Superman: the Animated Series''.

In the [[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]] animated series, Livewire teamed up with [[Kalibak]], [[Metallo]], [[Toyman]], and [[Weather Wizard]] to get revenge on Superman.  When some of it's members were defeated and Toyman's machine sent Superman into the future with them thinking that Superman is dead, Kalibak and Livewire later attacked the scene of the incident with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Volcana (Superman)|Volcana]], [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]], and [[Deadshot]].  When it came to Season 3 of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Livewire later returned as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom]].

===Comicbooks===

In ''Action Comics'' #835, [[Gail Simone]] and [[John Byrne]] will be bringing Livewire into the mainstream [[DC Universe]].

===Video game===

She also appears in Superman: Shadow of Apokolips video game as a boss for [[Gamecube]] and [[Playstation 2]].

==Powers and abilities==
Livewire is a being of pure energy (because of this, she can only "feed" off electricity). She can transform into energy and travel through electrical wires.  She can manipulate electricity (along with electric and magnetic fields), and any devices that use electricity including electronics, telecommunications networks and electrical grids.  She can also conjure and shoot lightning.

Livewire can not go near [[water]] or she will short out.  While live-wired, she can store a vast amount of electricity, though it is not infinite and her electric powers do not work if she does not have a charge.  However. it doesn't take much for her to recharge.
