'''Livewire''' is a [[supervillainess]] in the [[DC Universe]]. She first appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Lori Petty]]. She appeared in the Superman comic books beginning in 2006.

==Fictional character history==
===Animated series===

'''Leslie Willis''' was once [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most controversial [[shock jock]]. No one was immune to her venomous words, not even [[Superman]]. She took great joy in bashing him, and [[Lex Luthor]] enjoyed listening to her every morning.

One evening during a severe [[thunderstorm]], Willis was hosting a [[rock concert]] in honor of her anniversary working at the radio station in Centennial Park in downtown Metropolis. Ignoring the public safety concerns by Metropolis authorities, and the changeable skies, Willis demanded the show to go on.

It was about that time Superman showed up to help the police. Willis' fans showed support for her by throwing stuff at the Man of Steel, when suddenly, lightning struck the stage, setting it on fire. When Superman pushed Willis to safety, he got struck in the process. The [[lightning]] ran through a wire on stage which Willis then stepped on, shocking Willis and changing her appearance.

When Willis woke up, she saw that her skin had turned ghostly white and her hair turned blue and stood on end. She blamed Superman for the injuries she had suffered from the accident she created. She was about to throw a clock-radio at the TV on which she had seen Superman talking to reporters about the accident when the radio suddenly turned on. It was not plugged into the wall, there were no batteries in it. She discovered she could manipulate [[electricity]].

Willis then escaped from the hospital by turning herself into an electric current. Confronting Superman, she had rearranged the electrons of the hospital gown she was wearing into a black [[leotard]] with a lightning bolt down the front and black boots. She then declared herself to now be Livewire, and took over the telephones, televisions, and billboards-effectively taking over all of media. However, Superman stopped her when he doused her with water.

She had a short-lived alliance with [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and later had an alliance with [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]].

[[Lori Petty]] voiced Livewire in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. [[Maria Canals Barrera]] voiced Livewire in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''. Her powers and appearance have striking similarities to the [[controversy|controversial]] "[[Superman Blue]]".

In [[Hereafter (Justice League episode)|an episode]] of the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, Livewire teamed up with the [[Superman Revenge Squad]] to get revenge on Superman. When some of its members were defeated and [[Toyman]]'s machine sent Superman into the future with them thinking that Superman is dead, [[Kalibak]] and Livewire later attacked the scene of the incident with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Volcana (DC Comics)|Volcana]], [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]], and [[Deadshot]]. When it came to Season 3 of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Livewire later returned as a member of [[Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]].

===Comics===
In ''Action Comics'' #835, [[Gail Simone]] and [[John Byrne]] brought Livewire into the mainstream [[DC Universe]], in the same tradition as [[Harley Quinn]].

Much like the DCAU version of Livewire, before she gained her abilities, she was also a shock jock. Going by the DJ name Leslie, her show was dedicated to bashing upon Superman every night, claiming that Superman was only saving people in the name of grandstanding and showing off. She also shows a disdain for fellow broadcaster Billy Batson, aka [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Her career as a shock jock was cut short when the owner of the station, Miguel, decided to turn the station into a country station (a reference to popular real-world shock jock, [[Howard Stern]], who lost his first DJ job in a similar fashion). Miguel was also quite pleased that she was fired because his wife was saved by Superman.

Unlike the DCAU version of Livewire, she was born with the gift of controlling electricity.  Enraged at the loss of her job, she went to the top of the station where she was struck by lightning. Absorbing a large amount of energy from the lightning bolt, her appearance changed to a chalk-white skin with blue hair. With that change, she decided that she would now take her revenge out on Superman.

Superman was still feeling weak from his battle with the [[Queen Of Fables]] in the previous issue, when he was attacked by Livewire. He realized he did not have the strength to fight her directly and defeated her by cunning, shorting out her powers.

===Helping to save the world===

In ''Action Comics'' #842, Livewire gets kidnapped along with most of the other Metahumans on Earth by a being dubbed the 'Auctioneer'. This being scours the universe looking for unique items to acquire (often by theft) before selling them to the highest bidder. Livewire's unique powers allow her, Superman and several other captives to escape their containment fields. She teams up with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], Superman, the Veteran, [[Blue Jay (comics)|Blue Jay]] and other heroes in fleeing their situation and gaining intelligence.

A dampening field provides a psychological barrier against utilizing their powers. With the help of [[Mister Terrific]], who communicates through Livewire's natural electricity, the field is soon neutralized.

During the escape attempt, Livewire accidentally creates a link between the makeshift team and every single television on Earth. This proves hard to shut off. In ''Action Comics'' 843, the team confronts the Auctioneer. With great difficulty, Livewire gains control over the being's communication systems. Under Superman's suggestions, they threaten to broadcast the Auctioneer's entire database to every alien system possible unless he agrees to release the heroes and leave the Earth alone. He reluctantly does so and returns everyone to Earth. The entire adventure was seen on every Earth TV and due to the Auctioneer selling the dramatic story rights, on many alien planets as well. 

During this story arc she also shows that she is physically attracted to Nightwing.

In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #51, Livewire is shown to be under the control of [[Starro]].

She recently caused a blackout of Gotham City.  However, she is easily defeated by [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl VI]], who was wearing an insulated [[Batsuit]].<ref>''Batgirl'' v2 (Jan 2010) #4</ref>

===DCAU based appearances===  

In the ''[[Superman Adventures]]'' comics, based on the DCAU animated series, Livewire makes an appearance in issue #5, "Balance of Power", the two-part "War Games" (#22-23) and in the two-part finale (#65-66), "Power Play", the latter also featuring featuring [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Darkseid]]. She is portrayed more sympathetically in the comics, teaming up with [[Professor Hamilton]] and putting all of her energy into stopping [[Brainiac]] in "War Games", which puts her into a coma until she awakens in "Power Play".

===Other versions===
The [[Elseworld]] story [[Superman: Red Son]] features Livewire as a product of [[Lex Luthor]]'s villains gallery to fight against Superman.

===Video Games===
Livewire appears as a boss in the ''[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]]'' video game, which was released in 2002 for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[PlayStation 2]] home consoles. Livewire is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

===Other TV Appearances===
In the opening of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'''s episode "Prey", there is a girl with the ability to control electric objects, like an [[MP3 player]] and a street light. She also has a pendant on her necklace in the shape of a lightning bolt.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Prey|series=Smallville|credits=Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson (writers) & Michael Rohl (director)|network=The CW|airdate=2008-10-23|season=8|number=6}}</ref>

On ''Smallville'', in the season 8 episode "Injustice", Leslie Willis aka Livewire, appeared with [[Parasite (comics)#Smallville|Parasite]], [[Neutron (DC Comics)#Smallville|Neutron]], and [[Plastique (comics)#Smalville|Plastique]], who form into a team of [[Injustice Gang|meteor freak rogues]] who search for [[Doomsday (comics)#Smallville|Davis Bloome]]. 
She and Neutron are quickly killed after they let Doomsday get away for the first time.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Injustice|series=Smallville|credits=Al Septien, Turi Meyer (writers) & Tom Welling (director)|network=The CW|airdate=2009-05-07|season=8|number=21}}</ref>  She was portrayed, although uncredited, by actress Anna Mae Routledge.

==Powers and abilities==
Livewire is a being of pure energy, able to transform into electricity (her skintight costume is made up of ionized air) and travel through anything that will conduct an electric current. She can externally manipulate electricity (along with electric and magnetic fields), and conjure lightning blasts of various intensities and lengths. In her electrical state, she can possess and control any devices along a grid that conduct electricity - notably, consumer electronics and telecommunications networks. Her lightning blasts can weaken or stun Superman. Also (as stated by Superman in ''Action Comics'' #843) Livewire has the ability to broadcast the energy she has stored in the form of a coherent signal (radio wave, etc.), without directing the energy at a target.

Livewire's main weakness is [[water]]. Even a small amount of water will cause her stored energy to go haywire. However, if she has enough power, she can survive being splashed without completely losing her powers and suffering only a minor drain. Livewire has to be drenched in water to suffer a major power loss.  She also has another weakness, [[silicon]] dust. When a large quantity of it has been spread all over her body, its electrical resistance properties would render her powerless.<ref>''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "Girls' Night Out"</ref>

While live-wired, she can store a vast amount of electricity, though it is not infinite. When drained of her electricity, she reverts to her solid form and cannot use most of her abilities or transform into living electricity until absorbing at least a minimal amount of [[electric power]] from some source. However, even when depowered, she can direct the flow of free electricity from an available energy source to re-power herself.

In the episode "[[Livewire (Superman: The Animated Series)|Livewire]]" of ''Superman: The Animated Series'', when she wanted to recharge her powers at a hydroelectric plant, Livewire displayed extraordinary strength by lifting one of the power units that stored electricity that she could drain.
