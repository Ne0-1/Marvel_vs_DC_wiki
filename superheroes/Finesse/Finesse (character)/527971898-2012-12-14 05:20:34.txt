'''Finesse''' is a fictional character appearing in comic books from [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Finesse first appeared in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #1 (June 2010) and was created by [[Christos Gage]] and [[Mike McKone]]. She appeared as a regular character in the series through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
Finesse's past is one not all too clear, as her parents were once criminals who trained under [[Taskmaster]], her ability of polymath manifested at a young age which stunted her emotional growth and social abilities, making her very unsociable at times. She was approached by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and accepted his offer, and in fact was a willing participant in his test, only making her better while giving Osborn what he wanted.

===Heroic Age===
Finesse is recruited into the [[Avengers Academy]] along with five other students who have been affected by Osborn.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] |artist=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]] |colorist=Cox, Jeremy |letterer=Cowles, Clayton | editor=Rosemann, Bill |story=Permanent Record |title=Avengers Academy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=June 2010 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>
Finesse blackmails [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] into training her the way [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] trained him.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] |artist=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]] |colorist=Cox, Jeremy |letterer=Caramagna, Joe | editor=Rosemann, Bill |story=Gifted & Talented |title=Avengers Academy |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=July 2010 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>
She figures out that she may, in fact, be the genetic daughter of [[Taskmaster]], but due to his position during [[Dark Reign]] all possible evidence has been deleted or sealed. They have a confrontation but no straight answer as the information of his "Photographic reflexes" overwrites his actual memories so he can't remember the previous day, let alone the year she was born, but knows it's a possibility. After a sparring session, so Taskmaster can remember her movements at least knowing she's possibly his child, they part ways.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] |penciller=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]] |inker=Buchman, Rebecca |colorist=Cox, Jeremy |letterer=Caramagna, Joe | editor=Rosemann, Bill |story=Teach Your Children |title=Avengers Academy |volume=1 |issue=9 |date=February 2011 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===Post-[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]===
Finesse became friends with [[X-23]] due to their lack of emotion.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #29</ref> Finesse also stood by X-23 when she opposed the X-Men locking their students on the Academy grounds during [[Avengers vs. X-Men]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #31</ref> However, their friendship took a turn for the worse when Jeremy Briggs tried to release a superhuman cure. After Briggs took out X-23 and tried to acid burn her, Finesse grabs X-23's arms and fatally stabs Briggs in the radial and femoral arteries, making him bleed to death.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #37</ref> X-23 first thought she killed him, but when she finds out it was Finesse, she was furious. X-23 agrees to keep Finesse's secret, but declares they are no longer friends, upsetting Finesse.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #39</ref>

===Future===
In a possible future it is shown that Finesse and Reptil have married, had a daughter and gotten divorced. It is revealed that she has lost her memory as well and only remembers things on movements. She divorced Reptil due to this as it was causing an emotional strain on both of them and their daughter and knew that having a child puts their child at risk of the same thing happening to them as her and her father.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' Vol.1 #25</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Finesse is a polymath since the age of five, which means she can learn a vast amount of knowledge at an accelerated rate - anything from languages, varied skills, fighting techniques, etc.
