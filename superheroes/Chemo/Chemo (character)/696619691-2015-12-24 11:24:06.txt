Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] noted "where would comic books be without those flukes, those accidents of fate which, although inexplicable to science, result in innocuous materials having a far-reaching impact on the world outside the laboratory?"<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Chemo was originally the [[nickname]] given to a plastic vessel used by scientist Ramsey Norton to contain the chemical by-products from his failed experiments. When Norton places the remnants of a failed growth formula in the vessel as his latest contribution, it accidentally brings the man-shaped vessel to life as "Chemo". After killing Norton, Chemo goes on a rampage until stopped by [[Will Magnus]]' [[robot]] team, the [[Metal Men]].<ref>''Metal Men'' #39 - 40 (July - Aug. & Sept. - Oct. 1962)</ref> Chemo regenerates and returns, but is defeated each time by the Metal Men.<ref>''Metal Men'' #14 (July 1965); #25 (May 1967) and #46 - 47 (July & Sept. 1976)</ref>

On one occasion, the Metal Men team with the hero [[Superman]] to defeat Chemo,<ref>''DC Comics Presents'' #4 (Dec. 1978)</ref> with the hero having another two encounters with the entity.<ref>''Superman'' #342 (Dec. 1979) and #370 (April 1982)</ref>

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', villains [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] and [[Lex Luthor]] use Chemo as a living weapon on [[Earth-4]]. Chemo destroys the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of [[New York City]] and kills [[Aquagirl]] by releasing large quantities of [[toxic]] chemicals into the ocean. The entity is dispersed and neutralized when the heroine [[Valentina Vostok|Negative Woman]] shatters Chemo's plastic shell.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earth'' #9 - 10 (Dec. 1985 - Jan. 1986)</ref>

During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s incarnation of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] employs the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] to use Chemo as a living weapon by dropping the entity onto the city of [[Blüdhaven]]. Covering the city with [[toxic waste]], Chemo kills hundreds of thousands of people but is stopped when Superman throws the entity into deep space.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1 - 7 (Dec. 2005 - June 2006)</ref>

During the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' storyline, Chemo is retrieved and used as a weapon by fellow villains the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] whilst on a prison planet.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #1 - 7 (Nov. 2007 – June 2008)</ref> Rogue [[New Gods]] visiting the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] capture a trio of multicolored miniature versions of Chemo. Superman follows the true Chemo and discovers it to be a [[LexCorp]] project.<ref>''Superman'' #663 (July 2007)</ref>

In "[[The New 52]]" (a reboot of the DC Comics universe) during the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, a flashback sequence reveals Chemo is created when a prototype responsometer created by Will Magnus is thrown into a vat of chemicals by a thief. The Metal Men fought Chemo to protect Will Magnus and the local population, and while successful were apparently also destroyed.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #28(April 2014)</ref>
