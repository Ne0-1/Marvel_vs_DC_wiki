==Fictional character biography==
Chemo was originally the [[nickname]] given to a plastic vessel used by scientist Ramsey Norton to contain the chemical by-products from his failed experiments. When Norton places the remnants of a failed growth formula in the vessel, it accidentally brings the man-shaped vessel to life as "Chemo". After killing Norton, Chemo goes on a rampage until stopped by the [[robot]] team, the [[Metal Men]].<ref>''Metal Men'' #39 - 40 (July - Aug. & Sept. - Oct. 1962)</ref> Chemo regenerates and returns, but is defeated each time by the Metal Men.<ref>''Metal Men'' #14 (July 1965); #25 (May 1967) and #46 - 47 (July & Sept. 1976)</ref>
