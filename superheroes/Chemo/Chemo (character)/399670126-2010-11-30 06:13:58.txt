==Fictional character biography==
Chemo was originally a 25 foot tall vaguely man-shaped plastic vessel built by eccentric scientist Ramsey Norton, to contain the chemical by-products from his failed experiments.  Chemo was supposed to motivate Norton; it represented his research failures, which would defiantly overcome someday.

After attempting to create a growth formula that will enlarge plants to help feed starving nations, the scientist again is unsuccessful and pours the remnants of his project into Chemo, finally filling the massive vessel. These chemicals cause a massive reaction that results in Chemo coming to life and growing into a building-sized giant. Chemo proceeds to poison the scientist with a lethal dose of the growth-formula chemicals, and then goes on a rampage, only to be defeated by the robotic [[Metal Men]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Chemo proves to be an impressively resilient monster.  It is apparently incapable of being killed.  It returns time and time again, undergoing various resurrections and mutations, and has several more encounters with the Metal Men as well as squaring off against [[Superman]] more than once. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', [[Brainiac (comics)| Brainiac]] and [[Lex Luthor]] use Chemo as a living weapon stationed on Earth-4. Chemo proceeds to destroy much of that earth's New York City and kills [[Aquagirl]] by spewing more than a dozen varieties of corrosive acids into the ocean. It is finally destroyed when [[Valentina Vostok| Negative Woman]] uses her energy powers to shatter Chemo's living plastic shell.

After the Crisis, Chemo is resurrected and fights against a variety of superheroes, including its old enemies the Metal Men, Superman, and [[Supergirl]]. It has also fought with Superman as part of the [[Suicide Squad]] formed by President Lex Luthor to break [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] out of his prison at the [[Justice League|JLA]] Watchtower teleporters. 

===Infinite Crisis===
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}

[[Secret Society of Super Villains#3rd Formation|The Society]] has the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] acquire Chemo and they used Chemo as a living chemical weapon by dropping him onto the city of [[Blüdhaven]], killing hundreds of thousands of people. [[Dick Grayson]] (Nightwing) had agreed with [[Deathstroke]] for the 72 hours of ceasefire in Blüdhaven in exchange for staying away from [[Rose Wilson|Rose]]. However, Chemo is dropped before the 34th hour. Chemo bathes the entire city in radiation and toxic waste. All able-bodied superheroes attempt to save the infected, but Chemo quickly reforms itself. [[Superman]] battles the monster with the plan that he would regenerate quicker as the battle ensued. While Chemo regenerates, he continues to suck the toxins and radiation out of the city, cleansing the city of the remaining radiation and waste. In the end, Superman lifts Chemo and throws him into outer space.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #4</ref>

===One Year Later===
Later appearing in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders - Five of a Kind]]: Nightwing/Captain Boomerang'', Chemo is encountered in space by Nightwing and [[Owen Mercer]] on a mission from Batman.

On the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Chemo as a member of the latest [[Injustice League]].

===Salvation Run===
In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' limited series, Chemo is seen being transported to the Prison Planet.<ref>[[Salvation Run]] #2</ref> [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] use Chemo to destroy a burrowing [[Kraken]]-like creature that attacks the villains.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>Salvation Run #3</ref>

==Baby Chemos==
In ''Superman'' #663, rogue [[New Gods]] acting as "superheroes" in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] capture a trio of multicolored "baby Chemos", miniature versions of the monster that Superman traces back to an abandoned [[LexCorp]] warehouse. [[Lana Lang]] explains that the new Chemos were constructed from samples obtained from the ruins of Blüdhaven and assures Superman that they are merely one of many clandestine LexCorp projects that were hidden by [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] from his successors. The Chemos are last seen in the custody of the young New Gods; their fate is unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Chemo has superhuman strength, endurance and some resistance to physical and energy attacks. It can alter its height from 25' to over 100' and spew acid hundreds of feet at a target. It is sentient to a degree, but its intelligence is limited.

==Other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Metamorphosis" Pt. 2, [[Metamorpho]]'s vengeance on [[Simon Stagg]] resulted in the creation of a synthoid (vocal effects are done by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) that is based on Chemo. On a related note, a promo for the original pilot episode (viewable on disc four of the ''Justice League'' Season 1 box set) briefly features Chemo battling the [[Martian Manhunter]].|

* Chemo appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Journey to the Center of the Bat" with his vocal effects done by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0901/16/index.htm]</ref> Under the orders of [[Brain (comics)|The Brain]], Chemo attacks the sea and ends up in a fight with [[Batman]] and [[Aquaman]]. Batman ended up getting some of his phyllosilicates into him causing [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]] and Aquaman to go into his body and destroy the chemical compounds. While they are doing that, Batman tries to stop Chemo from getting to the offshore oil platform. After defeating the Navy, Chemo steals and devours a nuclear missile as Brain makes a transmission for the people to surrender. Batman ejects from his Batboat before Chemo eats it. As Chemo attacks [[Bialya]], Batman heads into him and eliminates the missile which breaks up Chemo. In "Clash of the Metal Men," Batman is seen fighting Chemo until he is assisted by the Metal Men who help to defeat Chemo.
