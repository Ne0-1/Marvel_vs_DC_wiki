'''David Linus "Microchip" Lieberman''' (often known as '''Micro''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], he first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' #4 (Nov. 1987) as an ally of [[Punisher|The Punisher]] for many years.<ref>{{cite book |title= Comic book heroes of the screen|last= Schoell|first= William|year= 1991|publisher= Carol Pub. Group|ISBN= 0-80651-252-0|page=155}}</ref>  He assisted the Punisher by building weapons, supplying technology and providing friendship, though in more recent publications, Microchip gradually evolved from the Punisher's friend to a bitter villain.

==Fictional character biography==
David Linus "Microchip" Lieberman was a legendary computer hacker in the early days of the hacking business, performing numerous scams and hacks still held in awe today, until one scam brought him too close to real-world criminals forcing him to go into "retirement" as a quiet unassuming businessman. This ended when his nephew, attempting to follow in his favorite uncle's footsteps, was caught and killed after accidentally hacking into the private computers of Wilson Fisk (a.k.a., The [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]). While personally investigating his nephew's murder, Lieberman met and started collaborating with The [[Punisher]]. Microchip's help proved invaluable to Castle; he served not just as a hacker and cyber-investigator.  Micro also helped Castle: manage and launder his finances (i.e., the money Castle takes from the criminals he kills); set-up and equip Castle's safehouses; train Castle in more "specialized" skills for his war on crime; and, obtain hard-to-get ammunition and equipment. Less obsessed with Castle's personal war, Microchip acts as a de facto counseler to Castle (e.g., encouraging Castle to take occasional vacations and breaks, to avoid burn-out or losing his mind).

Over time more of his past history is revealed. His father had been forced to create weapons against his will well before Microchip was born; in the same issue he mentions his sister is a happy housewife in Ft. Lauderdale.<ref>"The Punisher" #46 (1991)</ref> Micro has an illegitimate son named Louis Frohike. Louis is killed while trying to assist Frank Castle in a hostage exchange.<ref>"Punisher" Vol 2 #9 (1988)</ref>

Micro is capable of fighting on his own, such as when he took on an assassination ring threatening his godson's family.<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #1 (1998)</ref> He also takes on less violent crime. When he discovers his new neighbor is being scammed by a 'charity' he destroys it from within, not by violence but by computer trickery, sending a recording of the administrator's plans to fans of yodeling music.<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #3 (1990)</ref>

Despite everything, he has always considered his weight a problem. At one point he signs himself into a 'fat camp', though it goes unexpectedly as it turns out the administrators are dealing speed.<ref>"The Punisher" Annual 4 (1991)</ref>

Micro loses his left pinky finger when the Kingpin sends it to Frank as part of a blackmail attempt. He is let free from the Kingpin's custody when the arranged deal (Frank slaying a rival gangster) is accomplished.<ref>"The Punisher" #53 (October 1991)</ref>

===The Punisher War Zone===
The Punisher's 1992 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] entitled ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' was launched, written by [[Chuck Dixon]] and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr.]]. The first issues included character arcs for Micro, where Linus goes so far as to see a [[psychiatrist]] and take up acting in [[theatre]] as part of his therapy. After Castle discovers this, the two have a disagreement and Micro goes into hiding, working as a barman.

Microchip develops a friendship with [[Mickey Fondozzi]], a Mafia soldier whom Frank recruits to his side. The two work on operations together, such as infiltrating the [[Secret Empire]], a multi-faceted criminal organization.<ref>''Daredevil'' #307-309; ''Nomad'' #4-6; ''Punisher War Journal'' #46-48</ref> 

After the Punisher's seeming death in attacking a criminal meet-up, Microchip and Mickey find themselves literally on the street, their escape vehicle surrounded by police. When Microchip refuses to destroy the vehicle, as it would kill innocent cops, Mickey abandons him.<ref>''Punisher War Zone'' #23 (Jan. 1994)</ref>

===Death===
Ultimately, Castle and Micro have one final fallout just before the cancellation of all three major Punisher titles in 1995. This fight comes to an end in the closing issues of ''The Punisher War Journal''. Micro disagrees with Castle's methods, feeling that Castle has lost sight of their original goals and has gone over the edge. Soon after, Micro then tries to replace Castle with a new handpicked "Punisher", former Navy Seal Carlos Cruz. Micro and Castle come face to face in one of Micro's safehouses in what appears to be a final confrontation. A gun battle ensues between the two former partners. This battle is interrupted by rogue [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Derek "Stone Cold" Smalls, who had been part of a program to take down vigilante groups and had himself gone vigilante. Smalls fires a rocket into the safe house, killing Microchip. Castle moves on, unsure if he would have really slain Microchip himself.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol 1 #79 (June 1995)</ref>

===Dark Reign===
During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] brings Microchip back from the dead and offers to bring his son back to life if he helps in dealing with the Punisher.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 7 #4-5</ref> Microchip sends [[Megatak]] to attack Punisher's hacker ally Henry.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 7 #8</ref> To start off Hood's revival ritual of Castle's and Microchip's family, Microchip shoots [[G. W. Bridge|G.W. Bridge]] in the head. Unfortunately the Punisher refuses to help and threatens to use [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] to burn them alive. The death of Bridge does reanimate the corpses. The Punisher, believing that his family is not actually present, forces Firebrand to destroy the bodies, then kills the villain. <ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 7 #10 (December 2009)</ref>

===In the Blood===
In the ''[[Punisher: In the Blood]]'' mini-series, the Punisher returns to New York City and vows to find Microchip and make him pay for murdering G.W. Bridge. Microchip is knocked unconscious by [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]].<ref>''Punisher: In the Blood'' #1</ref> While Microchip is captive in Jigsaw's warehouse mansion, he is visited by [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]], who is the Punisher's old ally. Stuart explains his girlfriend was killed by the Punisher and swears to make him accountable, but his revenge failed. Stuart walks away and tells him that the Punisher is coming.<ref>''Punisher: In the Blood'' #2</ref> When the Punisher is captured, Jigsaw allows him to kill Microchip by slashing his throat. Jigsaw's son [[Henry Russo]] learned his father was manipulating the Punisher and helps him to escape.<ref>''Punisher: In the Blood'' #4</ref>

== Other versions ==

=== Crossovers ===
Microchip accompanies the Punisher to [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]] in ''[[Archie Meets the Punisher]]'', and to [[Gotham City]] in ''Punisher and Batman''; in the latter, he is narrowly bested by [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in a "hacking duel".<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Batton Lash|penciller = Stan Goldberg and John Buscema|inker = Tom Palmer|colorist = Barry Grossman|letterer = Jack Morelli|editor = Don Daley|story = When Worlds Collide|title = Archie Meets the Punisher|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = August 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Christie Scheele|letterer = Richard Starkings|editor = Don Daley|story = Deadly Knights|title = Punisher and Batman|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = October 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

=== Marvel MAX ===
In the Punisher: MAX universe Microchip has been presumed dead for some time. However he returns to attempt to pressure Castle into working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] [[black ops]] unit to participate in the hunt for terrorists (e.g. [[Osama bin Laden]]). The Punisher declines, as he prefers his autonomy to indentured service to an institution such as the government. Microchip confesses to Castle that the source of funding for the operation came from the CIA funneling arms and [[heroin]] out of [[Afghanistan]]. Castle gives Micro a chance he has not given his victims since before he officially assumed the role of the Punisher: the chance to run. Microchip declines, obligated to help Castle in a CIA/[[Mafia]] firefight. Taking a possibly mortal injury in the fight, Micro attempts to humanize Castle again, only to be met with a point-blank shotgun round to the head.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 5 #6</ref><ref name = "MGN"> {{cite book|author = Robert G.

=== Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe ===
Microchip, here a former member of the [[United States Air Force]] who was "kicked out" after [[Doctor Octopus]] ripped his legs off, is partnered with the Punisher by Kesselring, a superhuman-hating multi-millionaire who has convinced the Punisher to kill all the world's heroes and villains. Before going after his last target, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], the Punisher tells Microchip, "Last kill, Micro. You get some distance. Don't look back. You've got any sense, you'll find something else to do with that brain of yours. Something worth a damn." Microchip's response is a deadpan, "Are you telling me to get a life?"<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Doug Braithwaite|inker = Robin Riggs, Sean Hardy, Don Hudson, Michael Halblieb, Martin Griffith, and John Livesay|colorist = Tom Smith and Shannon Blanchard|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Marc McLaurin|title = The Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = November 1995|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

=== Space: Punisher ===
Microchip's equivalent is Chip, a robot the Punisher built to aid him in his vendetta against the [[The Hand (comics)|Six-Fingered Hand]]. When the Punisher confronts a group of renegade [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], the true leaders of the Six-Fingered Hand, the entities destroy Chip, though the Punisher is able to escape with his companion's decapitated head, the face of which he is revealed to have modeled after his murdered son's.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Frank Tieri|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Mark Texeira|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Ellie Pyle and Rachel Pinnelas|title = Space: Punisher|volume = 1|issue = #1-4|date = 11 July 2012 - 10 October 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

=== What If? Age of Ultron ===
The events of [[Age of Ultron]] caused one universe's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to drop dead while fighting the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]], which slaughtered the rest of that world's superpowered humans with the assistance of other [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] monsters. Microchip appears as a member of [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], a group consisting of Earth's remaining non-powered heroes who have holed up in [[Latveria]]'s Castle Doom. After filling a Quinjet with everything in the late [[Doctor Doom]]'s armory, Microchip and the other Defenders, sans Fury and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], sacrifice themselves in a [[kamikaze]] attack against the Midgard Serpent, giving Black Widow the opportunity to acquire [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], become the new Thor, and kill the Serpent.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Joe Keatinge|penciller = Mico Suayan and Raffaele Ienco|inker = Mico Suayan and Raffaele Ienco|colorist = Jean-Francois Beaulieu|letterer = Joe Sabino|editor = Jon Moisan|title = What If?
