'''Linus "Microchip" Lieberman''' (often known as ''Micro'') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], he first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' #4 (Nov. 1987) as an ally of [[Punisher|The Punisher]] for many years. He assisted the Punisher by building weapons, supplying technology and providing friendship. Micro served as a cross between [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], from the [[James Bond]] novels and films and [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the loyal butler of [[Batman]].

==Plot==
Most Punisher/Micro storylines followed the same outline. The Punisher selected (or was selected by) a criminal. The Punisher would then request the correct technology for the job, and Micro would quibble over the inherent danger of the job. Ultimately, he would provide the Punisher with what he needs, and the Punisher would then visit his brand of justice upon the villain. 

===The Punisher War Zone===
The Punisher's 1992 spin-off title, ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' was launched with [[Chuck Dixon]] writing and [[John Romita, Jr.]] penciling, and later turned into an out-of-continuity anthology. The first issues included character arcs for Micro, where Linus goes so far as to see a [[psychiatrist]] and take up acting in [[theatre]] as part of his therapy. After Castle discovers this, the two have a disagreement and Micro goes into hiding, working as a barman.

===Death===
Ultimately, Castle and Micro had one final fall out just before the cancellation of all three major Punisher titles in 1995. This fight came to an end in the closing issues of ''The Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 1). Micro had a falling out with Castle due to their disagreements over his methods, his feeling that Castle had lost sight of their original goals, and that Castle had gone over the edge. Soon after, Micro then tried to replace Castle with a new  handpicked "Punisher", former Navy Seal, Carlos Cruz. Micro and Castle eventually came face to face in one of Micro's safehouses in what appeared to be a final confrontation. A gun battle ensued between the two former partners. In the midst of this battle, Micro appeared to die at the hands of rogue [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent "Stone Cold". Castle moved on, showing no remorse over the apparent demise of his former friend, noting that if Stone Cold had not finished Microchip off, he would have.

==MAX==
[[Garth Ennis]], writing ''The Punisher'' adults-only ''[[Marvel MAX]]'' title, brought back the presumed-dead Microchip, who now attempts to pressure Castle into working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] [[black ops]] unit and join the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]]. The Punisher declines, as he prefers his autonomy to indentured service to an institution such as the government. Castle later learns Microchip is now part of a scheme involving the CIA funneling arms and [[heroin]] out of [[Afghanistan]]. Most damningly, Microchip knows of the heroin connection. Castle gives Micro a chance he almost never gives anyone: the chance to run. Microchip declines, thinking that his history and past friendship will protect him from Castle's wrath, and the two cooperate in a CIA/[[Mafia]] firefight. Taking a possibly mortal injury in the fight, Micro afterward tries to explain his previous actions, but by then Castle had rescinded the offer to run, and kills him with a point-blank shotgun round to the head.
