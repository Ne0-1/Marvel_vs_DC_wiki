'''Linus "Microchip" Lieberman''' (often known as ''Micro'') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by writer [[Mike Baron ]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], he first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)]]'' #4 (Nov. 1987) as an ally of [[The Punisher]] for many years. He assisted the Punisher by building weapons, supplying technology and providing friendship. Micro served as a cross between [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], from the [[James Bond]] novels and films, and [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the loyal butler of [[Batman]].

==Plot==

Most Punisher/Micro storylines followed the same outline. The Punisher selected (or was selected by) a criminal. The Punisher would then request the correct technology for the job, and Micro would quibble over the inherent danger of the job.  Ultimately, he would provide the Punisher with what he needs, and the Punisher would then visit his brand of justice upon the villain. 

==Punisher War Zone==

The Punisher's 1992 spin-off title, ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' was launched with [[Chuck Dixon]] writing and [[John Romita Jr.]] penciling, and later turned into an out-of-continuity anthology. The first issues included character arcs for Micro, where Linus goes so far as to see a [[psychiatrist]] and take up acting in [[theatre]] as part of his therapy. After Castle discovers this, the two have a disagreement and Micro goes into hiding, working as a barman.

==Death==

Ultimately, Castle and Micro had one final fall out just before the cancellation of all three major Punisher titles in 1995. This fight came to an end in the closing issues of ''The Punisher War Journal'' (vol.1). Micro had a falling out with Castle due to their disagreements over his methods, his feeling that Castle had lost sight of their original goals, and that Castle had gone over the edge. Soon after, Micro then tried to replace Castle with a new  handpicked "Punisher", former Navy Seal, Carlos Cruz. Micro and Castle eventually came face to face in one of Micro's safehouses in what appeared to be a final confrontation. A gun battle ensued between the two former partners. In the midst of this battle, Micro appeared to die at the hands of a rogue [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sudden Death (comics)|Sudden Death]]. Castle moved on, showing no remorse over the apparent demise of his former friend, noting that if Sudden Death had not finished Microchip off, he would have.

==MAX==

[[Garth Ennis]], writing ''The Punisher'' adults-only ''[[Marvel MAX]]'' title, brought back the presumed-dead Microchip, who now attempts to pressure Castle into working for the [[CIA]]'s [[black ops]] unit and join the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]]. The Punisher declines, and learns Microchip is now part of a scheme involving the CIA, funneling arms and [[heroin]] out of [[Afghanistan]]. Rather than killing Microchip outright, Castle gives him the opportunity to run, but Microchip declines. Although he subsequently backs Castle during a CIA/[[Mafia]] firefight and afterward tries to explain his previous actions, Castle kills him with a point-blank shotgun round to the head.

==In other media==
*Although not actually seen, Microchip can be heard talking with the Punisher in the [[Spider-Man (video game)|Spider-Man]] for the Playstation.
*Microchip also appeared with The Punisher in the 1990's Spider-Man cartoon on [[Fox Kids]]. His nickname was Chip, rather than Micro, and he tended to act as Frank's conscience, urging him to use the non-lethal weaponry. He was voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]].
*Microchip also had a [[cameo]] in the side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] ''[[Punisher computer and video games|The Punisher]]'', in continue screen giving the Punisher [[CPR]].
