'''David Linus "Microchip" Lieberman''' (often known as '''Micro''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].

Group|ISBN= 0-80651-252-0|page=155}}</ref>  He assisted the Punisher by building weapons, supplying technology and providing friendship, though in more recent publications, Microchip gradually evolved from the Punisher's friend to a bitter villain.

==Fictional character biography==
David Linus "Microchip" Lieberman was a legendary computer hacker in the early days of the hacking business, performing numerous scams and hacks still held in awe today, until one scam brought him too close to real-world criminals forcing him to go into "retirement" as a quiet unassuming businessman. This ended when his nephew, attempting to follow in his favorite uncle's footsteps, was caught and killed after accidentally hacking into the private computers of Wilson Fisk (a.k.a., The [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]). While personally investigating his nephew's murder, Lieberman met and started collaborating with The [[Punisher]]. Microchip's help proved invaluable to Castle; he served not just as a hacker and cyber-investigator.  Micro also helped Castle: manage and launder his finances (i.e., the money Castle takes from the criminals he kills); set-up and equip Castle's safehouses; train Castle in more "specialized" skills for his war on crime; and, obtain hard-to-get ammunition and equipment. Less obsessed with the Castle's personal war, Microchip also acted as a de facto counseler to Castle (e.g., encouraging Castle to take occasional vacations and breaks, to avoid burn-out or losing his mind).

Over time more of his past history was revealed. His father had been forced to create weapons against his will well before Microchip was born; in the same issue he mentions his sister is a happy housewife in Ft. Lauderdale. <ref>"The Punisher" #46 (1991)</ref> Micro has an illegitimate son named Louis Frohike. Louis is killed while trying to assist Frank Castle in a hostage exchange. <ref>"Punisher" Vol 2 #9 (1988)</ref>

Micro is capable of fighting on his own, such as when he took on an assassination ring threatening his godson's family.<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #1 (1998)</ref> He also takes on less violent crime. When he discovers his new neighbor is being scammed by a 'charity' he destroys it from within, not by violence but by computer trickery. This ultimately sends a recording of the administrator's plans to fans of yodeling music.<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #3 (1990)</ref>

Despite everything, he has always considered his weight a problem. At one point he signs himself into a 'fat camp', though it goes unexpectedly as the administrators ran speed. <ref>"The Punisher" Annual 4 (1991)</ref>

Later he loses his left pinky finger when the Kingpin sends it to Frank as part of a blackmail attempt. He is let free from the Kingpin's custody when the arranged deal (Frank slaying a rival gangster) is accomplished. <ref>"The Punisher" #53 (October 1991)</ref>

===The Punisher War Zone===
The Punisher's 1992 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] entitled ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' was launched, written by [[Chuck Dixon]] and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr.]]. It later turned into an out-of-continuity anthology. The first issues included character arcs for Micro, where Linus goes so far as to see a [[psychiatrist]] and take up acting in [[theatre]] as part of his therapy. After Castle discovers this, the two have a disagreement and Micro goes into hiding, working as a barman.

Microchip develops a friendship with [[Mickey Fondozzi]], a Mafia soldier whom Frank recruits to his side. The two work on operations together, such as infiltrating the [[Secret Empire]], a multi-faceted criminal organization.<ref>''Daredevil'' #307-309; ''Nomad'' #4-6; ''Punisher War Journal'' #46-48</ref> 

After the Punisher's seeming death in attacking a criminal meet-up, Microchip and Mickey find themselves literally on the street, their escape vehicle surrounded by police. When Microchip refuses to destroy the vehicle, as it would kill innocent cops, Mickey abandons him.<ref>''Punisher War Zone'' #23 (Jan. 1994)</ref>

===Apparent death===
Ultimately, Castle and Micro had one final fallout just before the cancellation of all three major Punisher titles in 1995. This fight came to an end in the closing issues of ''The Punisher War Journal'' Micro had a falling out with Castle due to their disagreements over his methods, his feeling that Castle had lost sight of their original goals and had gone over the edge. Soon after, Micro then tried to replace Castle with a new handpicked "Punisher", former Navy Seal Carlos Cruz. Micro and Castle eventually came face to face in one of Micro's safehouses in what appeared to be a final confrontation. A gun battle ensued between the two former partners. This battle was interrupted by rogue [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Derek "Stone Cold" Smalls, who had been part of a program to take down vigilante groups and had himself gone vigilante. Smalls fires a rocket into the safe house, killing Microchip. Castle later moves on, unsure if he would have really slain Microchip himself.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol 1 #79 (June 1995)</ref>

===Dark Reign===
During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] brings Microchip back from the dead and offers to bring his nephew back to life if he helps in dealing with the Punisher.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 7 #4-5</ref> Microchip later sends [[Megatak]] to attack Punisher's hacker ally Henry.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 7 #8</ref> To start off Hood's revival ritual upon the Castle family after Punisher was captured, Microchip shoots [[G. W. Bridge|G.W. Bridge]] in the head to resurrect Microchip and Punisher's families. Unfortunately the Punisher refuses and threatening [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] to burn them alive leaving Microchip loss to his son.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 7 #10</ref>

In the Punisher: MAX universe Microchip has been presumed dead for some time. However he returns to attempt to pressure Castle into working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] [[black ops]] unit to participate in the hunt for terrorists (e.g. [[Osama bin Laden]]). The Punisher declines, as he prefers his autonomy to indentured service to an institution such as the government. Microchip confesses to Castle that the source of funding for the operation came from the CIA funneling arms and [[heroin]] out of [[Afghanistan]]. Castle gives Micro a chance he has not given his victims since before he officially assumed the role of the Punisher: the chance to run.
