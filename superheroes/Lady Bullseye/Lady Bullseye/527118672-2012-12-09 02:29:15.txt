'''Lady Bullseye''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}.  A female counterpart of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], she was created by [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Marko Djurdjevic]], and [[Clay Mann]], first appearing in ''Daredevil'' #111.

==Creation==
Lady Bullseye was inspired by [[Lady Snowblood]], a Japanese [[femme fatale]].<ref name="enterladybullseye">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.4804.Daredevil~colon~_Enter_Lady_Bullseye|title=Daredevil: Enter Lady Bullseye|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|date=2008-09-05 |publisher=Marvel.com|accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Japan]], the young girl (it has not been revealed whether Maki Matsumoto is her birth name, or an assumed one) who would become Lady Bullseye was imprisoned by the [[Yakuza]], who planned to sell her and many others into sexual slavery.  However, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], on an unrelated errand, arrived to slaughter the mobsters.  The sight of Bullseye effortlessly killing her captors inspired the girl to escape and become a killer.<ref>''Daredevil #111''</ref>

Years later, now in the employ of [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]], the famous ninja order, she arrives in New York, to take the lead in Hand ninja-lord Hiroshi's plan. However, she has demonstrated little tolerance for the Hand's ritual, interrupting some in order to catch her enemies, who are used to those traditions, off-guard. She kills and resurrects both [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]] and [[Black Tarantula]] to assist her.<ref>''Daredevil #112-114''</ref>

At the same time, it has been revealed that in her civilian guise she is a lawyer, targeting [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] by assisting the parents of Murdock's mentally-ill wife [[Milla Donovan]] in gaining custody of her. When one of her associates discovers this, she kills him to prevent the Hand from learning the truth. Hiroshi claims that all she has done has been according to his will. Lady Bullseye offers Daredevil the leadership of the Hand, which he refuses. The organization regroups to [[Spain]], preparing to initiate "Plan B".  There, she finds [[The Kingpin]], trying to live a normal civilian life, and killing his new girlfriend and her kids, and brutally stabbing Kingpin, telling him that this is a message for Matt Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil #114-116''</ref>

It turns out that Matsumoto's real goal was to take the leadership of the Hand herself, something she had been promised by Daredevil's ally [[Master Izo]], who was revealed to have trained her. However, Izo was lying, and instead intended for Daredevil himself to take that post and reform the Hand. This occurring, Daredevil had Lady Bullseye cast out of the Hand for being untrustworthy. Angry, she vowed to kill Izo.<ref>''Daredevil'' #500''</ref>

Subsequently, she is shown to now be allied with the Kingpin against Daredevil, instigating a conflict between Daredevil and [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], which ultimately leads to Daredevil declaring Hell's Kitchen the territory of the Hand.<ref>''Dark Reign - The List: Daredevil'' #1, ''Daredevil'' #501-504</ref>

She was hired by an as yet unknown party to temporarily injure [[Pepper Potts]] with a compressed air rifle.<ref>''Black Widow'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Bullseye has no apparent superhuman powers, but is a master of several martial arts, and has been shown proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and using both a katana and shuriken. It has been noted that she is faster than both Bullseye and the Kingpin. However she is also less powerful. Daredevil has commented that in her costumed form she has little scent and a very level pulse, akin to one performing [[yoga]]. She is also skilled in legal matters, being a lawyer in her civilian guise.<ref>''Daredevil #113''</ref>

==Other versions==
===Daredevil Noir===
Lady Bullseye appears as a caucasian woman called '''Eliza'''. She is an operative of the Kingpin, and a lover of a rival crime lord called O'Halloran. <ref>Daredevil Noir #1-4</ref>
