'''Lady Bullseye''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]].  A distaff counterpart of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], she was created by [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Marko Djurdjevic]], and [[Clay Mann]], first appearing in ''Daredevil'' #111.

==Fictional character biography==

Born in [[Japan]], the young girl (it has not been revealed whether Maki Matsumoto is her birth name, or an assumed one) who would become Lady Bullseye was imprisoned by the [[Yakuza]], who planned to sell her and many others into sexual slavery.  However, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], on an unrelated errand, arrived to slaughter the mobsters.  The sight of Bullseye effortlessly killed her captors inspired the girl to escape and become a killer.<ref>''Daredevil #111''</ref>

Years later, now in the employ of [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]], the famous ninja order, she arrives in New York, to take the lead in Hand ninja-lord Hiroshi's as yet unknown plan.  However, she has demonstrated little tolerance for the Hand's ritual, interrupting some in order to catch her enemies, who are used to those traditions, off-guard.  She kills and resurrects both [[Angela Del Toro|White Tiger]] and [[Black Tarantula]] to assist her.<ref>''Daredevil #112-114''</ref>

At the same time, it has been revealed that in her civilian guise she is a lawyer, targetting [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] by aiding the parents of Murdock's mentally-ill wife [[Milla Donovan]] gain custody of her.  When one of her associates discovers this, she kills him to prevent the Hand from learning the truth.  Her true agenda is, as yet, unknown.<ref>''Daredevil #114''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Lady Bullseye has no apparent superhuman powers, but is a master of several martial arts, and has been shown proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and using both a katana and shuriken.  Daredevil has commented that in her costumed form she has little scent and a very level pulse, akin to one performing [[yoga]].<ref>''Daredevil #113''</ref>
