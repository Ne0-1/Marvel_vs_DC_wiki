'''Doc Samson''' (Dr. '''Leonard Samson''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] and [[psychiatrist]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Leonard Samson was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. After Robert Bruce Banner was temporarily cured of being the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Samson—who had been working on Banner/Hulk in his job as a psychiatrist—exposed himself to some of the siphoned radiation, causing his hair to become green and granting him superhuman strength proportionate to its length, reminiscent of his biblical [[Samson|namesake]]. His power level has since stabilized to the point that it doesn't matter how long his hair is. Shortly afterward, his flirting with [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]] caused Banner to re-expose himself to radiation, becoming the Hulk once more to beat up Samson.

Feeling guilty about this, Samson would spend much time working with Banner over the years, eventually realising that he was suffering from [[Dissociative identity disorder|Multiple Personality Disorder]]. To "cure" this, he hypnotised Banner with the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s help and successfully began the process of integrating their personalities. This got beyond his control, however, leading to a somewhat unstable merger which eventually fragmented once more into a third personality, albeit a more benign one than the previous Hulks.

With a patch on his eye, Doc Samson was also a part of Bruce Jones' run on the Hulk, with one of the main characters Jones introduced supposed to be his ex-wife

In addition to the Hulk, his most prominent patient, Samson has also spent time in a professional capacity with the second [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the [[Molecule Man]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[The Punisher]] among others.

In 1996 Doc Samson starred in his first, Dan Slott written [[mini-series]].

In 2006, he Samson starred in his second mini-series written by Paul Di Fillipo and penciled by Fabrizio Fiorentino, featuring 4 light-hearted stories. Befriended by Dr Strange's new pupil Jack Holoyak, Doc Samson helped his friends' daughter Tina Punnett rescue her new age hippi parents from dealing with a ghost of musician Cam Larson guarded by Living Totem. Searching for his friend Sam Laroquette Doc Samson along with Living Totem, Tina and Jack arrives at new age cultist doctor Arick Schnellageister's farm where they all fight Steven King-inspired nightmarish Weed. The third issue was written by Jay Faeber and it shows Samson helps the new Scorpion come clean after being implied to have killed SHIELD agents. The final two-parter was a storyline involving Nightmare from a different dimension sending the alternate Doc Samson to help him invade the regular 616 Marvel Universe. Those last two issues had Frank Rocketo Espinoza's short Living Totem stories as back up

He has recently appeared in ''She-Hulk'' #8, and treated [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #469. In that issue, he also had a discussion with [[Valerie Cooper]], regarding her and the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E*]] organization taping his session with Rachel, even though he asked her not to. Samson is currently seen as part of [[Iron Man]] pro side in [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] at the end of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #533. When last seen, he was giving the each member of the [[X-Factor Investigations]] a session after a particularly troubling mission.

== Powers and abilities ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2006}}
Doc Samson possesses superhuman physical abilities as a result of exposure to high levels of [[gamma radiation]]. While Samson wasn't exposed to as great a dosage as the [[Hulk]] or the [[Abomination]], Samson is superhumanly strong, his being nearly equal to the Hulk's while the Hulk is in a "calm" state (In an issue of the Avengers, Samsons' strength is said to be 70% of the Hulks'). However, unlike the Hulk, Samson's strength does not increase as he becomes enraged. When the character was first introduced, he was like the [[Biblical]] [[Samson]] in that his strength was dependent upon the length of his hair; however, this has since been abandoned. Samson's leg muscles are highly developed and extremely powerful. He is capable of leaping hundreds of feet both vertically and horizontally.

Samson's body has been fortified, granted vastly greater muscular size and development due to his exposure to radiation. The tissues of Samson's body are considerably harder than those of an ordinary human, granting superhuman durability. Samson can withstand falls from great heights, temperature extremes of hot and cold, and high caliber bullets without sustaining injury. Due to his highly advanced musculature, Samson possesses superhuman stamina in all physical activities. He was once able to beat The Hulk into unconsciousness in a one-on-one fight, a feat he put down to not letting the Hulk catch a breath during the entire, relentless pounding.{{issue}}

In his initial appearance, Samson is shown performing a wide array of athletic activities. This agility would prove to be advantageous against his vastly stronger opponent the Hulk.

Like others who have gamma induced powers, Doc Sampson is immune to terrestrial diseases.

Unlike the Hulk, Doc Samson does not suffer from [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], and so retains his [[genius]] [[intellect]].

==In other media==
*Samson appeared in the video game ''[[Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]''. Unlike in the comics, he doesn't fight the Hulk.  In the game, Samson and Banner had planned to use the Hulk as their weapon to get past [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]'s Division forces and military units under the command of [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]], while gathering parts for a machine that Banner needed. In the fourth boss battle, Samson was forced to betray Banner as the [[Devil Hulk]] personality in Banner's subconscious began to influence his actions and endanger innocent lives. After Banner's escape from Blonsky's base, Samson makes an apology to Banner for betraying him, and they continue to build the machine for Banner to face Devil Hulk.

*Doc Samson appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', the [[animated television series]] broadcast on [[UPN]] in [[1996]]–[[1997|97]]. Samson was shown both fighting the Hulk and trying to find a way to cure Banner of the Hulk.
