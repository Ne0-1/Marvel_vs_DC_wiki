==Publication history==
Doc Samson first appeared in the ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #141 (July 1971) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Herb Trimpe]]. Since then he has also appeared as a supporting character in several different Marvel Comics titles, including ''She-Hulk'', ''Uncanny X-Men'', and ''Amazing Spider-Man''. In 1996 Doc Samson starred in his first self-titled [[miniseries]] written by [[Dan Slott]]. In 2006, Samson starred in his second miniseries written by [[Paul Di Filippo]] and penciled by Fabrizio Fiorentino.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Leonard Samson''' was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. His father, Dr. Leo (short for Leonard) Skivorski, was a popular psychiatrist in his hometown who specialized in treating young women, most of whom he had affairs with.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}  Mrs. Skivorski had nicknamed her husband "Samson" after his long hair.  Leonard Skivorski ''Junior'' initially expressed disinterest in becoming a psychiatrist, perhaps because he resented his father's philandering.  Despite this he became a college professor and psychiatrist. After Robert Bruce Banner was temporarily cured of being the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] by siphoning off the gamma radiation that caused his transformations, Samson, who had been working with Banner/Hulk in his job as a psychiatrist, exposed himself to some of the siphoned radiation, granting him a superhumanly strong and muscular physique and causing his hair to turn green and to grow long, reminiscent of his biblical [[Samson|namesake]]. Initially, Samson's physical strength depends upon the length of his hair, though his gamma mutation eventually stabilized making the length of his hair no longer a factor. Shortly afterward, his flirting with [[Betty Ross]] caused a jealous Banner to re-expose himself to radiation, becoming the Hulk once more to battle Samson.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #141</ref> He learned that his power decreases when he cuts his green hair,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #143</ref> but then lost his powers due to the bombardment of intense gamma radiation.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #147</ref> Feeling guilty about his role in his patient's return to being the Hulk, Samson would spend much time working with Banner over the years.

Samson eventually regained his powers in a gamma ray explosion, and joined the gamma base staff.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #193</ref> Alongside [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], he battled the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #199</ref> He shrank and projected the Hulk into [[Glenn Talbot]]'s brain to cure Talbot of amnesia.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #200</ref> Samson then battled the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #218</ref>

Samson was later captured by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #223</ref> He teamed with the Hulk against the Leader's humanoids.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #225</ref> He attempted a psychoanalysis of the Hulk through his dreams, and diagnosed him with [[Dissociative identity disorder|Multiple Personality Disorder]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #227</ref> Samson next encountered [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and the [[Master Mold]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #7</ref> He encountered [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], and battled the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #228-229</ref> Samson then quit Gamma Base, and became [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]]' psychiatrist.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #238</ref>

Samson later encountered [[Woodgod]] and the Changelings.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #251-253</ref> His former relationship with Dr. Delia Childress was revealed, and he teamed with [[Spider-Man]] against the Rhino and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #102</ref> He next defeated [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]] in combat.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #11</ref> With the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and other heroes, he was abducted by the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]] to challenge him in combat.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #7</ref> The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] offers Doc Samson a position as the leader of a mid-western branch of the Avengers. Samson says that he is flattered, but has already accepted a position teaching at Northwestern University, which he prefers to the life of a hero, and additionally that administration isn't his strong point.<ref>''Avengers'' v.1, #252</ref>

Samson, determined again to cure the Hulk, defeated him in battle by calming him.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #314</ref> He succeeded in separating Bruce Banner and the Hulk physically into two separate individuals. He rescued the Hulk from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attempt to execute him, although the Hulk then ran amok.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #315</ref> Samson adopted a new costume, and battled the heroes [[Iron Man]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] for the right to recapture the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #316</ref> He battled the Hulk,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #317</ref> then destroyed the [[Hulk Robot|Hulk robot]], and battled the [[Hulkbusters]], resulting in the death of [[Carolyn Parmenter]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #318</ref> He battled the Hulk and the Hulkbusters again,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #319</ref> but the Hulk defeated Samson and the Hulkbusters.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #320</ref> Samson then attempted to remerge Banner and the Hulk, but an accident resulted in Banner's transformation into the grey Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #324</ref> Samson then became mentally dominated by a mutant mind-parasite.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #330</ref> He assisted [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] in capturing the Hulk on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #337</ref> Samson also cured [[Captain Ultra]] of his fear of fire.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #50</ref>

To "cure" his MPD, Samson eventually hypnotized Banner with the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s help and successfully began the process of integrating the Banner, grey Hulk, and green Hulk personalities into a new Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #377</ref> This ended up beyond his control, however, leading to a somewhat unstable merger which eventually fragmented once more into a third personality, albeit a more benign one than the previous Hulks. Around this time, Samson attended the execution of convicted murderess "[http://marvel.com/universe/Crazy_Eight Crazy Eight]".<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #380</ref>

Doc Samson was also a part of Bruce Jones' run on the Hulk, with one of the main characters Jones introduced supposed to be his ex-wife.  He spent much of this run sporting an eyepatch, after discovering that a covert organization which is hunting the Hulk has implanted a surveillance device in his eye; he removes the device with a scalpel and donned the eyepatch for protection while his eye healed.

In addition to the Hulk, his most prominent patient, Samson has also spent time in a professional capacity with the second [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the [[Molecule Man]], [[She-Hulk]], and the [[Punisher]] among others.

He is befriended by Doctor Strange's new pupil Jack Holyoak,<ref>In the 2006 ''Doc Samson'' miniseries</ref> and helped his friends' daughter Tina Punnett rescue her "new-age hippie" parents from dealing with a ghost of musician Cam Larson guarded by Living Totem. Searching for his friend Sam Laroquette, Doc Samson along with Living Totem, Tina, and Jack arrives at new age cultist doctor Arick Schnellageister's farm where they all fight Stephen King-inspired nightmarish Weed. The third issue was written by Jay Faerber and it shows Samson helps the new [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]] come clean after being implied to have killed S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The final two-parter was a storyline involving [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] from a different dimension sending the alternate Doc Samson to help him invade the regular 616 Marvel Universe. Those last two issues had [[Frank Espinosa]]'s short Living Totem stories as back up.

He reappeared,<ref>''She-Hulk'' #8</ref> and has also treated [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #469</ref> He talked with [[Valerie Cooper]], regarding her and the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E]] organization taping his session with Rachel, even though he asked her not to. Samson was a member of [[Iron Man]]'s  pro-registration side in [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' vol. 1 #533</ref> He gave each member of the newest incarnation of [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] a session after a particularly troubling mission. He is paying particular attention to the team's leader, [[Jamie Madrox]].

Samson is shown working alongside the Pro-Registration alliance. As part of this group, he helps She-Hulk and Spider-Man take down a rampaging robot threatening innocent civilians. Samson remains on Iron Man's side during the final breakout at the [[Negative Zone]] prison. The Pro-Registration people ultimately win when [[Captain America]] surrenders.

Samson plays a role in the events of the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' crossover event of 2007. Dr. Samson was instrumental in the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] plan of exiling the Hulk as well as de-powering [[She-Hulk]] for [[Iron Man]]. Samson was sent by Mr. Fantastic to retrieve She-Hulk after she discovered that her cousin was exiled, and tries to convince her that her cousin deserved his punishment after recalling several moments when the Hulk fought the members of the Illuminati. She-Hulk punches Samson into another state after realizing that Samson was siding with the Illuminati.

Samson is shown to be one of the various heroes that helped during the evacuation of New York.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1</ref> Later he and the Avengers are quickly defeated by the Hulk and his [[Warbound]] allies, whereby Doc Samson and his fallen teammates are 'enslaved' by obedience discs (the very same technology used to control the Hulk/Green Scar and other Gladiators on Sakaar).<ref>''World War Hulk'' #2</ref> Following a climactic and hard-fought victory over the Sentry, Doc Samson is freed from his obedience disk after Tony Stark activates a series of satellite devices that open fire on the Hulk and leave him unconscious, and in his human/Bruce Banner form.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #6</ref>

Samson is appointed by the Initiative to serve as therapist for [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref> He successfully helps Penance regain his original Speedball powers and make steps towards psychological recovery.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>

He is sent by the CSA to temporarily suspend Tony Stark from his S.H.I.E.L.D. duties pending psychological evaluation,<ref>''Iron Man'' (Vol 4) #23</ref> and while overseeing this was drawn into assisting Tony in uncovering the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s Extremis conspiracy. He gives evidence to the UN Security Council in Tony's cover, sparring verbally with [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] in the process.<ref>''Iron Man'' #27</ref>

Following the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Doc Samson is shown leading a support group meeting with those that had been replaced by [[Skrull]]s.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> Later, he appears on [[Air Force One]], attempting to disclose the full activities of [[Norman Osborn]] within Thunderbolts Mountain to the new United States President. Before Samson is able to play the evidence, Osborn's new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] hijack the plane: the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] takes the evidence, [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]] implants a gamma-emitter on the back of Samson's neck causing him to grow angry and more powerful in a Hulk-like manner, and someone wearing the Green Goblin's costume attacks the airplane.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #128, ''Thunderbolts'' #129</ref> Samson's increased anger brings him to attack the President, but he is phased out of the plane by the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. Osborn reasons that, in his enhanced state, Doc Samson probably survived the fall, and places a global warrant for his arrest, suggesting that Samson attempted to kill the President.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #129</ref>

In the debut issue of the 2008 ''Hulk'' title, written by [[Jeph Loeb]], Samson appears in Russia, alongside Iron Man, General Ross, and She-Hulk (whose attitude towards Samson is still antagonistic). The group is investigating the murder of the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] at the hands of a [[Red Hulk|Hulk-like]] creature. After an altercation over jurisdiction with the Russian [[Winter Guard]] (a fight which Samson uncharacteristically starts), Samson and Ross return to the United States to consult with Banner, who is imprisoned in a high-security facility.<ref>''Hulk'' #1</ref>

However, the [[Helicarrier]] crashes near New Jersey. Tony Stark orders [[Maria Hill]] to investigate, and search for survivors. [[Clay Quartermain]]'s corpse is found mangled and ravaged, and the area bathed with gamma radiations. General Ross' and Samson's bodies are missing. Leonard's coat is found ripped and shredded in a Hulk-like fashion, exhibiting higher Gamma Radiation values than every other item in the wreckage.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Samson later shoots [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and drags him away after Jones attempts to reveal the Red Hulk's true identity.<ref>''Hulk'' #6</ref>

In ''Incredible Hulk'' #600, it is revealed the reason Samson shot Rick Jones is because Samson now has multiple personality syndrome.  Samson grows larger in size (hence the high gamma output and ripped jacket in the Red Hulk story arc), his hair grows out, and in this form he is stronger and faster than [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]].  He also has a lightning bolt scar across his chest.  Samson claims, just before his evil persona takes over, that he was brainwashed by [[MODOK]] who wouldn't let him talk.  This personality refers to himself only as "Samson" and claims Leonard is never coming back.

However after MODOK subdues She-Hulk and Samson to keep them from destroying the facility, and just before it does explode due to a fight between Rulk and Hulk, Rulk is standing over Leonard (now short haired again) and She-Hulk claiming the three of them will ride out the explosion.  The fate of Leonard and She-Hulk is currently unknown.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #600</ref>

A subsequent appearance features "Samson" apparently attending a psychological evaluation which discusses his feelings of inadequacy compared to other heroes, never attracting the attention of either the public or women despite his powers, only for the appointment to be revealed to be a confrontation in Samson's mind between his three personas: Samson, Doc Samson, and Dr. Leonard Samson PhD. Concluding that his intellect is what has been holding him back in his previous confrontations, Samson "kills" his other two personas, prompting MODOK - who has been watching Samson in a cell while the "dream" takes place - to conclude that he is ready.<ref>''Hulk'' #18</ref>

After Banner frees the other captive intellects in the Intelligentsia's trap, they quickly determine that the Red Hulk 'creation process,' if accidentally or intentionally done incorrectly, will result in a series of "Hulked Out" individuals who will briefly obtain the same abilities as Red Hulk and Red She-Hulk -but these 'overcharged' candidates will overload and die not long afterward...and many of these candidates include members of the X-Men, Avengers, and the Fantastic Four who were inadvertently caught in a shipwide blast of cathexis rays.

After re-tooling the Cathexis Ray Generator to re-absorb and turn the Hulked-Out Heroes (and A.I.Marines) back to normal, Banner tries to absorb all of the energy with his body - and mostly succeeds - but at a crucial juncture, the machinery begins to break down from the feedback. Samson steps in and absorbs the additional excess energy, but for unknown reasons, his body is unable to absorb the energy as readily as Banner's body can and he is killed by the overload, reduced to a charred skeleton in seconds.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #610</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'', Doc Samson returns from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He helps Bruce and the other Hulks fight Brian Banner, Abomination, and the demons on [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]'s side.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #619</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Doc Samson possesses superhuman physical abilities as a result of exposure to high levels of [[gamma radiation]]. His exposure is considerably less than that of the Hulk or the Abomination.
The gamma radiation mutated Samson's physique by adding considerable muscle and bone mass to his body, granting him high levels of superhuman strength. The exposure also turned his hair a bright shade of green. Initially, his strength was dependent on the length of his hair and the longer it was, the more powerful he became, although his mutation has since stabilized, making his hair length irrelevant. Samson's strength is equal to that of the Gray Hulk, AKA Joe Fixit, while the latter is in a calm emotional state. Unlike the Hulk, however, Samson's strength doesn't increase due to adrenaline surges while angry. As a result, Samson is ultimately far less powerful than the Hulk. Samson is able to leap great distances vertically and horizontally, though not nearly as far as the Hulk or Abomination.

Aside from granting him more muscle mass, Samson's bodily tissues are fortified and are considerably harder than those of an ordinary human, granting him a high level of resistance to physical injury. Samson can withstand falls from great heights, extremes of temperature, high-caliber bullets, and tremendous impact forces like being repeatedly struck by the Hulk without sustaining injury. Due to his highly advanced musculature, his muscles produce considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a normal human, granting him superhuman stamina. He has demonstrated sufficient stamina to battle a mindless incarnation of the Hulk for more than six hours.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #317</ref>

The discovery of a new persona within Leonard's psyche, which he calls "Samson," reveals that Doc Samson is capable of much higher powers than previously observed.

Like others who have gamma induced powers, Doc Samson is immune to terrestrial diseases. Unlike the Hulk, Abomination, or even [[She-Hulk]], Samson hasn't demonstrated any accelerated healing powers.

Samson is said to be one of the most renowned psychiatrists on Earth.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #227</ref> He is often called on to counsel various superhumans, such as the members of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. He has a M.D. in psychiatry, and is a skilled theoretical technician and inventor of various medical devices.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  His extensive study of the mind also permits him a significant degree of resistance to telepathy and telepathic attacks.

Samson is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, which, coupled with his physical attributes, has allowed him to engage the Hulk for extended periods of time, and briefly held his own against the combined forces of [[Iron Man]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], after they had first fought the mindless Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #316</ref> He sometimes uses psychology as a tool to get through a more powerful opponent's guard, such as an [[Infinity Gem]]-empowered [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.3, #12</ref>

==Personality==
Unlike the Hulk, Doc Samson originally did not suffer from [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], and retained his [[genius]] [[intellect]], however in recent years he has developed a split personality: his calm conscious personality "Leonard" and his rude personality "Samson".{{Issue|date=December 2009}} He has conducted research on gamma beings like himself and has come to the conclusion that gamma mutation is largely determined by the subject's deepest sense of self.  Hence, his form is based on a subconscious desire for superhuman power like the Biblical Samson.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #393</ref>

While attacking the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], the telepath [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Second Mirage|Mirage]] noted that Doc Samson, who was present in Thunderbolts Mountain, had some fascinating thoughts. In his mind she saw that, while his mental reactions to [[Norman Osborn]] and [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] were Hulk-like, he was still able to control himself from physically acting on those impulses.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In [[Earth X]], it is stated that Doc Samson was killed when the Skull used his powers of persuasion to force Samson to rip himself inside out. It is stated that Samson got halfway through before he died, and the Skull "thought it was funny".

===Mutant X===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] Earth, Doc Samson had gained green skin and an expanded physique, much like the Hulk. He still manages to keep his calm and rational mind. He forms a new mini-team, called the Defenders, after the Avengers are neutralized. Stingray and Yellowjacket join him. Samson is one of the many victims of the conflict between that Earth's [[Beyonder]] and the Goblyn Queen.

===Spider-Ham===
In ''[[Spider-Ham|Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham]]'' #16 Doc Samson appears as a [[clam]] called '''Doc Clamson'''.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Doc Samson appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', the [[animated television series]] broadcast on [[UPN]] in [[1996 in television|1996]]–[[1997 in television|97]], voiced by [[Shadoe Stevens]]. Samson was shown both fighting the Hulk and trying to find a way to cure Banner of the Hulk.
* Doc Samson appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode "Hulk Versus the World" voiced by [[Cam Clarke]]. He is shown visiting Bruce Banner at the [[Cube (comics)|Cube]] taking a blood sample from him. He tells Bruce that he hasn't given up on trying to find a cure for the Hulk. Doc Samson later adds the vial containing Bruce's blood with the vials of the other inmates. In "The Breakout" Pt. 1, Doc Samson becomes exposed to Gamma Radiation following a breakout at the Cube. This gave him the strength to free Bruce Banner before being knocked out by Zzzax. Hulk manages to get him out of the Cube. In "The Breakout" Pt. 2, Hulk gives the unconscious Doc Samson to a waitress at the time when [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] was fighting Thor. In the episode "Gamma World," Samson goes with the rest of the Avengers to defeat the Leader at the Cube. By this time, he has very visibly responded to the gamma exposure.

===Film===
* Doc Samson appears in the 2008 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|Incredible Hulk]]'' film, and is played by [[Ty Burrell]].<ref>{{Cite news| author=Bill Varble | url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071021/LIFE/710210313 | title=This Just In | publisher=[[Mail Tribune]] | date=2007-10-21 | accessdate=2007-10-22 }}</ref> He does not have any superpowers, but he is portrayed closer to his earlier appearances before his incident. He is in a short relationship with Betty Ross. He calls the military regarding Bruce's location at Culver University, but criticized General Ross' reasons for hunting Banner/Hulk, especially after witnessing the Hulk protecting Betty from the crossfire of General Ross' attacks (he says, ''"I used to wonder why she never talked about you...Now I know."''). A large number of his scenes, including the scene where he talks to Bruce as seen in the film's trailer, were cut from the film. In the opening credits, the name Leonard Samson appeared on the quick clip of a list of Bruce's accomplices. In deleted scenes, he is hospitable to Banner and he, Betty, and Banner have a nice time talking. In another scene he reveals to Banner that he has been jealous of him and Betty all along, then the deleted scene from the trailer occurs. In the final scene where Betty is at [[Liberty Island]], Samson calls Betty where he seems to be depressed. He admits to really sending the armada when she asks. He wants Betty to return, but she says not yet, but she will return. When she is about to hang up, he asks her to not hang up, but she does it anyway.

===Video games===
* Samson appeared in the video game ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'' voiced by [[Daniel Riordan (actor)|Daniel Riordan]]. In the game, Samson and Banner had planned to use the Hulk as their weapon to get past [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]'s Division forces and military units under the command of [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]], while gathering parts for a machine that Banner needed. In the fourth boss battle, Samson was forced to betray Banner as the [[Devil Hulk]] personality in Banner's subconscious began to influence his actions and endanger innocent lives. After Banner's escape from Blonsky's base, Samson makes an apology to Banner for betraying him, and they continue to build the machine for Banner to face Devil Hulk.
