<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:inchulk141.jpg|160px|left|thumb|''The Incredible Hulk vol. 2'' #141: Doc Samson debuts.]] -->Leonard Samson was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. He became a college professor and psychiatrist.  After Robert Bruce Banner was temporarily cured of being the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Samson—who had been working on Banner/Hulk in his job as a psychiatrist—exposed himself to some of the siphoned radiation, causing his hair to become green and granting him superhuman strength proportionate to its length, reminiscent of his biblical [[Samson|namesake]]. His power level has since stabilized to the point that it doesn't matter how long his hair is. Shortly afterward, his flirting with [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]] caused a jealous Banner to re-expose himself to radiation, becoming the Hulk once more to battle Samson.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #141</ref> He learned that his power decreases when he cuts his green hair,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #143</ref> but then lost his powers due to the bombardment of intense gamma radiation.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #147</ref> Feeling guilty about his role in his patient's return to being the Hulk, Samson would spend much time working with Banner over the years.

To "cure" his MPD, Samson eventually hypnotized Banner with the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s help and successfully began the process of integrating the Banner, grey Hulk, and green Hulk personalities into a new Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #377</ref> This ended up beyond his control, however, leading to a somewhat unstable merger which eventually fragmented once more into a third personality, albeit a more benign one than the previous Hulks. Around this time, Samson attended the execution of convicted murderess "[[Crazy Eight (comics)|Crazy Eight]]".<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #380</ref> 

With a patch on his eye, Doc Samson was also a part of Bruce Jones' run on the Hulk, with one of the main characters Jones introduced supposed to be his ex-wife

In addition to the Hulk, his most prominent patient, Samson has also spent time in a professional capacity with the second [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the [[Molecule Man]], [[She-Hulk]], and The [[Punisher]] among others.

He is befriended by Doctor Strange's new pupil Jack Holoyak<ref>In the 2006 ''Doc Samson'' mini-series</ref>, and helped his friends' daughter Tina Punnett rescue her "new-age hippie" parents from dealing with a ghost of musician Cam Larson guarded by Living Totem. Searching for his friend Sam Laroquette, Doc Samson along with Living Totem, Tina and Jack arrives at new age cultist doctor Arick Schnellageister's farm where they all fight Stephen King-inspired nightmarish Weed. The third issue was written by Jay Faerber and it shows Samson helps the new [[Carmilla Black|Scorpion]] come clean after being implied to have killed SHIELD agents. The final two-parter was a storyline involving Nightmare from a different dimension sending the alternate Doc Samson to help him invade the regular 616 Marvel Universe. Those last two issues had Frank Rocketo Espinoza's short Living Totem stories as back up

He reappeared<ref>''She-Hulk'' #8</ref>, and has also treated [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #469</ref> He discussed with [[Valerie Cooper]], regarding her and the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E*]] organization taping his session with Rachel, even though he asked her not to. Samson is currently seen as part of [[Iron Man]] pro side in [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' vol. 1 #533</ref> When last seen, he was giving the each member of the newest incarnation of [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] a session after a particularly troubling mission. He is paying particular attention to the team's leader, [[Jamie Madrox]].

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Samson is shown working alongside the Pro-Registration alliance. As part of this group, he helps She-Hulk and Spider-Man take down a rampaging robot threatening innocent civilians. Samson remains on his side during the final breakout at the Negative Zone prison. The Pro-Registration people ultimately win when Captain America surrenders.

Leonard has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> He has also been appointed by the Initiative to serve as therapist for [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref>

===World War Hulk===
Due to his relationship with the Hulk, Samson plays a role in the events of the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' crossover event of 2007. Dr. Samson was vital towards the [[Illuminati (comics)| Illuminati]] plan of exiling the Hulk as well as de-powering the [[She-Hulk]] for [[Iron Man]]. Samson was sent by Mr. Fantastic to retrieve the She-Hulk after she found out that her cousin was exiled, and tries to convince her that her cousin deserved his punishment after recalling several moments when the Hulk fought the members of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. She-Hulk defeats Samson after realizing that Samson was siding with the Illuminati.

Within the first issue of World War Hulk, Samson is shown to be one of the various heroes that helped during the evacuation of New York. In issue #2, he and the Avengers are quickly defeated by the Hulk and his Warbound allies.

== Powers and abilities ==
Doc Samson possesses superhuman physical abilities as a result of exposure to high levels of [[gamma radiation]]. Initially, Doc Samson's strength was said to be equal to that of the Savage Hulk's when not enraged. 

Unlike the Hulk, Samson's strength does not increase as he becomes enraged. In the past, like the [[Biblical]] [[Samson]], his strength was dependent upon the length of his hair. <ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #143</ref> This is no longer the case. Samson's leg muscles are highly developed and extremely powerful. He is capable of leaping great distances both vertically and horizontally.

Samson's body has been fortified, granted vastly greater muscular size and development due to his exposure to radiation. The tissues of Samson's body are considerably harder than those of an ordinary human, giving him superhuman durability. Samson can withstand falls from great heights, extremes of temperature, and high-caliber bullets without sustaining injury. Due to his highly advanced musculature, Samson possesses superhuman stamina in all physical activities. He was once able to battle a mindless incarnation of the Hulk for more than six hours.  <ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #317</ref>

Like others who have gamma induced powers, Doc Samson is immune to terrestrial diseases.

Unlike the Hulk, Doc Samson does not suffer from [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], and so retains his [[genius]] [[intellect]]. He has conducted research on gamma beings like himself and has come to the conclusion that gamma mutation is largely determined by the subject's deepest sense of self.  Hence, his form is based on a subconscious desire for superhuman power like the Biblical Samson. <ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #393</ref>

Samson is said to be one of the most renowned psychiatrists on Earth. <ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #227</ref> He has a Ph.D. in psychiatry, and is a skilled theoretical technician and inventor of various medical devices.

He is also an accomplished fighter, enabling him to recurrently hold his own against the savage or mindless incarnations of the Hulk or, on one occasion, briefly against [[Iron Man]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Sub-Mariner]], and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] together, though those heroes had been previously weakened after battling the mindless Hulk. <ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #316</ref> He sometimes uses psychology as a tool to get through a more powerful opponent's guard, such as an [[Infinity Gem]]-empowered [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.3, #12</ref>

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In [[Earth X]], it is stated that Doc Samson was killed when the Skull used his powers of persuasion to force Samson to rip himself inside out. It is stated that Samson got halfway through before he died, and the Skull "thought it was funny".

===Mutant X===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] earth, Doc Samson had gained green skin and an expanded physique, much like the Hulk. He still manages to keep his calm and rational mind. He forms a new super-team, called the Defenders, after the Avengers are neutralized. Stingray and Yellowjacket join him. Samson is one of the many victims of the conflict between that earth's [[Beyonder]] and the Goblyn Queen.

===Spider-Ham===
In ''[[Spider-Ham|Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham]]'' #16 Doc Samson appears as a clam called '''Doc Clamson'''.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Doc Samson appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', the [[animated television series]] broadcast on [[UPN]] in [[1996]]–[[1997|97]], voiced by [[Shadoe Stevens]]. Samson was shown both fighting the Hulk and trying to find a way to cure Banner of the Hulk.

===Film===
* He will appear in the new [[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]] movie due next year, and be played by [[Ty Burrell]].

===Video games===
* Samson appeared in the video game ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'' voiced by [[Daniel Riordan (actor)|Daniel Riordan]]. Unlike in the comics, he doesn't fight the Hulk. In the game, Samson and Banner had planned to use the Hulk as their weapon to get past [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]'s Division forces and military units under the command of [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]], while gathering parts for a machine that Banner needed. In the fourth boss battle, Samson was forced to betray Banner as the [[Devil Hulk]] personality in Banner's subconscious began to influence his actions and endanger innocent lives. After Banner's escape from Blonsky's base, Samson makes an apology to Banner for betraying him, and they continue to build the machine for Banner to face Devil Hulk.
