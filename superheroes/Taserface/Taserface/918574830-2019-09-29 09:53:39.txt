Hence he described him as "a real dumbass," yet also "a very powerful guy."<ref name="Taserface">{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/07/24/james-gunn-reveals-why-taserface-is-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-v/|title=James Gunn Reveals Why Taserface Is In Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2|last=Davis|first=Brandon|publisher=Comicbook.com|date=July 24, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6jJ7nbqVx|archivedate=July 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Taserface is depicted as being proud of his name as he believes it strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. However [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]], and the rest of the Ravagers, scoff at the ridiculousness of his name. Feeling that Yondu is "going soft", he leads a mutiny against him which involves tossing those who are still loyal to him out the airlock. After [[Kraglin]] aids Yondu, Rocket, and [[Groot]] in escaping from their prison cells, Yondu kills off all of his former Ravager comrades that sided with Taserface and blows up the main engine severely burning Taserface. The heroes eject from the main ship, leaving Taserface to die. Before the ship explodes, Taserface contacts the female Sovereign representative to give the coordinates of Yondu's escape ship. In return, Taserface wishes to be known as the one who caused Yondu's defeat. Taserface then dies in the ship's explosion while the Sovereign representative laughs at his name.
