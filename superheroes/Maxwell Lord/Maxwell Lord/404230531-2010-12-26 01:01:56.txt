'''Maxwell Lord''' is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. He is a shrewd and powerful businessman who was very influential in the formation of the [[Justice League|Justice League International]] in [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
===Giffen and DeMatteis years: introduction, ''Justice League International'' (1987-1997)===
'''Maxwell Lord IV''', initially, worked behind the scenes to establish the League, while under the control of a villainous computer created by [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] (a later [[retcon]] would say that this was actually the villainous computer program '''Kilg%re''', which had taken over Metron's machine). The computer wanted Max to set up a worldwide peacekeeping organization, as part of its plan to [[Hegemony|dominate the world]].<ref>http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/13/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-one/</ref>

[[Image:Maxmartian.PNG|thumb|left|Lord talks with the [[Martian Manhunter]] on the need for a strong League.]]

Lord's ruthlessness at this time was illustrated when he set up a disturbed would-be terrorist as a villain for the League to defeat, resulting in the man's death. (The would-be terrorist believed he had a bomb connected to his heartbeat, but in fact, Max had disconnected it.) Later, however, he rebelled against the computer and (seemingly) destroyed it.

Once free of the computer's influence, Lord was portrayed as an [[amorality|amoral]] businessman, but not a real villain. During the time that Giffen and DeMatteis were writing the Justice League the character was shown struggling with his conscience and developing heroic qualities, though he would remain a con-artist; however, more recent changes to his character by different writers seem to contradict these previous characterizations.

===''Invasion!'', superpowers; cyborg status (1998-2004)===
Originally a normal human, Lord was one of many on Earth gifted with super-powers during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' crossover, when a Gene Bomb was exploded by alien invaders. This bomb activated the latent metagene present in a small percentage of Earthlings. Lord gained the ability to control the minds of others, albeit at great difficulty.<ref>http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/15/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-two/</ref>

After he was shot and placed in a coma, at the start of the 15-part ''JLAmerica/JLEurope'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] ''Breakdowns'', [[Dreamslayer]], a supervillain who, with the aid of the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]], a team of robotic servants, had once destroyed all life on their planet, took over Lord's body and "supercharged" this power, allowing him to control thousands of minds at once. Using Lord's body and power, he caused the JLI to lose its charter, and almost forced them to disband. Finally, however, while the possessed Lord forced the JLI to battle itself, the mortally-wounded [[Silver Sorceress]] managed to contain Dreamslayer and held it within her mind as she died, taking it with her, and while Lord was freed, his power was burnt out.

[[Image:Maxjl.PNG|thumb|left|Lord reflects on his time with the League.]]

Later, Lord is diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], and seemingly dies. '''Kilg%re''', however, had been waiting patiently for the right moment to reactivate its control of Lord and downloads his consciousness into a duplicate of one of the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremist]] robots, '''Lord Havok''' (in a further [[retcon]] the body is said to be a [[New Genesis]]-built automaton, which later fell into Checkmate's possession). In this form, he spends some time testing the League for unknown reasons. He also takes control of the secret organisation known as the Arcana.<ref>http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/19/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-three/</ref>

His cyborg body later comes to resemble his original human form. Lord  then pulls together several former JLI members, including [[L-Ron]], [[Captain Atom]], [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]], [[Booster Gold]] and [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] as the "[[Super Buddies]]," advertised as "Heroes the common man could call."  These stories are told in the six-issue miniseries ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' in 2003, and its 2005 sequel, ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League.''<ref>http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/06/27/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-four-the-super-buddies/</ref>

In [[Brad Meltzer]]'s ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' (2004), Lord attends [[Sue Dibny]]'s funeral, speaking to [[Booster Gold]].{{Clear}}

===''Infinite Crisis''===
{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}
[[Image:Beatlemax.png|Lord shoots Blue Beetle. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|left|thumb]]
The 2005 80-page one-shot ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' reveals that Lord is no longer a cyborg and, apparently, a criminal mastermind who spent years running the JLI gathering sensitive information about the world's superheroes, whom he considered a threat to the planet.  At the same time, he sabotaged JLI efforts in order to render the superhero team as ineffectual as possible. At the end of the prologue special issue, he shoots and kills one-time JLI member Blue Beetle when the hero discovers Lord's secret and refuses his offer to join him.

During this time, [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], the god-like son of [[Lex Luthor]] from an alternate earth, gives Lord control over Batman's [[OMAC_(comics)|Brother Eye]], a satellite system Batman created to monitor all superhuman contact, after the masked detective had grown paranoid following the discovery in ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' that the JLA had altered his memories years earlier when he objected to a similar resolution regarding [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]]. Lord uses Brother Eye to create an army of [[OMACs]] (humans infected with a nano-virus that transformed them into cyborgs) programmed to hunt down and kill all superhumans.{{issue|date=November 2010}}
[[Image:WWMax.png|Lord is killed by [[Wonder Woman]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]
Lord also uses his powers to influence [[Superman]]'s mind, causing him to brutally beat [[Batman]] in the belief that he is [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], subsequently sending Superman to attack [[Wonder Woman]] after making him believe that she is his old enemy [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] trying to find Lois Lane to kill her. Lord justifies the resulting destruction as proof of his argument about the dangers of superhumans, pointing out the devastation that Wonder Woman and Superman could cause if they fought in a crowded area, with the mere fact that Superman can be brought under another's control evidence that they cannot be relied on. In the midst of her battle with Superman, Diana realizes that even if she defeats him, he would still remain under Max Lord's absolute mental control. She creates a diversion lasting long enough for her to race back to Max Lord's location and demand that he tell her how to free Superman from his control. Bound by her lasso of truth, Max replies: "Kill me." Wonder Woman then snaps his neck (''[[The OMAC Project]]'', 2005). In response, Brother Eye broadcasts the footage of Wonder Woman killing Lord all over the world, destroying her reputation and her friendship with Batman and Superman, who rejected her, despite the fact that she saved their lives.<ref>http://league.jmkprime.org/2010/07/06/who-is-maxwell-lord-part-five-checkmate/</ref>

===''One Year Later''===
{{main|One Year Later}}
Lord reappeared in 2007 in the first two story arcs of the new ''[[Booster Gold (2007-)|Booster Gold]]'' series by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dan Jurgens]]. At the end of the ''[[52 Pick-Up (Booster Gold)|52 Pick-Up]]'' story arc  Booster Gold and Blue Beetles from the past, present and future go back in time to ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' and prevent Lord from killing Ted Kord. In the subsequent ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Blue and Gold]]'' story arc Beetle and Booster discover that in saving Ted Kord they have created a new timeline where Lord was never killed by Wonder Woman, and his OMAC's and a mind controlled [[Superman]] have turned the entire planet into a police state. Lord reveals that he had been returned to human form after dozens of clandestine operations, and that he learned the importance of control during that time. When Booster and Beetle, having assembled their old JLI teammates, storm Brother Eye, Lord is killed by [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]], who blasts a hole through his chest. Ted Kord realizes that his death is the only way to fix the timestream and leaves the battle, seemingly to return to the past and accept his death. Next, Max makes an appearance the [[Trinity (comic book)|''Trinity'' maxi-series]] (2008-9); Lord's skull is stolen by a group called the Dreambound and brought to [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine Le Fey]] for use in a spell, which requires an item connected to Wonder Woman.<ref>''Trinity'' #14</ref>

===''Blackest Night''===
{{main|Blackest Night}}
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' (2009â€“10) storyline, Maxwell Lord is identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1</ref> Lord's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref> Targeting Wonder Woman, he lures her to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] with a trail of slaughtered bodies. When Wonder Woman arrives, he springs a trap, using [[Power ring (weapon)|black rings]] to revive the bodies of fallen soldiers. Wonder Woman uses her Lasso to reduce Max and the soldiers to dust; however, as she leaves, the dust begins to regenerate.<ref>''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #1</ref> Some time later, Max resumes his attack on Wonder Woman, who has recently been deputised into the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphires]]. Wonder Woman encases Max's body in a violet crystal, then shatters it to pieces. However, Max still continues to taunt her, his mouth talking out of a piece of crystal.<ref>''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman''#3</ref> He is later brought back to life by the power of the White Light. Though Guy Gardner attempts to restrain him, Max 'convinces' Guy to let him leave.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8</ref>

===''Brightest Day/Justice League: Generation Lost''===
Lord is among the other resurrected heroes/villains, features in the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' (2010) series. He is first seen attempting to push his mind control powers further than ever, but severely injures himself in the attempt, despite his meticulous preparations, including a constant blood supply and an ice pool.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0</ref> Later, Deadman's white power ring shows a vision where Lord is shown shaking hands with [[Jaime Reyes]], the third Blue Beetle, but Lord is hiding a gun behind his back, implying that he is planning to kill him just as he killed Jaime's predecessor, Ted Kord.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref>

In the first issue of ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'' Lord is the subject of an unprecedented international manhunt. He is found hiding in the old Justice League International embassy by [[Booster Gold]], whom Lord is able to defeat. Lord then uses a device to amplify his mind control powers to unprecedented levels. With this he erases the world's memory of his existence. Initially it appears that only his former Justice League colleagues Booster, Ice, Fire, and [[Captain Atom]] remember Max;<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> it is later revealed in ''Brightest Day'' #8 that [[Deadman (comics)|Deadman]] also remembers his existence. Max uses his powers to disgrace the team, having Fire ousted from Checkmate, Captain Atom turned in to a fugitive for betraying the US army, and Ice isolated from Guy Gardner whom Max causes to believe she tried to kill him. He also influences the superhero community into believing Ted Kord committed suicide, which enrages Booster. He then sends OMACs after the current Blue Beetle, [[Jaime Reyes]], who calls Booster and the others for help.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> In the meantime, Max discovers that his resurrection has come with a side effect: some of his efforts to control others' minds transform his targets into cadavers wearing Black Lantern uniforms.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #4 (June 2010)</ref> Contacting his former colleagues through a fallen [[Rocket Red]]'s armor, Max reveals that he intentionally exempted them from the worldwide mindwipe, and that he wants them to protect the world as they did in the old days. He then warns the group not to come looking for him, unaware that Blue Beetle had located his transmission signal.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #5 (July 2010)</ref>

Captain Atom then tells the others that an explosion, seen in the first issue, propelled him briefly into the 24th century, where he saw a world reduced to a pre-industrial state by a metahuman war instigated by Max. The team resolve to try to prevent Max from bringing about this dystopia.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #6 (July 2010)</ref>

Maxwell Lord is at one point contacted by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]], who tells him to stop [[Magog (comics)|Magog]] from plunging the world into war.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> Max then sees a vision of himself killing a distraught Magog, who begs for mercy, with Magog's own staff.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> The Entity gives Max a vision of future when Magog's team attacks [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]. Parasite's absorption of Captain Atom causes an explosion that destroys everything within a large radius and annihilates over a million people (similar to the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' future).<ref name="jlgl10">''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #10 (September 2010)</ref>

[[Power Girl]] witnesses her new villain C.R.A.S.H. confronting Max before heading towards the teleporter.<ref>''Power Girl'' #15 (August 2010)</ref> When the team next encounter Lord,<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #8 (August 2010)</ref> after mind-controlling Fire and then Booster to prevent them from stopping him, he ports from the old JLI embassy back to Checkmate, where he attempts to enlist Magog to kill Captain Atom.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #9 (September 2010)</ref> Max uses technology to upgrade Magog's staff into emitting energy blasts.<ref name="jlgl10"/> Meanwhile, Max asks [[Professor Ivo]] to reprogram the [[Metal Men]].<ref name="jlgl10"/> Then he asks [[Doctor Sivana]] to create a genetically engineered humanoid clone of Power Girl.<ref>''Power Girl'' #18 (November 2010)</ref>

When Captain Atom and Magog battle in the heart of New York City, Captain Atom is able to convince Magog he's being used and Magog remembers Max. Watching, Max uses his powers to force Magog to kill himself, and then makes everyone believe they watched Captain Atom murder him. The Entity proclaims Max has completed his task, and his life is restored to him.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #13 (November 2010)</ref> After briefly receiving a White Ring, the recently returned Bruce Wayne seems to now be aware of Max Lord's resurrection .<ref>''Brightest Day'' #14 (November 2010)</ref>

When Captain Atom absorbs the energy from Magog's spear he is propelled forward through time 112 years in the future, where Max, while long dead, has plunged humanity into a massive metahuman war ruled by OMACs. Captain Atom is eventually returned to the present but not before a dying Power Girl tells him that the catalyst for all this was Wonder Woman's death by Max's hand and Batman ([[Damian Wayne]]) tells him how to stop Max's ultimate plans.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14 (November 2010)</ref> However, Max is struck with the ironic discovery that (with the exception of the original four ex-JLI'ers) no one in the world remembers Wonder Woman.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #15 (December 2010)</ref> Later, the [[Creature Commandos]] attacked the JLI embassy, Max poses as a member and captured Jaime Reyes heading the teleporter unable to stopping him.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #16 (December 2010)</ref>

==Criticism==
{{Section OR|date=April 2010}}
How Lord recovered his original human body and received a different variation of his telepathic powers has not been revealed, and fans have criticized this reboot of the character, especially after interviews where prominent DC comics administrators revealed they knew about the continuity problems but decided to ignore them (see next paragraph). In-story, it is possible to explain the various continuity errors as one of the side-effects of [[Superboy Prime]] "punching" the universe and [[Retcon|changing history]] (see [[Continuity changes during Infinite Crisis]] for more details); this may also explain his character's change from hero to villain, or he might have been influenced by Alexander Luthor and/or the [[Psycho-Pirate]]. While it was probably the writer's intent to suggest that Lord's previous 'heroic behavior' was simply a part he played to ingratiate himself with the heroes before his intended plan of betrayal, this is contradicted by his various thought-bubbles over the years.

At the "Crisis Counseling" panel at Wizard World Chicago, [[Dan DiDio]] explained DC's reasoning in using Lord's character in ''Infinite Crisis''. After going through several possible characters who could be the "new leader for the offshoot of Checkmate", Maxwell Lord was suggested. Many of the editors thought that the idea made sense, as Lord had been shown to have a mean streak and to have killed previously. The idea was dropped due to the continuity errors, such as him being a cyborg, but they went back to it later after deciding none of the other possible characters were suitable. "We thought about that aspect of the story [where Maxwell was turned into a cyborg] some more," DiDio explained. "And then asked, 'Did anyone read it?' No. 'Did anyone like the idea?' No. So we moved ahead with Max as being a human, and having been a human, and not letting that small part of the past stand in the way of this story. We wanted what was best for Countdown [to Infinite Crisis], and for us, that meant that Max had to be a human."<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&threadid=40070 WWC: DAY 2 - DC CRISIS COUNSELING PANEL - NEWSARAMA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A further retcon placed the cyberization of Maxwell Lord in a brief period, after which Maxwell Lord used his connections with [[Cadmus Labs]], Checkmate and [[Creature Commandos|Project M]] to reverse the changes made to him by the Kilg%re and get back into a healthy human body. The narrative captions that explain this also imply that, despite previous suggestions to the contrary, his reformation during ''JLI'' was genuine, and only following his cyberization and restoration (and presumably Sue Dibny's death) did he acquire the hatred of metahumans that defined his role in ''Infinite Crisis''.<ref>''Boooster Gold'' #9 (July 2008)</ref>

This has been revealed to be the case even in the current DC Universe (''[[Booster Gold]]'s'' events were set in a timeline diverging from the [[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]] events to present). However, the cyborg body owned by Maxwell Lord is no longer the one owned by the mechanical clone of Lord Havok, but a [[New Genesis]]-built automaton. Discarded after the restoration of his biological form, the body was abandoned in a basement at the Castle, Checkmate's current headquarters, and retooled to host the current iteration of the [[G.I. Robot]].<ref>[[Master Jailer|Carl Draper]] [http://www.gideonii.com/ fictional site], access with ''CARL DRAPER'' username and ''wilhelmina'' password</ref>

==Powers==
Maxwell Lord later in life was confirmed as a metahuman with the ability to telepathically influence people's minds. The extent of his abilities range from simple suggestion to outright commandeering of another's mind as seen with his complete "possession" of Superman where he was able to make the Man of Steel perform acts far outside of the range of his normal sensibilities. Max's power is not of the "zombie" mind control variety, but rather the kind where the people affected go about their daily lives and are unaware of his influence. He also has the ability to influence more than one mind at a time and, at one point, had many people under his control. While the subject's will does factor in on how difficult it is to initially possess and maintain his control, so far no one has been able to avoid his influence for long. Max's power not only affects the actions and predispositions of the victim, but also their perceptions of the world around them, such as in "Generation Lost" where even though Max's rap sheet is displayed in front of someone, they would see something else, like a list of random people named Maxwell Lord in the world. It is not, at this time, known how his power works after the fact, such as whether it works like a post-hypnotic suggestion or if he maintains some continuous, secondary hold on all his "possessions", but in "Generation Lost" #10 (2010) just as [[Batman]], his butler, Alfred, and Power Girl were starting to become aware that something was wrong with their memories and perceptions (and of Max's existence) and were about to start an investigation, the possession took hold again and they forgot everything they were talking about. Seeing as how, generally, the rule of thumb is once someone becomes aware of being controlled, that control is usually broken, this should show just how powerful Max actually is. The main drawback to using his power is the bigger the "push", as he calls his possessions, the more strain and toll it takes on his body. The most common reaction to a big "push" is a nosebleed with other secondary effects including a rapid elevation on body temperature, weakness and possible unconsciousness (Apparently, once the "push" has been effected, he still holds possession even while unconscious). Basically, the bigger the "push", the bigger the toll on his body, the biggest danger being, with a big enough "push", the bigger the possibility of a fatal hemorrhage. In ''Brightest Day'' #1 (after being resurrected), he is seen in hiding preparing for his "Biggest push yet" -a long-lasting alteration of the memories of ''everyone'' on Earth so that they think that he never existed -and has equipped the room with bio-monitors, a large tub of ice to cool his body down and a transfusion machine stocked with his own blood to replace what he would lose from such a venture. This world wide "push" was successful and, as a consequence, caused him to hemorrhage with blood flying out of his nose and ears and then pass out in the tub of ice showing just how powerful he is and the kind of toll it takes on his body. Lastly, it is not known if such strains on his body will have any lasting, long term effects, but as of now, he has learned to safeguard his body against such damage at least in the short run with such medical preparation. In "Justice League: Generation Lost" #4, Lord attempts to use his power on a scientist but not only does it kill the man but his corpse becomes a Black Lantern. Lord suffers a black nosebleed as he moans about this happening again, indicating his powers have taken a dark turn.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Maxjlu.jpg|right|thumb|Maxwell Lord as seen in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
*Maxwell Lord appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Ultimatum" voiced by [[Tim Matheson]]. He is shown as a normal human with no special powers. He acts as the manager of the Ultimen, a superhero team that works independently of the Justice League. It turns out, however, that the Ultimen are a series of artificial life forms cloned and given false memories while interacting with actors portraying their parents. The team was developed with the assistance of [[Project Cadmus]] as part of an ongoing project to protect the earth from the Justice League. As the clones (which are imperfect) die, they are replaced until one generation of the clones learns the truth and escapes. Maxwell is told by [[Amanda Waller]] to get them back or she will call in the "squad" to take them down. The Ultimen ended up attacking Maxwell Lord demanding answers. He told them that they were created to be a better superhero team then the Justice League. When he offers to help them when their lifespan ends, they deny his plea and head back to the building to look for Amanda Waller and their as-yet-unactivated clones. After four of the Ultimen are subdued by the Justice League, Maxwell Lord and Amanda Waller arrived with some Cadmus soldiers and take them into custody to be there for when their lifespan is up.

*Maxwell Lord appeared  in [[Smallville]]'s Season 9 episode "Charade", portrayed by [[Gil Bellows]].<ref>[http://www.kryptonsite.com/maxwell-lord.htm KryptonSite Scoop: Maxwell Lord Is Coming To Smallville!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In this incarnation, he's the Black King of the organization known as [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and had the ability to extract memories from others which he used to try to reveal the identity of "The Blur" (a.k.a. Clark Kent). He was thwarted by Clark but managed to escape only to be apprehended by the mysterious [[Characters of Smallville#Martha Kent|Red Queen]]. She then has him interrogate Tess in a mental illusion to try and find the Book of Rao, however she purposely gives him incorrect information that causes Tess to see through the illusion and escape, knowing that the first thing she will then do is go and move the book to a new hiding place.
