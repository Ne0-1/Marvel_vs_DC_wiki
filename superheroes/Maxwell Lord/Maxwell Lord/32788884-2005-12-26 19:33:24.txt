'''Maxwell Lord''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] Universe.  A shrewd and powerful businessman, he was very influential in the formation of [[Justice League|Justice League International]].

Originally a normal human; Lord was one of many on Earth gifted with super-powers when a '[[Metabomb]]' was exploded by alien invaders.  This bomb activated the latent metagene present in a small percentage of Earthlings.  Lord gained the ability to control the minds of others, albeit at great difficulty.  Exercising this power typically gave Lord a nosebleed. 

After he was shot and placed in a coma, at the start of the 15-part JLAmerica/JLEurope [[fictional crossover|crossover]] ''Breakdowns'', [[Dreamslayer]], a supervillain who, with the aid of the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]], a team of robotic servants had once destroyed all life on their planet, took over Lord's body and "supercharged" this power, allowing him to control thousands of minds at once. Using Lord's body and power, he caused the JLI to lose its charter, and almost forced them to disband. Finally however, while it forced the JLI to battle itself, the mortally-wounded [[Silver Sorceress]] managed to contain Dreamslayer and held it within her mind as she died, taking it with her, and while Lord was freed, his power was burnt out.

Later, he was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]], and was transferred to the robotic body of [[Lord Havok]], one of the Extremists to survive, and, while his original body was buried, he hid the news of his survival for a time. Recently, he pulled together several former JLI members, including [[L-Ron]], [[Captain Atom]], [[Blue Beetle]], [[Booster Gold]] and [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] as the "[[Super Buddies]]," advertised as "Heroes the common man could call."
==Infinite Crisis==

The 2005 80-page one-shot ''Countdown to [[Infinite Crisis]]'' revealed that Lord was, apparently, a criminal mastermind who spent his years running the JLI gathering sensitive information about the world's superheroes, whom he  considered a threat to the planet. At the same time, he sabotaged JLI efforts in order to render the superhero team as ineffectual as possible. At the end of the prologue special issue, ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', he shoots and kills one-time JLI member [[Blue Beetle]] when the hero discovers Lord's secret and refuses Lord's offer to join him.

During this time, Maxwell Lord also subverted Batman's Brother I project (created to monitor all superhuman contact; Batman had grown paranoid when discovering the JLA had mindwiped him; see ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]''), taking it over and creating an army of cyborgs called [[OMACs]] (humans infected with a virus that transformed them into the OMACs) programmed to hunt down and kill all superhumans.

He also used his powers to influence [[Superman]]'s mind, causing him to brutally beat up [[Batman]] and attack [[Wonder Woman]], believing them to be his old enemeis (ie [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], [[Darkseid]], [[Ruin (comics)|Ruin]], and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]).  After barely escaping from Superman, Wonder Woman confronted Maxwell Lord and bound him in her lasso of truth; telling him to tell her how to free Superman; Maxwell tells her she has to kill him, and she snaps his neck. In response, Brother I cast the footage of Wonder Woman murdering Max all over the world, destroying her reputation and her friendship with Batman and Superman (who rejected her despite the fact that she saved their lives).

==Trivia==
*Many fans were angry at Lord's role in the Infinite Crisis saga, as Lord's innermost thought processes had been shown to readers for years without criminal intent; also, the [[Martian Manhunter]] scanned his entire mind and considered him trustworthy. In addition, the fact that he had lost the power in question twice over - once when [[Dreamslayer]] burnt it out, and then lost even the potential for regaining it since he was no longer in his original, human, body - caused controversy.

*At the "Crisis Counseling" panel at WizardWorld: Chicago, [[Dan DiDio]] explained why Maxwell Lord was used. After going through several possible characters who could be the "new leader for the offshoot of Checkmate", Maxwell Lord was suggested. Many of the editors thought that the idea made sense, as Lord had been shown to have a mean streak and to have killed previously. The idea was dropped due to the continuity errors, such as him being a cyborg, but they went back to it later after deciding none of the other possible characters were suitable. "We thought about that aspect of the story [where Maxwell was turned into a cyborg] some more," DiDio explained. "And then asked, 'Did anyone read it?' No. 'Did anyone like the idea?' No. So we moved ahead with Max as being a human, and having been a human, and not letting that small part of the past stand in the way of this story. We wanted what was best for Countdown, and for us, that meant that Max had to be a human."[http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&threadid=40070]
