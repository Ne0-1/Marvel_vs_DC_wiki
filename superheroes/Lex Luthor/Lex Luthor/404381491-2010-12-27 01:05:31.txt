'''Alexander Joseph "Lex" Luthor''' is  a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who appears in [[American comic book|comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. He is the [[archenemy]] of [[Superman]]. Created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], he [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #23 (April [[1940 in comics|1940]]). Luthor is described as "a power-mad, evil scientist" of high intelligence and incredible technological prowess.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] |artist=Sikela, John |story=The Skeletons in Armor |editor=[[Whitney Ellsworth|Ellsworth, Whitney]]|title=[[Action Comics]] |issue=47 |date = April 1942|publisher=[[DC Comics]] |page=1}}</ref> His goals typically center on killing Superman, usually as a stepping stone to [[Hegemony|world domination]]. Though he periodically wears a [[powered exoskeleton]], Luthor has traditionally lacked [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s or a [[Secret identity|dual identity]].<ref name="Comics 166">{{cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-24|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/|title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs.

The character was originally depicted as a [[mad scientist]] who, in the vein of [[pulp novel]]s, wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry. In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown with a full head of red hair; despite this, the character later became hairless as the result of an artist's mistake. A 1960 story by [[Jerry Siegel]] expanded upon Luthor's origin and motivations, revealing him to be a childhood friend of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]'s who lost his hair when Superboy accidentally destroyed his laboratory; Luthor vowed revenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theages.superman.nu/encyc/entries/index.php?entry=luthor |title=The ENCYCLOPÆDIA of SUPERMAN: Lex Luthor |publisher=Theages.superman.nu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15604 |title=GCD :: Issue :: Adventure Comics #271 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

Following the [[1985 in comics|1985]] [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the character was [[retroactive continuity|re-imagined]] as a [[Machiavellian]] [[Business magnate|industrialist]] and [[white-collar crime|white-collar]] criminal, even briefly serving as [[President of the United States]]. In recent years, various writers have revived Luthor's mad scientist persona from the 1940s. The character was ranked as the 8th greatest villain by [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] on its "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>McCallum, Pat (July 2006). "100 Greatest Villains Ever". ''[[Wizard magazine|Wizard]]'' (177)</ref> [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Lex Luthor as #4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/4.html |title=Lex Luthor is Number 4 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

By some accounts{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, the seeds for Luthor's character first appeared in ''[[The Reign of the Super-Man]]'', also written by Siegel and Shuster. In the original [[short story]], a bald scientist uses a piece of alien meteor to give a vagrant named Bill Dunn [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities, which Dunn abuses for personal gain. Although Luthor would not appear until two years after Superman's debut, a central theme to his character&mdash;a dichotomy of science versus superpowers&mdash;was in place.<ref>[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]].

Retrieved on 2008-11-19.</ref> The character's original incarnation, as drawn by Joe Shuster, appeared only twice between 1940-1941. In his debut, "Luthor" (who is referred to only by his [[surname]]) is a wily genius who resides in a flying city suspended by a [[dirigible]]. Having taken control of several [[Europe]]an countries through his machinations, he tries to provoke a war between the two fictional nations of Galonia and Toran, planning to set all the nations of the world at war, but is stopped by [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]].<ref>[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] (w), [[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]] (p, i). ''Action Comics'' #23 (1940). [[DC Comics]].</ref><ref>Daniels (1998), p. 13.</ref> He describes himself as "an ordinary man, but with the brain of a super-genius."

In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown as a middle-aged man with a full head of [[red hair]]. Less than a year later, however, an artistic [[goof]] resulted in Luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip.<ref>Siegel, Jerry (w), Novak, Leo (p, i).

When the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC multiverse]] began to take hold, Luthor's red-haired incarnation was rewritten as Alexei Luthor, Lex's counterpart from the [[Earth-Two]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. In 1960, writer Jerry Siegel altered Luthor's backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin.

In the [[origin story]] printed in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #271 (April 1960), young Lex Luthor is shown as an aspiring scientist who resides in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], the hometown of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]. The teenage Luthor saves Superboy from a chance encounter with [[Kryptonite]]. In gratitude Superboy builds Luthor a laboratory, where weeks later he manages to create an [[artificial life|artificial form of life]]. Grateful in turn to Superboy, Luthor creates an antidote for Kryptonite poisoning. However, an accidental fire breaks out in Luthor's lab. Superboy uses his super-breath to extinguish the flames, inadvertently spilling chemicals which cause Luthor to go bald;<ref name="UGO"/> in the process, he also destroys Luthor's artificial life form. Believing Superboy intentionally destroyed his discoveries, Luthor attributes his actions to jealousy and vows revenge. This revenge causes Luthor's family to disown him and change their names to Thorul. It also leads to years of Superman, Luthor, and [[Supergirl]] concealing the truth from Luthor's sister, [[Lena Luthor|Lena Thorul]]. Luthor's revenge first came in the form of grandiose engineering projects in Smallville to prove his superiority over the superhero, only to have each go disastrously out of control and require Superboy's intervention.  The mounting embarrassments further deepen Lex's hate for Superboy for supposedly further humiliating him and he unsuccessfully attempted to murder the superhero.<ref>[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] (w), Plastino, Al (p). ''"How Luthor Met Superboy!" [[Adventure Comics]]'' #271 (1960).

These elements were played up in various stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in [[Elliot S. Maggin]]'s novel ''[[Last Son of Krypton]]''.<ref name="cbr maggin">{{cite web|author=Callahan, Timothy|date=2008-09-04|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=17934&page=article|title=Elliot S!

===1980s-1990s===
[[Image:Mos4.jpg|175px|right|Cover art to ''[[The Man of the Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' #4, by [[John Byrne]].|thumb]]
In the [[1986 in comics|1986]] limited series [[The Man of Steel (comics)|''The Man of Steel'']], [[John Byrne]] redesigned Lex Luthor from scratch, intending to make him a villain that the 1980s would recognize: an evil [[corporate]] [[Corporate title|executive]]. Initially brutish and overweight, the character later evolved into a sleeker, more athletic version of his old self.  In an example indicative of Byrne's realistic approach, Luthor is no longer recounted as having lost his hair in a chemical fire; rather, his hairline is shown to be receding naturally over time. [[Marv Wolfman]], a writer on Action Comics who had one conversation with Byrne prior to Luthor's reboot<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#31 |title=Who created the "new" Lex Luthor for MAN OF STEEL? |publisher=Byrnerobotics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> recalled:

{{cquote|I never believed the original Luthor. Every story would begin with him breaking out of prison, finding some giant robot in an old lab he hid somewhere, and then he'd be defeated. My view was if he could afford all those labs and giant robots he wouldn't need to rob banks. I also thought later that Luthor should not have super powers. Every other villain had super powers. Luthor's power was his mind. He needed to be smarter than Superman. Superman's powers had to be useless against him because they couldn't physically fight each other and Superman was simply not as smart as Luthor.<ref>Freiman, Barry (2005-11-15).

The [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] Lex Luthor is a product of [[child abuse]] and early poverty. Born in the [[Suicide Slum]] district of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], he is instilled with a desire to become a self-made man. As a teenager, he takes out a large insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge, then sabotages their car's brakes, causing their deaths. Upon graduating from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], Luthor founds his own business, [[LexCorp]], which grows to dominate much of Metropolis.

Luthor does not physically appear in ''The Man of Steel'' until the fourth issue, which takes place over a year after Superman's arrival in Metropolis. When [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]] are invited to a society gala aboard Luthor's [[yacht]], [[terrorism|terrorists]] seize the ship without warning, forcing Superman to intervene.<ref>[[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] (w, p), [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]] (i). ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' #4 (1986). DC Comics.</ref> Luthor observes Superman in action, and once the gunmen are dispatched, hands the hero a personal check in an attempt to hire him. When Luthor admits that he had not only anticipated the attack, but had arranged for it to occur in order to lure Superman out, the Mayor deputizes Superman to arrest Luthor for reckless endangerment. This, coupled with the indignation that Superman is the only person he could not buy off, threaten, or otherwise control, results in Luthor's pledge to destroy Superman at any cost.  As such, he is more than willing to help other businessmen destroy other superbeings.  He was instrumental in the apparent death of [[Swamp Thing]], which jeopardized many lives as the [[Parliament of Trees]] attempted to replace him.<ref>appearance in ''Swamp Thing'' #52-53; consequences in #65-75</ref>

Despite general acceptance of Byrne's characterization, as evidenced by subsequent adaptations in other media, some writers have called for a return to Luthor's original status as a [[mad scientist]].  Regarding the character's effectiveness as a corrupt [[billionaire]], author [[Neil Gaiman]] commented:

{{cquote|It's a pity Lex Luthor has become a [[Multinational corporation|multinationalist]]; I liked him better as a bald scientist. He was in prison, but they couldn't put his mind in prison. Now he's just a skinny [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>Neil Gaiman Interview (December 1994) ''[[Hero Illustrated]]'' #18</ref>}}

Luthor's romantic aspirations toward Lois Lane, established early on in the series, become a focal point of the stories immediately following it.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #424, January 1987.</ref> He is shown making repeated attempts to court her during ''The Man of Steel'', though Lois plainly does not return his feelings.<ref>Byrne, John (w), Giordano, Dick (i).

===Modern depictions===
''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', a limited series written by [[Mark Waid]] in [[2004 in comics|2004]], offers an alternate look at Luthor's history, including his youth in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] and his first encounter with Superman. The story has similarities to the 2001 television series ''[[Smallville]]'',<ref name="cbr bright">{{cite web|author=Singh, Arune|date=2004-03-11|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3256|title=Super-Stars (Part 1): Mark Waid's "Birthright," The Official Origin|work=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> which follows [[Clark Kent]]'s life as a teenager and into early manhood; among the elements shared with the show is Lex Luthor's problematic relationship with his wealthy father, [[Lionel Luthor|Lionel]]. ''Birthright'' also reinvents the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] concept of Luthor befriending Clark Kent as a young man. During a failed attempt to communicate with [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], an explosion erupts which singes off Luthor's hair.<ref>[[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]] (w), [[Leinil Francis Yu|Yu, Leinil Francis]] (p, i). ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' #8 (2004). DC Comics.</ref><ref name="scifi"/> Waid's original intention was to jettison the notion of Lex Luthor being an evil businessman, restoring his status as a mad scientist. However, he ultimately conceded that the [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Luthor would be easier for readers to recognize. In ''Birthright'', Luthor remains a wealthy corporate magnate; in contrast to Byrne's characterization, however, LexCorp is founded upon Luthor's study of [[extraterrestrial life]], thereby providing a link between himself and Superman.<ref name="cbr bright"/><ref>Waid, Mark (w), Yu, Leinil Francis (p, i). ''Superman: Birthright'' #6 (2004). DC Comics.</ref> In the retrospective section of the ''Superman: Birthright'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], Waid explains:

{{cquote|Despite my own personal prejudices, I say we leave Lex the criminal businessman he's been for the past 17 years. The ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'' producers liked it, the [[Superman: The Animated Series|WB cartoon]] guys liked it... so clearly, it works on some level. My concern is that, at least in my eyes, the fact that Luthor's allowed to operate uncontested for ''years'' makes Superman look ineffectual.<ref>[[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]] (2005).

Retrieved on 2008-10-09.</ref> A concise biography for Luthor, later outlined in ''Action Comics'' #850, first appeared in the [[2007 in comics|2007]] limited series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]''. Luthor's current origin appears to be a synthesis of aspects from Silver Age continuity and ''The Man of Steel'' mini-series. Recent changes to DC Comics continuity were revealed to have been a result of the [[2005 in comics|2005]] ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series.

As outlined in a backup profile in the ''52'' weekly series,{{Issue|date=July 2009}} the post-''Action Comics'' #850 Lex Luthor in this continuity is the son of business mogul [[Lionel Luthor]] and his socialite spouse, Leticia. As shown previously in ''Superman: Birthright'' and the pre-''Crisis'' stories, he spends part of his adolescence in Smallville, Kansas. It is here that Luthor comes into acquaintance with Clark Kent, [[Lana Lang]], and [[Pete Ross]]. However, in the 2009-2010 series ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]],'' Luthor and his father, Lionel are both once again poor as a child and an abusive alcoholic father, though residents of Smallville. [[Lena Luthor]], appears back in this version, as his sister. In both versions, he leaves Smallville "under a cloud of rumor and suspicion", after having his father mysteriously killed without anyone finding out the details, and leaving his sister behind as well. He later resurfaces in Metropolis and founds LexCorp.

In this incarnation, Luthor is so powerful that he owned every media in Metropolis and used it to enforce his public image as a wealthy benefactor, while the [[Daily Planet]] had always stood free, even condemning his actions with an outrageous editorial signed by [[Perry White]] himself. As a result, when Clark Kent is first inducted into the Planet, the newspaper is almost bankrupt, dilapidated and unable to afford new reporters. Thanks to Clark Kent's appearance as Superman granting exclusive interviews and photographs to Lois Lane and [[Jimmy Olsen]] when he debuts, the paper's circulation increases 700%. However, the paper's refurbishment is interrupted when the US Army, led by Lois's father, General [[Sam Lane]], forcibly shuts down the business while attempting to force her to tell them everything she knows about the now fugitive superhero after he fled a military interrogation. Thanks to Jimmy's help, Lois manages to escape to help Superman just when he is finished. Sam arrives and orders Superman and Lois arrested. However, the crowd turns on the Army, and Superman orders the crowd to stop, telling them that they, not the Army, not Lex Luthor, nor himself, are meant to be Metropolis's saviors. Knowing Luthor's role in the Army's attack against him, Superman confronts him and tells him that Metropolis doesn't belong to him: "You don't own us." Lex objects, since Superman isn't from Earth. Superman replies, "This is my home," and leaves. The next day, Lex goes to pick another person from the crowd of Metropolis to give a new life to (which he always does as his normal routine), only no one is there. Holding Superman responsible for losing his complete grip over the people of Metropolis, Luthor holds a grudge against Superman, which lasts for an eternity. In both "JLA" and "52," [[Grant Morrison]] states that Luthor's ego leads him to believe that the only reason Superman commits good deeds is to somehow strike at Luthor and prove who is better. Many times, Luthor has stated that he could have aided the entire human race if not for Superman's interference, although both Superman and Conner Kent have called him out on the hypocrisy of this statement.

Luthor's rise to the presidency and his removal from office are also recounted in this biography, however contrary to ''Birthright'' his hair is once again shown to have naturally receded over time, as also shown in ''The Man of Steel''.

Though he is a noted criminal on Earth, Luthor is revered on the alien world of Lexor, where he rediscovered the planet's lost technology and rebuilt society for its inhabitants. He apparently lost a fight to Superman so that water could be transported to the desert planet. He and Superman had originally gone there to have a proper fight as Superman did not want to appear cowardly, as this planet had a red sun meaning Superman lost his powers there. As a result, he becomes a hero in the eyes of Lexor's people, whereas Superman is detested as a villain.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #43, November/December 1946: ''“The Molten World!”''</ref> He eventually marries a local woman named Ardora,<ref>Action Comics # 318, November 1964: ''"The Death of Luthor"''.</ref> with whom he fathers a son.

Luthor eventually returns to Earth, unable to accept his own role in Lexor's destruction and blaming Superman for it.<ref>''Action Comics'' #544, June 1983: ''"Luthor Unleashed"''.</ref>

During the 12-issue limited series ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Luthor allies himself with fellow Superman foe [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] to recruit an army of supervillains spanning the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC multiverse]], intending to take advantage of the confusion caused by the Crisis. However, once it becomes clear that it is as much in their interests to save the multiverse as anyone else's, Luthor and Brainiac reluctantly ally their faction with Superman and the other heroes. At the conclusion of the series, reality is altered so that each of the different universes fall into their proper place, converging into one. Afterward, Luthor is subsequently returned to prison with all his memories of the alliance forgotten.

Luthor is assisted by the extreme unpopularity of the previous administration's mishandling of the [[Gotham City]] earthquake crisis (as depicted in the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline in the Batman titles), and his own seemingly heroic efforts to rebuild Gotham. After six months, Gotham is restored and rejoins America. Ironically, [[Batman]] ultimately learns that the entire debacle was the fault of Luthor alone as he attempted to take control of Gotham by forging deeds for the land in his name, which results in Bruce Wayne severing all commercial ties between the U.S. government and his company, [[Wayne Enterprises]], in protest of Luthor's election as President. Luthor responds in turn by arranging for the murder of Wayne's lover, [[Vesper Fairchild]], and framing Wayne for the murder (as seen in ''[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]'').

An early triumph of Luthor's first term occurs during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' comic book [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], in which he coordinates the U.S. Army, Earth's superheroes, and a number of untrustworthy alien forces to battle the main villain of the story arc, [[Imperiex]]. As it is eventually revealed, however, Luthor knew about the alien invasion in advance and did nothing to alert Earth's heroes to it, leading to the destruction of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]] by an Imperiex probe.

====Removal from office====
The initial story arc of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' ongoing series depicts the fall of Luthor's reign as U.S. President.  In "The World's Finest" (more commonly referred to as "Public Enemies"), a cadre of superheroes eventually break ranks from the [[Justice League]] to oppose Luthor. Batman, who had previously forbidden any attempt to unseat Luthor from office by force, led the storming of the [[White House]]. This was predicated by an attempt on Luthor's part to link Superman to a kryptonite [[asteroid]] that is hurtling toward Earth. In a desperate gambit, Luthor uses a variant combination of the "super-[[steroid]]" Venom (a chemical associated with the Batman villain [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]), liquid synthetic Kryptonite, and an [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] battlesuit to fight Superman directly.

The madness that is a side effect of Venom takes hold, and during the ensuing fight with Superman and Batman, Luthor admits he had traded the creature [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] to [[Darkseid]] in return for weapons during the ''Our Worlds at War'' crisis; in doing so, he inadvertently provides a confession which is captured on video by Batman. Returning to the LexCorp building to regroup, Luthor finds that the acting [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Talia Head]], has sold the entire company to the Wayne Foundation, forcing Luthor to escape and go into hiding. Following Luthor's bankruptcy and total disgrace, Vice President [[Pete Ross]] briefly assumes his place as President. Luthor serves fewer than three years.

In 2009, the story of Luthor's rise and fall as U.S. President was adapted as a [[direct-to-video]] [[animated film]] entitled ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=483 |title=Press Release For "Superman/Batman: Public Enemies" Direct-To-Video Animated Feature |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

====''Infinite Crisis''====
[[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], the son of Earth-Three's Lex Luthor, returned to the DC Universe along with other survivors from ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' as part of a scheme to create a perfect Earth, under the pretense of restoring Earth-Two. To this end, he assumed Luthor's identity and created a new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. In response, the real Luthor took on the identity of '''[[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]]''' and formed the third incarnation of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] in order to counter Alexander's organization.

Luthor confronts his impostor in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #3, but is intercepted by [[Superboy-Prime]], who is allied with Alexander. After discovering that his hybrid clone/"son" [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] was injured by Prime, Luthor contacts [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and gives him the means to help Superboy recover.  Later Luthor himself goes to [[Titans Tower]] and slips Conner a crystal shard which shows the location of Alexander's Arctic Fortress. At the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, Luthor oversees Alexander's execution at the hands of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].

====''52''====
{{Main|52 (comics)}}
[[Image:52weekthirtynine.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Cover art for ''52'': Week 39, by J.G. Jones.]]
In the opening weeks of ''52'', the [[Gotham City Police Department]] finds what appears to be Luthor's body in an alley. [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] examines the body at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and notes that the corpse was altered postmortem to make it resemble Lex Luthor. During a press conference, the genuine Luthor publicly states that the body is that of an impostor from another Earth, and the true culprit of the crimes with which Luthor is being charged.<ref>''[[52 (comics)|52]]'': Week 3</ref> Though Alexander's body had a missing finger and a different appearance from Lex at the time of his death, ''52'' editor Stephen Wacker has confirmed that the body found in Gotham is indeed Alex, and that Luthor had it altered before the police discovered it.<ref>[[Newsarama]] interview with Stephen Wacker [http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/WAcker/Wacker03.html]{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

Luthor immediately sets out to build a church, which he names the Luthoran Church; he becomes spokesman for a new procedure, created by the [[Everyman Project]], that engineers ordinary citizens to develop [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. During the [[autopsy]] of Alex Luthor, he secretly exposes John to the chemicals involved in his creating his new army of superheroes, turning John into a literal man of steel. When approached by John's niece [[Natasha Irons]], Luthor gladly allows her to be one of his first test subjects. Using Natasha and several other volunteers, Luthor forms his own team of superheroes which are introduced as the new [[Infinity Inc.]] In Week 21, Infinity Inc. is in the midst of a battle with [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]] (which Luthor has created as well), when he demonstrates that he can 'shut off' the powers of each of his agents; this results in the death of his [[Speedster (comics)|speedster]], Trajectory.<ref>''52'': Week 21</ref>

At the stroke of midnight on [[New Year's Eve]], Luthor sets in motion a calculated plot to discredit [[Booster Gold#52 and Supernova|Supernova]], a new hero who has taken over defending Metropolis in Superman's absence. Luthor triggers a mass-shutdown of the powers of everyone who has undertaken the Everyman program, except for the members of Infinity Inc. As multiple flight-powered Everymen plummet to their deaths, underground gas mains rupture from the impact, which adds civilians to the death toll. Millions of dollars worth of damage is caused. Luthor's plot ultimately fails when Supernova is able to minimize the disaster with a spectacular rescue.<ref>''52'': Week 35</ref>

While investigating Luthor in order to root out his motive, Natasha Irons discovers that Luthor has been testing himself to see if he is compatible with the artificial [[Metagene|metagene]] treatment.<ref>''52'': Week 39</ref> John Henry Irons leads an assault on Luthor's building; despite the destruction of his armor during the fight, he confronts Luthor - only to find himself badly outclassed, as Luthor demonstrates nearly all of Superman's powers. Luthor considers conquering Earth and renaming it Lexor. However, Natasha uses her uncle's hammer to trigger an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down the synthetic metagene long enough for Steel to knock Lex unconscious.<ref>''52'': Week 40</ref> Lex is disgraced as a result, and later faces indictment when the members of the Everymen realize they have been used.

====''One Year Later'' and ''Countdown''====
{{Main|One Year Later}}
One year after the events of ''Infinite Crisis,'' Luthor has been cleared of over 120 criminal counts ranging from malfeasance to first-degree murder relating to the New Year's Eve massacre from ''52''. However, his role in the massacre has permanently ruined his public image and thanks to the machinations of [[Doctor Sivana]], he has lost most of his wealth and all of his control over his newly reformed LexCorp, which is now being run by [[Lana Lang]]. He blames Clark Kent for writing several articles unraveling his schemes and pledges vengeance on Metropolis after an angry mob jeers him on the courthouse steps. After amassing large quantities of Kryptonite, including kidnapping the supervillains [[Metallo]] and the [[Kryptonite Man]], Lex uses it to power a Kryptonian battleship controlled through a "sunstone" crystal.<ref>''Action Comics'' #839</ref> Superman manages to destroy the Kryptonite-powered ship and recover the crystal, but Lex manages to escape custody yet again.<ref>''Action Comics'' #840</ref>

Lex later sends Bizarro after the newly arrived "Superboy" only for the creature to be defeated by Superman. Undaunted, Luthor gathers together a new [[Superman Revenge Squad|Revenge Squad]] to fight against invading Kryptonians led by [[General Zod]].

In JLA, Luthor (alongside Joker and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] III) gathers together a new "[[Injustice League]]" and, outfitted in a new version of his warsuit (although still green and purple, it no longer has clear design derivations from the pre-Crisis warsuit as the McGuinness design did), sets out to destroy the Justice League with them. On a related note during this section, he was responsible for creating the third [[Shaggy Man (comics)|Shaggy Man]] and the third [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]].

Luthor plays a large role in the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' tie-in event, ''[[Salvation Run]]''. Having been sent to the prison planet after his Injustice League was defeated, Lex quickly assumes control of the amassed villains, receiving competition only from Joker and [[Gorilla Grodd]], who convince half of the villains to join them. He does fight the Joker until the battle was interrupted by an attack by [[Desaad]]'s [[Parademon]]s. After the attack, Luthor manages to get the villains off the planet with a makeshift teleporter, secretly powered by [[Neutron (DC Comics)|Neutron]], [[Aryan Brigade (comics)|Heatmonger]], [[Plasmus (comics)|Plasmus]], [[Warp (comics)|Warp]], and [[Thunder and Lightning (comics)|Thunder and Lightning]]. When called a "monster" by Thunder, Luthor claims it is the ones who sent them there who are the real monsters, and that he is the hero. He later sets the teleporter to self-destruct after he uses it, killing the attacking Parademons, and his living batteries.

====Final Crisis====
{{Main|Final Crisis}}
In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21, Luthor can be seen associating with [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] and placed in its Inner Circle. Lex Luthor wanted Libra to prove himself, so Libra sends [[Clayface]] to blow up the ''Daily Planet'' building. As Lex Luthor attempts to ambush Libra after learning that he is a prophet of Darkseid, Lex Luthor soon ends up surrounded by [[Justifiers]]. Libra tells Lex Luthor to make a final choice... swear an oath to Darkseid or become a mindless slave. In ''Final Crisis'' #5, Lex Luthor is seen when Libra blames [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] for cracking the computer codes that will help the resistance. Lex Luthor is silent on the matter, but has been picked to lead the rearguard action against the heroes at [[Blüdhaven]]. He assumes it's an honor, but he doesn't look very pleased. During ''Final Crisis'' #6, Libra figures out Luthor had been the mole in the Society of Super Villains. Luthor, in league with [[Doctor Sivana]], seemingly destroys [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and overturns the [[Anti-Life Equation]] being broadcast into the Justifiers' helmets.

====New Krypton====
{{Main|Superman: New Krypton}}

Luthor ended up imprisoned for his crimes, but rather than going to jail General [[Sam Lane]] had him serve out his sentence working for the secretive Project 7734.  While still forced to wear chains, Luthor was assigned the job of accessing the knowledge stored within the captured [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]],<ref name="ac871">''Action Comics'' #871 (January 2009)</ref> who had recently been defeated by Superman (as seen during the [[Brainiac (story arc)|"Brainiac"]] storyline). Luthor successfully accessed Brainiac’s brain and after [[Metallo]] and Reactron were taken to [[Kandor]] as prisoners of the [[Kryptonian]]s who had now settled on Earth he used Brainiac to reactivate the [[Colu]]an’s ship that was also being held in Kandor. Brainiac’s robots attacked the Kryptonians, providing a distraction as Metallo and Reactron used their [[Kryptonite]] hearts to kill their captors and murder [[Zor-El]].

After his success with Brainiac, Luthor was given the seemingly dead body of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who had been defeated by the Kryptonians,<ref name="ac871"/> to study as it had “potential”.<ref>''Action Comics'' #873 (March 2009)</ref>

Luthor later manages to use Brainiac's connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor's control, forcing him onboard the ship, and the two make their escape.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #0</ref> The two are later shown to have entered into an alliance, with Brainiac promising Luthor the Earth when he is done with it. While reading newspapers to catch up on what happened during his imprisonment, Luthor learns of the resurrection of Superboy.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #2</ref>  Lex quickly returns to Smallville, where it is revealed that his physically and mentally handicapped sister Lena Luthor is still alive, and living with her daughter Lori.  In an effort to mockingly prove his abilities to Superboy, Lex agrees to cure his sister's illness.  With Superboy's aid, Luthor manages to cure Lena, allowing her to walk and think logically again for a brief moment, before he then quickly reverses the process, leaving Lena completely catatonic, and informs Superboy that so long as Superman is alive, he will never reveal how he did it.  Luthor escapes with Brainiac, leaving Superboy, Lori, and [[Krypto]] horrified at his cruelty.  Because Luthor now sees Superboy as a failed experiment of using the "wrong alien DNA," he and Brainiac create another binary clone with their own genetics for another plan against the entire House of El.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #5-6</ref>

====''Blackest Night''====
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, when word got out that apparently ''everyone'' around the world who have died are rising as undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]s, Luthor isolates himself in his safehouse in fear that ''all'' the people he had murdered over the years would also reanimate and seek revenge on him.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4 (November 2009)</ref> His fear is justified as his victims, including his deceased father, arrive, seeking to feast on his [[avarice]]-filled heart. However, Luthor escapes after receiving a [[Orange Lantern Corps|power ring]] fueled by the orange light of avarice and becomes a deputy of the Orange Lanterns. Luthor arrives at [[Coast City]] and joins the battle against the Black Lantern Corps.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (February 2010)</ref> Luthor engages battle with the Black Lantern versions of Superman and Superboy. However, the Agent Orange [[Larfleeze]] wants Luthor's ring off, as the alien does not want to share his power with him, resulting in them battling each other for it despite all of the dangers around them.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #50 (January 2010)</ref> Luthor is able to use all of the people he has killed as his own Orange Lanterns, and seeks to add Superman to their numbers.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #51 (February 2010)</ref> Luthor is quickly overwhelmed by his greed, and sets out to steal the rings of his fellow inducted Lanterns, taking [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]]'s ring and attempting to steal [[Mera (comics)|Mera]]'s, but is held back by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and the [[Barry Allen|Flash]]. When [[Wonder Woman]] uses her magical lasso to restrain Luthor, under its spell of truth, Luthor is forced to confess that he secretly wants to be Superman.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #7 (February 2010)</ref> When [[Nekron]] is defeated, Larfleeze takes the ring from Luthor, leaving him powerless, and allows Luthor to remain on Earth with the [[Green Lantern]]s (although [[Sinestro]] notes that this is the first time Larfleeze has given anyone anything).<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>

In the aftermath of the crisis, Luthor, craving the power of the orange light, recovers and operates on several Black Lantern remains in an attempt to find one with a ring still on its finger. He is then visited by Larfleeze, who demands to know what is important to the people of Earth. Luthor responds with "power", which Larfleeze already possesses, and "land", which intrigues the alien.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #53 (April 2010)</ref>

====''Last Stand of New Krypton''/''War of the Supermen''====
{{Main|Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton}}
{{Main|Superman: War of the Supermen}}
As part of his participation in Project 7734, Luthor sends a robot double of himself with Brainiac on a mission to attack New Krypton.  While there, the Luthor robot tampers with the body chemistry of the previously-captured Reactron.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #52 (June 2010)</ref>  Shortly thereafter, Reactron kills himself, initiating a chain reaction which ultimately destroys New Krypton and all but a handful of its 100,000 Kryptonian inhabitants.  Supergirl's mother [[Alura]] (who had assumed leadership of the planet) is among the casualties.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[James Robinson (comics)|Robinson, James]] and [[Sterling Gates|Gates, Sterling]]|Title = Superman: War of the Supermen|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = May 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> For his efforts, Luthor receives a presidential pardon for his past crimes.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[James Robinson (comics)|Robinson, James]] and [[Sterling Gates|Gates, Sterling]]|Title = Superman: War of the Supermen|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = May 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

====''Brightest Day'': ''Action Comics''-"The Black Ring"====
After the conclusion of the ''New Krypton'' event, Luthor became the lead character in ''[[Action Comics]]'' and will remain so until issue #900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/06/22/paul-cornell-on-action-comics-890-and-beyond/ |title=Paul Cornell on Action Comics #890 and Beyond @ DC's The Source |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> Written by [[Paul Cornell]], the first story entitled "The Black Ring" explores Luthor's more aggressive lust for power in the wake of his exposure to a [[power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event. After being infused with the [[Larfleeze|Orange Light of Avarice]], Luthor begins a universal quest to locate the energy of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]|Title = [[Action Comics]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 890|Date = June 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

During the midst of the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event, [[Deathstroke]] and his new team of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]] are hired to assassinate Luthor while he is visiting [[Midway City]] with Nava Mendelssohn, his new personal assistant and bodyguard. When the Titans ambush Lex's convoy and begin killing his hired mercenaries, Nava takes him into the sewers, where she is shot and apparently killed by Deathstroke. It is then revealed that Luthor himself had paid the Titans to fake an attempt on his life, in hopes that it would draw out conspirators within LexCorp.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24</ref> Nava's injuries soon heal, and she reveals herself to be a shapeshifter named Facade, who had murdered and impersonated the real Nava in order to get close enough to Lex to kill him. After a massive battle, Deathstroke and [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Amon Tomaz|Osiris]] are able to defeat Facade, and then turn him over to Lex. In the end, LexCorp scientists are shown performing experiments on the captured Facade, while Luthor assembles his staff and reveals that he knows that it was one of his employees who had hired the creature in the first place. Luthor warns them not to try such a tactic again, as he will turn them into his next morbid experiment if they do.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #25</ref>

==Relationships and family==
In the pre-''Crisis'' continuity, Luthor is shown as having very few personal attachments. Shamed by his crimes, his parents ('''Jules and Arlene''') disown him, move away, and change their name to the [[anagram]] "Thorul". Luthor has a younger sister named '''[[Lena Luthor|Lena]]''', an [[empathy|empath]] who grows up unaware of her familial connection with the noted supervillain. Lena, like Lex, also attended Regis High School. Protective of his sister, Luthor takes measures to hide his fraternity, and is assisted towards this end by both [[Superman]] and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Lena Thorul later marries [[FBI]] agent '''Jeff Colby'''<ref>Action Comics #317 (October, 1964)</ref> (who had once arrested Lex), later giving birth to a son, '''Val Colby'''.<ref>Adventure Comics #387, (December 1969)</ref> Jeff Colby dies some time later.<ref>Revealed in Superman Family #211, (October, 1981)</ref>

In the Post-''Crisis'' continuity, Lena is the name of Lex's adopted sister when he was living in a foster home.  She is accidentally killed by their foster father when she refuses to try and trick Lex out of his inheritance.  Lex later names his baby daughter after her.  However, following the events of the ''Infinite Crisis'', Luthor's history was again altered, re-introducing Lena as his sister.  Unlike the Pre-''Crisis'' version, Lena is well-aware of history with Lex, having grown up alongside him, with only an abusive father.  She has no empathic abilities, and is a paraplegic with a teenaged daughter, '''Lori''', both of whom still live in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]].<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (Vol. 2) #5 (December 2009)</ref> Unlike his pre-''Crisis'' version, Lex has little love for his sister, having abandoned her with an unnamed aunt after their father dies of a heart attack.  Lex even goes so far as to cure Lena's illness, and then immediately undoes the process, leaving her completely catatonic, solely in order to make a mocking point to Superboy and Superman.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (Vol. 2) #6 (January 2009)</ref> Lena is currently under the care of the best doctors from Wayne Enterprises, hired by [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]].

Lex Luthor himself later marries '''Ardora''' of the planet Lexor and, in ''Action Comics'' #544 (June, 1983), first learns of his infant son by Ardora, '''Lex Luthor, Jr.''' A short time later, Lexor is destroyed and both Ardora and Lex, Jr. die as a direct result.

The Pre-''Crisis'' Luthor also has a niece named '''Nasthalia Luthor''' who is an occasional thorn in Supergirl's side.<ref>Adventure Comics #397 (September, 1970)</ref>

In post-''The Man of Steel'' continuity, Luthor is childhood friends with [[Perry White]] and it is revealed that Luthor is the biological father of Perry's dead son '''Jerry White'''.<ref>''The World of Metropolis #1''</ref> Lex Luthor has been married eight times, though the first seven marriages occurred off-panel in Luthor's past. His eighth marriage to '''Contessa Erica Alexandra Del Portenza''' (aka the "Contessa") is based on mutual greed;<ref>''Superman: The Man of Tomorrow'' #5.</ref> the Contessa buys controlling interest in LexCorp after Luthor is indicted, compelling him to marry her in order to regain control of his company. The Contessa becomes pregnant<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #119</ref> and starts using the [[Lena Luthor|unborn child]] to dominate Lex into doing her bidding. Luthor's response is to imprison her while she is drugged during childbirth, keeping her in a permanently-unconscious state. The Contessa later escapes to an island mansion,<ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #77.</ref> but upon being elected President, Luthor targets her home with a barrage of missiles and destroys it.<ref>''President Luthor: Secret Files & Origins'' #1.</ref>  Luthor's daughter Lena was the avatar of The Tech, the remnant cyberware of Metropolis after [[Brainiac 13]]'s advancing the city to a futuristic state was undone.

[[James D. Hudnall]]'s ''Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography'' further expands on Luthor's origin. The story details how Luthor was sent to live with a foster family following the sabotage of his parents' car. His foster parents, '''Casey and Emily Griggs''', conspire to embezzle his insurance, and coerce their daughter, Lena, into seducing Lex in order to learn the location of the money. Due to her own romantic feelings toward Lex, Lena refuses, and is beaten to death by her father. Lex is absent from the home at the time of the murder, having been talked into going to a football game by his schoolmate [[Perry White]].<ref>''Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography'' (1989)</ref> Once he has established his preeminence in Metropolis, Luthor takes vengeance on Griggs, secretly hiring him to assassinate Frank Berkowitz, the city's popular four-term mayor, who refuses to knuckle under to Luthor's dominance, then personally killing him once the deed is done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=griggs-casey |title=Who's Who in the Superman Comics |publisher=Superman Homepage |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

As an adult, this incident motivates Luthor to begin an affair with Perry's wife, Alice, during a period when Perry is missing and assumed dead. Alice becomes pregnant shortly afterward, though the timing of the conception means an equal possibility of either Luthor or White being the father. The child, Jerry White, later learns of his true parentage during his late teens, shortly before being killed by a local street gang he is associated with. The loss of a potential heir weighs heavily on Luthor's mind, particularly when he is dying of cancer; while mulling over his fate, Luthor visits Jerry's gravesite.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #49.</ref>

Luthor has shown an unusual level of compassion for '''[[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]]''', a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] clone created from the DNA of Superman and Luthor himself. After Conner's death at the conclusion of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Luthor is shown visiting a memorial statue of Conner in Metropolis and placing flowers there.<ref>''Action Comics'' #837</ref> More than once Luthor addresses Conner as his son.  Following Conner's resurrection, Luthor is shocked and decides to locate him.  When Brainiac accuses him of showing paternal feelings for Conner though, Luthor denies it, saying that he only wants his property back, and has no fatherly feelings towards Superboy. Apparently, Luthor is no longer affectionate to the Boy of Steel after the event at his sister's house, and now seeing Superboy as a "failed experiment" due to using "a wrong alien DNA" to combine with his own.  Luthor creates another binary clone with Brainiac using their genetics, which implies that it would becomes a threat to Superboy.

In the alternate future timeline of ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'',<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #17-19 (2005)</ref> in which Conner still exists, Luthor acts as a caring, fatherly figure to him.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #51 (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lex Luthor has the physical capabilities and limitations of a normal adult with no [[metahuman]] abilities.  However, he possesses a genius level of intelligence.  For virtually his entire publication history, he has been depicted as the most intelligent human in the [[DC Universe]], and as one of the most intelligent beings of any planet or species.  He has mastered seemingly every known form of science, including [[Spaceflight|space travel]], [[hyperspace (science fiction)|extra-dimensional travel]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer]]s, [[synthetic polymer]]s, [[communication]]s, [[mutation]]s, [[transportation]], [[holography]], [[energy development|energy generation]], [[spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]], and more (including [[time travel]] in many Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] stories).  With the exception of the renegade [[Colu]]an scientist [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], he does not view any other being as an intellectual peer.

Over the years, Luthor has made liberal use of kryptonite weapons capable of injuring Superman and other Kryptonians.  Since the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age of Comics]], he has also utilized various battlesuits in many stories.  Additionally, he often wore a kryptonite ring on his right hand in Post-Crisis stories, but abandoned this tactic after prolonged exposure to K-radiation resulted in the loss of his hand and poisoned his entire body (requiring him to transplant his brain into a cloned body in order to survive).

[[File:Luthor Superman II.JPG|thumb|right|Lex Luthor, played by Gene Hackman, crashes the White House in ''Superman II'']]

[[Lyle Talbot]] was the first actor to portray the character in a live-action film, appearing in the [[1950 in film|1950]] [[serial film|serial]] ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]''.<ref>Daniels (1998), p. 75.</ref> The character has appeared in all of the modern [[Superman (film series)|''Superman'' films]], with the exception of ''[[Superman III]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]). In the original [[Richard Donner]] films, Luthor is a vain, wisecracking money-hungry gangster, with a particular fixation on real estate, who plots outrageous disasters for Superman to try to avert. He is regularly captured by Superman and sent to prison, only to escape &mdash; in a manner similar to the comics &mdash; at the opening of the next film. This version of Luthor appears to have little personal dislike for Superman, other than the fact the hero interferes with his criminal schemes. He still displays the scientific expertise that the traditional Luthor exhibited, being able to trace Zod and his cohorts by monitoring their radioactive signatures, and masterminding the creation of the Nuclear Man. This version of Luthor also favors hairpieces to conceal his baldness.

[[Gene Hackman]] portrays Luthor in the [[Superman (film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]], along with two of its sequels, ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]). In the films, Luthor is established as an elusive, high-profile criminal who has taken refuge in an extensively restored abandoned subway station under the streets of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He is initially fixated on making billions from a massive real-estate swindle, but after being foiled by Superman, shifts his focus to the history and biology of the Kryptonian himself. Unlike in most other portrayals, Hackman's Luthor appears to view Superman as a respectable and challenging foe rather than a subject of intense hatred.  Luthor, as portrayed by Hackman, is somewhat light and comical, resembling a fast talking con artist more than a criminal mastermind; often attempting to talk his way out of trouble. As a result, Luthor is initially not taken seriously by General Zod or Ursa.  Although he attempts to kill Superman on multiple occasions, he also expresses his pleasure with Superman's genius intellect and ability to "keep up with" Luthor's speeches and schemes.<ref>''Superman'', Richard Donner, 1978</ref><ref>''Superman IV: The Quest For Peace'', Sidney J. Furie, 1987</ref>

[[John Shea]] portrayed Lex in the 1990s TV series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' as a charming and debonair philanthropist and [[polymath]], the owner of the massive [[LexCorp]]. He is established early on as "the 3rd richest man in the world", behind [[Bill Gates]] and the fictional Arthur Chow. He is secretly, however, a ruthless and power-hungry individual involved in many criminal enterprises and obsessed with defeating and killing Superman. Unlike other version of the character, Shea's Lex has a full head of hair for the majority of the series. Shea addressed this by stating "Hey, this is the '90s. Do you think a billionaire like Luthor couldn't get himself a full head of hair? Lex Luthor has got to be a modern villain." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://mutantxarchive.livejournal.com/588569.html |title=Scott Williams, November 28th, 1993, Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=Mutantxarchive.livejournal.com |date=1993-11-28 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

In 2004, Kurt Carley portrayed Luthor in [[Sandy Collora]]'s fan film ''World's Finest''.

In [[2006 in film|2006]], the role was inherited by [[Kevin Spacey]] in ''[[Superman Returns]]'', set sometime after the events of ''Superman II''. Following another stint in jail, during Superman's absence from Earth to investigate the remains of Krypton, Luthor is released on a string of technicalities and seduces a dying widow in order to marry her and inherit her fortune. The widow dies shortly after Superman's return to Earth, and Luthor immediately sets out to avenge himself, first by ransacking the Fortress of Solitude, and later through the abduction of [[Lois Lane]] and her son Jason. Spacey's Luthor continues the real-estate fixation of the Hackman version, but also appears to have a real personal animus toward Superman. Both the Hackman and Spacey versions of Luthor surround themselves with bungling henchmen and dim-witted molls.

Other actors who have portrayed Luthor include [[Scott James Wells]] and [[Sherman Howard]] in the television series ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]''; and [[Michael Rosenbaum]] in the 2000s/2010s series ''[[Smallville]]''. He has also been voiced in animation by [[Jackson Beck]] in the 1960s series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'', [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]] in the 1970s/1980s ''[[Super Friends]]'' franchise, [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] in the 1988 [[Superman (TV series)|''Superman'']] animated series, and by [[Clancy Brown]] in the 1990s/2000s [[DC animated universe]], as well as a 2007 episode of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' and the 2009 direct-to-[[DVD]] animated feature ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', among others. [[Chris Noth]] portrays Luthor in the animated DVD release ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=4 0 |url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/VoicesFromKrypton/news/?a=11344 |title=WORLD EXCLUSIVE: The Making of "Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths" |publisher=Comicbookmovie.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/news/2009-news/2009-news-movie.php?topic=2009-news-movie/1203 |title=Chris Noth Talks '&#39;Crisis on Two Earths'&#39; |publisher=Supermanhomepage.com |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> Lex Luthor is also a playable character in 2008's ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', sporting his trademark battle armor.

While Lex Luthor has not appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' TV series, a character named '''Rohtul''' (Luthor spelled backwards) appears in the episode "The Super-Batman of Planet X!" He appears as the Lex Luthor of Zur-En-Arrh and possibly the arch enemy of [[Batman of Zur-En-Arrh|the Batman of that world]]. He discovers Earth Batman's super weakness and plans to use it against him. Rohtul is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]] (the voice of Lex Luthor from the [[DCAU]]).
