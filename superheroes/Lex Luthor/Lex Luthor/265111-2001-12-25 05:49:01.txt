'''Alexander Joseph Luthor''', or "Lex" Luthor as he is more famously known, is the principal antagonist of [[Superman]]. He first appeared in [[Action Comics]] #23 (April, [[1940]]) and although his history has been [[retcon|retconned]] many times since then his current [[canon|canonical]] origin is revealed in Man Of Steel #4 (August, [[1986]]). Starting out as an orphan in [[Metropolis]]' "suicide slums," Lex Luthor worked his way up to wealth and fame as a wealthy business tycoon.



Lex Luthor is the CEO of LexCorp International, based out of [[Metropolis]]. He was the most powerful man in Metropolis until Superman arrived. When terrorists attacked a society gala aboard his yacht shortly after his arrival, Luthor observed Superman in action and then tried to hire him as a bodyguard. But when Luthor admitted that he'd expected the attack, Mayor Berkowitz deputized Superman to arrest Luthor for reckless endangerment. Luthor vowed to destroy Superman for this humiliation, and he has since devoted much time and energy to that goal; he is a man driven to be the best, having fought his way up from lowly beginnings by his own effort, and is resentful of how Superman was given his powers by random fate of birth. Superman survived every attempt but has never been able to prove Luthor's role in the attacks.



LexCorp's other experimentations with [[Kryptonite]] have had significant impact on Superman over the years, at one point inadvertantly transmuting all Kryptonite on [[Earth]] into [[iron]] when an attempt was made to use it as a  power source. Later, to secure another piece of the now-rare Kryptonite, Luthor's men captured the Kryptonite-powered [[cyborg]] [[Metallo]] just before Metallo succeeded in killing Superman. Luthor suffered from a severe [[cancer]] in the [[1990s]], caused by the long-term radiation from a fragment of Metallo's Kryptonite set into his ring for protection from Superman. Kryptonite exposure had not previously been thought to be harmful to non-Kryptonian life forms.



Luthor's hand had to be amputated to prevent the cancer's spread, but unfortunately by then it had already metastatized; it was eventually determined that the disease was terminal. Luthor faked his own death shortly afterward by taking his private jet aloft and crashing it in some mountains, using this as cover for the [[transplant]] of his [[brain]] into a healthy [[clone]] of himself which he then passed off as his son and heir. Later, when his new body also grew terminally ill for other reasons, he had his brain again transplanted into a new cloned body that resumed the identity of the original Luthor.



Lex Luthor has cultivated a popular image as a great philanthropist; he has been instrumental in reverse-engineering alien technology for use in general consumer goods, upgrading Metropolis into a true "city of tomorrow," and when [[Gotham City]] was destroyed by an earthquake and then abandoned by the American government it was LexCorp that took up the massive task of rebuilding. He also played an instrumental role in assisting the [[Justice League]] in recharging the [[Sun]] during "The Final Night" crisis.



Lex became the 43rd [[president of the United States]] in [[2000]], winning the election on a platform of promoting technological progress (his first action as president was to take a proposed moratorium on fossil-based fuels to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in hopes of putting "a flying car in every garage"). He was assisted by the extreme unpopularity of the previous administration due to its mishandling of the Gotham City earthquake crisis; even given Luthor's tendancy towards covert supervillainy, he could well prove to be a better choice for the office.



Luthor is married and has several children.
