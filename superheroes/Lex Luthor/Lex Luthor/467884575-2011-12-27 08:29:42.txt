'''Lex Luthor''' is  a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who appears in [[American comic book|comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]],  and the [[archenemy]] of [[Superman]], although given his high status as a supervillain, he has also come into conflict with [[Batman]] and other [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Universe]]. Created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], he [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #23 (April [[1940 in comics|1940]]). Luthor is described as "a power-mad, evil scientist" of high intelligence and incredible technological prowess.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] |artist=Sikela, John |story=The Skeletons in Armor |editor=[[Whitney Ellsworth|Ellsworth, Whitney]]|title=[[Action Comics]] |issue=47 |date = April 1942|publisher=[[DC Comics]] |page=1}}</ref> His goals typically center on killing Superman, usually as a stepping stone to [[Hegemony|world domination]]. Though he periodically wears a [[powered exoskeleton]], Luthor has traditionally lacked [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s or a [[Secret identity|dual identity]].<ref name="Comics 166">{{cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-24|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/|title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs.

The character was originally depicted as a [[mad scientist]] who, in the vein of [[pulp novel]]s, wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry. In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown with a full head of red hair; despite this, the character later became hairless as the result of an artist's mistake. A 1960 story by [[Jerry Siegel]] expanded upon Luthor's origin and motivations, revealing him to be a childhood friend of [[Superman (Kal-El)|Superman]]'s who lost his hair when a fire destroyed his laboratory; Luthor vowed revenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theages.superman.nu/encyc/entries/index.php?entry=luthor |title=The ENCYCLOPÆDIA of SUPERMAN: Lex Luthor |publisher=Theages.superman.nu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15604 |title=GCD :: Issue :: Adventure Comics #271 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

Following the [[1985 in comics|1985]] [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the character was [[retroactive continuity|re-imagined]] as a [[Machiavellian]] [[Business magnate|industrialist]] and [[white-collar crime|white-collar]] criminal, even briefly serving as [[President of the United States]]. In recent years, various writers have revived Luthor's mad scientist persona from the 1940s. The character was ranked as the 8th greatest villain by [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] on its "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>McCallum, Pat (July 2006). "100 Greatest Villains Ever".

===Creation and development===

By some accounts{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, the seeds for Luthor's character first appeared in ''[[The Reign of the Super-Man]]'', also written by Siegel and Shuster. In the original [[short story]], a bald scientist uses a formula created from a piece of alien meteor to give a vagrant named Bill Dunn [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities, which Dunn abuses for personal gain. The scientist battles Dunn and is killed, but by the end of the story Dunn realises his power is going and soon he will have to rejoin the bread line. Although Luthor would not appear until two years after Superman's debut, a central theme to his character&mdash;a dichotomy of science versus superpowers&mdash;was in place.<ref>[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Superman: The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Man of Steel''. Chronicle Books, 1998, pg. 66.

Retrieved on 2008-11-19.</ref> The character's original incarnation, as drawn by Joe Shuster, appeared only twice between 1940-1941. In his debut, "Luthor" (who is referred to only by his [[surname]]) is a wily genius who resides in a flying city suspended by a [[dirigible]]. Having taken control of several [[Europe]]an countries through his machinations, he tries to provoke a war between the two fictional nations of Galonia and Toran with the help of the crooked Galonian General Lupo planning to set all the nations of the world at war, but is stopped by [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]]. Superman first 'sees' Luthor in a cave which Lupo has gone into to contact him. On a stone slab a face appears which Lupo talks to. Superman goes in and tries to make Lupo tell him who Luthor is, but the face reappears and a green ray slices the stricken General in half.<ref>[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] (w), [[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]] (p, i). ''Action Comics'' #23 (1940). [[DC Comics]].</ref><ref>Daniels (1998), p. 13.</ref> He describes himself as "an ordinary man, but with the brain of a super-genius." He sends his two henchmen to get Clark, they find Lois in his room and seize her to prevent her speaking, then take her up to the base where she meets Luthor. One of the guards is not under Luthor's command and leaves a note in Clark's room which tells him Lois is in danger. Superman follows the plane to the dirigible. Luthor attempts to kill Superman after threatening to kill Lois, but despite being weakened by his destruction ray, Superman is able to destroy it. At the end of the story, Luthor was apparently killed when Superman caused the dirigible to crash. He returns in Superman #4, first trying to use a stolen Earthquake machine and challenging Superman to a duel of his science vs Superman's powers, which Superman wins; however, this was just a distraction to allow him to steal the machine. Despite Superman destroying his base,  Luthor apparently escapes, with Superman destroying the machine and the scientist who made it committing suicide to prevent its reinvention. In a story in the same issue, he is also shown to have created a city on the sunken [[Lost continent|Lost Continent]] of Pacifo and to have recreated prehistoric monsters, which he plans to unleash upon the world after draining oil wells dry. After Clark and Lois fly there, a [[pterodactyl]] attacks their plane, killing the pilot. Though Superman defeats it, he sees that shock has placed Lois in a coma. Luthor apparently dies here after being attacked by his monsters, after which Superman breaks the city's glass cover, causing the ocean to destroy it. Clark then takes Lois to a doctor who revives her, and proceeds to cover the story. However, Luthor returns in Superman #5 with a plan to place hypnotic gas in the offices of influential people, intending to throw the nation into a depression with the help of corrupt financier Moseley. By the end of the story, he is once again defeated.

In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown as a middle-aged man with a full head of [[red hair]]. Less than a year later, however, an artistic [[goof]] resulted in Luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip.<ref>Siegel, Jerry (w), Novak, Leo (p, i).

When the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC multiverse]] began to take hold, Luthor's red-haired incarnation was rewritten as Alexei Luthor, Lex's counterpart from the [[Earth-Two]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. In 1960, writer Jerry Siegel altered Luthor's backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin.

In the [[origin story]] printed in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #271 (April 1960), young Lex Luthor is shown as an aspiring scientist who resides in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], the hometown of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]. The teenage Luthor saves Superboy from a chance encounter with [[Kryptonite]]. In gratitude Superboy builds Luthor a laboratory, where weeks later he manages to create an [[artificial life|artificial life-form]], which Luthor loved as if his own child. Grateful in turn to Superboy, Luthor creates an antidote for Kryptonite poisoning. However, an accidental fire breaks out in Luthor's lab. Superboy uses his super-breath to extinguish the flames, inadvertently spilling chemicals which cause Luthor to go bald;<ref name="UGO"/> in the process, he also destroys Luthor's artificial life form. Believing Superboy intentionally destroyed his discoveries, Luthor attributes his actions to jealousy and vows revenge. Luthor's revenge first came in the form of grandiose engineering projects in Smallville to prove his superiority over the superhero, only to have each go disastrously out of control and require Superboy's intervention.  The mounting embarrassments further deepen Lex's hate for Superboy for supposedly further humiliating him and he unsuccessfully attempted to murder the superhero.<ref>[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] (w), Plastino, Al (p). ''"How Luthor Met Superboy!" [[Adventure Comics]]'' #271 (1960). DC Comics.</ref> This revised origin makes Luthor's fight with Superman a personal one, and suggests that if events had unfolded differently, Luthor might have been a more noble person. These elements were played up in various stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in [[Elliot S. Maggin]]'s novel ''[[Last Son of Krypton]]''.<ref name="cbr maggin">{{cite web|author=Callahan, Timothy|date=2008-09-04|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=17934&page=article|title=Elliot S!

It also leads to years of Superman, Luthor, and [[Supergirl]] concealing the truth from Luthor's sister, [[Lena Luthor|Lena Thorul]]. She was told her brother died in a rock-climbing accident. She has ESP powers due to touching one of Luthor's inventions. Once she found out about Luthor being her brother and briefly lost her memory. However Luthor broke out of prison and gave her flowers he had developed that removed the bad memory from her mind.

In [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Alexei Luthor is killed by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]],<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' # 9 (December 1985)</ref> and is subsequently erased from history with the rest of the [[DC multiverse]].

In the [[1986 in comics|1986]] limited series [[The Man of Steel (comics)|''The Man of Steel'']], [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] redesigned Lex Luthor from scratch, intending to make him a villain that the 1980s would recognize: an evil [[corporate]] [[Corporate title|executive]]. Initially brutish and overweight, the character later evolved into a sleeker, more athletic version of his old self.  In an example indicative of Byrne's realistic approach, Luthor is no longer recounted as having lost his hair in a chemical fire; rather, his hairline is shown to be receding naturally over time. [[Marv Wolfman]], a writer on Action Comics who had one conversation with Byrne prior to Luthor's reboot<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#31 |title=Who created the "new" Lex Luthor for MAN OF STEEL? |publisher=Byrnerobotics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> recalled:

{{cquote|I never believed the original Luthor. Every story would begin with him breaking out of prison, finding some giant robot in an old lab he hid somewhere, and then he'd be defeated. My view was if he could afford all those labs and giant robots he wouldn't need to rob banks. I also thought later that Luthor should not have super powers. Every other villain had super powers. Luthor's power was his mind. He needed to be smarter than Superman. Superman's powers had to be useless against him because they couldn't physically fight each other and Superman was simply not as smart as Luthor.<ref>Freiman, Barry (2005-11-15).

The [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] Lex Luthor is a product of [[child abuse]] and early poverty. Born in the [[Suicide Slum]] district of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], he is instilled with a desire to become a self-made man. As a teenager, he takes out a large insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge, then sabotages their car's brakes, causing their deaths. Upon graduating from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], Luthor founds his own business, [[LexCorp]], which grows to dominate much of Metropolis.

Luthor does not physically appear in ''The Man of Steel'' until the fourth issue, which takes place over a year after Superman's arrival in Metropolis. When [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]] are invited to a society gala aboard Luthor's [[yacht]], [[terrorism|terrorists]] seize the ship without warning, forcing Superman to intervene.<ref>[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] (w, p), [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]] (i). ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' #4 (1986). DC Comics.</ref> Luthor observes Superman in action, and once the gunmen are dispatched, hands the hero a personal check in an attempt to hire him. When Luthor admits that he had not only anticipated the attack, but had arranged for it to occur in order to lure Superman out, the Mayor deputizes Superman to arrest Luthor for reckless endangerment. This, coupled with the indignation that Superman is the only person he could not buy off, threaten, or otherwise control, results in Luthor's pledge to destroy Superman at any cost.  As such, he is more than willing to help other businessmen destroy other superbeings.  He was instrumental in the apparent death of [[Swamp Thing]], which jeopardized many lives as the [[Parliament of Trees]] attempted to replace him.<ref>appearance in ''Swamp Thing'' #52-53; consequences in #65-75</ref>

Despite general acceptance of Byrne's characterization, as evidenced by subsequent adaptations in other media, some writers have called for a return to Luthor's original status as a [[mad scientist]].  Regarding the character's effectiveness as a corrupt [[billionaire]], author [[Neil Gaiman]] commented:

{{cquote|It's a pity Lex Luthor has become a [[Multinational corporation|multinationalist]]; I liked him better as a bald scientist. He was in prison, but they couldn't put his mind in prison. Now he's just a skinny [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>Neil Gaiman Interview (December 1994) ''[[Hero Illustrated]]'' #18</ref>}}

Luthor's romantic aspirations toward Lois Lane, established early on in the series, become a focal point of the stories immediately following it.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #424, January 1987.</ref> He is shown making repeated attempts to court her during ''The Man of Steel'', though Lois plainly does not return his feelings.<ref>Byrne, John (w), Giordano, Dick (i).

''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', a limited series written by [[Mark Waid]] in [[2004 in comics|2004]], offers an alternate look at Luthor's history, including his youth in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] and his first encounter with Superman. The story has similarities to the 2001 television series ''[[Smallville]]'',<ref name="cbr bright">{{cite web|author=Singh, Arune|date=2004-03-11|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3256|title=Super-Stars (Part 1): Mark Waid's "Birthright," The Official Origin|work=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> which follows [[Clark Kent]]'s life as a teenager and into early manhood; among the elements shared with the show is Lex Luthor's problematic relationship with his wealthy father, [[Lionel Luthor|Lionel]]. ''Birthright'' also reinvents the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] concept of Luthor befriending Clark Kent as a young man.

However, he ultimately conceded that the [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Luthor would be easier for readers to recognize. In ''Birthright'', Luthor remains a wealthy corporate magnate; in contrast to Byrne's characterization, however, LexCorp is founded upon Luthor's study of [[extraterrestrial life]], thereby providing a link between himself and Superman.<ref name="cbr bright"/><ref>Waid, Mark (w), Yu, Leinil Francis (p, i). ''Superman: Birthright'' #6 (2004). DC Comics.</ref> In the retrospective section of the ''Superman: Birthright'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], Waid explains:

{{cquote|Despite my own personal prejudices, I say we leave Lex the criminal businessman he's been for the past 17 years. The ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'' producers liked it, the [[Superman: The Animated Series|WB cartoon]] guys liked it... so clearly, it works on some level.

Retrieved on 2008-10-09.</ref> A concise biography for Luthor, later outlined in ''Action Comics'' #850, first appeared in the [[2007 in comics|2007]] limited series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]''.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} Luthor's current origin appears to be a synthesis of aspects from Silver Age continuity and ''The Man of Steel'' mini-series. Recent changes to DC Comics continuity were revealed to have been a result of the [[2005 in comics|2005]] ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series.

As outlined in a backup profile in the ''52'' weekly series,{{Issue|date=July 2009}} the post-''Action Comics'' #850 Lex Luthor in this continuity is the son of business mogul [[Lionel Luthor]] and his socialite spouse, Leticia. As shown previously in ''Superman: Birthright'' and the pre-''Crisis'' stories, he spends part of his adolescence in Smallville, Kansas. It is here that Luthor comes into acquaintance with Clark Kent, [[Lana Lang]], and [[Pete Ross]]. However, in the 2009-2010 series ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]],'' Luthor and his father, Lionel are both once again poor as a child and an abusive alcoholic father, though residents of Smallville. [[Lena Luthor]], appears back in this version, as his sister.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} In both versions, he leaves Smallville "under a cloud of rumor and suspicion", after having his father mysteriously killed without anyone finding out the details, and leaving his sister behind as well. He later resurfaces in Metropolis and founds LexCorp.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

In this incarnation, Luthor is so powerful that he owned every media in Metropolis and used it to enforce his public image as a wealthy benefactor, while the [[Daily Planet]] had always stood free, even condemning his actions with an outrageous editorial signed by [[Perry White]] himself. As a result, when Clark Kent is first inducted into the Planet, the newspaper is almost bankrupt, dilapidated and unable to afford new reporters. Thanks to Clark Kent's appearance as Superman granting exclusive interviews and photographs to Lois Lane and [[Jimmy Olsen]] when he debuts, the paper's circulation increases 700%. However, the paper's refurbishment is interrupted when the US Army, led by Lois's father, General [[Sam Lane]], forcibly shuts down the business while attempting to force her to tell them everything she knows about the now fugitive superhero after he fled a military interrogation. Thanks to Jimmy's help, Lois manages to escape to help Superman just when he is finished. Sam arrives and orders Superman and Lois arrested. However, the crowd turns on the Army, and Superman orders the crowd to stop, telling them that they, not the Army, not Lex Luthor, nor himself, are meant to be Metropolis's saviors.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} Knowing Luthor's role in the Army's attack against him, Superman confronts him and tells him that Metropolis doesn't belong to him: "You don't own us." Lex objects, since Superman isn't from Earth. Superman replies, "This is my home", and leaves. The next day, Lex goes to pick another person from the crowd of Metropolis to give a new life to (which he always does as his normal routine), only no one is there. Holding Superman responsible for losing his complete grip over the people of Metropolis, Luthor holds a grudge against Superman, which lasts for an eternity. In both "JLA" and "52," [[Grant Morrison]] states that Luthor's ego leads him to believe that the only reason Superman commits good deeds is to somehow strike at Luthor and prove who is better, arguing that it is impossible for Superman to be as 'good' as he appears to be. 

Many times, Luthor has stated that he could have aided the entire human race if not for Superman's interference, claiming that he gives humanity a goal that they could realistically strive to duplicate while Superman makes them reach for the impossible. However, both Superman and Conner Kent have called him out on the hypocrisy of this statement, noting that he has regularly turned down easy opportunities to willingly help others simply because he would have sacrificed the opportunity to kill Superman by doing so, showing that his ego is more important to him than humanity. Even when Superman was depowered after the Battle of Metropolis<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref> and remained out of sight for a year, the only thing Luthor accomplished with this time was the self-sabotaged 'Everyman' project and "found [himself] a big destructive machine so [he] could break things" while claiming that Superman drove him to this.<ref>''Superman'' #653</ref> This idea was further reinforced when Luthor was briefly merged with a near-omnipotent entity that sought peace after its difficult 'childhood'; while merged with the entity, Luthor had the power to bring peace and bliss to the entire universe, potentially becoming a hero greater even than Superman, but Luthor fought against that power simply because he would have had to share that bliss with Superman as well.

Though he is a noted criminal on Earth, Luthor is revered on the alien world of Lexor, where he rediscovered the planet's lost technology and rebuilt society for its inhabitants. He apparently lost a fight to Superman so that water could be transported to the desert planet, as he had reactivated digging machines but discovered he could not find water. He and Superman had originally gone to the world to have a proper fight as Superman did not want to appear cowardly after Luthor over a radio challenged him to a fight, as this planet had a red sun meaning Superman lost his powers there. As a result, he becomes a hero in the eyes of Lexor's people, whereas Superman is detested as a villain.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #43, November/December 1946: ''“The Molten World!”''</ref> He eventually marries a local woman named Ardora,<ref>Action Comics # 318, November 1964: ''"The Death of Luthor"''.</ref> with whom he fathers a son, Lex Luthor, Jr. After its debut,<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (vol. 1) #164.</ref> Lexor appears sporadically in various Superman comics as Luthor's base of operations, where he wages assaults on Superman.

However, once it becomes clear that it is as much in their interests to save the multiverse as anyone else's, Luthor and Brainiac reluctantly ally their faction with Superman and the other heroes.

As part of the continuity changes which followed ''The Man of Steel'' and ''Superman: Secret Origin'', Luthor is shown actively participating in the creation of three ''Superman'' villains, [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] (indirectly), [[Bizarro]] (the failed result of an attempt to clone Superman), and the [[cyborg]] [[Metallo]]. Upon discovering that Metallo is powered by a 'heart' of [[kryptonite]] rock in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #2, Luthor steals it in order to fashion a kryptonite [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]] for himself. He wears the alien ore around his finger as a symbol that he is untouchable, even to the Man of Steel, after carrying out a series of kidnappings to try to determine the nature of the connection between Superman and Clark Kent. However, although computer analysis of the assembled data revealed that Clark Kent and Superman were the same person, Luthor dismissed the results because he believed that he 'knew' that someone as powerful as Superman would never choose to live a normal human life.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #22, February 1987</ref> Luthor eventually suffers from severe [[cancer]] brought on by long-term [[Radiation poisoning|radiation exposure]] to the ring;<ref>''Action Comics'' #600.</ref> before this, kryptonite was mistakenly assumed to produce a 'clean' radiation that is harmless to humans. His hand requires [[amputation]] to prevent the cancer's spread,<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | inker = [[John Beatty (illustrator)|Beatty, John]] | story = The Power That Failed! | title = Superman | volume = 2 | issue = 19 |date = July 1988| publisher = [[DC Comics]] | page = 12 }}</ref> but by then it has already [[Metastasis|metastasized]], and his condition is terminal.

Luthor decides to fake his own death by piloting a prototype jet on a proposed trip around the world and crashing it in the [[Andes]]; this is merely a cover for the removal of his brain from his cancer-ridden body and the growth of a [[Human cloning|cloned]] body around it, whereupon he passes himself off as his hitherto unknown, illegitimate 21-year-old son and heir, '''Lex Luthor II'''. His deception is benefited by a vibrant new body with a beard and full head of red hair, as well as assuming an Australian accent as part of his fake backstory.<ref>''Action Comics'' #670.</ref> As Luthor II, he inherits control of LexCorp and seduces [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]] (a [[protoplasm]]ic clone of an alternative universe [[Lana Lang]]), due to his resemblance to her creator (the alternative universe's Luthor).<ref>''Action Comics'' #677.</ref> Luthor's clone body eventually begins to deteriorate and age (and lose its hair) at a rapid rate, a side-effect of a disease that affects all clones.

In the end, Luthor becomes a permanent prisoner in his own body, unable to even blink, and swearing vengeance on Superman.

Aid comes in the form of the demon [[Neron]]; Luthor is offered full health in exchange for services and his soul.  Not believing in the existence of souls, he agrees.<ref>''Superman: The Man of Tomorrow'' #3.</ref> Returning to Metropolis, Luthor freely turns himself over to the police and is put on trial. He is acquitted on all counts when Luthor claims to have been kidnapped by renegade scientists from [[Cadmus Labs]], who replaced him with a violent clone that is allegedly responsible for all the crimes with which Luthor is charged.<ref>''Action Comics'' #737</ref>

====President of the United States====
[[Image:Lex2000.jpg|left|160px|thumb|right|Cover to ''Lex 2000'' #1, featuring Lex Luthor as [[President of the United States]]. Art by [[Glen Orbik]].]]
Deciding to turn to politics, Luthor becomes [[President of the United States]], winning the election on a platform of promoting technological progress. His first action as president was to take a proposed moratorium on fossil-based fuels to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].

Luthor is assisted by the extreme unpopularity of the previous administration's mishandling of the [[Gotham City]] earthquake crisis (as depicted in the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline in the Batman titles), and his own seemingly heroic efforts to rebuild Gotham. After six months, Gotham is restored and rejoins America. Ironically, [[Batman]] ultimately learns that the entire debacle was the fault of Luthor alone as he attempted to take control of Gotham by forging deeds for the land in his name, which results in [[Bruce Wayne]] severing all commercial ties between the U.S. government and his company, [[Wayne Enterprises]], in protest of Luthor's election as President. Luthor responds in turn by arranging for the murder of Wayne's lover, [[Vesper Fairchild]], and framing Wayne for the murder (as seen in ''[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]'').

An early triumph of Luthor's first term occurs during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' comic book [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], in which he coordinates the U.S. Army, Earth's superheroes, and a number of untrustworthy alien forces to battle the main villain of the story arc, [[Imperiex]]. As it is eventually revealed, however, Luthor knew about the alien invasion in advance and did nothing to alert Earth's heroes to it, leading to the destruction of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]] by an Imperiex probe.

====Removal from office====
The initial story arc of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' ongoing series depicts the fall of Luthor's reign as U.S. President.  In "The World's Finest" (more commonly referred to as "Public Enemies"), a cadre of superheroes eventually break ranks from the [[Justice League]] to oppose Luthor. Batman, who had previously forbidden any attempt to unseat Luthor from office by force, led the storming of the [[White House]]. This was predicated by an attempt on Luthor's part to link Superman to a kryptonite [[asteroid]] that is hurtling toward Earth, claiming that he had 'evidence'- which he declined to share while claiming that it would make the public laud his actions if they knew it- that the asteroid was being drawn to Earth by Superman, offering a billion dollar reward for Superman's capture that pitted Superman and Batman against an army of villains, all of whom they defeated. In a desperate gambit, Luthor uses a variant combination of the "super-[[steroid]]" Venom (a chemical associated with the Batman villain [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]), liquid synthetic Kryptonite, and an [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] battlesuit to fight Superman directly.

The madness that is a side effect of Venom takes hold, and during the ensuing fight with Superman and Batman, Luthor admits he had traded the creature [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] to [[Darkseid]] in return for weapons during the ''Our Worlds at War'' crisis; in doing so, he inadvertently provides a confession which is captured on video by Batman. Returning to the LexCorp building to regroup after Superman damaged his battlesuit, Luthor finds that the acting [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Talia Head]], has sold the entire company to the Wayne Foundation, forcing Luthor to escape and go into hiding. Following Luthor's bankruptcy and total disgrace, Vice President [[Pete Ross]] briefly assumes his place as President. Luthor serves fewer than three years.

In 2009, the story of Luthor's rise and fall as U.S. President was adapted as a [[direct-to-video]] [[animated film]] entitled ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=483 |title=Press Release For "Superman/Batman: Public Enemies" Direct-To-Video Animated Feature |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

====''Infinite Crisis''====
[[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] (the son of [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-Three|Earth-Three's version of Luthor]]) returned to the DC Universe along with other survivors from ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' as part of a scheme to create a perfect Earth, under the pretense of restoring Earth-Two. To this end, he assumed Luthor's identity and created a new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. In response, the real Luthor took on the identity of '''[[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]]''' and formed the third incarnation of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] in order to counter Alexander's organization.

Luthor confronts his impostor in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #3, but is intercepted by [[Superboy-Prime]] (a teenage version of Superman from [[Earth Prime#Superboy-Prime|Earth-Prime]]), who is allied with Alexander. After discovering that his hybrid clone/"son" [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] (Superboy) was injured by Prime, Luthor contacts [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and gives him the means to help Superboy recover.  Later Luthor himself goes to [[Titans Tower]] and slips Conner a crystal shard which shows the location of Alexander's Arctic Fortress. At the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, Luthor oversees Alexander's execution at the hands of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].

====''52''====
{{Main|52 (comics)}}
[[Image:52weekthirtynine.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Cover art for ''52'': Week 39, by J.G. Jones.]]
In the opening weeks of ''52'', the [[Gotham City Police Department]] finds what appears to be Luthor's body in an alley. [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] examines the body at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and notes that the corpse was altered postmortem to make it resemble Lex Luthor. During a press conference, the genuine Luthor publicly states that the body is that of an impostor from another Earth, and the true culprit of the crimes with which Luthor is being charged.<ref>''[[52 (comics)|52]]'': Week 3</ref> Though Alexander's body had a missing finger and a different appearance from Lex at the time of his death, ''52'' editor Stephen Wacker has confirmed that the body found in Gotham is indeed Alex, and that Luthor had it altered before the police discovered it.<ref>[[Newsarama]] interview with Stephen Wacker [http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/WAcker/Wacker03.html]{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

Luthor immediately sets out to build a church, which he names the Luthoran Church; he becomes spokesman for a new procedure, created by the [[Everyman Project]], that engineers ordinary citizens to develop [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. During the [[autopsy]] of Alexander Luthor Jr., he secretly exposes John to the chemicals involved in his creating his new army of superheroes, turning John into a literal man of steel. When approached by John's niece [[Natasha Irons]], Luthor gladly allows her to be one of his first test subjects. Using Natasha and several other volunteers, Luthor forms his own team of superheroes which are introduced as the new [[Infinity Inc.]] In Week 21, Infinity Inc. is in the midst of a battle with [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] (which Luthor has created as well), when he demonstrates that he can 'shut off' the powers of each of his agents; this results in the death of his [[Speedster (comics)|speedster]], Trajectory.<ref>''52'': Week 21</ref>

At the stroke of midnight on [[New Year's Eve]], Luthor sets in motion a calculated plot to discredit [[Booster Gold#52 and Supernova|Supernova]], a new hero who has taken over defending Metropolis in Superman's absence. Luthor triggers a mass-shutdown of the powers of everyone who has undertaken the Everyman program, except for the members of Infinity Inc. As multiple flight-powered Everymen plummet to their deaths, underground gas mains rupture from the impact, which adds civilians to the death toll. Millions of dollars worth of damage is caused. Luthor's plot ultimately fails when Supernova is able to minimize the disaster with a spectacular rescue.<ref>''52'': Week 35</ref>

While investigating Luthor in order to root out his motive, Natasha Irons discovers that Luthor has been testing himself to see if he is compatible with the artificial [[metagene]] treatment.<ref>''52'': Week 39</ref> John Henry Irons leads an assault on Luthor's building; despite the destruction of his armor during the fight, he confronts Luthor - only to find himself badly outclassed, as Luthor demonstrates nearly all of Superman's powers. Luthor considers conquering Earth and renaming it Lexor. However, Natasha uses her uncle's hammer to trigger an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down the synthetic metagene long enough for Steel to knock Lex unconscious.<ref>''52'': Week 40</ref> Lex is disgraced as a result, and later faces indictment when the members of the Everymen realize they have been used.

====''One Year Later'' and ''Countdown''====
{{Main|One Year Later}}
One year after the events of ''Infinite Crisis,'' Luthor has been cleared of over 120 criminal counts ranging from malfeasance to first-degree murder relating to the New Year's Eve massacre from ''52''. However, his role in the massacre has permanently ruined his public image and thanks to the machinations of [[Doctor Sivana]], he has lost most of his wealth and all of his control over his newly reformed LexCorp, which is now being run by [[Lana Lang]]. He blames Clark Kent for writing several articles unraveling his schemes and pledges vengeance on Metropolis after an angry mob jeers him on the courthouse steps. After amassing large quantities of Kryptonite, including kidnapping the supervillains [[Metallo]] and the [[Kryptonite Man]], Lex uses it to power a Kryptonian battleship controlled through a "sunstone" crystal.<ref>''Action Comics'' #839</ref> Superman manages to destroy the Kryptonite-powered ship and recover the crystal- simultaneously confronting Lex with the fact that, despite his claims that Superman has been 'holding him back' from helping humanity, the only thing he accomplished with Superman being absent for a year was to find a large robot that he used to try to destroy everything-, but Lex manages to escape custody yet again.<ref>''Action Comics'' #840</ref>

Lex later sends Bizarro after the newly arrived "Superboy", only for the creature to be defeated by Superman. Undaunted, Luthor gathers together a new [[Superman Revenge Squad|Revenge Squad]] to fight against invading Kryptonians led by [[General Zod]], leaving Superman alive to provide assistance simply because he believed that this 'invasion' was proof that he had been right about Superman all along and he wanted Superman to live with that knowledge.

In JLA, Luthor (alongside Joker and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] III) gathers together a new "[[Injustice League]]" and, outfitted in a new version of his warsuit, sets out to destroy the Justice League with them. On a related note during this section, he was responsible for creating the third [[Shaggy Man (comics)|Shaggy Man]] and the third [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]].

Luthor plays a large role in the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' tie-in event, ''[[Salvation Run]]''. Having been sent to the prison planet after his Injustice League was defeated, Lex quickly assumes control of the amassed villains, receiving competition only from Joker and [[Gorilla Grodd]], who convince half of the villains to join them. He does fight the Joker until the battle was interrupted by an attack by [[Desaad]]'s [[Parademon]]s. After the attack, Luthor manages to get the villains off the planet with a makeshift teleporter, secretly powered by [[Neutron (DC Comics)|Neutron]], [[Aryan Brigade (comics)|Heatmonger]], [[Plasmus (comics)|Plasmus]], [[Warp (comics)|Warp]], and [[Thunder and Lightning (comics)|Thunder and Lightning]]. When called a "monster" by Thunder, Luthor claims it is the ones who sent them there who are the real monsters, and that he is the hero. He later sets the teleporter to self-destruct after he uses it, killing the attacking Parademons, and his living batteries.

====Final Crisis====
{{Main|Final Crisis}}
In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21, Luthor can be seen associating with [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] and placed in its Inner Circle. Lex Luthor wanted Libra to prove himself, so Libra sends [[Clayface]] to blow up the ''Daily Planet'' building. As Lex Luthor attempts to ambush Libra after learning that he is a prophet of Darkseid, Lex Luthor soon ends up surrounded by [[Justifiers]]. Libra tells Lex Luthor to make a final choice... swear an oath to Darkseid or become a mindless slave. In ''Final Crisis'' #5, Lex Luthor is seen when Libra blames [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] for cracking the computer codes that will help the resistance. Lex Luthor is silent on the matter, but has been picked to lead the rearguard action against the heroes at [[Blüdhaven]]. He assumes it's an honor, but he doesn't look very pleased. Libra later figures out Luthor had been the mole in the Society of Super Villains. Luthor, in league with [[Doctor Sivana]], seemingly destroys [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and overturns the [[Anti-Life Equation]] being broadcast into the Justifiers' helmets.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #6</ref> He subsequently assists Superman in leading the assault against Darkseid's forces, noting that Superman can consider this a legendary first team-up between 'good' and 'bad'- with Luthor's side taking the credit for the win-, Superman accepting the deal due to the stakes. Luthor later assists Superman and his remaining allies in constructing the new [[Miracle Machine]] to reset the universe and recreate the universe without Darkseid<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7</ref>

====New Krypton====
{{Main|Superman: New Krypton}}

Luthor ended up imprisoned for his crimes, but rather than going to jail General [[Sam Lane]] had him serve out his sentence working for the secretive Project 7734.  While still forced to wear chains, Luthor was assigned the job of accessing the knowledge stored within the captured [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]],<ref name="ac871">''Action Comics'' #871 (January 2009)</ref> who had recently been defeated by Superman (as seen during the [[Brainiac (story arc)|"Brainiac"]] storyline). Luthor successfully accessed Brainiac’s brain and after [[Metallo]] and [[Reactron]] were taken to [[Kandor]] as prisoners of the [[Kryptonian]]s who had now settled on Earth he used Brainiac to reactivate the [[Colu]]an’s ship that was also being held in Kandor. Brainiac’s robots attacked the Kryptonians, providing a distraction as Metallo and Reactron used their [[Kryptonite]] hearts to kill their captors and murder [[Zor-El]].

After his success with Brainiac, Luthor was given the seemingly dead body of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who had been defeated by the Kryptonians,<ref name="ac871"/> to study as it had “potential”.<ref>''Action Comics'' #873 (March 2009)</ref>

Luthor later manages to use Brainiac's connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor's control, forcing him onboard the ship, and the two make their escape.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #0</ref> The two are later shown to have entered into an alliance, with Brainiac promising Luthor the Earth when he is done with it. While reading newspapers to catch up on what happened during his imprisonment, Luthor learns of the resurrection of Superboy.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #2</ref>  Lex quickly returns to Smallville, where it is revealed that his physically and mentally handicapped sister Lena Luthor is still alive, and living with her daughter Lori.  In an effort to mockingly prove his abilities to Superboy, Lex agrees to cure his sister's illness.  With Superboy's aid, Luthor manages to cure Lena, allowing her to walk and think logically again for a brief moment, before he then quickly reverses the process, leaving Lena completely catatonic, and informs Superboy that so long as Superman is alive, he will never reveal how he did it.  Luthor escapes with Brainiac, leaving Superboy, Lori, and [[Krypto]] horrified at his cruelty.  Because Luthor now sees Superboy as a failed experiment of using the "wrong alien DNA," he and Brainiac create another binary clone with their own genetics for another plan against the entire House of El.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #5-6</ref>

====''Last Stand of New Krypton'' and ''War of the Supermen''====
{{Main|Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton|Superman: War of the Supermen}}
As part of his participation in Project 7734, Luthor sends a robot double of himself with Brainiac on a mission to attack New Krypton.  While there, the Luthor robot tampers with the body chemistry of the previously-captured Reactron.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #52 (June 2010)</ref>  Shortly thereafter, Reactron kills himself, initiating a chain reaction which ultimately destroys New Krypton and all but a handful of its 100,000 Kryptonian inhabitants.  Supergirl's mother [[Alura]] (who had assumed leadership of the planet) is among the casualties.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[James Robinson (comics)|Robinson, James]] and [[Sterling Gates|Gates, Sterling]]|Title = Superman: War of the Supermen|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = May 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> For his efforts, Luthor receives a presidential pardon for his past crimes.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[James Robinson (comics)|Robinson, James]] and [[Sterling Gates|Gates, Sterling]]|Title = Superman: War of the Supermen|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = May 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

====''Blackest Night''====
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, when word got out that apparently ''everyone'' around the world who have died are rising as undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]s, Luthor isolates himself in his safehouse in fear that ''all'' the people he had murdered over the years would also reanimate and seek revenge on him.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4 (November 2009)</ref> His fear is justified as his victims, including his deceased father, arrive, seeking to feast on his [[avarice]]-filled heart. However, Luthor escapes after receiving a [[Orange Lantern Corps|power ring]] fueled by the orange light of avarice and becomes a deputy of the Orange Lanterns. Luthor arrives at [[Coast City]] and joins the battle against the Black Lantern Corps.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (February 2010)</ref> Luthor engages battle with the Black Lantern versions of Superman and Superboy. However, the Agent Orange [[Larfleeze]] wants Luthor's ring off, as the alien does not want to share his power with him, resulting in them battling each other for it despite all of the dangers around them.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #50 (January 2010)</ref> Luthor is able to use all of the people he has killed as his own Orange Lanterns, and seeks to add Superman to their numbers.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #51 (February 2010)</ref> Luthor is quickly overwhelmed by his greed, and sets out to steal the rings of his fellow inducted Lanterns, taking [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]]'s yellow ring and attempting to steal [[Mera (comics)|Mera]]'s red one, but is held back by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]](wielding the ring-staff of the Indigo tribe) and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] wearing a Blue Lantern Ring. When deputy Violet Lantern [[Wonder Woman]] uses her magical lasso to restrain Luthor, under its spell of truth, Luthor is forced to confess that he secretly wants to be Superman.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #7 (February 2010)</ref> When [[Nekron]] is defeated, Larfleeze takes the ring from Luthor, leaving him powerless, and allows Luthor to remain on Earth with the [[Green Lantern]]s (although [[Sinestro]] notes that this is the first time Larfleeze has given anyone anything).<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>

In the aftermath of the crisis, Luthor, craving the power of the orange light, recovers and operates on several Black Lantern remains in an attempt to find one with a ring still on its finger. He is then visited by Larfleeze, who demands to know what is important to the people of Earth. Luthor responds with "power", which Larfleeze already possesses, and "land", which intrigues the alien.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #53 (April 2010)</ref>

====''Brightest Day'': ''Action Comics''-"The Black Ring"====
After the conclusion of the ''New Krypton'' event, Luthor became the lead character in ''[[Action Comics]]'' and will remain so until issue #900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/06/22/paul-cornell-on-action-comics-890-and-beyond/ |title=Paul Cornell on Action Comics #890 and Beyond @ DC's The Source |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> Written by [[Paul Cornell]], the first story entitled "The Black Ring" explores Luthor's more aggressive lust for power in the wake of his exposure to a [[power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event. After being infused with the [[Larfleeze|Orange Light of Avarice]], Luthor begins a universal quest to locate the energy of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]|Title = [[Action Comics]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 890|Date = June 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

During the midst of the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event, [[Deathstroke]] and his new team of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]] are hired to assassinate Luthor while he is visiting [[Midway City]] with Nava Mendelssohn, his new personal assistant and bodyguard. When the Titans ambush Lex's convoy and begin killing his hired mercenaries, Nava takes him into the sewers, where she is shot and apparently killed by Deathstroke. It is then revealed that Luthor himself had paid the Titans to fake an attempt on his life, in hopes that it would draw out conspirators within LexCorp.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24</ref> Nava's injuries soon heal, and she reveals herself to be a shapeshifter named Facade, who had murdered and impersonated the real Nava in order to get close enough to Lex to kill him. After a massive battle, Deathstroke and [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Amon Tomaz|Osiris]] are able to defeat Facade, and then turn him over to Lex. In the end, LexCorp scientists are shown performing experiments on the captured Facade, while Luthor assembles his staff and reveals that he knows that it was one of his employees who had hired the creature in the first place. Luthor warns them not to try such a tactic again, as he will turn them into his next morbid experiment if they do.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #25</ref>

While searching for the energy of the Black Lantern simultaneously dispatching various [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] 'clones' created from the original to distract Earth's heroes by [[Reign of Doomsday|sending them]] after the other members of the Superman family with the aid of a robotic duplicate of Lois Lane created to give him an honest opinion on his actions, Luthor encountered Brainiac in space while attempting to alter the last of the Black Lantern energy, acting upon an unspoken theory of his. Brainiac revealed that Loisbot was an unwilling pawn in his bid to hijack Luthor's quest. Luthor then replied that he had anticipated this for some time, and he then attacked Brainiac and snapped his neck, temporarily incapacitating him. Loisbot pleaded for Lex's forgivness, and he accepted her apology. However, after he altered the four remaining black spheres, he opened a Phantom Zone portal which unleashed an extremely powerful, monstrously large being which prepared to kill all life in the universe, because the negative emotions of sentient creatures hurt it. Luthor promptly impaled Loisbot's head, allowing himself to be infected with Krypontian technology which he used to engage the monster on a mental plane of existence. Grappling with the creature, Luthor's body and mental essence suddenly fused with it, learning that it evolved in the Phantom Zone and now seeks to escape from the grief and anger of the Zone prisoners. Using his new power, Luthor draws Superman to him, attempting to drive Superman mad by forcing him to experience the human emotions that he believes the alien merely fakes to blend in. However, Luthor is outraged when he learns that Superman's defining moment of tragedy is the loss of [[Jonathan and Martha Kent#Post-Birthright|his father]]. Luthor is unable to cope with the fact that not only was his greatest enemy raised by humans, but he also had a father he would actually mourn rather than the anguish Luthor endured in his own relationship with his father. As Luthor becomes one with the creature, Superman and [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil#Return|Mr. Mind]] who has been aiding Luthor's search realise that the creature allows Luthor to create a feeling of peace and bliss throughout the entire universe, at the cost of never allowing him to cause any harm to another being at the same time. Superman attempts to appeal to Luthor about the potential of doing something even he never accomplished, but Luthor is unable to let go of his hate for Superman, costing him control of the entity as well as his memory of everything he learned or did while he was merged with it and it departs for another part of the universe. Luthor is ultimately defeated when he falls into one of the Phantom Zone holes created by the creature, seemingly forever.<ref>''Action Comics'' #900</ref>

==Relationships and family==
In the pre-''Crisis'' continuity, Luthor is shown as having very few personal attachments. Shamed by his crimes, his parents ('''Jules and Arlene''') disown him, move away, and change their name to the [[anagram]] "Thorul". Luthor has a younger sister named '''[[Lena Luthor|Lena]]''', an [[empathy|empath]] who grows up unaware of her familial connection with the noted supervillain. Lena, like Lex, also attended Regis High School. Protective of his sister, Luthor takes measures to hide his fraternity, and is assisted towards this end by both [[Superman]] and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Lena Thorul later marries [[FBI]] agent '''Jeff Colby'''<ref>Action Comics #317 (October, 1964)</ref> (who had once arrested Lex), later giving birth to a son, '''Val Colby'''.<ref>Adventure Comics #387, (December 1969)</ref> Jeff Colby dies some time later.<ref>Revealed in Superman Family #211, (October, 1981)</ref> After Lena has brain surgery the decision is made to reveal the truth about Luthor to her. There is some reconciliation between them when Luthor discovers he was an unwitting party to a conspiracy against Lena, which was masterminded by his cellmate "Sam", who wanted revenge against Colby. He is deeply apologetic to Lena.<ref>Superman Family #212 - #214, (November 1981-January 1982)</ref>

In the Post-''Crisis'' continuity, Lena is the name of Lex's adopted sister when he was living in a foster home.  She is accidentally killed by their foster father when she refuses to try to trick Lex out of his inheritance.  Lex later names his baby daughter after her.  However, following the events of the ''Infinite Crisis'', Luthor's history was again altered, re-introducing Lena as his sister.  Unlike the Pre-''Crisis'' version, Lena is well-aware of history with Lex, having grown up alongside him, with only an abusive father.  She has no empathic abilities, and is a paraplegic with a teenaged daughter, '''Lori''', both of whom still live in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]].<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (Vol. 2) #5 (December 2009)</ref> Unlike his pre-''Crisis'' version, Lex has little love for his sister, having abandoned her with an unnamed aunt after their father dies of a heart attack.  Lex even goes so far as to cure Lena's illness, and then immediately undoes the process, leaving her completely catatonic, solely in order to make a mocking point to Superboy and Superman.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (Vol. 2) #6 (January 2009)</ref> Lena is currently under the care of the best doctors from Wayne Enterprises, hired by [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]].

Lex Luthor himself later marries '''Ardora''' of the planet Lexor and, in ''Action Comics'' #544 (June, 1983), first learns of his infant son by Ardora, '''Lex Luthor, Jr.''' A short time later, Lexor is destroyed and both Ardora and Lex, Jr. die as a direct result.

The Pre-''Crisis'' Luthor also has a niece named '''Nasthalia Luthor''' who is an occasional thorn in Supergirl's side.<ref>Adventure Comics #397 (September, 1970)</ref>

In post-''The Man of Steel'' continuity, Luthor is childhood friends with [[Perry White]] and it is revealed that Luthor is the biological father of Perry's dead son '''Jerry White'''.<ref>''The World of Metropolis #1''</ref> Lex Luthor has been married eight times, though the first seven marriages occurred off-panel in Luthor's past. His eighth marriage to '''Contessa Erica Alexandra Del Portenza''' (aka the "Contessa") is based on mutual greed;<ref>''Superman: The Man of Tomorrow'' #5.</ref> the Contessa buys controlling interest in LexCorp after Luthor is indicted, compelling him to marry her in order to regain control of his company. The Contessa becomes pregnant<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #119</ref> and starts using the [[Lena Luthor|unborn child]] to dominate Lex into doing her bidding. Luthor's response is to imprison her while she is drugged during childbirth, keeping her in a permanently-unconscious state. The Contessa later escapes to an island mansion,<ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #77.</ref> but upon being elected President, Luthor targets her home with a barrage of missiles and destroys it.<ref>''President Luthor: Secret Files & Origins'' #1.</ref>  Luthor's daughter Lena was the avatar of The Tech, the remnant cyberware of Metropolis after [[Brainiac 13]]'s advancing the city to a futuristic state was undone.

[[James D. Hudnall]]'s ''Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography'' further expands on Luthor's origin. The story details how Luthor was sent to live with a foster family following the sabotage of his parents' car. His foster parents, '''Casey and Emily Griggs''', conspire to embezzle his insurance, and coerce their daughter, Lena, into seducing Lex in order to learn the location of the money. Due to her own romantic feelings toward Lex, Lena refuses, and is beaten to death by her father. Lex is absent from the home at the time of the murder, having been talked into going to a football game by his schoolmate [[Perry White]].<ref>''Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography'' (1989)</ref> Once he has established his preeminence in Metropolis, Luthor takes vengeance on Griggs, secretly hiring him to assassinate Frank Berkowitz, the city's popular four-term mayor, who refuses to knuckle under to Luthor's dominance, then personally killing him once the deed is done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=griggs-casey |title=Who's Who in the Superman Comics |publisher=Superman Homepage |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

As an adult, this incident motivates Luthor to begin an affair with Perry's wife, Alice, during a period when Perry is missing and assumed dead. Alice becomes pregnant shortly afterward, though the timing of the conception means an equal possibility of either Luthor or White being the father. The child, Jerry White, later learns of his true parentage during his late teens, shortly before being killed by a local street gang he is associated with. The loss of a potential heir weighs heavily on Luthor's mind, particularly when he is dying of cancer; while mulling over his fate, Luthor visits Jerry's gravesite.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #49.</ref>

Luthor has shown an unusual level of compassion for '''[[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]]''', a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] clone created from the DNA of Superman and Luthor himself. After Conner's death at the conclusion of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Luthor is shown visiting a memorial statue of Conner in Metropolis and placing flowers there.<ref>''Action Comics'' #837</ref> More than once Luthor addresses Conner as his son.  Following Conner's resurrection, Luthor is shocked and decides to locate him.  When Brainiac accuses him of showing paternal feelings for Conner though, Luthor denies it, saying that he only wants his property back, and has no fatherly feelings towards Superboy. Apparently, Luthor is no longer affectionate to the Boy of Steel after the event at his sister's house, and now seeing Superboy as a "failed experiment" due to using "a wrong alien DNA" to combine with his own.  Luthor creates another binary clone with Brainiac using their genetics, which implies that it would becomes a threat to Superboy.

In the alternate future timeline of ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'',<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #17-19 (2005)</ref> in which Conner still exists, Luthor acts as a caring, fatherly figure to him.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #51 (2007)</ref>

After the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Luthor went on to build a [[gynoid]] version of Lois Lane using Brainiac technology. His primary purpose for creating her was to have a companion which voiced honest opinions about his plans, and to give him an extra voice of reason to counsel him on his obsessive quest for the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] energy. Luthor also had a pseudo-romantic relationship with the "Loisbot", and regularly slept with it.

==Powers and abilities==
Lex Luthor has the physical capabilities and limitations of a normal adult with no [[metahuman]] abilities. However, he possesses a genius level of intelligence.  For virtually his entire publication history, he has been depicted as the most intelligent human in the [[DC Universe]], and as one of the most intelligent beings of any planet or species.  He has mastered seemingly every known form of science, including [[Spaceflight|space travel]], [[hyperspace (science fiction)|extra-dimensional travel]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer]]s, [[synthetic polymer]]s, [[communication]]s, [[mutation]]s, [[transportation]], [[holography]], [[energy development|energy generation]], [[spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]], and more (including [[time travel]] in many Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] stories).  With the exception of the renegade [[Colu]]an scientist [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], he does not view any other being as an intellectual peer.

Over the years, Luthor has made liberal use of kryptonite weapons capable of injuring Superman and other Kryptonians.  Since the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age of Comics]], he has also utilized various battlesuits in many stories.  Additionally, he often wore a kryptonite ring on his right hand in Post-Crisis stories, but abandoned this tactic after prolonged exposure to K-radiation resulted in the loss of his hand and poisoned his entire body (requiring him to transplant his brain into a cloned body in order to survive).

[[Lyle Talbot]] was the first actor to portray the character in a live-action film, appearing in the [[1950 in film|1950]] [[serial film|serial]] ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]''.<ref>Daniels (1998), p. 75.</ref> The character has appeared in all of the modern [[Superman in film|''Superman'' films]], with the exception of ''[[Superman III]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]). In the original [[Richard Donner]] films, Luthor is a vain, wisecracking money-hungry gangster, with a particular fixation on real estate, who plots outrageous disasters for Superman to try to avert. He is regularly captured by Superman and sent to prison, only to escape&mdash;in a manner similar to the comics&mdash;at the opening of the next film. This version of Luthor appears to have little personal dislike for Superman, other than the fact the hero interferes with his criminal schemes. He still displays some scientific expertise that the traditional Luthor exhibited, being able to trace Zod and his cohorts by monitoring their radioactive signatures, and masterminding the creation of the Nuclear Man. Along with surrounding himself with dimwitted henchmen and molls, this version of Luthor also favors hairpieces to conceal his baldness.

[[Gene Hackman]] portrays Luthor in the [[Superman (film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]], along with two of its sequels, ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]). In the films, Luthor is established as an elusive, high-profile criminal who has taken refuge in an extensively restored abandoned subway station under the streets of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He is initially fixated on making billions from a massive real-estate swindle, but after being foiled by Superman, shifts his focus to the history and biology of the Kryptonian himself. Unlike in most other portrayals, Hackman's Luthor appears to view Superman as a respectable and challenging foe rather than a subject of intense hatred.  Luthor, as portrayed by Hackman, is somewhat light and comical, resembling a fast talking con artist more than a criminal mastermind; often attempting to talk his way out of trouble. As a result, Luthor is initially not taken seriously by General Zod or Ursa.  Although he attempts to kill Superman on multiple occasions, he also expresses his pleasure with Superman's genius intellect and ability to "keep up with" Luthor's speeches and schemes.<ref>''Superman'', Richard Donner, 1978</ref><ref>''Superman IV: The Quest For Peace'', Sidney J. Furie, 1987</ref>

[[John Shea]] portrayed Lex in the 1990s TV series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' as a charming and debonair philanthropist and [[polymath]], the owner of the massive [[LexCorp]]. He is established early on as "the 3rd richest man in the world", behind [[Bill Gates]] and the fictional Arthur Chow. He is secretly, however, a ruthless and power-hungry individual involved in many criminal enterprises and obsessed with defeating and killing Superman. Unlike other versions of the character, Shea's Lex has a full head of hair for the majority of the series. Shea addressed this by stating, "Hey, this is the '90s. Do you think a billionaire like Luthor couldn't get himself a full head of hair? Lex Luthor has got to be a modern villain."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mutantxarchive.livejournal.com/588569.html |title=Scott Williams, November 28th, 1993, Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=Mutantxarchive.livejournal.com |date=1993-11-28 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

[[Michael Rosenbaum]] portrayed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Luthor]] in the series ''[[Smallville]]''. In this 2001 series, Lex Luthor is sent to Smallville, by his father Lionel Luthor, to run the local LuthorCorp fertilizer plant. After driving his car off a bridge, he is saved by Clark Kent and quickly develops a new friendship with the farm boy. As the series unfolds, Lex's curiosity about Clark and all things connected to Clark ultimately destroys their friendship. Smallville's Lex Luthor is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks a fine line between good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses, ultimately leading him to being Clark's greatest enemy, his conviction that he is 'needed' to protect the world causing him to kill his own father and turn against everyone that he cannot control in the belief that he is 'protecting' the world from the aliens or superhumans who might exert their authority, unable to accept the idea that they only seek to help others. After Rosenbaum left the show, Lex Luthor made few appearances (with his face obscured) or had his presence felt by way of clones, or constant mentions of his intertwined destiny with Clark Kent. [[Michael Rosenbaum]] reprised his role of Lex Luthor in the two-hour Smallville series finale, which aired on May 13, 2011, in which the memory of his immoral life is erased by his half sister "[http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Tess_Mercer Lustessa Lena Luthor]" before she dies. Seven years later in a flash-forward sequence it is revealed that the new Lex Luthor is the President of the United States and has donned his White Suit and [http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Lex_Luthor's_black_glove#Season_Ten Black Glove]. Whether or not he has reverted back to his darker side is unknown.

In 2004, Kurt Carley portrayed Luthor in [[Sandy Collora]]'s fan film ''World's Finest''.

In [[2006 in film|2006]], the role was inherited by [[Kevin Spacey]] in ''[[Superman Returns]]'', set sometime after the events of ''Superman II''. Following another stint in jail, during Superman's absence from Earth to investigate the remains of Krypton, Luthor is released on a string of technicalities and seduces a dying widow in order to marry her and inherit her fortune. The widow dies shortly after Superman's return to Earth, and Luthor immediately sets out to avenge himself, first by ransacking the Fortress of Solitude, and later through the abduction of [[Lois Lane]] and her son Jason. Spacey's Luthor continues the real-estate fixation of the Hackman version, but also appears to have a real personal animus toward Superman. Both the Hackman and Spacey versions of Luthor surround themselves with bungling henchmen and dim-witted molls.

Other actors who have portrayed Luthor include [[Scott James Wells]] and [[Sherman Howard]] in the television series ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]''. He has also been voiced in animation by [[Jackson Beck]] in the 1960s series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'', [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]] in the 1970s/1980s ''[[Super Friends]]'' franchise, [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] in the 1988 [[Superman (TV series)|''Superman'']] animated series, and by [[Clancy Brown]] in the 1990s/2000s [[DC animated universe]], as well as a 2007 episode of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' and the 2009 direct-to-[[DVD]] animated feature ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', among others. [[Chris Noth]] portrays the Lex Luthor of a [[Earth-Three|parallel universe]] (where the character is a superhero) in the animated DVD release ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=4 0 |url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/VoicesFromKrypton/news/?a=11344 |title=WORLD EXCLUSIVE: The Making of "Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths" |publisher=Comicbookmovie.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/news/2009-news/2009-news-movie.php?topic=2009-news-movie/1203 |title=Chris Noth Talks '&#39;Crisis on Two Earths'&#39; |publisher=Supermanhomepage.com |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> Luthor is also a playable character in 2008's ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', sporting his trademark battle armor.

In ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' TV series, a character named Rohtul (Luthor spelled backwards) appears in the episode "The Super-Batman of Planet X" portrayed by [[Clancy Brown]]. He appears as the Lex Luthor of Zur-En-Arrh and possibly the arch enemy of [[Batman of Zur-En-Arrh|the Batman of that world]]. Both Batmen ended up fighting Rohtul and his army of giant robots (resembling the ones from the comics) when Batman discovered that he had superpowers upon being exposed to Rodon. He used his new abilities to defeat Rohtul's robots and apprehend Rohtul. While in jail, Rohtul discovers Earth Batman's weakness and plans to use it against him as Rodon-powered Earthlings are weak against Quartz (in other words, Rodon and Quartz don't mix). Rohtul contacts one of his robots which springs him out of jail while quoting to the guard that he's "done with the room." When Batman confronts Rohtul, he has one of his robots open a compartment that contains Quartz. Batman of Zur-En-Arrh rescues Batman and sprays him with something that protects him from the Rodon's events. When Rohtul tries to take Vilsi Veylar hostage, he ends up defeated by both Batmen.

The actual Lex Luthor appears in the episode "Battle of the Superheroes!" voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. He robs a museum and kidnaps Lois Lane only to be thwarted by Superman and arrested by the police. When Lois Lane unknowingly receives a Red Kryptonite necklace, it causes Superman to turn evil causing Batman and Krypto to hold off Superman until the effects wore off. They discovered that the real Lex Luthor is at large having been the one who mailed Lois the Red Kryptonite necklace and that the one in jail was a robotic duplicate. When Lex Luthor tries to use his Kryptonite ring on Superman, it doesn't work due to the fact that Superman was actually Batman in disguise. Lex Luthor was defeated by Batman and Superman.

Luthor appears again in the episode "Triumvirate of Terror!", in which he teams up with Joker and Cheetah to battle the DC Trinity (Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman).  While Joker fights Wonder Woman and Cheetah Superman, Luthor easily defeats Batman with his battle suit.  However, Batman tricks him into teleporting them and the others back to their hideout.  Once there, he questions Luthor as to whether Cheetah will get control of Metropolis, as she was the one to defeat Superman.  Luthor scoffs at this idea, leading to an argument between the three villains.  This gives the Trinity enough time to escape from their restraints and promptly defeat the villains.
