}} The author, James Kakalios, is a physics professor. Pages 254-255: "With our improved understanding of physics, we can now more accurately describe Kitty Pryde's mutant power as being able to alter her macroscopic quantum wave function, increasing her tunneling probability to near 100 percent at will." Page 255: "How, when she's is 'phasing' and immaterial, can she walk?"</ref> This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]].

[[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] christened Kitty with her first code name, '''Sprite'''.  [[Professor X]] had also suggested the codename '''Ariel''', which Kitty adopted for a short time prior to adopting the codename '''Shadowcat'''. After joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she replaced her fiancée and became part of the legend of the '''Star-Lord'''. Pryde was the youngest person invited to join the team of mutant superheroes the [[X-Men]].

During her early years, she was portrayed as a "kid sister" to many older members of the X-Men, filling the role of [[Foil (literature)|literary foil]] to the more established characters. In the years since her introduction, she has aged and matured, and has become a main character on her own.

In the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], Kitty Pryde was portrayed by young actresses in cameos in the first two films, Sumela Kay in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000) and [[Katie Stuart]] in ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003), and is portrayed by [[Ellen Page]] in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014). She is ranked #47 in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Kitty Pryde was introduced into the ''X-Men'' title as the result of an editorial dictate that the book was supposed to depict a school for mutants.<ref>Grant, Steven. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18546 "Permanent Damage - The 20 Most Significant Comics"] [[Comic Book Resources]], October 22, 2008</ref> ''Uncanny X-Men'' artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] named Kitty Pryde after a classmate he met in art school, Alberta College of Art and Design in [[Calgary]] in 1973. He had told Pryde that he liked her name and asked for permission to use it, promising to name his first original comics character after her.<ref name=cbrul42>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/03/16/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-42/2/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #42 |work=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=March 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> Byrne had drawn the character to slightly resemble an adolescent [[Sigourney Weaver]].<ref>''The X-Men Companion, Volume II''. 1982. [[Fantagraphics Books|Fantagraphics Books, Inc]].</ref>

The fictional Kitty Pryde first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #129 (January 1980), by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist Byrne, as a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. Claremont said several elements of the character's personality were derived from those of ''X-Men'' editor [[Louise Simonson]]'s daughter, Julie.<ref>{{cite book| last = Defalco| first = Tom| title = Comics Creators on X-Men| date = 2006-05-01| publisher = Titan Books| pages = 79| isbn = 1-84576-173-1}}</ref> Claremont and Byrne made the new character a full-fledged X-Man in issue #139, where she was codenamed "Sprite". She was the main character in the issues #141-142, the "[[Days of Future Past]]" storyline, where she is possessed by her older self, whose consciousness time travels into the past to prevent the mass extermination of mutants. The six-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' (1984–1985), written by Claremont, was a coming-of-age storyline in which she matures from a girl to a young woman and adopts the new name "Shadowcat".

In the late 80s she joined the British-based super team Excalibur where she would remain for roughly ten years before coming back to the X-Men. In the early 2000s she disappeared from the spotlight as she semi-retired from Superhero work. She came back to the main X-Men books in 2004 under the pen of Joss Whedon in Astonishing X-Men. She remained a part of the X-Men books until 2008 when she left again for roughly 2 years. After coming back she was featured in Jason Aaron's Wolverine in the X-Men and Brian Michael Bendis' All-New X-Men books.

In early 2015 she joined the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. After the Secret Wars event she adopted her new alias, '''Star-Lord''' (first believed to be Star-Lady).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/star-lady-revealed-secret-wars-ends-all-new-all-different-marvel-begins|title=STAR-LADY REVEALED, "SECRET WARS" ENDS, "ALL-NEW, ALL-DIFFERENT MARVEL" BEGINS}}</ref>

Shadowcat's popularity had a profound effect on the real-life Kitty Pryde: the latter became so overwhelmed by attention from Shadowcat fans after the publication of the X-Men comics that she abbreviated her name to K.D. Pryde to avoid association with her fictional counterpart. She has since stated that she has mixed feelings about her fame, saying that she values Byrne's comics for their entertainment and artistic value, but wishes that more people would appreciate her as more than just Shadowcat's namesake.<ref name=cbrul42/>

==Fictional character biography==
{{cleanup|section|date=October 2008}}
Katherine Anne "Kitty" Pryde was born in [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], [[Illinois]] to Carmen and Theresa Pryde. Of [[Jew]]ish descent, her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men's [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club's]] White Queen, [[Emma Frost]], both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes. Kitty was unnerved by Frost, observing that the White Queen had looked at her as if she were "something good to eat."  She got along better with Xavier and the three X-Men who escorted him to his meeting with her and her parents, quickly becoming friends with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]]. Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier's school.

Their conversation was cut short when they (along with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) were attacked by armored [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club. The X-Men defeated their assailants, but were subdued by the White Queen's telepathic powers immediately after. In the confusion, Kitty had become separated from the X-Men and therefore was not captured along with them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #129</ref> She managed to contact [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]], and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #130</ref> With the help of [[Dazzler]] and Pryde, those X-Men rescued their teammates and Xavier (who had also been captured) from the Hellfire Club.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #131">''Uncanny X-Men'' #131</ref>

The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle, which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty's parents. Kitty's parents had not heard from her in more than a day, because during that time she was first being pursued by the Hellfire Club's men and then working with the X-Men to save their friends. All they knew was that Kitty had left with Xavier's "students" to get a soda, there had been reports that the soda shop had been blown up, and that Kitty had been missing since. Therefore, they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow. At first, it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X-Men. Phoenix then used her considerable telepathic power to erase the memories of Kitty's parents and plant false ones, resulting in a complete shift in their attitude towards Xavier. Kitty was then allowed to enroll at Xavier's school with her parents' blessing.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #131"/> She was the youngest person to join the X-Men up to that point.

===Joining the X-Men===

Kitty joined the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #138</ref> and assumed the costumed identity of Sprite.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #139</ref> Early in her career as an X-Man, Kitty's adult self from an alternate future took possession of her body in the present to help X-Men thwart the assassination of Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] by the second [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142</ref> Kitty then singlehandedly defeated a [[N'Garai]] [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #143</ref> Kitty also briefly attended the White Queen's [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] when her parents became convinced that she needed to be with students of her own age, but following a failed attempt to subdue the X-Men, Frost revoked Kitty's admission.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #151-152</ref>

During her teen years, Kitty fostered a number of close relationships with others at the school and in the X-Men. She developed a crush on [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and became close friends with his little sister [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]]. Initially uneasy around Nightcrawler and other mutants with physical deformities, Kitty finally overcame her fears and became close friends with him. Kitty also befriended [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], a highly intelligent alien resembling a [[dragon]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #166</ref> who followed her home after a mission in [[outer space]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #168</ref>  Lockheed is extremely loyal to Kitty, and the two of them share a psychic bond. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] became something of a mentor to Kitty despite his usually gruff personality. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] came to view Kitty as the daughter she never had.

Kitty was later assigned to the [[New Mutants]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #167</ref> a team of younger mutants established in the absence of the X-Men while they were in outer space. Kitty convinced Professor Xavier to allow her to remain a full member of the X-Men on the basis of her high intelligence, maturity, and the fact that she was already a fully trained member of the team. Kitty was later abducted by the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] and nearly forced to wed [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177-179</ref> She was then abducted by the White Queen, but rescued by the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #15-17</ref>

During this time, Kitty began to "date" Colossus, but this did not last long. Colossus developed feelings for an alien woman named [[Colossus (comics)#Zsaji|Zsaji]] whom he met on the [[Beyonder]]'s planet in the first [[Secret Wars]]. Colossus' feelings toward Zsaji were primarily a side effect of her own unique healing abilities, which she had used on him after he became injured. Regardless, Colossus' feelings were real and he returned to Earth consumed with grief after Zsaji's death. He admitted to Kitty that he loved Zsaji, which hurt her deeply and ended the budding romantic relationship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #183</ref>  Kitty had made good friends with a local boy from Salem Central named [[Cypher (comics)|Doug Ramsey]] around this time, but her feelings for him never went as deep as his for her, and they never actually dated, though they remained close, even more so after Doug's status as a mutant was revealed and he joined the New Mutants under the codename Cypher. They remained friends until his death some time later.<ref>''New Mutants'' #60</ref>

===Ogun===
During the 1984-1985 ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' miniseries, Kitty is possessed by a demon, the ninja [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]]. Ogun psychically bestows upon Kitty a virtual lifetime of martial arts training. Kitty was brainwashed by Ogun into becoming a ninja assassin, and was sent to attack Wolverine. Kitty is able to resist Ogun's influence with Wolverine's help, and the two form a strong teacher/student bond, which helps them in vanquishing Ogun. Kitty returns to the X-Men, no longer the innocent girl they once knew, and officially adopts the codename Shadowcat.<ref>''Kitty Pryde and Wolverine'' #1-6</ref>

===Morlock Massacre===
While trying to save Rogue, Kitty was badly injured by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]]'s energy spear during the [[Mutant Massacre]] story arc, in the massacre of the Morlocks, with the result that she lost control of her power and was stuck in an intangible state and could not regain her solidity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211</ref> She was rushed to [[Muir Island]] along with other surviving [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] of the Massacre to be tended to by [[Moira MacTaggert]]. MacTaggert was able to keep Kitty's condition from deteriorating to the point where she completely lost physical substance and ceased to exist, but was not able to do any more to help her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #212</ref>

At this time, Kitty's natural state was to be intangible. Where she once had to make a conscious effort to phase, she could now only maintain her solidity through an act of conscious will. The X-Men went to Reed Richards, [[Mister Fantastic]] of the Fantastic Four, for aid, but Richards initially refused because he was not sure he would be able to help.<ref>''Fantastic Four Vs. the X-Men'' # 1</ref>

Having nowhere else to go, the X-Men turned to Richards' enemy [[Doctor Doom]]. This created a moral dilemma for both the X-Men and the Fantastic Four, and both teams fought each other because the Fantastic Four were trying to stop the treatment while the X-Men were determined to save Kitty's life. In the end, both the personal crisis of the Fantastic Four and the life of Shadowcat were saved after [[Franklin Richards]], with the help of Lockheed, brought both teams to their senses.<ref>''Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men'' #1-4</ref>  Kitty has since recovered from this state and now has full control over her power again.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

===Excalibur===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PrydeSHIELD.jpg|Kitty Pryde as an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D|200px|thumb]] -->
Among the others injured and brought to Muir Isle were Colossus and Nightcrawler, although Colossus left the [[United Kingdom]] shortly after being released from MacTaggert's care to join the rest of the X-Men on their mission to battle the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 225</ref> The X-Men [[Fall of the Mutants|sacrificed their lives]] to defeat the Adversary, the battle and their sacrifice was televised and broadcast across the world.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The X-Men were resurrected later, unknown to the world at large, but chose to keep a low profile and perpetuate the belief that they were still dead.{{issue|date=January 2013}} This strategy was enforced to more effectively fight their enemies. This meant avoiding contact with friends and family, including Kitty. Thinking the X-Men were dead, Kitty and Nightcrawler joined [[Rachel Summers]], [[Captain Britain]], and [[Meggan]] to form the [[United Kingdom|Britain]]-based team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref>  For a brief time, Kitty studied at St. Searle's school for girls in Britain.<ref>''Excalibur'' #33</ref> During her time with Excalibur, Kitty developed a crush on Professor [[Alistaire Stuart]] which went unreciprocated since Alistaire was attracted to Rachel.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #11</ref> Later, she was romantically involved with former [[Black Air]] agent [[Pete Wisdom]], with whom she lost her virginity.{{issue|date=April 2013}} At some point, Kitty was recruited by the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to repair the computer system of their flying headquarters. Kitty discovered the problem was due to Ogun's spirit having infiltrated the computer system, and with the aid of Wolverine, she managed to purge Ogun's presence.<ref>''Kitty Pryde Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.' #1 - #3</ref> During this time, Kitty was attracted to a S.H.I.E.L.D. intern her own age, and this made her begin to doubt her relationship with Wisdom.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Soon after, she broke off their relationship.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Back to the X-Men===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
After Excalibur's dissolution, Shadowcat, Nightcrawler, and Colossus return to the X-Men. While returning, they faced a group of [[Cerebro's X-Men|imposters]] following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X. While tracking [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], she stumbles onto prophetic diaries that belonged to [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Irene Adler]], a precognitive. During the six-month gap, Kitty visited [[Genosha]]. Whatever she experienced there is unknown (although presumably connected to her father, living on Genosha at the time), but it had a profound effect on her. She cut her hair and began to act rebelliously, also using one of Wolverine's bone claws broken off during battle as a weapon. Kitty remained with the X-Men for a while before leaving after the apparent death of Colossus. Trying to give herself a normal life, she attended the [[University of Chicago]]. During this time, her father was killed when [[Cassandra Nova]]’s [[sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] destroyed Genosha. Kitty later finds a recording of his death due to exploring footage of the attack. She is also kidnapped by [[William Stryker]], but the [[X-Treme X-Men]] team helped her escape, and she assisted them on several missions.

At the start of [[Joss Whedon]]'s run on ''Astonishing X-Men'', Kitty once again rejoins the X-Men, despite having extreme reservations about working with the former [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], given their history. This was the primary reason why Frost herself wanted Kitty on the team, as a sort of "safety" should Frost ever revert to type. Frost reasoned that the person who trusted her least would be most likely to spot such behavior. On one of the team's first missions, Shadowcat discovered Colossus was alive. After some initial awkwardness, Kitty and Colossus resumed dating.

Kitty Pryde appeared alongside Colossus in the "Blinded by the Light" arc in X-Men. They are the two X-Men left to look after the students while the rest of the X-Men leave for [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s home in Mississippi to check up on [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], during which they are ambushed by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Kitty and Colossus, meanwhile, attempt to protect the students from a faction of the Marauders led by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. It is revealed over the course of the story that Kitty, worried of the Destiny Diaries' safety, devised a plan with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and Emma Frost to hide them and have Emma wipe the location from her mind. The location could only be revealed by a code word spoken to Kitty. The arc concludes with a battle between [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] against the Marauders for the diaries, during which they are destroyed by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].

In the "Torn" arc, the latest incarnation of the Hellfire Club begin an assault on Xavier's School. Kitty fulfilled the role that Emma Frost envisioned, personally taking down Frost and imprisoning her, only to fall under a telepathic delusion created by Hellfire member [[Emma Frost#A New Hellfire Club|Perfection]], who claimed to be the true, unreformed Emma Frost. Under this delusion, Kitty was made to believe that she and Colossus had conceived a child, which was later taken away by the X-Men because its potential mutant abilities were supposedly dangerous. Kitty reacts in the delusion by attempting to rescue the child from a near-inescapable "box" in the depths of the school, unaware that in reality she is freeing an alien entity, Stuff, who contains the trapped consciousness of Cassandra Nova, the apparent ringleader of this new Hellfire Club. A newly awakened Cyclops revealed that the new Hellfire Club, including Perfection and Nova, are actually mental projections created by a piece of Cassandra Nova's consciousness; which became lodged in Emma's mind during the X-Men's last confrontation with her, playing on her [[survivor's guilt]] over the Genoshan massacre, and utilizing Emma's telepathy to both confound the X-Men and orchestrate her (Nova's) escape from the Stuff body. As Cyclops killed the mental projections, Emma tried to force Kitty to kill her to get rid of Nova. Undeterred, Cassandra Nova switched her focus to attempt to transfer her mind to [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]]. It appears that Nova did not succeed, as the team was transported to S.W.O.R.D.'s air station en route to Ord's [[Breakworld]] for the "Unstoppable" arc that concludes Whedon's run on ''Astonishing X-Men''.

===Breakworld===
As the team prepares to end the confrontation with the Breakworld leader, the team splits up—with Kitty on the team appointed to stop the missile pointed at Earth. Kitty phases into the missile to disrupt its circuitry noting that it is composed of the same material as the rest of Breakworld, a material that’s difficult and exhausting for her to phase through. After phasing for a mile into the missile, Kitty finds the center only to discover it empty. The missile is fired, causing Kitty to pass out inside of it as [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] discovers too late that due to its shape, trajectory, and lack of internal circuitry, the Breakworld's weapon is not a missile, but a bullet. As the bullet hurtles toward Earth, Kitty lies unconscious within it.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Giant Size Astonishing X-Men'' # 1</ref>

As the situation becomes increasingly dire, Emma establishes mental contact with Kitty, reassuring her that she will come out of this fine, though it eventually becomes clear to both that the situation will be grim. Kitty and Emma come to an understanding and reconciliation, Emma stating that she never wanted something like this to happen to her. Kitty then phases the bullet through Earth, but is trapped within. At the end of ''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men'', [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] mentions that [[Doctor Strange]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], and some "top men" tried to save her, but believe she has fused to the bullet, as it continues to hurtle through space. Whether she is alive or dead is unknown, though the X-Men consider her lost to them.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

As a result of these events Kitty does not appear in the X-Men crossover event [[X-Men: Messiah Complex]], since this takes place after the events of ''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men''. She is briefly mentioned in the aftermath of the Messiah Complex, by Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine, as the three of them discuss "losing her."<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #496</ref>

To cope with Kitty's loss, Colossus takes down a group of Russian criminals dealing in human trafficking, and gets a tattoo of the name 'Katya' on his chest.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' # 507</ref> Emma begins having a recurring dream in which she hears a voice whom she believes is Kitty's trying to reach out to her.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Dark Reign'' # 1</ref>

It was later confirmed by Abigail Brand that Kitty Pryde was still alive within the bullet, but because the bullet's design would harden as time went on, it would become increasingly difficult to break the bullet open.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D.'' #1</ref>

===Return===
After the X-Men move to the island of Utopia, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] arrives on the island professing his desire to join and support the X-Men in their effort to unite the world's remaining mutants. The X-Men reluctantly let him stay, remaining wary of him despite his efforts to gain their trust.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #520</ref>  In a final bid to gain their trust, Magneto focuses his powers, attempting to divert the interstellar path of the metal bullet Kitty is trapped in and bring her home to Earth. Meanwhile, inside the bullet, Kitty is revealed to still be alive.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #521</ref> Unbeknownst to the others, Magneto had encountered the bullet earlier while attempting to regain his powers with the [[High Evolutionary]] and surmised that Kitty was inside. Despite this and the [[High Evolutionary]]'s apparent ability to retrieve the bullet and Kitty, Magneto chose to focus on regaining his powers, secretly keeping tabs on the bullet until his decision to draw it back to Earth. During her time trapped inside the bullet, Kitty keeps herself and the bullet phased to avoid collisions with any inhabited objects in its path. Magneto brings her safely down to Earth, with the help of [[Doctor Strange]], by cracking the bullet in two and levitating Kitty to the ground. When she and Colossus try to touch, it is revealed that she is trapped in her intangible form, unable to speak, and the X-Men place her in a protective chamber similar to the one used for her following the events of the Mutant Massacre.<ref name="Return">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Matt Fraction]] | penciller = [[Whilce Portacio]]| inker = Ed Tadeo| story = Ghostly| title = Uncanny X-Men| volume = 1| issue = 522| date = May, 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = | page =| panel =| id =}}</ref><ref name="Status">{{Cite comic| writer = [[Matt Fraction]]| penciller = [[Whilce Portacio]]| inker = Ed Tadeo| story = The Five Lights Part One: Freak Like Me| title = Uncanny X-Men| volume = 1| issue = 526| date = July, 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =| page =| panel =| id =}}</ref>  How Kitty survived her time in the bullet is unclear to the X-Men's science team, where the X-Men discover that all her bodily functions halted.<ref name="Status"/>  An analysis by [[Kavita Rao]] hypothesizes that Kitty created an intense [[muscle memory]] to keep herself and the bullet phased and has "forgotten" how to un-phase.<ref name="Status"/>

During a conversation with Colossus, with Emma Frost acting as the psi-conduit, Kitty picks up Emma's stray thoughts on killing the captive [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], to prevent [[Namor]] from discovering she previously lied to him. While disgusted at Emma's intentions, Kitty offers a compromise. Due to her current ghost state, she is the perfect tool for making Shaw disappear.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #529</ref>

In a storyline in ''Uncanny X-Men'', the Breakworlders make their way to Earth. During the conflict between the Breakworlder Kr'uun and the X-Men, Kitty is slain and resurrected by Kr'uun's mate in an alien ritual, which results in her powers returning to normal.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #538</ref>

===Regenesis===

===The Black Vortex===
In the following weeks, Kitty's relationship with Peter Quill evolves more and more as they developed stronger feelings for each other everyday. At one point, Quill gets captured during one of their dates and she has no option but to go in his rescue, despite her fear for space as a result of her being trapped on the giant space bullet.<ref>''Legendary Star-Lord #6'' (February 2015)</ref> After rescuing Peter, she decides to stay in space with him. Then, Kitty convinces Peter to steal a powerful artifact called [[the Black Vortex]] from his father J'son. Soon, they find themselves being chased by J'son's assassination squad, the Slaughter Lords. In despair, they request the aid of the X-Men and the Guardians of the Galaxy to protect the Vortex. After a few of their own friends can't resist the temptation and submit to the Vortex, betray the team, and escape with the artifact; the team splits and Kitty stays in Spartax to help an orphanage. She is encased in amber after Thane (who was allied with J'son) freezes the whole planet along with the people inside it; but thanks to her phasing powers, she manages to get out of the amber. Then the Brood attacks Spartax, planning to use every encased person to lay eggs and create an army of Brood to start invading other planets and conquering them. Kitty feels the only way to stop them is by submitting to the Vortex herself as she's the only one who can resist the cosmic corruption. She reluctantly submits and becomes a being of unlimited power. After being reminded of the love between her and Peter Quill, she goes back and phases all the amber that encased Spartax, along with the Broods trying to infect the people, and sends them all to another dimension. Kitty doesn't give up the cosmic power but admits to Peter that she is afraid of it. Peter promises her that he will never abandon her no matter how much she changes. Then, Peter kneels and proposes marriage to Kitty. She, with tears in her eyes, accepts.<ref>"Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: The Black Vortex Part 1-13 (April–June 2015)</ref> Later when Star Lord is declared Emperor of Spartax she is told she will become the first lady of Spartax.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3 #26 (June 2015)</ref>

==Relationship with Colossus==
Kitty expressed a romantic love interest in [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] early into her time with the X-Men. This did not sit well with Marvel Comics' editor-in-chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]], who disapproved of the suggestion that a nineteen-year-old boy was sleeping with a fourteen-year-old girl.<ref>[http://uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=453 Review of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #183], UncannyXmen.net (see "Notes")</ref>  Kitty had in fact directly propositioned Colossus in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #165, when they were both infected with [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] embryos and seemingly doomed to die: Kitty, aware of the [[taboo]] of their romantic relationship, made the plea that if she were older it would not be a problem, but Colossus refused—offering only a passionate kiss—saying "However, little one, you are ''not'' older". This did not stop the relationship from continuing, as the two were spotted once again passionately kissing in an apparent formalization of their romantic involvement.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #174 (November 1983)</ref>

Shooter finally brought an end to the close and budding romantic relationship in his ''[[Secret Wars]]'' limited series, in which Colossus developed romantic feelings for an alien woman named Zsaji while on the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #5</ref> Zsaji was a healer whose abilities had a side effect of infatuation. For Colossus, this infatuation furthered his doubts of his feelings for Kitty due to his jealousy of her friendship with [[Doug Ramsey]] and led to a passionate, albeit brief romantic relationship with Zsaji. After Zsaji's death, Colossus found he no longer had romantic feelings for Kitty, and upon returning to Earth, he would break up with her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #183 (July 1984)</ref>

The two remained friends, though much cooler around each other until they were separated when Colossus was among the X-Men killed in Dallas during ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]''. While a member of Excalibur, Kitty exploited her closeness with Colossus after he joined the Acolytes by luring him to Muir Island under the pretense of wanting to join him on Avalon. In reality, it was a ruse to allow Professor X to heal a head injury Colossus had suffered which they assumed had led to his defection. Kitty disliked betraying him, but went along with the ruse and was forgiven for her part in it.<ref>''Excalibur'' Vol. 1 #75</ref>

After the fall of Avalon, Colossus came to Muir Island looking for Kitty, and upon finding her with Pete Wisdom, he attacked and seriously injured Wisdom. The two talked about their past and decided to become close friends, with Colossus carefully watching over her romantic relationship with Wisdom. After Kitty and Wisdom's romantic relationship ends, she rejoins the X-Men with Colossus and Nightcrawler, and the two remain close. Kitty was not among the team when Colossus sacrificed himself to cure the [[Legacy Virus]], but she returned to claim his ashes and spread them in his homeland.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #110</ref>

After Colossus' resurrection in Joss Whedon's run on ''Astonishing X-Men'', the two discuss their feelings and consummate the strong, close romantic relationship.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #14</ref>

During the events of ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' after numerous failed attempts to stop the Norse-powered [[Juggernaut (Marvel Comics)|Juggernaut]] Cain Marko, Shadowcat goes on a mission with [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] and Colossus to [[Cytorrak]]'s dimension to try to convince him to stop using Cain Marko as the avatar of the Juggernaut. Cytorrak accepts on the terms that one of them become his new avatar, which Colossus takes to prevent his sister from carrying the burden.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #543"/> After Colossus repels Cain's attack, Kitty dissolves her romance with Colossus, saying she needs a man who will live for her, not die for her.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #543"/>

==Relationship with Star-Lord==
In comics, Kitty and [[Star-Lord]] developed strong romantic feelings for each other. After the ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' and the relaunch called Marvel Now that followed, writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] became the main architect behind both the X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises. His plan to join Kitty and Star-Lord would not start until a year later when he created a crossover event called "the trial of Jean Grey" where he revisited the event of the original Phoenix Saga with the original X-Men team who he had brought into the present. At the end of the crossover, Star-Lord gives Kitty an intergalactic phone she can use to call him whenever she wants to. Kitty, who was already interested on still seeing him, accepted the gift and kissed him on the cheek.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3 #13</ref>

Soon, Star-Lord's new ongoing series writer Sam Humphries took interest on the relationship and decided to expand it in his own book. He, along with Bendis and editor Mike Marts (who edited both franchises), would start developing the relationship for a year before doing another crossover event that would be completely focused on them.

In Star-Lord's book, Peter and Kitty kept using the intergalactic phone to call each other and have what they called "holo-dates". The many problems in Peter Quill's life started interfering and soon he was captured by a new villain who had put a bounty on Peter's head called Mr. Knife. Kitty, who had been witness of Peter being abducted while they were on a date, rushed to Avengers Tower and stole one of Tony Stark's jets to go into space and save Peter.<ref>''Legendary Star-Lord'' Vol. 1 #6</ref> She infiltrated Mr. Knife's base (now revealed to be J'son, Star-Lord's father) and rescued Peter after hitting Knife in the face. Then they kissed for the first time.<ref>''Legendary Star-Lord'' Vol. 1 #7</ref>

After spending an afternoon in Ma Savage's orphanage (one of many orphanages Peter founded), Kitty decided to leave Earth and stay in space with Peter, after that they consummated their relationship on Peter's ship.<ref>''Legendary Star-Lord'' Vol. 1 #8</ref>

Soon the crisis of [[the Black Vortex]] started. Kitty and Peter started fighting a lot because of the Vortex. Kitty wanting nothing to do with it while Peter wanting to have cosmic powers that would help him deal with the horrors of outer space. However, at one point, Peter had the complete freedom to submit to the Vortex and gain cosmic powers. He asked the Vortex to show him how his future would be if he submitted and he saw himself saving Spartax and gaining the approval of his father, but at one point he would go back to being a womanizer and Kitty would then leave him. Peter completely rejected the Vortex after this, wanting to be a better man for Kitty because he really loved her. Kitty appreciated this but submitted to the Vortex anyways in order to save the galaxy.<ref>''Legendary Star-Lord'' Vol. 1 #11</ref>

After saving everyone from the horrors of the Black Vortex, everyone was offered a chance to give up their new acquired cosmic powers but Kitty didn't take it. She then used these new powers to walk in space with Peter. There, she confessed to him how afraid she was of these new powers and their influence. Peter assured her that no matter what happens or how much she changes, he would be by her side to the end because he knew the real Kitty would always be there, and to prove how sure he was about his love for her, he proposed marriage right there. Kitty started crying and finally accepted. Both then started dancing in space while their friends watched them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: The Black Vortex Omega''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Phase powers.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Physics professor [[James Kakalios]] has attempted to use [[quantum mechanics]] to explain Kitty Pryde's "phasing" power. He has described it as an ability to control her own "macroscopic quantum [[wave function]], increasing her [[Quantum tunnelling|tunneling]] probability to near 100 percent at will."<ref name="PhysicsofSuperheroes"/>]]
Kitty is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atomic particles through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. In this way she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting, and each is unharmed when Shadowcat has finished passing through the object. This process is called "[[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Intangibility or phasing|phasing]]" or [[quantum tunneling]] and it renders her almost completely intangible to physical touch.<ref name="PhysicsofSuperheroes" /> Shadowcat passes through objects at the same speed at which she is moving before she enters them. Since she is unable to breathe while inside an object, she can only continuously phase through solid objects (as when she travels underground) as long as she can hold her breath. However, contrary depictions of the duration of her phasing ability have been presented, such as when she has phased miles within an object. The use of her abilities also interferes with any electrical systems as she passes through by disrupting the flow of [[electron]]s from atom to atom, including the bio-electric systems of living bodies if she concentrates in the right way.<ref>''X-Men Black Sun'' #1</ref> This typically causes machines to malfunction or be destroyed as she phases through them, and can induce shock and unconsciousness in living beings.

Using her power began as an optional ability, but for a period (over ten years of published comics, approximately two years in-continuity) Kitty existed in a naturally "phased" state, and had to consciously choose to become solid. Kitty has returned to her original form and is normally solid and must choose to use her power.<ref>''X-Men True Friends'' #1 (1999)</ref>  While phasing, she does not physically walk on surfaces, but rather interacts with the molecules of air above them, allowing her to ascend and descend, causing her to seemingly walk on air. While phased, she is immune to most physical attacks, and has inconsistent showings of some resistance to [[telepathy]]. The density of some materials (such as [[adamantium]]) can prove deleterious to her phasing, causing her to be severely disoriented or experience pain if she tries to pass through them.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 1 #125</ref>  Some energy attacks also prove problematic for Kitty. For example, an energy blast fired by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]], a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], caused her to lose her ability to become fully tangible for months. Magic and magical beings can also harm her in her phased state, as demonstrated in a battle with a [[N'Garai]] demon whose claws left no visible marks, but caused Kitty severe pain as they passed through her intangible body.

Kitty can also extend her powers to phase other people and objects. She is able to phase at least a half a dozen other people (or objects of similar mass) with her, so long as they establish and maintain physical contact with her. She can extend her phasing effect to her own clothing or any other object with mass up to that of a small truck, as long as she remains in contact with it. Kitty can also make objects intangible by maintaining contact with them. She has threatened to leave people phased into a wall,{{issue|date=May 2013}} and used her power offensively to harm the Technarch [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]],{{issue|date=May 2013}} and Danger.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

Kitty's powers seem to have increased over the years. During an ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' story arc where she is kidnapped by Reverend [[William Stryker]], she phases out of sync with Earth's rotation to move from one place in the world (only east or west) to another seemingly instantaneously.{{issue|date=May 2013}} At the climax of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'', Kitty phases a 10&nbsp;mi (16&nbsp;km) long "bullet" composed of super-dense alien metals through the entire planet Earth. This feat caused her considerable strain, but she is unable to phase out of the bullet.<ref>''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men'' #2</ref> Moreover, originally Kitty found it difficult or impossible to phase only part of her body at a time.  In the [[Days of Future Past]] story arc, she is possessed by her older future self, allowing her to solidify only her shoulder while phasing the rest of her body through Destiny - a feat explicitly beyond the 13-year-old Kitty's abilities.{{issue|date=March 2015}}  By contrast, the Kitty Pryde of Joss Whedon's run can punch and kick someone standing on the other side of a wall, selectively phasing and unphasing body parts as necessary.{{issue|date=March 2015}}  She can even run and leap through an armed opponent, grabbing their weapon as she passes by, which presumably requires her to solidify only the surface area of the palms of her hands and them immediately phase both her palms and the weapon.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

Besides her mutant powers, Kitty is a genius in the field of applied technology and [[computer science]]. She is highly talented in the design and use of computer hardware. She is a skilled pilot of piston and jet engine aircraft, and a competent pilot of certain advanced interstellar vehicles. She has previously shown a unique ability to wield the [[Soulsword]] and also be harmed by it. Since her possession by the ninja demon Ogun, she has been consistently shown to be an excellent [[Hand to hand combat|hand-to-hand]] combatant, having since been endowed with a lifetime of training in the martial arts of Japanese ninja and samurai, such as [[aikido]], [[karate]], and [[ninjutsu]]. She is also trained in the Israeli martial art of [[Krav Maga]].

She is a professional-level [[dance]]r in both ballet and modern dance. She speaks fluent English, Japanese, Russian, and the royal and standard languages of the alien [[Shi'ar]] and [[Skrull]], and has moderate expertise in Gaelic, Hebrew, and German.

Kitty also shares a mental/empathic connection with her pet dragon [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]; both she and the alien dragon can "sense" each other's presence at times and generally understand one another's thoughts and actions.

Since Kitty used The Black Vortex her powers were augmented to a cosmic scale making her a god-like being.{{issue|date=July 2015}} She can phase through any material of any density and can even phase a planet out of Thane's amber which in her normal state is an extremly difficult task to simple phase herself out of the amber. She can also apparently transverse between the planes of the multiverse and is immune to the effects of space. Her appearance can be changed but her natural form appears to be rather gaseous in look

{{Main|Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde}}
In addition to her [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation, Kitty Pryde has been depicted in other [[fictional universe]]s.

==In other media==

===Television===

====Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends====
Kitty Pryde appeared as Sprite in "The X-Men Adventure" episode of ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', which guest-starred the X-Men. She was voiced by Sally Julian. She also appeared in her short-lived "Ariel" costume in the X-Men group cameo at the end of the episode "The Education of a Superhero".

====X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men====
Kitty Pryde (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) was a viewpoint character in the [[animation|animated]] television one-shot ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men|Pryde of the X-Men]]'', as the newest member of the team. She is a new recruit of the team and is initially frightened of Nightcrawler, due to his demonic appearance. She and Nightcrawler later succeed in defeating Magneto. Once Nightcrawler seemingly dies as a result of having apparently sacrificed himself, Kitty begins to cry until discovering that he is alive and is met with positive relations by her teammates, except Wolverine.

====X-Men: Evolution====
In the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Shadowcat is a main character, who is shown as the [[teenybopper]] of the team and who has a romantic interest in Brotherhood member [[Avalanche (comics)|Lance Alvers]]. Shadowcat saves Wolverine in the season one episode "Grim Reminder", where she unintentionally stows away with Nightcrawler while on the Blackbird without the knowledge that he was beginning to pilot the jet. She is also shown to have developed a close friendship with Nightcrawler, despite the fact that she at first displayed a dislike for his appearance. Besides Nightcrawler, she is shown to have formed a friendship with Rogue and Spyke.

Her initial dislike of his appearance changes after he is severely wounded by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], while she and the rest of the X-Men tried to recruit her. In this series, she does not have [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]] for a pet, but she is shown preferring to sleep with a stuffed dragon instead of a teddy bear. Though she has an on-and-off interest in the delinquent mutant boy [[Avalanche (comics)|Lance Alvers]], early in the series she displays interest in [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. After Rogue is recruited, she serves as her support in beginning a romantic relationship with Scott and develops a friendship with her, despite their differences.

When [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] tries to join the X-Men in the season two episode "Joyride", she tries to help him and shows additional attraction to him as she grades him and the other members of the junior team. After he informs her that some members of the group have started a joyride on the Blackbird and helps her avert catastrophe, she staunchly defends him once he is accused by Cyclops of being responsible. When Avalanche starts to leave, Shadowcat gives him a brief kiss before his departure. With the exposing of the X-Men and mutants in general in the third season, Kitty hides with the other X-Men and after being allowed at school, starts to dislike Nightcrawler after he refuses to reveal himself as a mutant.

In the fourth season, the X-Men try to use her powers to damage one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s domes and fails, instead being electrocuted briefly. In the fiftieth episode of the series, entitled "Ghost of a Chance", she comes across [[Danielle Moonstar]] once she depicts herself in a dream sequence to her. Once she wakes out of it, she tries to and successfully finds her, becoming friends with the girl after learning she had been in suspended animation for two years. Prior to this, it is discovered that her fear is phasing repeatedly into the ground and going further without any control of where she is going. Of the six main X-Men from the first season of the series, she is one of the four that is still a member of the team in the future Charles Xavier saw while in the mind of Apocalypse. Shadowcat was voiced by [[Maggie Blue O'Hara]].

====Wolverine and the X-Men====
Shadowcat appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'',{{vague|date=November 2011}}<!--which episodes?--> voiced by Danielle Judovits and was a student at the Xavier Institute before the destruction of the X-Mansion and disappearance of Professor X. When Wolverine reformed the X-Men to take down the Mutant Response Division and save the dismal future controlled by the Sentinels, Kitty was on her way to the "mutant paradise" [[Genosha]]. The X-Men came to re-recruit her and she immediately rejoined the team. Shadowcat appears as the youngest member of the team and she seems to have a crush on [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] as she is jealous when his attention is taken by Emma Frost<ref>''Wolverine e os X-Men (Wolverine and the X-Men)'' Eps. 3, 4 - "Hindsight Pt. III, Overflow"</ref> and is shown with a love-struck face when she lands on Bobby during a Danger Room training session, though she quickly moves away from him when [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] arrives. She seems to have formed a friendship with Tildie Soames after babysitting her in one episode.

In the last episode of the series, she uses her powers to penetrate a Sentinel controlled by Magneto, of which Beast had difficulty with. Her design is inspired by the appearance of the character in the Astonishing X-Men comics, and her costume emulates the design with the appearance of the blue and yellow used on her costume. The shorts she wears are based off the appearances of the original X-Men, and her first appearance when she wore a variant of the uniform.

====The Super Hero Squad Show====
Shadowcat appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "And Lo...A Pilot Shall Come". She appears alongside [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] at the unveiling of the Great Wall that separates Super Hero City from Villainville and helping citizens into the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Shelters. In the episode "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy", she uses Lockheed to chase [[Reptil]] and the hypnotized X-Men out of the girls' bathroom.

===Motion comics===
Shadowcat appears in the ''Astonishing X-Men'' motion comic, voiced by [[Eileen Stevens]].

===Film===
* In the film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', she has a small cameo, played by [[Sumela Kay]]. She is referenced as the "girl in Illinois who can walk through walls" by [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]]. She is shown in Xavier's class when Wolverine walks in; she returns for her books which she had left behind, grabs them, and phases through the door on her way out. Xavier responds with a cheerful "Bye, Kitty" while Wolverine is startled.
* In ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', she has a brief appearance played by [[Katie Stuart]]. She is shown phasing through walls and through people to escape [[William Stryker]]'s military forces during their attack on the [[X-Mansion]]. Another scene shows her falling through her bed to avoid an assault. She shares a room with [[Siryn]]; in the novelization it is stated that this is because her phasing ability gives her partial protection from Siryn's scream. When the President of the United States asks Professor Xavier how he got the files he gave him, Xavier replies that he knows a little girl who can walk through walls.
* In ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', she is portrayed by [[Ellen Page]] and has a central role. She serves as a rival to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] for the romantic attentions of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], since their close friendship and their kiss (deleted scene) make Rogue increasingly jealous and frustrated. She also joins the X-Men in the battle on [[Alcatraz Island]], breaking off from the battle to save [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] from the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. In the novelization of the film, it is hinted that at some point Kitty had a romantic relationship with Colossus, but that it had long since run its course, although Colossus appears to still retain feelings towards her.

At the beginning of the film, she has been using this ability to repeatedly send [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] four days back in time whenever the Sentinels attack, thus preventing her group from ever engaging them by having him warn the past team before they are detected. In order to prevent the Sentinels' creation, she sends Wolverine back to 1973 (chosen as the strain of sending someone else back that far would snap their mind, with Logan's healing factor the only thing that makes such a trip survivable for him), and was gravely injured when Wolverine becomes violent due to provocation from events in 1973. After the timeline was successfully altered, Kitty is seen teaching a class at the X-Mansion with Colossus. In the film's alternate release, called ''The Rogue Cut'', Kitty's injuries from sending Wolverine back to the past result in the X-Men rescuing Rogue to take over for her. Rogue absorbs Kitty's powers and takes over stabilizing Wolverine and Kitty helps Magneto flee a Sentinel attack.<ref name="RogueCut">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2211098/x-men-rogue-cut-review/|title=Every Secret We Learned Watching The ‘X-Men: Rogue Cut’|last=McNally|first=Victoria|date=July 12, 2015|publisher=[[MTV.com]]|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref>
