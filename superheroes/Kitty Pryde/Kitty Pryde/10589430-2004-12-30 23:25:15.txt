==History==

Shadowcat is a [[mutant]], with the ability to become intangible and walk through solid matter (an ability she calls "[[intangibility|phasing]]").  Her powers first manifested when she was 13; shortly thereafter she was approached by both [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and the [[The Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s [[Emma Frost|White Queen]].  Taking an instant dislike to the White Queen, she chose to go with Xavier.  When Emma kidnapped Xavier and the X-Men, Kitty helped fight to free them.  Proving herself in this battle, she joined the X-Men soon after.

Despite Professor X's attempt to move her to [[The New Mutants]] after they were formed, she remained an X-Man for several years.  During this time she developed a crush on her teammate [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].  During the [[Morlock Massacre]], she was injured by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]]'s energy spear and lost control of her phasing abilities.  She was eventually cured with the help of both [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]].  During Kitty's absence from the team, however, the X-Men had died fighting the [[Adversary]].  Unaware that [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] had returned the X-Men to life, Kitty joined the British team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].  It was during her time with Excalibur that Kitty inherited her friend [[Magik (comics)|Magik]]'s Soul Sword, and that she became romantically involved with scruffy British bad-boy [[Peter Wisdom]].

Eventually Excalibur disbanded and Kitty ended her relationship with Wisdom.  She returned to the X-Men,  but left again after the apparent death of Colossus.  Recently, she once again rejoined the X-Men at the urging of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and Emma Frost.  On one of the new team's first missions, Kitty discovered Colossus alive and imprisoned in a research facility.  The full repercussions of this discovery have yet to be seen.

==Powers and Skills==

Shadowcat possesses the ability to "phase" -- pass through solid matter by passing her atoms through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. Utilizing her phasing ability she can also walk on air.  While phasing she is intangible and thus invulnerable to physical attacks; additionally, [[telepathy|telepaths]] have a hard time reaching her mind in phased form.  Her phasing powers also disrupt any electronic equipment she passes through. 

Due to a battle injury, Kitty Pryde became unable to control her phasing abilities, and nearly faded out of existence.  Although [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Doctor Doom]] saved her life, for years she was only able to become solid through great effort; she has since overcome this disability.  

Shadowcat is a genius in the field of applied technology such as computers. She is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant as she was trained extensively by her one time mentor, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], in the arts of [[ninjitsu]], [[aikido]], and [[karate]]. She has had training in [[gymnastics]] and is a professional [[dancer]].
