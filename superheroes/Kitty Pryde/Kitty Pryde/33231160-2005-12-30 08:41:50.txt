'''Shadowcat''' (Katherine "Kitty" Anne Pryde) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She used the code-names '''Sprite''' and '''Ariel''' early in her career and is a member of the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''X-Men'' #129 (January [[1980]]).

==Character biography==
Katherine "Kitty" Pryde was born in [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]] to Carmen and Theresa Pryde.

Her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman was a [[Europe]]an [[Jew]], known to have been held in a [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]. His married sister Chava Rosanoff is reported to have died during [[the Holocaust]]. Samuel was rescued by the [[United States Army]] at the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in [[1945]]. He soon [[immigration|immigrated]] to the United States.

As a thirteen year old [[adolescent]], Kitty started suffering from recurring [[headache]]s. Unknown to her these headaches resulted from her body trying to cope with her new emerging powers. Kitty was a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the ability to become [[Wiktionary:intangible|intangible]] and walk through solid matter, an ability called "phasing."

Shortly thereafter, Pryde was approached by both [[Professor X|Professor Charles Francis Xavier]] and the [[The Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s White Queen, [[Emma Frost]].  Taking an instant dislike to the White Queen, she chose to go with Xavier.  When Emma kidnapped Xavier and the X-Men, Kitty helped fight to free them.  Proving herself in this battle, she joined the X-Men soon after becoming one of the youngest members at the time ever.  Initially wearing an old-style X-Men uniform, Kitty took the codename "Sprite" and later dressing in more brightly-colored outfits calling herself "Ariel."  From the time of their first meeting, she developed a crush on her teammate [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. 

One of her earliest adventures with the X-Men involved their kidnapping by the non-humanoid alien race known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].  During this adventure in outer space, Kitty's life was saved by a small alien dragon whom she named [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], who has been her frequent companion since.  Kitty and Colossus began a romantic relationship upon their return to Earth.  Professor X, in the X-Men's absence, had created a sister team of younger mutants called the [[New Mutants]] whom he did not intend to combat other mutants.  He intended to place Kitty in that group when she returned to Earth but Kitty convinced him to allow her to remain in the X-Men.  Later, Colossus's seven-year old sister [[Magik (comics)|Illyana]] was kidnapped by the demonic sorcerer [[Belasco]] and held in the extradimensional realm known as [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]], where he trained Illyana as his demonic apprentice.  Since time passed more quickly in Limbo than on the Earthly plane, Belasco used magic to artificially age Illyana several years.  She eventually escaped him and returned to Earth seconds after she had been kidnapped; she was now a teenager and became Kitty's best friend and roommate.  Because of their strong rapport, Kitty would inherit Illyana's Soul Sword, the ultimate expression of Illyana's mystical abilities, if Illyana died or otherwise ceased to exist.

During the 1985 ''Kitty Pryde and Wolverine'' miniseries, Kitty became possessed by the demon ninja, [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]]. While in Japan assisting her father, who was caught up in a bit of organized crime, Kitty was brainwashed by Ogun into thinking she was his assassin. Ogun bestowed upon Kitty a virtual lifetime of martial arts training and sent her to kill fellow X-Man, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], himself a former pupil of Ogun. Now calling herself Shadowcat, Kitty was able to resist Ogun's influence with Wolverine's help and a bit of tough love.  Kitty and Wolverine defeated Ogun and in the process formed a strong teacher/student bond with each other which remains to this day. Nevertheless, Kitty returned to the X-Men a changed girl, no longer the innocent Sprite they knew.

Kitty's romance with Colossus came to an end following the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' miniseries, during which Colossus developed feelings for an alien female that he had met on another planet.  

During the [[Mutant Massacre]], she was injured by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]]'s energy spear and lost control of her phasing abilities and was left in a permanently-phased state.  Unable to speak, her body slowly discorporating; a condition that if not stopped would eventually lead to her death.  She was eventually cured in the ''Fantastic Four Versus the X-Men'' miniseries with the help of both [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]].  During Kitty's absence from the team, the X-Men had apparently died fighting the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]] in Texas.  Unaware that the extradimensional sorceress [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] had returned the X-Men to life, Kitty and her fellow former X-Men [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Rachel Summers]] joined the British superheroes [[Captain Britain]] and [[Meggan]] to form the [[Britain]]-based team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].

It was during her time with Excalibur that Kitty inherited the Soul Sword following the events of the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|"Inferno"]] storyline, during which Illyana's time in Limbo had been erased from existence, her demonic form ceased to exist and she was returned to the age she was prior to her kidnapping by Belasco.  With the Soul Sword came dominion over Limbo.  Kitty eventually lost the Soul Sword and Limbo when Doctor Doom attempted to steal it from her, but his plans were thwarted and the sword and Limbo ended up in the possession of the being known as [[Darkoth]].  It was also during her tenure with Excalibur that Kitty became romantically involved with scruffy British bad-boy [[Peter Wisdom]].

Eventually Excalibur disbanded and Kitty ended her relationship with Wisdom.  She returned to the X-Men, but left again after the apparent death of Colossus. She went on to attend the [[University of Chicago]] trying to give herself a normal life. It was during this time, her father was killed when [[Cassandra Nova]]'s wild [[sentinels (comics)|sentinels]] destroyed [[Genosha]].

Recently, she once again rejoined the X-Men at the urging of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and Emma Frost (''Astonishing X-men'' #1).  On one of the new team's first missions, Kitty discovered Colossus alive and imprisoned in a research facility.  The full repercussions of this discovery have yet to be seen.

==Powers and abilities==
Shadowcat possesses the ability to "phase" or literally pass through solid matter by passing her atoms through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. Utilizing her phasing ability, she can also walk on air.  While phasing, she is intangible and thus invulnerable to physical attacks and [[telepathy|telepaths]] have a hard time reaching her mind in phased form.  Her phasing powers also disrupt any electronic equipment she passes through. For some time after she discovered her powers, she was only able to phase herself and her clothes along with her. However, she quickly learned to phase other people and objects with her.

Due to a battle injury, Kitty Pryde became unable to control her phasing abilities and nearly faded out of existence.  Although [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Doctor Doom]] saved her life, for years she was only able to become solid through great effort; she has since overcome this disability.  

Shadowcat is a genius in the field of applied technology such as computers. She is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the arts of [[aikido]] and [[karate]]. After the martial arts master known as [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]] possessed her and imprinted his mind onto hers, Shadowcat became skilled in the arts of [[ninjitsu]], in which she was later trained extensively by her one time mentor, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. She has had training in [[gymnastics]] and is a professional [[dancer]].

== The real-life Kitty Pryde ==
[[John Byrne]] revealed that he named Shadowcat "Kitty Pryde" after a classmate from [[Calgary]] he met in art school in [[1973]]. Before he got famous, Byrne told his colleague that he liked her name and would use it for his first original character. Pryde (i.e. the real-life woman) at first thought nothing about it, but was eventually overwhelmed by hordes of people associating her with the comic book hero. K. D. Pryde, as she calls herself now, has stated that she has mixed feelings about this [http://solo23.abac.com/thecatbox/interview.html] [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/trivia].

== Other Shadowcats ==

===Cat===
In Magik #1, Shadowcat renamed herself "Cat" after she was mutated by Belsco into a more catlike form, with cat eyes, whiskers and a tail.

=== Ultimate Shadowcat ===

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Kitty Pryde was one of the first additions to the core [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] group. She was the only child of Theresa Pryde, a strong, independant woman who is hinted to have brought up Kitty alone.

Kitty had a long-standing crush on [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] which was recently consummated in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man Annual]] #1'', where they hooked up after ending their relationships with their respective ex-partners, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. In USM #87, Kitty and Peter are dating for the first time in the "real" comic. [[Brian Michael Bendis]], writer of Ultimate Spider-Man, plans to continue with Kitty as a supporting character in USM.
