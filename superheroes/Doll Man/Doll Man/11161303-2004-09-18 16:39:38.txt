'''Doll Man''' is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] created by [[Will Eisner]] and published by [[Quality Comics]].  His real name was Darrel Dane.  He could shrink to six inches while retaining normal strength.  He was probably the first example of a shrinking superhero. His girlfriend, Martha Roberts, later became Doll Girl.

After [[DC Comics]] bought Quality's superhero characters, Doll Man was made a member of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] and, after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], was [[retcon]]ned into having been a member of the [[All-Star Squadron]].

Another Doll Man appeared in a film, with a comic adaption by [[Malibu Comics]]. He was a doll-sized alien, chasing a similarly-sized criminal.

A modern version of the DC Doll Man and Doll Girl have briefly appeared in [[Teen Titans]], although little is learnt about them.

Also in the [[DC Universe]], the most recent Doll Man is a non-powered criminal who has encountered the current [[Batgirl]].
