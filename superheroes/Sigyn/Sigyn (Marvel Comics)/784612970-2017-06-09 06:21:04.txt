==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Sigyn and Loki.jpg|thumb|left|Loki and Sigyn]]

Sigyn is the wife of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], making her princess of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].

When Loki was young, he came to desire a wife, and admired Sigyn from afar. When he went to court her, she revealed that she was betrothed to Theoric. Loki arranged to have Theoric murdered but made it look like he was killed in battle, and then disguised himself as Theoric so that Sigyn and "Theoric" were eventually wed by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]. At the end of the ceremony, Loki revealed his true form. Odin was furious, but Sigyn noted that as his wife, she was duty-bound to Loki for life. Odin made her the goddess of fidelity for her endurance, and banished Loki from Asgard.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #14 (Nov 1989)</ref>

In their marriage, Sigyn mothered two sons with Loki, Narvi and Váli, although both of them died young.

She is assumed to have died during the Ragnarok in Thor II #85.<ref>http://marvel.com/universe/Sigyn</ref><ref>''Thor'' Vol 2 #85 (Dec 2004)</ref>

===Goddess of Fidelity===
When Loki manipulates blind [[Hoder (comics)|Hoder]] into killing [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], he is caught and taken in front of Odin to be punished. Sigyn returned to Asgard at that point out of loyalty to Loki. After [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] succeeded in restoring Balder to life, Loki was held over by trial for atrocities against the gods. Sigyn wept as Loki stood before the gods for his crimes and was punished by being chained to a rock as a serpent dripped venom onto his face. Sigyn begged [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] to intervene, and Odin allows her to go to Loki so she can catch the venom in a bowl to save him, but every time she had to empty the bowl, the venom would again strike him in the face.<ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #275-277 (Sept-Nov 1978)</ref> 

When [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] and her army of monsters attacked Asgard, Loki escaped his imprisonment, only to fall into a crack on the Bifrost with Thor and sent to another realm. Sigyn stayed by Hoder and offered to guide his hand against Hela's armies but their forces were ultimately driven off when Thor returned.<ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #278 (Dec 1978)</ref>

When the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] threatened earth, Sigyn was among one of the goddesses of Asgard who were recruited by [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]] in her attempt to save earth by offering them the [[Young Gods (comics)|Young Gods]]. Sigyn spent twenty years beneath the earth, guarding the Young Gods with her fellow goddesses. She also donated life energies, with other Asgardians, into the Destroyer to battle the Celestials.<ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #300 (Oct 1980)</ref> After the Destroyer lost, Gaea told [[Thor (comics)|Thor]] that Sigyn and all the Asgardians were dead but if he gathered enough life energies from the sky-fathers of the other pantheons, it could to restore them back to life. All the pantheons gladly give up a portion of their power, except for Shiva so Thor battles him for it. Thor defeats him and then uses the granted power to revive everyone.<ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #301 (Nov 1980)</ref>

===Being Bound to Loki===
After being bound to Sigyn as punishment, Loki grew tired of being chained to his wife so he convinced Odin to let him go. By observing how Odin had always been distant to him because he was not his flesh-and-blood son, Odin was moved, and released Loki from bondage to Sigyn.<ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #307 (May 1981)</ref> Loki deserted Sigyn but she continued to be a devoted wife. When Thor accused Loki of turning mortals into beasts, Loki denied it and Sigyn provided an alibi seeing as how they were bound together and rebuffed Thor's accusation.<ref>''Thor Annual'' Vol 1 #9 (Nov 1981)</ref>

Loki learned from Sigyn that a vote was being held to determine if Thor would remain in Asgard permanently so he sends her to vote for Thor to remain in Asgard, while he devised a way of getting Thor to abandon the trial, so that Odin would turn on him. Ultimately, it was voted that Thor return to Earth, and Loki's plan was thwarted. She didn't perceive how her actions had aided Loki in his schemes. <ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #313 (Nov 1981)</ref>

===During Loki's absence===
Sigyn acted as an agent on Asgard for Loki while he was imprisoned in the realm of Mephisto. Loki had schemed with [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] to destroy Thor using Pluto's hell-hound [[Cerberus (Marvel Comics)|Cerberus]], and the hybrid Elven warrior Flame. However, Pluto manipulated events so that the Flame ran across Sigyn, and he attempted to kill her. Loki tried to help her, but wasn't powerful enough in his spirit form, so he revived Thor to assist him. Thor saved Sigyn from both Cerberus and the Flame, and won some small gratitude from Loki in the process.<ref>''Thor Annual'' Vol 1 #19 (June 1994)</ref>

While Loki was imprisoned in a tree, Sigyn saw Odin place the mortal Dr. [[Donald Blake]] into suspended animation in [[Mount Wundagore]], while Thor was given a new mortal identity in which he became exactly like Blake. Sigyn hoped to use Blake as a bargaining tool for Loki's release, but as she cast a spell to capture him, it backfired and Blake was destroyed. Horrified, Sigyn created a duplicate of Blake with her magic, and left him in place of the Odin's Blake in Wundagore. Unknown to her at the time, she left her wedding band by the duplicate's body. <ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #479 (Oct 1994)</ref>
 
Sigyn, Thor, Red Norvell, the Warriors Three, [[Beta Ray Bill]], Frigga, [[Sif]] and Balder are all present when Odin decides to tell Thor all about his connection to Donald Blake. Sigyn stays silent about the occurrences at Mt. Wundagore but after having revived the Blake duplicate and learning that he was a fake, Thor discovered Sigyn's wedding band and went to confront Loki, believing him to be behind the ruse. For Loki to have a physical form, Sigyn places Loki's spirit in a suit of armor. He and Thor battle but after Loki's armor is severely damaged, Sigyn admits to having created the Blake duplicate after accidentally destroying it after trying to use it as a way to get Loki free. Thor realized that she had meant him no harm.<ref>''Thor'' #483</ref>
