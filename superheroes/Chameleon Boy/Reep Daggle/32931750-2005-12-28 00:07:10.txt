{{dablink|Chameleon Boy should not be confused with [[Beast Boy]], also called Changeling, another young shape-shifting DC Comics superhero.}}

'''Chameleon Boy''' (Reep Daggle) is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the thirtieth century. He has the power to [[shapeshift]]. He is from the planet Durla, where everyone has the power to change their physical form. He has orange skin, pointed ears and antennae. He has no hair in his usual humanoid form. In pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity he was the son of Legion financer [[R.J. Brande]] who was revealed to be a Durlan who had become frozen in human form after contracting a disease. Reep did not learn that Brande was his father for many years.  Reep was also an exceptional detective.  His deductive prowess coupled with his shape shifting abilities led to his being named the permanent head of the Legion's Espionage Squad.

Post-Zero Hour, Reep was known simply as 'Chameleon' and was not related to R.J. Brande. This time, he was the son of Durla's spiritual leader and heir to that title.

In the reimagining/reboot of the Legion that occurred in 2005, the character was still referred to as Chameleon, but is now portrayed as a completely androgynous, non-gender specific creature. Chameleon still has the power to change into any form at will, but the character's revised origin has yet to be revealed.

==Other Media==
Chameleon appeared in an episode of the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' animated series with [[Saturn Girl]] and [[Cosmic Boy]]; he was voiced by [[Jason Priestley]].
