'''Chameleon Boy''' ('''Reep Daggle''') is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th and 31st centuries. 

== Character history ==
===Silver Age===
Reep Daggle is from the planet Durla, where everyone has the power to [[Shapeshift|change their physical form]]. He has orange skin, pointed ears and antennae, and has no hair in his usual humanoid form. In pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, he was the son of Legion financer [[R. J. Brande]] who was revealed to be a Durlan who had become frozen in human form after contracting a disease. Reep did not learn that Brande was his father for many years. (Brande's name was originally revealed to be Ren Daggle, but later altered after the Crisis storyline.) Reep was also an exceptional [[detective]]; his [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] prowess coupled with his shapeshifting abilities led to his being named the permanent head of the Legion's Espionage Squad.

Chameleon Boy was sentenced to the prison world in the 1980s for his espionage activities against the [[Khund]]s, which almost led to war. He was released after his heroics against [[Darkseid]] in the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. During his incarceration, he was forced to wear binders on his antennae that canceled his shape-shifting powers, although he regained them a few months later.  Following the dissolution of the Legion after volume 3, "Cham" became in volume 4 the primary force behind the reassembly of the Legion.

During the "Five Year Gap" following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the [[Dominators]], and withdrew from the [[United Planets]].  A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified "Batch SW6" escaped captivity.  Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teeange Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to [[Ferro Lad]]'s death at the hands of the [[Sun-Eater]].  Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts.  However, this version of Chameleon Boy was killed in battle (along with SW6's [[Princess Projectra]] and [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]) fighting Dominion troops.

===''Zero Hour'' Reboot===
Post-Zero Hour, Reep was known simply as 'Chameleon' and was not related to R. J. Brande. This time, he was the son of Durla's spiritual leader and heir to that title. Originally he did not speak Interlac (the universal language of the 30th century), and [[Invisible Kid]] had to translate. After learning the language, he feigned continued difficulty as a part of a [[sting operation]] against President Chu, organised by Invisible Kid's Espionage Squad. Once this was completed, he abandoned the ruse. He was the secret admirer of [[Spark (comics)|Spark]], and they later began a relationship.

===2005 "Threeboot"===
In the 2005 reimagining/reboot of the Legion, the character was still referred to as Chameleon, but is now portrayed as a completely [[androgynous]], non-gender specific creature. Chameleon still has the power to change into any form at will, but the character's revised origin has yet to be revealed, although Jeyra Entinn, a female Titanian and [[telepath]], squeezed out of his mind the image of a chilhood ambiguously described as filled with prejudices, which left him driven to achieve results as a detective and a Legionnaire as a way to achieve a better image for all Durlans. He is still a master detective and proficient not only in Interlac but in many aspects of life in the United Planets. He is currently able to mimic only the superficial appearance of people or animals, though duplicating most [[metahuman]] abilities is beyond his capacity; purely  physical powers, however, are in his grasp (for example he can gain the sense smell of a dog and the infrared vision of an exotic beast, but not the [[heat vision]] or the superstrength of [[Superman]]).

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
The events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Legion to continuity, as seen in "[[The Lightning Saga]]" story arc in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', and in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes (comics)|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''.  Chameleon Boy is included in their number.

==Other media==
[[Image:LegionnairesSTAS.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chameleon Boy as seen on Superman:TAS.]] Chameleon appeared in an episode of the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' animated series with [[Saturn Girl]] and [[Cosmic Boy]] titled "New Kids in Town". He was voiced by [[Jason Priestley]]. He later appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Far From Home". 

He appears in the second season of ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]].
