'''Armadillo''', Antonio Rodriguiz, is a [[fictional character]], a minor former [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in Captain America, Vol. 1 #308.

==Character biography==
The Armadillo is a character who was given [[superhuman]] strength and durability by an organization of the Power Broker. Unfortunately, this process bonded his [[costume]] to his body giving him a freakish appearance. 

The Armadillo's original motivation during his criminal [[career]] was to get enough money to be able to pay a doctor to discover a way to cure his girlfriend, Maria, of an unspecified [[terminal illness]]. When she was cured from her treatment she abandoned him because of his appearance. Since that time his motive was to pay the [[Power Broker]] or some other [[scientist]] to find a way to reverse the process which transformed him.

He was talked into giving up a brief life of crime and turned into an ally for [[Captain America]] for a short while. It was later revealed that the Armadillo became a fighter in illegal cage matches and was taken advantage of by his manager. Eventually, he suffered brain damage (he had below average intelligence to begin with) and wound up living in an alley with homeless people.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to a muscle-enhancing procedure performed on him by the villainous Power Broker, the Armadillo has superhuman strength and durability.  Originally it was thought that his costume, a scaly nine-foot-tall orange [[armor]]ed [[hide]] with claws useful for digging through earth, was bonded to his skin by this process. It was later revealed that it was not a costume, but part of his body that had been mutagenically altered with the genetic material of an actual Armadillo. The upward limit of what the Armadillo can lift is somewhere under 30 tons. His armor is [[bulletproof]] and can even resist most ballistic weaponry. His claws can tear through all but the most dense of substances.

The Armadillo is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant as he was a skilled street fighter prior to his superhuman transformation.
