'''Armadillo''' ('''Antonio Rodriguez'''), is a [[fictional character]], a minor former [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' #308.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Antonio Rodriguez was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He was given [[superhuman]] strength and durability by an organization of the [[Power Broker]]. This process bonded his [[costume]] to his body giving him a freakish appearance, causing him to resemble a humanoid armadillo.

The Armadillo's original motivation during his criminal [[career]] was to get enough money to be able to pay a doctor to discover a way to cure his girlfriend, Maria, of an unspecified [[terminal illness]]. When she was cured from her treatment, Maria abandoned him because of his appearance. Since that time his motive has been to secure enough money to pay the Power Broker or some other [[scientist]] to reverse the process which transformed him.

===Life of Crime===
As part of the Armadillo's first encounter with superheroes, he was dispatched by Dr. [[Karl Malus]] to break into the [[West Coast Avengers]] Compound and free [[Erik Josten|Goliath]].  There, the Armadillo battled [[Captain America]], who released him after learning of the sacrifice he made for the comatose Maria.<ref>''Captain America'' #308</ref>

The Armadillo later joined the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]].  While on tour with the UCWF, he battled Captain America and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].  He was injured in a fall from the Empire State Building, and arrested.<ref>''Captain America'' #316</ref>

He was later seen incarcerated in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], following a rampage after discovering his estranged wife Bonita with another man. Having been talked out of a criminal career by Captain America and his allies, he surrendered to [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] to avoid further prosecution.<ref>''Captain America'' #340</ref> Armadillo only wished to serve out the remainder of his sentence. To this end, he fought against various supervillains who wished to engineer large-scale breakouts, including [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and later various supervillains released by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] as they broke out [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].

===Ultimate Fighting League===
After being released from the Vault, Armadillo became the regional champion of the Ultimate Fighting League. After his defeat by Daniel Axum (formerly the villain Battler), Armadillo was reduced to begging in an alleyway. There, he talked Daniel Axum out of joining a [[Spider-Man]] Revenge Squad. 

Having fallen on hard times, Armadillo proceeded to join the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] in robbing an armored car. After his defeat by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], Armadillo was incarcerated at [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], and chained to [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]]. During the break-out initiated by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], Armadillo and Tiger Shark escaped and hid out in the town of [[Fairbury, Illinois]]. There, they were confronted by the [[New Warriors]], resulting in a battle in which both fugitives were defeated. Afterwards, Armadillo joined [[Vil-Anon]], a twelve-step group dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.

===Civil War/The Rangers/MODOK's 11===
Recently, during the [[Marvel civil war|Civil War]],<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (2nd series) #4</ref>, he was spotted at the funeral of [[Stilt-Man]]. After poisoning the guests, the Punisher blew up the bar in which the wake had been held. It was later mentioned  that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]."<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' (2nd series) #17</ref>

The Armadillo later took place in the 50-State Initiative, as a member of Texas' superhero team, The [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]]. However, he was a wash-out extremely quickly. 

He was next seen doing [[lucha libre]] wrestling in Mexico for small cash, eventually being recruited by [[MODOK]]. After being one of the few villains that does not betray MODOK, Armadillo gains more money than initial promised. He happily departs with [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] and [[Deadly Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], with whom he'd developed a friendship, and shows a desire for them to remain as a team.

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to a genetic altering procedure performed on him by the villainous Dr. [[Karl Malus]], the Armadillo has superhuman strength, stamina, and durability.  Originally it was thought that his costume, a scaly nine-foot-tall orange [[armor]]ed [[hide]] with claws useful for digging through earth, was bonded to his skin by this process. It was later revealed that it was not a costume, but part of his body that had been mutagenically altered with the genetic material of an actual armadillo. His armor is [[bulletproof]] and his claws can tear through all but the densest of substances.

The Armadillo is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant as he was a skilled street fighter prior to his superhuman transformation.
