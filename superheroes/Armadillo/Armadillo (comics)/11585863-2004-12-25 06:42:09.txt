'''Armadillo''' is a [[fictional character]], a minor former [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|univrse]].  He was talked into giving up a brief life of crime and turned into an ally for [[Captain America]] for a short while.

Due to a muscle-enhancing procedure performed on him by the villainous Power Broker, the Armadillo has [[superhuman]] strength and durability.  His costume, a scaly nine-foot-tall orange armored hide with claws useful for digging through earth, was bonded to his skin by this process.  The Armadillo's main motivation during his criminal career was to get enough money to be able to pay the Power Broker or some other scientist to find a way to safely remove him from the costume so that he could be reunited with his girlfriend.
