'''Armadillo (Antonio Rodriguez)''', is a [[fictional character]], a minor former [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''Captain America'' #308.

==History==
The Armadillo was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]].  He was given [[superhuman]] strength and durability by an organization of the [[Power Broker]]. Unfortunately, this process bonded his [[costume]] to his body giving him a freakish appearance. 

The Armadillo's original motivation during his criminal [[career]] was to get enough money to be able to pay a doctor to discover a way to cure his girlfriend, Maria, of an unspecified [[terminal illness]]. When she was cured from her treatment she abandoned him because of his appearance. Since that time his motive was to pay the Power Broker or some other [[scientist]] to find a way to reverse the process which transformed him.

His appearnaces have been mostly limited to his incarceration in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] following a rampage after discovering his estranged wife with another man. Having been talked out of a criminal career by Captain America and his allies, Armadillo only wishes to serve out the remainder of his sentence. To this end, he has actually fought against various supervillains who wish to engineer large-scale breakouts, including [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and later various supervillains released by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] as they broke out [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]]. 

After being released from the Vault, Armadillo became the regional champion of the Ultimate Fighting League (in the odd last issues of the first ''Thunderbolts'' series). After his defeat by Daniel Axum (formerly the villain Battler), Armadillo was reduced to begging in an alleyway. There, he talked Daniel Axum out of joining a [[Spider-Man]] Revenge Squad. 

Having fallen on hard time, Armadillo proceeded to join the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] in robbing an armored car. After his defeat by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], Armadillo was incarcerated at [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], and chained to [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]]. During the break-out initiated by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], Armadillo and Tiger Shark escaped, eventually hiding out in the town of [[Fairbury, Illinois]]. There, they were confronted by the [[New Warriors]], resulting in a battle in which both fugitives were defeated. Afterwards, Armadillo joined [[Vil-Anon]], a twelve-step group dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.

More recently Armadillo appeared in [[The New Warriors]] as a hiding fugitive in [[Fairbury, IL]] linked with [[Adamantium]] chains to the hand of [[Tiger Shark (comics) |Tiger Shark]].  They were discovered by The New Warriors because they were ordering pizzas and not paying for them.  After Armadillo was knocked out after being dropped from a great height on to a car by [[Nova (comics) |Nova]] and [[Namorita]], Tiger Shark displayed tremendous strength as he used an unconcious Armadillo as a [[Mace]].  <ref>"New Warriors" Reality Check, #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to a muscle-enhancing procedure performed on him by the villainous Power Broker, the Armadillo has superhuman strength and durability.  Originally it was thought that his costume, a scaly nine-foot-tall orange [[armor]]ed [[hide]] with claws useful for digging through earth, was bonded to his skin by this process. It was later revealed that it was not a costume, but part of his body that had been mutagenically altered with the genetic material of an actual armadillo. His armor is [[bulletproof]] and can even resist most ballistic weaponry. His claws can tear through all but the most dense of substances.

The Armadillo is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant as he was a skilled street fighter prior to his superhuman transformation.
