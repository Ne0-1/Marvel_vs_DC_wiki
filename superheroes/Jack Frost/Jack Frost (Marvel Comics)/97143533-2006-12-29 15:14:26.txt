'''Jack Frost''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe.  He first appeared in ''USA Comics'' #1 (August 1941).

Jack Frost seemingly awoke wandering the [[Arctic]] wastes with no knowledge of his past or origins. He resembles a young man made of ice, and can create and withstand extremely cold temperatures and generate large amounts of ice. He was later added to the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] team. 

[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] has said that he may be the diminutive child of a [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost giant]], but this has never been confirmed.
