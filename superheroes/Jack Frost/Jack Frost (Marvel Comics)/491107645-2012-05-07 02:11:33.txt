===Publication history===
Marvel Comics' first character named Jack Frost outwardly recalls the [[folklore|folklorish]] spirit of winter [[Jack Frost]]. [[First appearance|First appearing]] in ''[[U.S.A. Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1941), from Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]], he was one of the first creations of future Marvel editor-in-chief and publisher [[Stan Lee]],<ref name="lee">[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lee_s.htm Stan Lee] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]</ref> who collaborated with [[penciler]] [[Frank Giacoia]] and [[inker]] [[Carmine Infantino]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1580 The Grand Comics Database: ''USA Comics'' #1]</ref>

In ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #29 (April 1976), he was [[retconned]] to have been a member of the stateside [[World War II]]-era superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]].

===Fictional character biography===
This Jack Frost seemingly awoke wandering the [[Arctic]] wastes with no knowledge of his past or origins. He resembles a young man made of ice, and can create and withstand extremely cold temperatures and generate large amounts of ice. During [[World War II]], he joined with other superheroes to form the team [[Liberty Legion]] and protect the United States from [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] home-front infiltration.  The Liberty Legion was initially assembled by [[Bucky]] Barnes to rescue the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] brainwashed by the [[Red Skull]].  With the Legion, Jack Frost battled [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], and protected bystanders from shrapnel with an ice umbrella.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #29; ''Invaders'' #6; ''Marvel Premiere'' #30</ref>

Jack Frost appeared in the modern era, where it was explained he had sacrificed himself by melding with an Arctic "ice-worm" monster in order to neutralize it and keep it from possibly devastating humanity. Jack Frost was briefly freed during an encounter with [[Captain America]] before willingly being swallowed by and melding with the ice-worm once more.<ref>''Captain America'' #384 (April 1991)</ref> Marvel's [[mythological]] character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in this issue speculated that this Jack Frost may be the diminutive child of a [[Norse mythology]] [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost giant]].

===Powers and abilities===
Jack Frost has the ability to generate sub-freezing temperatures.  Combined with ambient water vapor, he can create snow, sleet, and ice for various effects such as propelling snow flurries at hurricane wind-speeds or fashioning ice into various simple constructs such as spheres, bridges, or walls.  He also has superhuman stamina and durability.

Jack Frost has bluish-white skin that glistens from the glaze of frost that covers it.  His skin temperature is {{convert|32|°F|°C}}.

==Jack Frost (Modern)==
{{main|Blizzard (comics)}}
In modern Marvel continuity, an unrelated, human scientist, Professor Gregor Shapanka, using technological means to generate incapacitating ice which he first planned to use to prolong life, became the [[supervillain]] Jack Frost. He was introduced as an [[antagonist]] of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]], as he was a former Stark employee who was fired for attempted robbery, in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #45 (Sept. 1963). He later took on the name [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]].
