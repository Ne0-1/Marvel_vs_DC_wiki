'''Johnny Thunder''' is the name of two [[fictional characters]] in comics published by [[DC Comics]].

==Versions==
===Original version===
The original and best-known Johnny Thunder appeared in the first issue of ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash Comics]]'' in January [[1940]]. Born at 7 AM on the seventh day of the seventh month in [[1917]], Johnny had a unique destiny; kidnapped by a group of men from the fictional country of Badhnesia as an infant, Johnny was given possession of the [[genie]]-like "Thunderbolt" during a mystic ritual on his seventh birthday, which was intended to allow the Badhnesians to use Johnny to rule the world. However, the plan was soon aborted after an attack from a neighboring country. Johnny eventually returned to the [[United States]] and lived an unextraordinary life until one day, while washing windows, he inadvertently summoned the Thunderbolt with the magic words ''cei-u'' (pronounced "say you"). Eventually, Johnny figured out how to summon the Thunderbolt on cue, and used this ability to eventually join the [[Justice Society of America]].

Johnny's appearances with the Justice Society and in his own solo adventures tended to be quite comedic, as Johnny's main personality trait was being fairly dim-witted, which prompted his much-smarter Thunderbolt to possess a sarcastic (if patient) attitude toward his "boss."

The Thunderbolt's abilities, thanks to his magical powers, were quite vast; however, he was limited by only being able to execute Johnny's exactly worded ordersâ€”which, thanks to Johnny's lack of intelligence, sometimes created a fair amount of chaos.

Johnny's adventures ceased in the late [[1940s]] when he was replaced in the Justice Society stories by a heroine he had begun teaming up with, the [[Black Canary]]. The reason for his leaving the Justice Society was eventually explained (in the [[1970s]] comic ''[[Superman Family]]'' #204) to be that his control over his Thunderbolt was weakening, thanks to a spell cast by renegade Badhnesian priests. In the early [[1950s]], Johnny had been kidnapped again by agents from Badhnesia, with the intention of executing their original world conquest plan. Johnny managed to summon [[Superman]], and the would-be conquerors' plans were defeated. Johnny spent some time in Badhnesia afterwards, teaching the native citizens about [[democracy]]. He returned home after the country had elected its first [[president]].

Johnny rejoined the Justice Society upon its reformation in the [[1960s]], and joined them on various adventures through the following decades. By the [[1990s]], Johnny was suffering from symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and had lost track of a pen in which the Thunderbolt was being stored. The pen eventually wound up in the ownership of a young [[African-American]] boy named [[Jakeem Thunder]]. Recently, in an attempt to save Johnny's life, Johnny was merged with the Thunderbolt, taking the name "Johnny Thunderbolt" (although a recent issue of JSA, dealing with a Jakeem "gone mad", has shown a Johnny separate from the genie and a denizen of the fifth dimension, part of the "Thunderbolt family").

===Old West version===
The second Johnny Thunder, completely unrelated to the original, first appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' in [[1948]].  His name was John Tane and he lived in the Old West. The son of a sheriff and a schoolteacher, Johnny's mother made him promise never to use guns and to instead follow in her footsteps. Johnny, however, soon found himself in a situation where violence was required. In order to keep his vow, Johnny created the identity of Johnny Thunder, by changing clothes and using coal dust to change his hair black. The stories of his adventures were surprisingly ahead of their time, in that they dealt with the position of African-Americans and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the Old West.

===Pre-Crisis Earth-One version===
Prior to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], the hero Johnny Thunder hailed from [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]]. A counterpart existed on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]], but this version was a simple petty criminal with no Thunderbolt. When the Earth-One Johnny somehow got hold of the 'bolt, he used it to temporarily reshape Earth-One such that several heroes, such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Green Lantern]], retroactively ceased to exist, their powers being transferred to some of Johnny's fellow criminals. (The Thunderbolt was unable to tell the difference between the Johnny Thunders, and so obeyed the orders of the criminal Johnny without question.) This alternate version of Earth-One is sometimes referred to as [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-A|Earth-A]] ('A' for 'alternate'). It was wiped from existence when the Thunderbolt's abilities were employed to return Earth-One to normal.

==Trivia==
