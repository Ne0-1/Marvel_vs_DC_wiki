'''Johnny Thunder''' is the name of three [[fictional characters]] in comics published by [[DC Comics]].  A fourth character has the variant name '''Jonni Thunder'''.

==Fictional character biography==
John "Johnny" L. Thunder is the seventh son of a seventh son, born at 7 a.m. on Saturday, July 7, the seventh day of the week, the seventh day of the seventh month in 1917. This causes him to be kidnapped and sold to a group of men from the fictional country of Badhnesia who had been looking for someone born at this time on this day. As an infant, Johnny is given possession of the [[genie]]-like "Thunderbolt"<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 8 | date=  August, 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = 32 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> during a mystic ritual on his seventh birthday, which was intended to allow the Badhnesians to use Johnny to rule the world. However, the plan is soon aborted after an attack from a neighboring country.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | date=  January, 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = 34-35 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> Johnny eventually returns to the [[United States]] and lives an unextraordinary life until one day, while washing windows, he inadvertently summons the Thunderbolt with the magic words ''cei-u'' (pronounced "say you") which he accidentally uses to become a successful boxer. Johnny underwent several adventures (each time inadvertently summoning the Thunderbolt via the use of "say, you" in his day-to-day conversation, never realizing the Thunderbolt was responsible for the extraordinary events that befell him) before finally learning of the Thunderbolt's existence. <ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 2 | date=  February, 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = 35 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

Johnny's appearances with the Justice Society and in his own solo adventures tended to be quite comedic, as Johnny's main personality trait was being fairly dim-witted, which prompts his much-smarter Thunderbolt to possess a sarcastic (if patient) attitude toward his "boss." Despite recurring impatience with his stupidity, his fellow JSAers genuinely valued Johnny's good-heartedness and dedication and considered him a friend. Furthermore, the Thunderbolt's vast power may have contributed to Johnny's continued JSA membership, his frequent blunders notwithstanding, since the more competent heroes doubtlessly thought it wise to keep an eye on the pair whenever possible. Like most of the JSA members, he had his aging factor greatly slowed during an encounter with the villain [[Ian Karkull]].

Johnny's adventures ceased in the late 1940s when he was replaced in the Justice Society stories by a heroine he had begun teaming up with, the [[Black Canary]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[All Star Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 42 | Date = | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> The reason for his leaving the Justice Society is eventually explained to be that his control over his Thunderbolt is weakening, thanks to a spell cast by renegade Badhnesian priests.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] | Penciller = [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] | Inker = [[Frank Chiaramonte]] | Story = The Rescue of His Majesty, Johnny Thunder | Title = [[Superman Family]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 204 | date=  November/December, 1980 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page =  | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> In the early 1950s, Johnny is kidnapped again by agents from Badhnesia, with the intention of executing their original world conquest plan. Johnny manages to summon [[Superman]], and the would-be conquerors' plans are defeated. Johnny spent some time in Badhnesia afterwards, teaching the native citizens about [[democracy]]. He returns home after the country elects its first [[president]]. Johnny joins the Justice Society on various adventures. 

===Crisis on Infinite Earths & Ragnorok===
Following the maxi-series '''''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''''' was the one-shot '''''Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special''''' (1986).  This book depicted the sacrifice of Johnny and his JSA teammates as they left the 'new' post-Crisis world and entered into a limbo dimension.  Caused by the actions of [[Adolf Hitler]] in April 1945, a wave of destruction appears over Earth even as it is settling down from the Crisis.  In order to stop a literal Ragnorok, the heroes enter into an eternal battle, and so leave the world.

===Johnny's Return===
The absence of the JSA and of Johnny Thunder did not last long.  In 1992 DC published '''''Armageddon: Inferno''''', the mini-series which brought the JSA out of limbo and into the post-Crisis world.  This was followed by '''''Justice Society of America''''' (1992-1993).  This series showed how the heroes were adjusting to a 'normal' life.  Johnny is depicted as an over-weight man, not as old as his friends, but nostalgic for the past.  It is explained that before he had entered into limbo he had lent his foster daughter a few thousand dollars and during his time fighting for the universe, she had created ''Peachy's Frozen Yogurt'', a very successful chain of which Johnny is half owner... and now very wealthy.  Of greater import to Johnny Thunder is his discovery that the Bahdnesians have all but disappeared.  A visit to the island of Bahdnesia (now under the ownerhsip of Pol St. Germain) proves that no Bahdnesians are left there. In issue #7 Johnny states: "There were never very many of them... and the island magic had worn out.  T-Bolt was all that was left, and he was with me in limbo.  They had to leave or starve to death."  This series also introduced the young Kiku, according to the Thunderbolt, the last remaining Bhadnesian.

After this Johnny is depicted as suffering from symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]].  At one point he loses track of a pen in which the Thunderbolt is being stored. The pen eventually ends up in the ownership of a young [[African American]] boy named Jakeem Williams, who takes up the name Johnny Jakeem Thunder or [[Jakeem Thunder]].<ref>''JLA'' #26</ref>

===Johnny Thunder of Earth-One===
Due to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] some of Johnny Thunder's adventures have been retconned out of existence when his history was moved from [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|New Earth]]. A counterpart that has since been retconned out existed on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]], but this version was a simple petty criminal with no Thunderbolt. When the Earth-One Johnny somehow gets hold of the 'bolt, he uses it to temporarily reshape Earth-One such that several heroes, such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Green Lantern]], retroactively cease to exist, their powers being transferred to some of Johnny's fellow criminals. (The Thunderbolt is 'keyed' to simply obey Johnny Thunder, without any distinction made between alternate versions of Thunder, and so had to obey the orders of the criminal Johnny, although he often tries to work in loopholes to give the heroes an advantage.) This alternate version of Earth-One is sometimes referred to as [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-A|Earth-A]]. Thunder's 'Lawless League' of evil Justice League heroes are defeated by the visiting [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] of Earth-Two, who subsequently face off against Johnny Thunder on the moon. When the fight comes down to a struggle between [[Doctor Fate]] and the Thunderbolt, Johnny Thunder is so battered about by the combating magic wielders that he finally gives up his attempts to use the Thunderbolt and wishes that none of these events had taken place.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #37 (August 1965)</ref>

The Johnny Thunder of Earth-One would return in ''Justice League of America'' #219 and #220.

==John Tane==
The second Johnny Thunder, completely unrelated to the original, first appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]] #100'' in 1948. His name was John Stuart Mill Tane and he lives in the [[Mormon]] settlement of Mesa City, Arizona. The son of a sheriff and a schoolteacher, Johnny's mother makes him promise never to use guns and to instead follow in her footsteps. Johnny becomes a schoolteacher, but however, soon found himself in a situation where violence is required. In order to keep his vow, Johnny creates the identity of Johnny Thunder, by changing clothes and darkening his hair to black. Thus "Thunder" is not the character's genuine surname, making it unlikely that any familial connection exists between the two Johnnys.

In ''[[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'' Annual #2 (1997), a back up story revealed that, at the time of his mother's death, Johnny Tane is inspired to create a [[secret identity]] by [[Max Mercury]]. The young Johnny is briefly under the impression Max is a genie, in an ironic reference to the later Johnny Thunder. Eventually, Johnny retired from action, marrying the similarly-retired outlaw [[Madame .44]], and the couple bore a son and a daughter.

==Jonni Thunder==
Jonni Thunder is a female private detective who first appeared in a four issue miniseries from 1985 named ''Jonni Thunder AKA Thunderbolt'', written by [[Roy Thomas]].  A small gold statue gives her the power to turn into a human thunderbolt, while leaving her body behind.  In later issues of [[Infinity, Inc.]], the thunderbolt is revealed to be a hostile alien energy-being, who is defeated by being reimprisoned in the statue, leaving Jonni without powers.{{issue}}  Since she was created by [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] expert [[Roy Thomas]] and appeared with the descendants of the original JSA in ''Infinity Inc.'', a potential connection to Johnny Thunder seemed likely but was never expounded upon.  Jonni existed on Earth-Two before ''Crisis'' and is briefly seen on the merged Earth resulting from the Crisis, attending a detectives convention.<ref>''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #11</ref>

In the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' continuity, she and [[Black Lightning]] have a child who becomes the [[anti-hero]] known as "Lightning", possessing the electricity-based powers of both of her parents. However, in the contemporary DC Universe, Black Lightning's daughter Lightning, who recently joined the JSA, is identified as the daughter of Black Lightning and his ex-wife Lynn Stewart.

==Other media==
Johnny Thunder and Thunderbolt had made many appearances on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as League members.
Johnny Thunder has also made appearances in lego sets and comics in the magizines a while ago.
