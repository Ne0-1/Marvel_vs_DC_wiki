'''Johnny Thunder''' is the name of three [[fictional characters]] in comics published by [[DC Comics]].  A fourth character has the variant name '''Jonni Thunder'''.

==Fictional character biography==
Johnny Thunder is the seventh son of a seventh son, born at 7 AM on the seventh day of the seventh month in [[1917]]. This causes him to be kidnapped and sold to a group of men from the fictional country of Badhnesia who had been looking for someone born at this time on this day. As an infant, Johnny is given possession of the [[genie]]-like "Thunderbolt"<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 8 | date=  August, 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = 32 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> during a mystic ritual on his seventh birthday, which was intended to allow the Badhnesians to use Johnny to rule the world. However, the plan is soon aborted after an attack from a neighboring country.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | date=  January, 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = 34-35 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> Johnny eventually returns to the [[United States]] and lived an unextraordinary life until one day, while washing windows, he inadvertently summons the Thunderbolt with the magic words ''cei-u'' (pronounced "say you") which he accidentally uses to become a successful boxer.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 2 | date=  February, 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = 35 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> Eventually, Johnny figures out how to summon the Thunderbolt on cue, uses this ability to eventually join the [[Justice Society of America]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Johnny's appearances with the Justice Society and in his own solo adventures tended to be quite comedic, as Johnny's main personality trait was being fairly dim-witted, which prompts his much-smarter Thunderbolt to possess a sarcastic (if patient) attitude toward his "boss."

The Thunderbolt's abilities, thanks to his magical powers, are quite vast; however, he is limited by only being able to execute Johnny's exactly worded ordersâ€”which, thanks to Johnny's lack of intelligence, sometimes create a fair amount of chaos.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Johnny's adventures ceased in the late [[1940s]] when he was replaced in the Justice Society stories by a heroine he had begun teaming up with, the [[Black Canary]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Artist =  | Story = | Title = [[All Star Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 42 | Date = | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> The reason for his leaving the Justice Society is eventually explained to be that his control over his Thunderbolt is weakening, thanks to a spell cast by renegade Badhnesian priests.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] | Penciller = [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] | Inker = [[Frank Chiaramonte]] | Story = The Rescue of His Majesty, Johnny Thunder | Title = [[Superman Family]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 204 | date=  November/December, 1980 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page =  | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> In the early [[1950s]], Johnny is kidnapped again by agents from Badhnesia, with the intention of executing their original world conquest plan. Johnny manages to summon [[Superman]], and the would-be conquerors' plans are defeated. Johnny spent some time in Badhnesia afterwards, teaching the native citizens about [[democracy]]. He returns home after the country elects its first [[president]].

Johnny rejoins the Justice Society upon its reformation in the [[1960s]],{{Fact|date=September 2007}} and joins them on various adventures through the following decades. 

===Crisis on Infinite Earths & Ragnorok===
Following the maxi-series '''''Crisis on Infinite Earths''''' was the one-shot '''''Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special''''' (1986).  This book depicted the sacrifice of Johnny and his JSA teammates as they left the 'new' post-Crisis world and entered into a limbo dimension.  Caused by the actions of Adolf Hitler in April 1945, a wave of destruction appears over earth even as it is settling down from the Crisis.  In order to stop a literal Ragnorok, the heroes enter into an eternal battle, and so leave the world.

===Johnny's Return===
The absence of the JSA and of Johnny Thunder did not last long.  In 1992 DC published '''''Armageddon: Inferno''''', the mini-series which brought the JSA out of limbo and into the post-Crisis world.  This was followed by '''''Justice Society of America''''' (1992-1993).  This series showed how the heroes were adjusting to a 'normal' life.  Johnny is depicted as an over-weight man, not as old as his friends, but nostalgic for the past.  It is explained that before he had entered into limbo he had lent his foster daughter a few thousand dollars and during his time fighting for the universe, she had created ''Peachy's Frozen Yogurt'', a very successful chain of which Johnny is half owner... and now very wealthy.  Of greater import to Johnny Thunder is his discovery that the Bahdnesians have all but disappeared.  A visit to the island of Bahdnesia (now under the ownerhsip of Pol St. Germain) proves that no Bahdnesians are left there. In issue #7 Johnny states: "There were never very many of them... and the island magic had worn out.  T-Bolt was all that was left, and he was with me in limbo.  They had to leave or starve to death."  This series also introduced the young Kiku, according to the Thunder Bolt, the last remaining Bhadnesian.

After this Johnny is depicted as suffering from symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]].  At one point he loses track of a pen in which the Thunderbolt is being stored.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} The pen eventually emds up in the ownership of a young [[African American]] boy named [[Jakeem Thunder]].<ref>''JLA'' #26</ref> Recently, in an attempt to save Johnny's life after the [[Ultra-Humanite]] used his body to take control of the Thunderbolt and temporarily remake Earth in his image, Johnny is merged with the Thunderbolt, taking the name "Johnny Thunderbolt"{{Fact|date=September 2007}} (although a recent issue of JSA, dealing with a Jakeem "gone mad", shows a Johnny separate from the genie and a denizen of the fifth dimension, part of the "Thunderbolt family").{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

===Johnny Thunder of Earth-One===
Due to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] some of Johnny Thunder's adventures have been retconned out of existence when his history was moved from [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|New Earth]]. A counterpart that has since been retconned out existed on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]], but this version was a simple petty criminal with no Thunderbolt. When the Earth-One Johnny somehow gets hold of the 'bolt, he uses it to temporarily reshape Earth-One such that several heroes, such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Green Lantern]], retroactively cease to exist, their powers being transferred to some of Johnny's fellow criminals. (The Thunderbolt is 'keyed' to simply obey Johnny Thunder, without any distinction made between alternate versions of Thunder, and so had to obey the orders of the criminal Johnny, although he often tries to work in loopholes to give the heroes an advantage.) This alternate version of Earth-One is sometimes referred to as [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-A|Earth-A]]. Thunder's 'Lawless League' of evil Justice League heroes are defeated by the visiting [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] of Earth-Two, who subsequently face off against Johnny Thunder on the moon. When the fight comes down to a struggle between [[Doctor Fate]] and the Thunderbolt, Johnny Thunder is so battered about by the combating magic wielders that he finally gives up his attempts to use the Thunderbolt and wishes that none of these events had taken place.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #37 (Aug. 1965)</ref>

==John Tane==
The second Johnny Thunder, completely unrelated to the original, first appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' in [[1948]]. His name was John Tane and he lives in the [[Mormon]] settlement of Mesa City, Arizona, which is portrayed as a mostly congenial Old West town.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} The son of a sheriff and a schoolteacher, Johnny's mother makes him promise never to use guns and to instead follow in her footsteps. Johnny becomes a schoolteacher, but however, soon found himself in a situation where violence is required. In order to keep his vow, Johnny creates the identity of Johnny Thunder, by changing clothes and using coal dust to change his hair black.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} The stories of his adventures were surprisingly ahead of their time, in that they dealt with the position of African-Americans and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the Old West.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Johnny Thunder's "old-fashioned" heroic values were admirable, but also fairly typical of pop culture protagonists created during the 1940s and '50s. As was typical of leading characters in popular fiction at the time, Johnny evinced vaguely Judeo-Christian values and beliefs; his precise denominational affiliation (as a [[Latter Day Saint]]) was only vaguely hinted at. In ''[[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'' Annual #2 (1997), a back up story revealed that, at the time of his mother's death, Johnny Tane is inspired to create a [[secret identity]] by [[Max Mercury]]. The young Johnny is briefly under the impression Max is a genie, in an ironic reference to the later Johnny Thunder.

==Jonni Thunder==
Jonni Thunder is a female private detective who first appeared in a four issue miniseries from 1985 named ''Jonni Thunder AKA Thunderbolt'', written by [[Roy Thomas]].  A small gold statue gives her the power to turn into a human thunderbolt, while leaving her body behind.  In later issues of [[Infinity, Inc.]], the thunderbolt is revealed to be a hostile alien energy-being, who is defeated by being reimprisoned in the statue, leaving Jonni without powers.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}  Jonni existed on Earth-Two before Crisis and is briefly seen on the merged Earth resulting from Crisis, attending a detectives convention.<ref>''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #11</ref>

==Other media==
Johnny Thunder and Thunderbolt had made many appearances on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as League members.
