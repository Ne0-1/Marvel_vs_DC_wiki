'''Johnny Thunder''' is the name of three [[fictional characters|fictional]] superheroes appearing in comics published by [[DC Comics]]. A fourth character has the variant name '''Jonni Thunder'''. 

==Publication history==
Johnny Thunder first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940) and was created by [[John Wentworth (comics)|John Wentworth]] and [[Stan Aschmeier]].  In the first few issues, the title of the feature was ''Johnny Thunderbolt''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''John L. Thunder''' is the seventh son of a seventh son, born at 7 a.m. on Saturday, July 7, the seventh day of the week, the seventh day of the seventh month in 1917. This causes him to be kidnapped and sold to a group of men from the fictional country of Badhnesia who had been looking for someone born at this time on this day. As an infant, the [[blond]]-haired Johnny is given possession of the pink, [[lightning]]-haired [[Jinn|genie]]-like "[[Thunderbolt (DC Comics)|Thunderbolt]]"<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = #8 | date= August 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> named '''Yz''' during a mystic ritual on his 7th birthday, which was intended to allow the Badhnesians to use Johnny to rule the world. However, the plan is soon aborted after an attack from a neighboring country.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = #1 | date= January 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

Johnny eventually returns to the [[United States]] and lives an ordinary life until one day, while washing windows, he inadvertently summons the Thunderbolt with the magic words "'''Cei-U'''" (pronounced "say you") when he calls for someone to throw him a sponge, which he accidentally uses to become a successful boxer. Johnny underwent several adventures (each time inadvertently summoning the Thunderbolt via the use of "say, you" in his day-to-day conversation, never realizing the Thunderbolt, who moved so fast he was virtually [[invisible]], was responsible for the extraordinary events that befell him) before finally learning of the Thunderbolt's existence.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = | Story = | Title = [[Flash Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = #2 | date= February 1940 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

Johnny lived with his parents, dated his on-again, off-again girlfriend Daisy Darling (who had a somewhat less-than-scrupulous businessman father) and later he adopted a little [[freckle]]-faced blond orphan girl named Peachy Pet, who, despite her cutesy name and clothing, was a tough little girl who was much smarter than her new father.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #21 (September 1941). [[All-American Publications]].</ref>  Many times during his adventures, which included a stint with the United States Navy, Peachy would instruct her befuddled but beloved "Papa John" on how and when to use the Thunderbolt's magic powers.

The green-suit-and-red-[[bow tie]]-clad Johnny's appearances with the [[Justice Society of America]] and in his own solo adventures tended to be quite comedic, as Johnny's main personality trait was being fairly dimwitted, which prompts his much-smarter Thunderbolt to possess a sarcastic (if patient) attitude toward his "boss", while knowing full well that he could not actually do anything until his master told him to.

Johnny accidentally joined the Justice Society when wishing out loud that he could be a member and was immediately taken to their meeting by the Thunderbolt. Despite recurring impatience with his stupidity, his fellow JSAers genuinely valued Johnny's good-heartedness and dedication and considered him a friend. Furthermore, the Thunderbolt's vast power may have contributed to Johnny's continued JSA membership, his frequent blunders notwithstanding, since the more competent heroes doubtlessly thought it wise to keep an eye on the pair whenever possible. He finally became a member after the Flash left and the group told him to capture Mister X, which he accidentally succeeded in doing. Like most of the JSA members, he had his aging factor greatly slowed during an encounter with the villain [[Ian Karkull]].

Johnny's adventures ceased in the late 1940s when he was replaced in the ''Justice Society'' stories by a heroine he had begun teaming up with, the [[Black Canary]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = | Story = | Title = [[All Star Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = #42 | Date = August-September 1948 | Publisher = [[All-American Publications]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> The reason for his leaving the Justice Society is eventually explained to be that his control over his Thunderbolt is weakening, thanks to a spell cast by renegade Badhnesian priests.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] | Penciller = [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] | Inker = [[Frank Chiaramonte]] | Story = The Rescue of His Majesty, Johnny Thunder | Title = [[Superman Family]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = #204 | date= November/December, 1980 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> In the early 1950s, Johnny is kidnapped again by agents from Badhnesia, with the intention of executing their original world conquest plan. Johnny manages to summon [[Superman]], and the would-be conquerors' plans are defeated. Johnny spent some time in Badhnesia afterwards, teaching the native citizens about [[democracy]]. He returns home after the country elects its first [[President (government title)|President]]. Johnny joins the Justice Society on various adventures.

===''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and Ragnarök===
Following the maxiseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was the one-shot ''[[Last Days of the Justice Society of America]] Special'' (1986). This book depicted the sacrifice of Johnny and his JSA teammates as they left the 'new' Post-''Crisis'' world and entered into a Limbo dimension. Caused by the actions of [[Adolf Hitler]] in April 1945, a wave of destruction appears over Earth even as it is settling down from the Crisis. In order to stop a literal [[Ragnarök]], the heroes enter into an eternal battle and so leave the world.

===Johnny's return===
The absence of the JSA and of Johnny Thunder did not last long. In 1992 DC published ''Armageddon: Inferno'', the miniseries which brought the JSA out of Limbo and into the Post-''Crisis'' world. This was followed by ''Justice Society of America'' (1992–1993). This series showed how the heroes were adjusting to a 'normal' life. Johnny is depicted as an overweight man, not as old as his friends, but nostalgic for the past. It is explained that before he had entered into Limbo, he had lent his foster daughter a few thousand dollars and during his time fighting for the universe, she had created ''Peachy's Frozen Yogurt'', a very successful chain of which Johnny is half owner and now very wealthy. Of greater import to Johnny is his discovery that the Bahdnesians have all but disappeared. A visit to the island of Bahdnesia (now under the ownership of Pol St. Germain) proves that no Bahdnesians are left there. In issue #7, Johnny states: "There were never very many of them...and the island magic had worn out. T-Bolt was all that was left, and he was with me in limbo. They had to leave or starve to death." This series also introduced the young Kiku, according to the Thunderbolt, the last remaining Bahdnesian.

After this, Johnny is depicted as suffering from symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. At one point, he loses track of a pen in which the Thunderbolt is being stored. The pen eventually ends up in the ownership of a young [[African American]] boy named Jakeem Williams, who takes up the name Johnny Jakeem Thunder or [[Jakeem Thunder]].<ref>''JLA'' #26. DC Comics.</ref>

===Johnny Thunderbolt===
In a later battle with [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], Jakeem unwittingly cures Johnny Thunder of his Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, Johnny immediately falls prey to the [[Ultra-Humanite]], who takes over Johnny's body in order to command the Thunderbolt's powers. In the "Stealing Thunder" storyline, Jakeem is one of several heroes left free from the Ultra-Humanite's control. Eventually, Jakeem wrests control of the Thunderbolt back from the Ultra-Humanite, but Johnny Thunder loses his life. Jakeem then wishes that the Thunderbolt could save Johnny somehow, so the genie chooses to merge with Johnny, creating a new being with the memories of both. He later assumes the name Johnny Thunderbolt.<ref>''JSA'' #46. DC Comics (New York).</ref>

Johnny Thunderbolt bears Johnny's likeness, though it is not clear how the personalities of Johnny and the two genies interact, and whether any one personality is dominant. Johnny's family is informed of his death and a funeral is held at Valhalla, a cemetery for superheroes. The family does not know that he lives on as the Thunderbolt. The Thunderbolt eventually stops displaying Johnny's likeness while still speaking as him.

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Johnny Thunder's body is reanimated as part of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4. DC Comics (New York).</ref>

===''DC Rebirth''===
When [[Wally West]] was looking for someone to tether him to the universe again as seen in the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' reboot, he comes to a retirement home called the Good Life Rest Home where a now-elderly Johnny Thunder tries to reconnect to the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]], who have been lost since [[Joseph McCarthy]] had him reveal his secret and he had lost the Thunderbolt in the periods since. He tried to tell others who he was, but many think that he is crazy. When Wally comes to him to find the Justice Society, he disappears asking him to find the Justice Society. Believing that he was his old ally, Johnny tearfully calls out to him, apologizing for "throwing (him) away" in the past.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016). DC Comics (New York).</ref> Johnny Thunder is seen climbing on a rooftop of a home for the elderly shouting "Where are you Thunderbolt?" and calls him (the Thunderbolt) to come back to him. He is later found by two men: presumably workers at the house. They ask him how did he get there and forcefully pull him from the edge of the roof, saving him from lightning that struck the place that he stood on. He shouts at them that they "can't keep me locked up" and struggles to get free of them. they say he "has got a lot of a fight for a ninety-year-old" and drag him into the building. On the way into the building, he says that "The lightning says we need to find my friends" and "We lost the Justice Society" and "It's all my fault", to which they reply with disbelief, saying "Sure it did" and "Tell the nurse to up his meds."<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #21 (April 2017). DC Comics (New York).</ref>

During the 2018-2019 miniseries ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Johnny Thunder is seen at his retirement home staring out the window while waiting for his family to take him out to dinner. They do not show up.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018). DC Comics (New York).</ref> Later that night, Thunder escapes from the retirement home as one of the orderlies claims that he will not get far. He heads to an old steel mill, where he is assaulted by a group of thieving junkies. However, he is saved by [[Saturn Girl]] and [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] II. Johnny Thunder finds Alan Scott's Green Lantern power battery. Rorschach II asks Johnny Thunder what that Lantern is.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics (New York).</ref> Rorschach, Saturn Girl and Johnny Thunder meet up with Ozymandias at the Owlship. Using Ozymandias' pet [[lynx]] Bubastis II (revealed to have been cloned from the original Bubastis that Doctor Manhattan disintegrated and containing a sliver of his power) and the Lantern Battery, Ozymandias transports everyone to Doctor Manhattan's location at the Joker's “fun house” where Comedian is. After the confrontation with Doctor Manhattan, the injured Ozymandias makes it back to the Owlship, attacking Johnny and Saturn Girl, declaring that he can save everything and everyone.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #7 (September 2018). DC Comics (New York).</ref> Ozymandias has Johnny Thunder and Saturn Girl imprisoned in his hideout. When Saturn Girl fades upon no longer being part of the current timeline, Ozymandias leaves as Johnny Thunder mourns Saturn Girl's disappearance and Alan Scott's Green Lantern is shown near him.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #11 (September 2019). DC Comics (New York).</ref> When Doctor Manhattan undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes, Johnny Thunder finds himself merged with Thunderbolt as Johnny Thunderbolt.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12 (December 2019).

==Other versions and connected characters==
===Johnny Thunder of Earth-One===
Prior to the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' retcon, an alternate version of Johnny Thunder existed on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]]. This version was a simple petty criminal with no Thunderbolt. Upon meeting the Earth-Two Thunder (who had traveled to Earth-One out of curiosity), the criminal Johnny Thunder knocked his counterpart out and seized control of the Thunderbolt. He uses it to temporarily reshape Earth-One such that several heroes, such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Green Lantern]], retroactively cease to exist. The criminal exploits the fact that the Thunderbolt is 'keyed' to simply obey Johnny Thunder, without any distinction made between alternate versions, leaving the Thunderbolt obligated to obey whichever Johnny is conscious despite his own morality; however, the Thunderbolt often tries to work in loopholes to give the heroes an advantage, such as informing the criminal that the Justice Society - who had come to Earth-1 to find out what had happened to their friends in the Justice League - had disappeared, when they had, in fact, disguised themselves as the Justice League to try and provoke Johnny into revealing what had happened to their version, or making a barrier which keeps cops out, but not superheroes. The Earth-2 Johnny is apparently placed in a coma by the Thunderbolt's magic, though this is not actually shown.

The alternate version of Earth-One that Johnny creates is sometimes referred to as [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-A|Earth-A]] (Earth Alternate), which Johnny thinks up himself. Thunder's 'Lawless League' of evil people with powers like the Justice League heroes, which are made up of Johnny's fellow criminals who were given the powers of the Justice League members, are defeated by the visiting [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] of Earth-Two, who had originally disguised themselves as the JLA, after learning of Johnny's disappearance, the Society's greater experience allowing them to easily defeat their criminal counterparts. They subsequently face off against Johnny Thunder on the Moon, and the three creatures that the Thunderbolt creates, Medusa-Man (who turns people into wood), Absorbo-Man (who can absorb the powers of others), and Repello-Man (who throws attacks back at their origins). All of the members are defeated, except for Doctor Fate. He creates a golden mask over Medusa-Man's face, and sends the wooden Mr. Terrific and Atom at Absorbo-Man, who had absorbed Green Lantern's power, meaning he is vulnerable to wood and is destroyed. He uses repello-magic on Repello-Man, which is repelled and destroys him. When the fight comes down to a struggle between [[Doctor Fate]] and the Thunderbolt, Johnny Thunder is so battered about by the combatting magic wielders - whose powers fail to do any actual damage to each other - that he finally gives up his attempts to use the Thunderbolt and wishes that none of these events had taken place.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #37 (August 1965)</ref> The two Earths and their respective heroes are restored, with the Justice League mentioning their world's Johnny Thunder as a small-time criminal at their meeting. The Johnny Thunder of Earth-One would return as a threat in ''Justice League of America'' #219-220.

===Jonni Thunder===
{{split|Jonni Thunder|date=April 2018}}
Jonni Thunder is a female private detective who first appeared in a four-issue miniseries from 1985 named ''Jonni Thunder aka Thunderbolt'', written by [[Roy Thomas]]. A small gold statue gives her the power to turn into a human thunderbolt, while leaving her body behind. First described as "a stone once struck by the hand of [[Apu Illapu]], the [[Inca]] lightning god,"<ref>''Jonni Thunder AKA Thunderbolt'' #3</ref> the thunderbolt is revealed in later issues of ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' to be a hostile alien energy-being, who is defeated by being re-imprisoned in the statue, leaving Jonni without powers.<ref>''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' #41</ref> Since she was created by [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] expert [[Roy Thomas]] and appeared with the descendants of the original JSA in ''Infinity Inc.'', a potential connection to Johnny Thunder seemed likely, but was never expounded upon. Jonni existed on Earth-Two before ''Crisis'' and is briefly seen on the merged Earth resulting from the Crisis, attending a detectives' convention.<ref>''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #11. DC Comics (New York).</ref>

In the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' continuity, she and [[Black Lightning]] have a child who becomes the [[anti-hero]] known as "Lightning", possessing the electricity-based powers of both of her parents. However, in the contemporary DC Universe, Black Lightning's daughter [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Lightning]], who recently joined the JSA, is identified as the daughter of Black Lightning and his ex-wife Lynn Stewart.

In ''[[The New 52]]'', a 2011 reboot of the [[DC Universe]], the history of characters related to the Golden Age of Comics has been drastically altered. A new version of Jonni Thunder is introduced on the parallel world of [[Earth Two|Earth 2]], appearing in the miniseries ''Earth 2: Worlds End''. This Jonni is seemingly possessed by the Thunderbolt, which grants her electrical abilities and a multi-armed appearance similar to a [[Hindu]] goddess. She is part of a team of heroes recruited by the mage [[John Constantine]] in his attempt to return to his own world.

===Son of Johnny Thunder (Will Power of ''Primal Force'')===
William Twotrees is the illegitimate son of 1940s hero Johnny Thunder and a [[Jicarilla Apache]] woman. Afraid of prejudices against mixed marriages, Johnny abandoned his son, something he later regretted deeply. However, it seems as if Johnny's partner, the magic Thunderbolt named Yz, left his mark on young William, who developed astonishing Thunderbolt powers later in his life. As Will Power, William joined the supernatural/metahuman team of heroes called the Leymen (a.k.a. [[Primal Force]]) until it was disbanded. He was last seen searching for his father, touring with a rock band as a "human light show".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=willpower |title=The Unofficial Will Power Biography |publisher=Dcuguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>

Twotrees has neither reappeared since the cancellation of the ''Primal Force'' series nor been referenced in any way in the later [[Justice Society of America]] titles.

==In other media==
Johnny Thunder and the Thunderbolt appear in three non-speaking roles in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. Johnny himself only appears in the first episode, "Initiation." The Thunderbolt goes on to appear in two more episodes by himself. The Thunderbolt appears in "Initiation", "The Greatest Story Never Told", and the series finale "Destroyer." In "Initiation", he is seen with Johnny during [[Superman]]'s speech. In "The Greatest Story Never Told", he is seen helping the Justice League in the battle against [[Mordru]] without Johnny. In the series finale "Destroyer", he is seen at the end as the League walks down the stairs, also without Johnny. It is possible that this incarnation is Johnny Thunderbolt.
