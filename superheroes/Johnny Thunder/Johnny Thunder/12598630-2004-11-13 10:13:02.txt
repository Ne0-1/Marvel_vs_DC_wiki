'''Johnny Thunder''' is the name of two characters in the [[DC Universe]]

The first Johnny Thunder appeared in the first issue of [[Flash Comics]] in [[1939]].
Born at 7 AM on the seventh day of the seventh month in 1917, Johnny had a unique destiny. Kidnapped by cultist from the imaginary country of Badhnisia, Johnny was give possion  of the genie-like "Thunderbolt" during a mystic ritual on his 7th birthday. The genie would appear whenever Johnny said the word "cei-u" ("say you"), though it was a while before Johnny figured out that. He went on to have many comic adventures and, later, joined the [[Justice Society of America]]. 

Following the JSA's [[1990s]] sojourn in the [[Ragnarok]] Dimension, Johnny was suffering from [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. He lost track of the pen the Thunderbolt was contained in. Eventually, the genie was passed on to a young African-American kid named [[J. J. Thunder|Jakeem Thunder]]. Johnny is now merged with the Thunderbolt.

The second Johnny Thunder first appeared in [[All-American Comics]] in [[1948]].  His name was John Tane and he lived in the Old West. The son of a sheriff and a schoolteacher, his mother made him promise never to use guns and to follow in her footsteps. Of course, Johnny soon found himself in a situation where violence was called for. In order to keep his vow, Johnny creates the identity of Johnny Thunder, by changing clothes and using coal dust to change his hair black. The stories he appeared in were surprisingly ahead of their time, in that they dealt with the position of [[African-Americans]] and [[Native Americans]] in the Old West.
