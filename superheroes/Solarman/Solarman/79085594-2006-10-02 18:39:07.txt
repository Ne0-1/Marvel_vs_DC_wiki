'''Solarman''' was a superhero that ran briefly in his own title by [[Marvel Comics]].

In reality Solarman is teenaged Benjamin Tucker, who dreams of writing for Marvel Comics. An alien warlord named Kraal tried to use his technology to drain the energy of Earth's sun, but his head scientist, Sha-han, refused and fled to Earth with Kraal's Circlet of Power, which he gave to Ben. Thereafter, Ben could expose the circlet (which is worn on his wrist and can't be removed) to sunlight and transform into Solarman, who is capable of super-sonic flight, survival in deep space, and can utilize superhuman strength and control over light energies.

Marvel had high hopes for the character, and even created a pilot for an animated TV series based around him, but the public wasn't interested; the show was never picked up and his comic lasted only two issues.

The idea has much in common, even down to the real name of the main character, with the animated TV series ''[[Ben 10]]''.
