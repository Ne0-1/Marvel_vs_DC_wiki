'''Solarman''' was a [[superhero]] that ran briefly in his own [[1989]] title from [[Marvel Comics]].

In reality '''Solarman''' is teenaged '''Benjamin Tucker''', who dreams of becoming an artist for Marvel Comics even though his [[Los Angeles]] [[gym]]-owner father wants him to become a [[jock (athlete)|jock]]. A blue-skinned alien [[cyborg]] warlord named '''Commander Gormagga Kraal''' tried to use his technology to drain the energy from Earth's sun, but his white-bearded head scientist, '''Sha-han''', refused and fled to Earth with Kraal's '''Circlet of Power''', which he gave to Ben along with a helpful little [[robot]] the boy, for obvious reasons, dubs '''Beepie'''. Thereafter, Ben could expose the Circlet (which is worn on his wrist like a [[bracelet]] and cannot be removed) to sunlight and transform into the golden-haired adult Solarman who posesses superhuman strength, is capable of super-sonic flight and survival in deep space and can control light, heat and other forms of energy, although his weakness is that his powers would fade without constant exposure to sunlight, causing him to revert to his powerless teenage form. 

Basically a cross between ''[[Shazam]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'', Marvel had high hopes for the character, and even created a [[pilot (television)|pilot]] for an [[animated TV series]] based around him.  However the show was never picked up, and despite scripts by [[Stan Lee]] and art by [[Jim Mooney]], [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Nestor Redondo]], his [[comic book]] lasted only two issues.

Creator [[David Oliphant]] had actually published three [[Digest size|digest]]-sized issues of a more educationally-oriented version of Solarman back in [[1979]] under the [[Pendulum Illustrated]] imprint.  This Solarman was an alien '''Solarite''' named '''Davos''' from a land inside the [[Sun]] called '''Coresun''' who came to Earth with his stiff-legged [[android]] servant '''Arman''' and used his superior abilities to become a [[baseball]] player while preaching the virtues of [[solar energy]].  In addition to the tremendous strength granted to him by Earth's lower [[gravity]], his '''Solarcell Medallion''', which also allowed him to recharge his life energy via exposure to sunlight, made him able to fly through the air in a giant fireball and shoot flames from his eyes.

[[Image Comics]] currently features its own character called '''Solar Man''', a [[psychotic]] [[vigilante]] version of [[Superman]] who appears as a villain in [[Erik Larsen]]'s ''[[Savage Dragon]]''.
