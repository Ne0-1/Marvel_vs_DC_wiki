'''War Machine''' is a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  War Machine's abilities come from an advanced suit of armor, designed with technology from Stark Industries.  Tony Stark, the secret identity of [[Iron Man]], was a close associate of James Rhodes, who would often times take up the armor of Iron Man when Stark was incapable of performing.  After the discovery of [[psychology|psychological]] side-effects due to the interaction between Stark's armor and the human [[nervous system]], Jim continued his services with the War Machine armor.
