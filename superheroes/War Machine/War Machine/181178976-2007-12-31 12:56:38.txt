'''War Machine''' ('''Jim Rhodes''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #118 (January 1979), and was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Bob Layton]].

War Machine's abilities came from an advanced suit of armor, designed using technology from Stark Industries, and later from an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]]-built suit. He is well known as the best friend of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], whose [[Iron Man]] armor Rhodes has worn on several occasions.
   
==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
[[Image:Iron170.jpg|170px|left|Jim Rhodes becomes Iron Man. Cover to '''The Invincible Iron Man #170'''. Art by Luke McDonnell.|thumb]]
'''James Rupert Rhodes''' was born in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He first met billionaire industrialist [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] while flying combat missions in [[Vietnam]]. Rhodes' helicopter had been shot down by [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] rocket fire, and while trying to get the aircraft airborne again, he encountered Stark, who had just escaped from the prison camp of the Vietnamese warlord Wong Chu in a bulky prototype suit of [[powered exoskeleton|powered armor]]. At that moment the Viet Cong attacked, and Stark, in his suit, helped to drive them off. Together, Rhodes and Stark made their way to a nearby enemy base where they stole another helicopter, flying it back to the American lines.

After the end of the [[Vietnam War]], Stark, who had secretly become the superhero named [[Iron Man]], offered Rhodes a job as his personal pilot, and Rhodes soon became one of Stark's closest associates and confidants as well as Stark Industries' chief aviation officer. As a result, he had numerous adventures with his employer where his daring and skills were valuable assets.

When Stark lost his company to [[Iron Monger#Obadiah Stane|Obadiah Stane]] and relapsed into [[alcoholism]], Rhodes took over the armor and role of Iron Man in Stark's stead, even fighting alongside Stark's colleagues in the Avengers during the [[Secret Wars]]. However, he began to experience headaches while using the armor, and over time, his behavior began to grow more erratic and aggressive, prone to violent solutions to given problems. Rhodes's manic mental state was later revealed to be the result of his using armors whose cerebral interfaces were calibrated for Stark's brain, leaving any other long-term user disoriented and confused. When Stark was on the road to recovery, he helped Rhodes maintain the armor, but Rhodes became increasingly [[paranoia|paranoid]], believing that Stark meant to retake the armor.

Rhodes went on a rampage, and Stark was forced to don a crude, prototype suit of armor much like his original suit to stop him. Rhodes came to his senses and the two fought together for a time until Rhodes was injured by Stane and Stark took the new armor. In the aftermath of Stane's suicide and Stark rebuilding his company, the two men worked together on many occasions, Rhodes even risking his life and his career to aid Stark during the [[Armor Wars]], when Iron Man discovered that his technology had been stolen by the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] and sold to various armoured villains.

===War Machine career===
[[Image:Warm11.jpg||200px|right|thumb|The War Machine armor. Cover art to ''War Machine'' #11.]]
Stark also subsequently designed a heavier-armed version of the Iron Man suit, the "Variable Threat Response Battle Suit" to battle the Masters of Silence, and it became known as the War Machine armor. Rhodes used the War Machine armor as Iron Man when Stark faked his own death while recovering from a life-threatening illness. When the ruse was revealed, it damaged the friendship between the two men, and they went their separate ways.    
 
Rhodes, however, continued to use the War Machine armor in a solo superhero career, and it eventually was replaced by a symbiotic alien suit, known as the Eidolon Warwear. When Stark died during a battle with [[Kang the Conqueror]] (And the younger alternate Tony Stark brought in to replace him vanished during the fight with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]), Rhodes rejoined Stark Enterprises (which was bought by Fujikawa Industries) to protect his old friend's legacy. To prevent Stark's armor technology from being misused, he used the abilities of his alien armor to erase all trace of Stark's designs from the Fujikawa systems, but the armor was destroyed in the process. Rhodes gave up his superhero career and started his own salvage company.

===Post War Machine===
Later, [[comic book death|perhaps unsurprisingly]], Stark once more returned from the dead, forming a new company, Stark Solutions and taking up the Iron Man identity once more. The two men were reconciled and Rhodes and Stark teamed up again to stop a new villain (also calling himself War Machine) who was wearing what looked like a version of the old War Machine armor, including a heavily-gunned exo-suit, but was in fact not based on Stark technology.

Rhodes later became one of the main characters in the comic series ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]].'' In the series' first issue, his sister, Jeanette, died and he was declared bankrupt; while avenging her murder, he becomes one of the driving forces that brings the team together.

Jim Rhodes later became the [[commanding officer]] and head combat instructor for [[Sentinels (comics)#Sentinel Squad O*N*E|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]], and a key member of the Office of National Emergency (O*N*E). In that role, he wears armor derived from the Sentinel technology, and painted in the same color scheme as the larger Sentinels.

===Return of War Machine===
In ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', Rhodes once again becomes War Machine, with a new suit of armor resembling Tony Stark's, to help train the new recruits of The Initiative program. During a recent issue, he fought alongside new superhero [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]] to depower [[Spider-Man]] (while he was in the middle of a battle with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Hydro-Man]], and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]), only for Spider-Man to escape.  During ''[[World War Hulk]]'', before Stark's confrontation with [[Hulk (comics)|the enraged behemoth]], Rhodes was thrown off by Stark's talk of the Hulk's threat reuniting the splintered hero community. Rhodes seems to feel that, despite his support of Stark, too many questionable and borderline things have happened at Stark's behest for those wounds to be casually undone. Whether this sharp disagreement is simply part of the sometimes-contentious long friendship between the two, or the first seeds of real doubt in Stark's cause by Rhodes, remains to be seen.

==Powers and abilities==
===War Machine Armor===
* Repulsors: Laser-guided particle beam emission units mounted in the palm of each hand.
* Unibeam: Multi-band light and force beam emitter. Can be adjusted for a variety of effects such as search light, heat beams, tractor beam, lasers, image inducers, ultraviolet light, and electromagnetic pulse. While not present in the original model, it was added for Rhodes.
* Pulse Bolt Generators: Plasma discharges that build in intensity as they travel through the atmosphere, picking up static and ambient energy.
* Force Shield: A focused photon emitter on the back of his left wrist that shapes into a shield.
* Gatling Gun: Shoulder-mounted and using an [[electronic firing]] system. This is a state of the art gatling machine gun firing [[caseless ammunition]]. It can be loaded with a wide array of various bullet types including stun and armor-piercing.  Default loadout is 1800 rounds of [[Depleted uranium]] bullets.
* Double-barreled cannon.  Wrist-mounted, fires various ammo types.  Ammo is user-selectable and is fed from belt circling the upper wrist.  
* Flamethrower. Uses napalm gas. Effective at all types of combat.
* Plasma Blade.
* Micro-Rocket Launcher.  Holds a variety of up to eight rockets, including High Explosive, Concussion, Smoke, Flare, and Sub-Nuke.
* Particle Beam Discharger.
* Forcefield-based stealth technology (which Rhodey referred to as the "Romulan Cloaking Device")
* Self-contained breathing system.
* Granted the wearer high levels of superhuman strength
* Granted the wearer high levels of superhuman durability

===Eidolon Warwear===
* Drone Remotes:  The Warwear can "unskin" or "morph" remote drones.  Drones are capable of the following functions:
** Discharge various types of energy and concussive force.
** Act as sensors and as infiltrators of various electronic/computer systems.
** Create defensive energy shields virtually instantaneously.
** Follow basic instructions and carry out minor tasks (in the last issue of War Machine, Rhodey instructs a drone to carry his luggage to his then-girlfriend Rae while he completed one last mission).

* Left Arm Cannon: Fires destructive blasts of energy.
* Because the armor was hidden in a tattoo-like "body stigmata" known as a "mandala" on Jim's chest, which he only had to touch to be instantly clad in the armor, he never had to waste precious moments putting the armor on (which prevented at least one civilian from being crushed by a car in one of the early Eidolon stories).
* Could instantly adapt to the rigors of space by hardening, polarizing the visor, and recycling air.
* The right arm (at least) was able to morph into a blade weapon, which Rhodey once used to decapitate a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[mandroid]] while leaving its pilot unscathed.
* The warwear morphed into a "full battle mode" in the last issue of War Machine, but what notable enhancements or abilities were gained from this mode were not explained. It enabled Rhodes to easily defeat several S.H.I.E.L.D. mandroids in short order.
* The warwear increased the strength of whoever it was bonded to by an undetermined amount; enough to effortlessly catch a full-size sedan thrown by a supervillain.

===U.S. War Machine===
* Gatling Gun:  This shoulder mounted Gatling gun is presumed to be a M134 minigun. 
* Gauntlet Guns: Twin barreled wrist mounted machine guns. The gauntlet guns are presumed to use 9mm Luger/Parabellum rounds.
* Micro-Rocket Launchers: Miniature shoulder mounted rocket launchers.
* Long Barrel Machine Guns: A shoulder mounted long barrel machine gun presumed to use 5.56 mm round.

==Other versions==
===1602===
In ''[[1602: New World|Marvel 1602: New World]]'', there is a character named Rupert Rhodes, hinting at a War Machine in that universe and he is an accomplice of Lord Iron, a version of [[Iron Man]]. The Rhodes in 1602 has yet to get his War Machine armour, although he is the engineer of Lord Iron's suit.

===Marvel Zombies===
In [[Marvel Zombies]]: Dead Days, War Machine is seen amongst the crowd of heroes who have survived the Zombie plague so far. It is unknown if he was transformed into a zombie or if he was eaten by the infected heroes.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] alternate future, Rhodes gained superhuman powers after exposing himself to experimental microscopic robots. While Tony Stark had intended to test them on himself, Rhodes did not feel it would be right for Stark to unnecessarily risk his life. Although now-blessed with exponentially-increasing invulnerability and an impressive array of energy-based attacks, the nanites slowly corrupt Rhodes' mind, eventually destroying his personality and leaving him as little more than a very powerful, humanoid robot. He eventually works as a personal bodyguard for Tony Stark, and although he adopts a super hero uniform (vaguely reminiscent of [[Superman]], though with a different color scheme and no chest insignia) neither he nor Stark bother to come up with a moniker for him. [[Spider-Girl]] refers to him as "Fred" for most of her series, for simple lack of anything else to call him.

===U.S. War Machine===
[[Image:Ultimate War Machine.jpg|thumb|Ultimate War Machine on the cover of ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' #4. Art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]
In the non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]] [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''U.S. War Machine'', Rhodes is fired by Stark after War Machine kills two hostage takers on national TV, one in cold-blood. After his dismissal, Rhodes is attacked by former War Machine pilot Parnell Jacobs in an attempt to recover the War Machine armor. The two are picked up by [[Nick Fury]] and taken to the [[Helicarrier]]. It is revealed that Jacobs had sold his stolen War Machine to [[HYDRA]] for money when he learned his wife was pregnant. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] was able to recover the armor and was in the process of reverse engineering the Stark technology. [[Nick Fury]] planned to field a squad of War Machines commanded by Rhodes.

===Ultimate War Machine===
*Ultimate War Machine made his first appearance in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity in [[Ultimate Iron Man]] #3 where he is a prep school student, and the frequent victim of [[bullying]] from a number of peers at his school for his African American ethnicity. He finds an unlikely friend in a young [[Iron Man#Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]] who is seemingly indestructible and defends him against the bullies, to his dismay.
*Stark allows a teenage James Rhodes (affectionately nicknamed "Rhodey"), a chance to wear some of the armor he and his father have innovated and this is where James Rhodes has his first experience as a super-powered War Machine. Later, he is seen making another armor titled 'War Machine' and is going to trade with Stark's 'Iron Man' armor when both are fully developed. Also, the two form a close bond throughout the remainder of the [[limited series]] representing their youth.
*At the beginning of the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage]] story arc of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Dr. Curt Conners]] receives a letter from Stark Enterprises about his project's funding. The letter is signed by Jim Rhodes, so it can be assumed that Jim Rhodes lives through the ''Ultimate Iron Man'' series.
*Within [[Ultimates|The Ultimates]], Tony gives a black version of his outfit to [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Black Widow|Black Widow]] that is vaguely reminiscent of the traditional War Machine outfit.
*In Ultimate Ironman II, Tony and James team up as "Robots" to take out a terrorist group for the government.

==Other media==
===Television===
[[Image:The Hands Of The Mandarin, Part One - Iron Man & War Machine.jpg|right|thumb|[[Iron Man]] and War Machine in a [[1995 in television|1995]] episode of the [[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man animated series]].]]
* War Machine has appeared in the [[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]] animated series played by [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]] in Season 1 (as well as on ''Spider-Man''), [[Jim Cummings]] in a few episode, and [[Dorian Harewood]] in Season 2 (The color scheme of the War Machine armor, as well as the colors of other Force Works members' uniforms changes without explanation between Seasons 1 and 2 of ''Iron Man'').

* War Machine made a cameo in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]''.

* James Avery reprises his role of War Machine in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episodes "Venom Returns" and "Carnage."

* Dorian Harewood reprises his role of War Machine in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' episode "Helping Hand, Iron Fist."

===Video games===
*War Machine is a playable character in [[Capcom]]'s [[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|''Marvel vs. Capcom'' series]]. In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'', he was originally a [[palette swap]] of Iron Man as depicted in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' with an additional Super. There is also a hidden character known as "''Mega-Armor''" War Machine; this version wears golden armor and couldn't block, but was never stunned by any hits, and switched the beam and missile weapons of Iron Man and War Machine around (for example, when kneeling, Iron Man could fire a missile from a shoulder-mounted gun, while the Mega-armored War Machine fired a short beam). In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]'', he had the switched weapons of his Mega-Armored form to further differentiate him from Iron Man. The two were also voiced by different [[Seiyū|voice actors]]; Iron Man's voice is calm and collected, while War Machine's voice is more gung-ho.
*War Machine is an alternate costume for Iron Man in the games ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' and ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. In the former, it is his "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" costume, which, when worn alongside three other party members who are in their AoA appearances, will grant a special bonus to all the characters. In the latter, if it is worn along with three other member's "Alternate Identity" costumes, it grants a special bonus to all characters.

===Films===
*In the animated Marvel film ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]'', Tony Stark's Iron Man armor is damaged, so he replaces it with the War Machine armor. Jarvis disapproves of the choice, as the War Machine armor is slow and cumbersome by Iron Man standards, but its durability and heavy firepower prove useful. Jarvis tells him 'It handles like a 10 ton tractor', but Stark responds by saying 'Yeah, but its got some sweet guns'.
*However, Rhodes does appear in the 2007 animated movie ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]'', which is a prequel to ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]''. Rhodes is voiced by Rodney Saulsberry.
*Academy Award nominated actor [[Terrence Howard]] portrays James Rhodes in the upcoming [[Iron Man (film)|2008 Iron Man film]]<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=87090 Newsarama]</ref>. In the film, Rhodes is a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[lieutenant colonel]] who serves as the military's chief liaison to Stark Industries. He is also Tony Stark's most trusted ally and best friend. <ref>http://www.ironmanmovie.com/</ref>Director Jon Favreau told AintItCoolNews that War Machine would not appear in the first film, but would in the sequels. Howard was supposedly cast with this in mind.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}
