'''Bizarro''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[publications]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first  appeared in ''[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]'' #68 (1958), and was created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[George Papp]].

[[Debut]]ing in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character has appeared in both [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s; and other DC Comics-related products such as [[animated]] and [[live-action]] [[television series]]; [[trading card]]s; [[toy]]s and [[video games]].

==Publication history==
===Origin===
Bizarro [[debut]]ed in ''[[Superboy]]'' #68 (Oct. 1958), writer [[Otto Binder]] casting the character as a [[Frankenstein]] [[pastiche]] that possessed all the powers of Superboy. Shunned for his grotesque appearance, the teen version of Bizarro only appeared in a single comic book story. An adult version, however, followed soon after: debuting in the [[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]] daily [[newspaper comic strip]], featuring in Episode 105: "The Battle With Bizarro" (Strips 6147-6242 :Aug. 25, 1958 to Dec. 13, 1958). This storyline also introduced the strange speech patterns that became synonmous with the character, with all of Bizarro's comments meaning the opposite (eg. "bad" means "good"). The newspaper version also wore a "B" on his chest, as opposed to the distinctive "S".<ref>http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/</ref>

Writer of the strip [[Alvin Schwartz]] stated: 

{{cquote|I was striving, you might say, for that mirror-image, that opposite. And out of a machine which would reveal the negative Superman, came the mirror image, - always remembering that in a mirror everything is reversed...The times were such that one-dimensional characters, your standard superheroes, even in comics, seemed rather simplistic, like paper cut-outs. What was demanded was the full dimensional personality - a figure that carried a shadow, if you like. I was certainly inspired to some degree also by C.G. Jung's archetype of "the shadow" - and Bizarro certainly reflected that, as well. <ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

Binder revised the character, this time wearing an "S" in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #254 (July 1959). Bizarro proved popular, and starred in the back-up feature in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' for fifteen issues, running from issue #285 - 300 (June 1961 - Sep. 1962). The character made forty appearances<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/whoswho.php</ref> in the Superman family of titles - ''[[Action Comics]]''; ''[[Superman]]''; ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]''; ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]''; ''[[Adventure Comics]]''; ''[[Secret Society of Super-Villains]]'' and ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' - from 1959 to 1984 prior to a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the DC Universe as a result of the limited series [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] #1 - 12 (April 1985 - March 1986).

Bizarro was reintroduced into the DC Universe in ''[[The Man of Steel]]'' #5 (Dec. 1986). An unrelated four issue [[limited series]] titled ''[[A. Bizarro]]'' (July - Oct.) was published in 1999. Yet another version was introduced during the "[[Emperor Joker]]" storyline in ''Action Comics'' #769 – 770 (Sep. - Oct. 2000); ''[[Adventures of Superman]]'' #582 – 583 (Sep. - Oct. 2000); ''Superman'' #160 – 161 (Sep. - Oct. 2000); ''[[Superman: Man of Steel]]'' #104 – 105 (Sep. - Oct. 2000) and ''Superman: Emperor Joker'' #1 (Oct. 2000).

==Biography==
===Pre-Crisis Bizarro===
When a scientist is demonstrating his newly invented "duplicating ray" to [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]], an accident causes the ray to duplicate the teen hero. The copy, quickly labelled "Bizarro", is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior. Shunned by the people of [[Smallville]], Bizarro befriends a blind girl. Superboy is eventually forced to "kill" the [[doppelganger]], using the remains of the duplicating machine, which acts like [[blue kryptonite]] (as opposed to [[green kryptonite]], Superboy's weakness) on the copy.<ref>''Superboy'' #68 (Oct. 1958)</ref>

Years after this adventure when Superboy has become Superman, his arch-foe [[Lex Luthor]] recreates the "duplicating ray" and uses it on the hero, hoping to control the duplicate.  The Bizarro that is created, however, is confused, stating :"Me not human...me not creature...me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don't belong in world of living people! Me don't know difference between right and wrong-good and evil!"<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> Luthor is forgotten as Bizarro attempts to emulate Superman, creating havoc in the city of [[Metropolis]] and almost exposing Superman's secret identity as [[Clark Kent]]. When Bizarro falls in love with reporter [[Lois Lane]], she uses the duplicating ray on herself to create a "Bizarro Lois", who instantly attracted to Bizarro. The Bizarros leave Earth together, determined to find a home where they can be themselves.<ref>''Action Comics'' #254 - 255 (July - Aug. 1959)</ref>

Superman encounters the couple once again, discovering that Bizarro - now called Bizarro #1 -  has used a version of the duplication ray to create an entire world of Bizarros, who now reside on a square-shaped planet called "Htrae" (Earth spelled backwards).<ref>''Action Comics'' #263 - 264 (April - May 1960)</ref> Bizarro #1 and Bizarro-Lois #1 also give birth to a child who while super-powered, appears to be totally human. Considered a freak by Bizarro standards, the child is the catalyst for a brief war between Htrae and Earth.<ref>''Superman'' #140 (Oct. 1960)</ref> Bizarro also has a series of adventures on Htrae, aiding a normal [[Jimmy Olsen]] when accidentally trapped on the Bizarro world;<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #287 (June 1961);</ref> preventing an invasion of blue kryptonite statues<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #290 (Nov. 1961)</ref> and stopping the Bizarro version of [[Titano]].<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #295 (April 1962)</ref>

The character returned to Earth time and again, and a new teen version even travels to the 30th century, attempting to join the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. When rejected by the Legion, the Bizarro teen creates his own Bizarro version of the Legion, which Superboy eventually persuades him to disband.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #329 (Feb. 1965)</ref>

===Post-Crisis Bizarro===
In ''Man of Steel'' #5, Lex Luthor creates a clone to combat the Man of Steel.<ref>''Man of Steel'' #5 (1986)</ref> The clone is proven to be imperfect,  the imperfections in the duplicates  eventually fatal. The mute creature makes several attempts to "be" Superman, including wearing a jacket and glasses over his still visible costume. The flawed duplicate is destroyed when he and Superman fly into each other.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Bizarro | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 48  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>  The powdered remains of Bizarro restore sight to Lois Lane's blind sister.

Luthor later recreates Bizarro to offer insight into how to stop the "Clone Plague". The new Bizarro escapes, and kidnaps Lois Lane, taking her to "Bizarro World"; a warehouse set up like a surreal version of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He subjects her to danger, but she manages to escape. Bizarro is recaptured by Lexcorp, where he subsequently dies.

A later version of Bizarro is created by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] by the use of the powers of [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]<ref>''Superman'' vol. 2, #160</ref>. The Joker creates a twisted version of Earth,  a perfect cube with Joker's image on each facet. Created to be the greatest hero of Jokerworld and leader of that world's JLA (Joker's League of Anarchy), the backwards talking Bizarro is one of a number of characters Mxyzptlk saves from that world after Joker loses the  stolen powers. The creature is subsequently captured by the [[Pokolistan]]ian dictator [[General Zod#Russian Zod|General Zod]], and tortured, apparently just for the pleasure of beating someone who resembles Superman. 

After escaping from Pokolistan with Superman's help, Bizarro recreates his Jokerworld headquarters, the Graveyard of Solitude, and at erratic intervals emerges to "help" or hinder Superman; the decision as to which being seemingly random, and the same amount of trouble caused either way.

Bizarro is invited to join the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]]. Bizarro challenges [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]] to a race, due to Bizarro's complicated speech patterns, neither Zoom nor [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] are sure which end result of the race would convince Bizarro to join.  The two race across the planet, Bizarro's erratic zig-zag path a point of contention with Zoom.  When Zoom insults and threatens Bizarro, he is convinced that Zoom is his friend and joins. While with the Society, Bizarro kills the [[Human Bomb]], commenting that he likes the flashes of light that the Bomb's powers produce.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

[[One Year Later|One year later]], Bizarro is a captive of [[Lex Luthor]] and has been watching television in a small room for thirteen months. As a result, he is better informed than before. 

Afterwards Bizarro left Earth to create a home for himself. After creating a [[Bizarro World|cube shaped planet]], filled with abstract versions of various buildings and locations on Earth, Bizarro found himself still lonely. Bizarro finds that, under the power of a blue sun, he gained a new ability called "Bizarro Vision". He uses his new ability to populate the planet with Bizarros, starting with a Bizarro Lois, that feared and hated him. Attempting to find answers Bizarro abducts [[Pa Kent]] and Superman follows in pursuit. With Superman's help, he becomes the new Bizarro World's greatest hero.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''Superman'' #682, Bizarro goes to the grave of [[Jonathan Kent]]. When Clark and [[Martha Kent|Martha]] arrive, he says "Me am happy." before flying off. Later, he is rounded up and placed in the [[Phantom Zone]] by members of [[Kandor]]. Superman frees all supervillains to be taken to Belle Reve, but Bizarro disappears from the Phantom Zone, somehow escaping.<ref>''Superman'' #684 (January 2009)</ref> Bizarro mysteriously wound up on Throneworld; Home of [[Starman (comic)#Prince Gavyn|Prince Gavyn]]. In fifteen minutes a lost, angry Bizarro defeated half of Throneworld's Imperial Guard before Gavyn stopped Bizarro by befriending him. Gavyn kept Bizarro sedated with food and cartoons until [[Adam Strange]], having learned from [[Weird (comics)|the Weird]] of Bizarro's presence on Throneworld, teleported the two to Hardcore Station to aid his overpowered allies. Bizarro became embroiled in the war between [[Rann]], [[Thanagar]], [[Lady Styx]], and Synnar. 

Bizarro, along with Adam Strange and [[Captain Comet|Comet]] currently star in [[Strange Adventures]] written by [[Jim Starlin]].

Bizarro is confronted with the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] version of his late friend [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]].<ref>''Superman/Batman #66</ref> When Grundy is assaulting Bizarro, his black ring initially reads his emotions as inversions of the [[Emotional spectrum]] ("rage" shows as pink rather then red). It then starts losing the ability to read Bizarro's emotions completely as his aura changes to a brilliant white. Bizarro eventually destroys his former friend by flying him into the sun, completely incinerating the Black Lantern Grundy and his ring.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #67</ref>
