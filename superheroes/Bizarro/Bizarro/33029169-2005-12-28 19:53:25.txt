'''Bizarro''' is a [[fictional character]] who is a failed clone of [[Superman]].  The original Bizarro was created by an unsuccessful attempt to duplicate [[Superboy]], in a story written by [[Otto Binder]].

==Pre-Crisis Bizarro==
The later Bizarro was created by [[Lex Luthor]], who used the "duplicating ray" on the adult Superman and hoped to use the duplicate to attack Superman.  However, this Bizarro did not cooperate and instead tried to emulate Superman.  Unfortunately, his attempts to match the original's heroics were clumsy and destructive, and he kidnapped Lois.  This was resolved when Lois created a Bizarro-Lois for Bizarro using the "duplication ray".  Feeling rejected by the people of Earth, they moved to the world of Htrae, which had ancient advanced technology which was used to populate the planet with other Bizarros created in the same manner.  Almost everyone on Htrae looked like an ugly Superman (and possessed super powers) or an ugly [[Lois Lane]].  When Superman visited, he was arrested for being normal, but he plea-bargained a proposal to change the shape of the world into a cube for his release.

His only weakness was blue [[Kryptonite]], created by using the same machine to duplicate green Kryptonite.  Though Bizarro acts in what he believes to be the best manner, his Bizarro logic often causes him to act for evil.

===Appearance===
Bizarro has chalky and sometimes rock-like skin, a pale complexion, and a misshapen face.  In addition, his version of Superman's famous S-shield is usually backwards. Bizarro wears a button that said "Bizarro #1", in order to distinguish himself from the other failed Superman clones on Htrae.

===The Bizarro World===
In the Bizarro world, a cube-shaped planet known as "Htrae" (Earth spelled backward), society is ruled by the Bizarro Code, which states that it is a crime to do anything well or to make anything perfect or beautiful.  Predictably camp lines abound.  In one episode, for example, a salesman is doing a brisk trade selling "Bizarro bonds.  Guaranteed to lose money for you".  Later in this episode, the mayor appoints Bizarro #1 to investigate a crime, "Because you are stupider than the entire Bizarro police force put together".  This is intended and taken as a great compliment.

Later stories introduced Bizarro versions of Superman's supporting cast, including Bizarro-[[Perry White]] and Bizarro-[[Jimmy Olsen]], created by using the duplicator ray on characters other than Superman and Lois Lane, as well as the children of Bizarro and Bizarro Lois.  There was even a Bizarro-[[Justice League]] and [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

"Tales of the Bizarro World" became a recurring segment in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' from 1961 to 1962.

On one occasion, [[Keith Giffen]] portrayed Htrae itself as being ''sentient'' - "Me am the Bizarro World. Planet Earth not think... therefore, me do" - and its only sane inhabitant was the Bizarro [[Ambush Bug]].

===Linguistics===
Bizarro and the other inhabitants of the Bizarro world used an odd but predictable form of English.  The most notable characteristics were:
* The lack of [[nominative case]] when using pronouns; Bizarro replaces pronouns that should be nominative with their analogues in the [[accusative case]].  Bizarro might introduce himself by saying "Me am Bizarro" instead of "I am Bizarro," for example.
* The lack of proper verb [[conjugation]]; Bizarro only uses the [[first person]] conjugation for any verb.  For example, the verb [[to be]] is always conjugated as "am", leading to sentences like "This am great".

===Criticism===
The Bizarro World stories were certainly not to everyone's taste.  Some see them as simply silly and irritating.  Others see the concept as foreshadowing the enormously successful [[surrealism|surrealistic]] school of [[farce]] that includes [[Monty Python]].  Just the fact that male Bizarro babies possess super powers, while little girls do not, dates the concept severely (though this is ostensibly because male Bizarros are copies of Superman, who is a Kryptonian and thus has super powers, and female ones are copies of Lois Lane, a normal human).  There are also hints of making fun of the handicapped.

===Death===
In ''Superman'' #423 & ''Action Comics'' #583,  [[Alan Moore]] wrote [[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|the final Superman]] story for the Pre-Crisis era (though subsequent writers have retconned it into being an alternate reality). In the beginning of ''Superman'' #423, Superman had his final encounter with Bizarro, who had gone on a killing spree.

Superman had been off the Earth, doing research for the government. When he returned he found complete city blocks horribly destroyed, and was told Bizarro had gone berserk, smashing buildings and injuring innocent people.

Confronted by Superman, Bizarro told him, "This am part of genius Bizarro self-improvement plan."  Bizarro tells Superman that he had destroyed Bizarro world, as Krypton had been destroyed. 
<blockquote>
"Bizarro... what's happened to you? I can't believe you've really destroyed your homeworld!"<br>
"Ha! That am only the beginning! Next, me realize that Superman never kill, so me kill lots of people! Them very grateful! Scream with happiness!"<br>
"Killed people? Oh, merciful Rao..."<br>
"...But then me finally understand what me need to be perfect imperfect duplicate: it am little Blue Kryptonite meteor that me carry in lead case for good luck!" *Bizarro holds the Blue Kryptonite before him.* "See... you am alive Superman... and if me am perfect imperfect duplicate, then me have to be... h-have to be..." *Bizarro staggers and collapses to the floor*<br>
"Bizarro!"<br>
"Uh... everything, him go d-dark... Hello, Superman. Hello." *Bizarro dies.*</blockquote>

Not much later, Superman's secret identity was exposed and all his rogue's gallery attempt to kill him and everyone associated with him. Superman later discovers that [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] is the villain orchestrating the attacks, and was most likely also the one responsible for Bizarro's strange behavior.

===Post-Crisis appearances of Pre-Crisis Bizarro===
Though Bizarro was destroyed in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], even before his character was reintroduced in a reimagined form, the original Bizarro made a few appearances.
* In [[Animal Man]]'s ''Deus Ex Machina'' storyline, a villain in [[Arkham]] asylum recreates characters removed from continuity, exposing the [[fourth wall]] to the protagonist.  Bizarro appears as he did pre-crisis.

==Post-Crisis Bizarro==
Bizarro World was erased from the history of the [[DC Universe]] during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].  Since then, two Bizarros have been created by [[Lex Luthor]].  However, in the post-Crisis version, the imperfections in the duplicates are eventually fatal.  The first Bizarro created Post-Crisis appeared in ''Man of Steel'' #5 (1986).  A Bizarro-[[Superboy]] was created by [[Project Cadmus]], when they used the same process in their attempts to [[Cloning|clone]] Superman.  It was also used to create a Bizarro-[[Harley Quinn]] after Bizarro developed a crush on Quinn.  The current version of Bizarro has a very different origin, having been created by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] by the use of the powers of [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]; his first appearance was in ''Superman'' Vol. 2 #160, and he seems to be the longest lived Post-Crisis Bizarro yet.

===Appearance===
Unlike the original Bizarro, the Post-Crisis Bizarro is not chalky and angular.  Instead, he has a greyish skin-tone, yellow eyes, an overly muscular body, and a maniacal smile.  Bizarro has a purple and green uniform, and the logo on his chest is inverted, so the "S" is backwards.

===Abilities===
While in the past Bizarro's abilities have been the same as Superman's, it is now common for Bizarro's heat-vision and freezing-breath to be "reversed": flaming-breath and freezing-vision.  Apparently, he also possess "x-ray hearing" and "spotlight vision."  He has also been discovered to be physically more powerful than Superman, but the nature of his fractured mind leaves him unable to access that potential.

Post-Crisis Bizarro has only encountered Blue Kryptonite on one occasion, when Batzarro presented him with a ring set with a stone of it.  The ring caused Bizarro to speak normally and act rationally, but he was still afraid of the ring.  The ring appeared to have no effect on Batzarro since he's a batman clone.

===Linguistics===
Post-Crisis Bizarro adopted all of the linguistic idiosyncracies of his pre-crisis self, but also negates every possible word in the sentence.  Though the usage is slightly inconsistent, this usually includes:
* Negating verbs.
* Replacing [[adjective]]s with their opposite.
* Replacing certain [[noun]]s with their opposite.
The ultimate end of this causes sentences to frequently have [[double negative|double]] and triple negatives.  Combined with the fact that Bizarro's logic is already flawed, this causes some of his dialogue to be very difficult to follow.

===Bizarro Batman===
A Bizarro Batman debuted in World's Finest Comics #156.

Recently, Jeph Loeb has introduced a Bizarro-[[Batman]], "Batzarro", into the comic book universe in ''[[Superman/Batman]]''.  His origin is unknown, but his speech patterns are almost identical to those of Bizarro.  Just as Bizarro has an inverted "S" on his chest, Batzarro has Batman's logo on his chest, but it is upside-down.

According to Bizarro "Him no come from same place as Bizarro #1. That am why we am so different." This ''may'' indicate that Batzarro was also created as part of Joker's World or perhaps Batzarro is from an alternative timeline, some of which appear later in the same story line that Batzarro was introduced.

===Other Bizarro characters===
While the Superman-like Bizarro is the predominant one, anyone with milky-white or crystalline skin (depending on the artists' design) and who speaks with Bizarro's odd linguistic pattern can be considered to be ''a'' Bizarro in the [[DC Universe]].  In [[DC One Million]], for example, there are references to a future Bizarro epidemic where the condition spreads like zombism.  In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', the [[Justice League]] encounters Bizarro duplicates used as henchmen.

Many Bizarro duplicates would break-down and disintegrate after enduring a relative amount of stress.  This was attributed to the imperfect nature of the duplication process, originally unable to deal with Superman's extra-terrestrial nature.

Similar processes to Luthor's were used by [[Two-Face]] to create a Bizarro-[[Supergirl]] and [[Brainiac 5|Brainiac 5.1]] to create a post-Crisis Bizarro-Legion.  There was also a miniseries, ''A. Bizarro'', about a Bizarro who was the duplicate of an ordinary man who happened to look like Superman.  Most recently, DC produced an [[anthology]], ''Bizarro Comics'', featuring offbeat and irreverent stories by alternative comics writers and artists featuring various [[DC Universe]] characters.  The anthology's chief conceit was that all of its contents (aside from the [[framing sequence]]) were created by Bizarro himself.  A second, conceptually similar,  anthology entitled ''Bizarro World'' has been released.

==Other appearances of Bizarro==

[[Image:Superman-bizarroworld1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bizarro from ''Superman-the Animated Series''.]]

Bizarro has also appeared in the ''Superboy'' TV series and the ''[[Superfriends]]''.  In the later series, Bizarro was depicted almost as an outright villain, and part of the Legion of Doom; although the last season had a more faithful depiction. During that last apparition he made a Batzarro and Bizarro clones of [[Wonder Woman]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].  

In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Bizarro's incarnation is a combination of Pre-Crisis material, Post-Crisis material, and new stuff. As seen in his first episode "Identity Crisis", Bizarro is a creation of Luthor's, although he was never intended to be what he became. Rather, Luthor wanted to make an exact Superman clone, one whose only difference was that he followed Lex's orders. He took samples of Superman's DNA (gathered from blood left from his Kryptonite-induced weakness during "A Little Piece of Home") and grew Superman clones, the first of which to be released looked and acted exactly like Superman, down to the do-gooding. The duplication breaks down, though, and Bizarro's form and costume changes (as angular as Pre-Crisis, but colored like Post-Crisis).  This version has washed-out colors on his costume with a deformed (but still forward) S-shield, pale skin, and his posture suggests that his limbs are twisted.

Unlike either of his comic incarnations, Bizarro's logic does not follow a purposefully opposite pattern; his "Bizarro logic" is resultant of his atrophied Superman mindset. Instead of doing bad because Superman does good, Bizarro is distinctly trying to do good but can't understand what he sees. For example, he sees a bridge folding up to let in a boat and thinks the bridge is breaking, causing him to push it together again and seal it with heat vision, failing to recognize what the boat was doing there. Bizarro, as far as he knew, ''was'' Superman, so the appearance of the real Superman confused him something fierce, and he tried to maintain the idea within his own mind that he indeed was Superman and that Superman was an imposter. This dissipated when he saw Superman saving Lois Lane; since he associated saving Lois with being Superman, he realized the truth.

"Bizarro's World", his next episode, highlighted the next step in Bizarro's confusion. Now aware that he is not Superman, he wanders for months before accidentally stumbling on the [[Fortress of Solitude]], where the Fortress' computer mistakes him for Superman and tells him that he is Kal-El, explaining his Kryptonian heritage. Now with a new mistaken identity, Bizarro sets out to recreate Krypton in Metropolis, and then his faulty logic presumes that he needs to toss a missile at "Krypton" to destroy it again. Superman stops him, and gives him an alien moon which he can call home. Bizarro remains pleased with this until "Little Big Head Man", where [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] convinces Bizarro to attack Superman because he and his friends were supposedly making fun of him. This is a lie, of course, and at the end, Mxyzptlk is stuck on Bizarro's moon serving him. There seems to have been a change in Bizarro's mind by the time ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' rolls around, though, because in "Ultimatum" he returns, now in confused love with [[Giganta]] (even though she's just using him to break [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]] out of jail). He has also joined the [[Legion of Doom]] in the most recent season. It is unknown how he has reconciled his need to be a hero with hanging out with all these villains, though it is possible that Grodd easily tricked him into joining the Legion.

In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' Bizarro was an imperfect clone of Superman created by Lex Luthor.  His costume resembled that of the "normal" Superman, but his monogram was a shield with "US" printed on it.  He had red hair and odd-looking skin with blisters and distended veins.  He sacrificed himself to save [[London]] from a nuclear missile.

=="Bizarro" references==
'Bizarro ___' eventually became a popular term for a version of a character who, while not always evil, is unsettling or creepy to those who know the original version.  
* The [[cartoon]] [[Sealab 2021]] (which airs on [[Cartoon_Network]]) has satirized the Bizarro concept (episode #17). 
* Episode 105 of the animated series [[South Park]], called "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]," features a clone of [[Stan Marsh]] that is mutated in appearance, and wreaks havoc on the town.
* The cartoon [[reality tv]] show parody, [[Drawn Together]] featured at one point a Bizarro Captain Hero. 
* [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]'' comic used the Bizarro concept (although using a different name) as an important plot element; it was a comic book read by the characters in the [[story arc]] ''[[The Sandman: A Game of You|A Game of You]]''.
* The comic strip ''[[This Modern World]]'' occasionally transforms into "This Bizarro World" in which all the characters are crude duplicates of our world and speak in a Bizarro-like manner. 
* The [[television]] series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', with its many Superman references and in-jokes, devoted an episode to the Bizarro concept, "[[The Bizarro Jerry]]", with Elaine dating a mirror opposite of Jerry who had his own Bizarro versions of friends George, Kramer, and Newman.  (Since the "Bizarro" group were actually nicer, smarter, and more responsible than the "normal" group, it is arguable that the Elaine's original friends are actually the Bizarros.)
* Sometimes, when the ''[[WWE RAW]]'' show comes from Canada, [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] refers to the country as "bizarro world", where the locals root for heels like [[Jason Reso|Christian]] because they hail from Canada.  
* There is a fledgling literary movement calling itself Bizarro, featuring a collection of authors (including [[Carlton Mellick III]], [[Chris Genoa]], Jeremy Robert Johnson, and [[Steve Aylett]]) and [[small press]]es (Eraserhead Press, Raw Dog Screaming Press, and Afterbirth Books) who specialize in weird, offbeat [[fiction]].
* The Video game [[Final Fantasy VII]] included a boss character named "Bizarro Sephiroth".
* In the toy and cartoon series of the 80's [[He-Man]], there was a character named [[Faker]], who was created by the villian [[Skeletor]] to take on He-Man.  He looked just like He-Man, but had blue skin.

* In Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode "Dopplegängland", Cordelia refers to that reality as Bizarro world.
