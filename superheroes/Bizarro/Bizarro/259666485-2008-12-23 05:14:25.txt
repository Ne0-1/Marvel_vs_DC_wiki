'''Bizarro''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]] ([[superhero]] in [[Bizarro World]]) that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]'' #68 ([[1958#October|October 1958]]), and was created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[George Papp]].

Bizarro and the [[Bizarro World]] have become somewhat well known in popular culture, and the term Bizarro is used as to describe anything that uses twisted logic or that is the opposite of something else.<ref>[http://www.neca.org/source/NECA_2840.asp Bizarro reference] Reference to Bizzaro logic in FCC pleading.</ref>

==Publication history==
The original Bizarro first appears in ''Superboy'' #68 (Oct. 1958) when Superboy is exposed to a "duplicator ray." This version makes multiple appearances in ''[[Action Comics]]''; ''[[Superman]]''; ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]''; ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]''; ''[[Adventure Comics]]''; ''[[Secret Society of Super-Villains]]'' and ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' from 1959 to 1984 prior to a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] as a result of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] storyline. In 1986, Bizarro was reintroduced in issue #5 of the limited series, ''[[The Man of Steel]]''. Another version appears in the 2006 "Emperor Joker" storyline that ran through ''Superman'' #160-161, ''Adventures of Superman'' #582-583, ''Superman: Man of Steel'' #104-105, ''Action Comics'' #769-770 and ''Superman: Emperor Joker'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis Bizarro===
The original Teen Bizarro is created during a laboratory accident.  A scientist  demonstrating his newly invented "duplicating ray" to [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]], tests the device on a [[radium]] pellet and a jewel.  However, the duplicated radium was non-radioactive and the jewel melted.  The scientist then stumbles and knocks the machine, inadvertently creating an imperfect Superboy.  Although the scientist insists the duplicate is not alive, the creature nonetheless escapes from the lab. Bizarro wants to be accepted, but his appearance and his childlike erratic behavior scares people, especially since he has little control over his super-strength. He is befriended by a blind girl, shortly before Superboy realizes the glowing-blue remains of the machine would act as kryptonite to the [[doppelganger]].  During the confrontation, Bizarro flies straight towards Superboy, having realized that the shockwave from his destruction would cure the girl's blindness. Strangely, Teen-Bizarro later appears in a Legion of Super-Heroes story set in the Legion's future time. 

The later Adult Bizarro is created by [[Lex Luthor]], who re-created the "duplicating ray" and uses it on Superman hoping to use the duplicate in an attack on Superman.  Bizarro does not cooperate and instead tries to emulate Superman.  Unfortunately, his attempts to match his original's heroics are clumsy and destructive. Bizarro uses the Imperfect Duplication Ray on himself and creates a New Bizarro who has Superman's looks and Bizarro's mentality. New Bizarro asks for Lois Lane's hand in marriage and prevents Superman from filling Lois in on the plot that fails anyway. In a later story, Jimmy Olsen becomes a Normal-looking Bizarro with a Bizarro mentality and exposure to Blue Kryptonite resets his mentality to Jimmy normal.

Bizarro then kidnaps Lois for companionship.  This dilemma is resolved when Lois uses the "Imperfect duplication ray" to create a Bizarro-Lois Lane to be a more appropriate companion for Bizarro. Feeling rejected by the people of Earth, the Bizarro couple move to [[Bizarro World|Htrae]], which had ancient advanced technology which they used to populate the planet with other Bizarros created in the same manner.

===Post-Crisis Bizarro===
====LexCorp Bizarros====
In Man of Steel #5, Lex Luthor creates a clone to combat the Man of Steel.<ref>''Man of Steel'' #5 (1986)</ref> The clone is proven to be imperfect,  the imperfections in the duplicates  eventually fatal. The mute creature makes several attempts to "be" Superman, including wearing a jacket and glasses over his still visible costume. The flawed duplicate is destroyed when he and Superman fly into each other.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Bizarro | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 48  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>  The powdered remains of Bizarro restore sight to Lois Lane's blind sister.

Luthor later recreates Bizarro to offer insight into how to stop the "Clone Plague". The new Bizarro escapes, and kidnaps Lois Lane, taking her to "Bizarro World"; a warehouse set up like a surreal version of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He subjects her to danger, so she manages to escape, and Bizarro is recaptured by Lexcorp, where he subsequently dies.

====Emperor Joker====
[[Image:ActionComicsCvr785.jpg|thumb|185px|The Modern Age Bizarro. Art by [[Ed McGuinness]].]]
A later version of Bizarro is created by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] by the use of the powers of [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]<ref>''Superman'' vol. 2, #160</ref>. The Joker creates a twisted version of Earth,  a perfect cube with Joker's image on each facet. Created to be the greatest hero of Jokerworld and leader of that world's JLA (Joker's League of Anarchy), the backwards talking Bizarro is one of a number of characters Mxyzptlk saves from that world after Joker loses the  stolen powers. The creature is subsequently captured by the Pokolistanian dictator [[General Zod#Russian Zod|General Zod]], and tortured, apparently just for the pleasure of beating someone who resembles Superman. 

After escaping from Pokolistan with Superman's help, Bizarro recreates his Jokerworld headquarters, the Graveyard of Solitude, and at erratic intervals emerges to "help" or hinder Superman; the decision as to which being seemingly random, and the same amount of trouble caused either way.

Bizarro is invited to join the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]]. Bizarro challenges [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]] to a race, due to Bizarro's complicated speech patterns, neither Zoom nor [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] are sure which end result of the race would convince Bizarro to join.  The two race across the planet, Bizarro's erratic zig-zag path a point of contention with Zoom.  When Zoom insults and threatens Bizarro, he is convinced that Zoom is his friend and joins. While with the Society, Bizarro kills the [[Human Bomb]], commenting that he likes the flashes of light that the Bomb's powers produce.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

====One Year Later====
[[One Year Later|One year later]], Bizarro is a captive of [[Lex Luthor]] and has been watching television in a small room for thirteen months. As a result, he is better informed than before. 

Afterwards Bizarro left Earth to create a home for himself. After creating a [[Bizarro World|cube shaped planet]], filled with abstract versions of various buildings and locations on Earth, Bizarro found himself still lonely. Bizarro finds that, under the power of a blue sun, he gained a new ability called "Bizarro Vision". He uses his new ability to populate the planet with Bizarros, starting with a Bizarro Lois, that feared and hated him. Attempting to find answers Bizarro abducts [[Pa Kent]] and Superman follows in pursuit. With Superman's help, he becomes the new Bizarro World's greatest hero.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===New Krypton===
In Superman #682, Bizarro went to the grave of Jonathan Kent. When Clark and Martha showed up, he said "Me am happy" before flying off. Later, he is rounded up and placed in the Phantom Zone by members of Kandor.

==Powers and abilities==
{{main|Powers and abilities of Superman}}
Bizarro has similar powers to Superman, which include superhuman strength, speed, durability and flight. The Pre-Crisis Bizarro's abilities were the same as Superman's until he was hit by a meteorite which reversed his powers: such as freeze vision (as opposed to heat vision); flame breath (as opposed to frost breath); X-ray vision that can only see through lead; microscopic vision that decreases the size of objects; "x-ray hearing" and "spotlight vision". <ref>''Superman/Batman'' #19</ref> Under the light of a blue sun, Bizarro also gains amplified powers and "Bizarro vision", which creates a Bizarro duplicate of the target. <ref>''Action Comics'' #855</ref>

Bizarro is weakened by blue [[kryptonite]], which affects him in the same manner as green kryptonite affects Superman. Yellow sunlight has also been shown to weaken Bizarro.

==Alternate versions of Bizarro==
[[Image:BIZARRO!.jpg|185px|thumb|Bizarro mimics Superman on the cover of ''Tales of the Bizarro World''. Art by [[John Forte]].]]

*'''Pre-Crisis Bizarro''' - In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Animal Man]]'' storyline "Deus Ex Machina", [[Psycho-Pirate]], while in [[Arkham Asylum]], recreated characters removed from continuity. This version of Bizarro was one of them. Bizarro appears as he originally did. Presumably, this character vanished from existence when the Psycho-Pirate's episode of madness ended, along with his colleagues.

*'''[[Batzarro]]''' - A Bizarro version of Batman debuted in ''World's Finest Comics'' #156.  [[Jeph Loeb]] introduced a Bizarro-[[Batman]], [[Batzarro]], into the DC universe in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #20 (June 2005). 

* '''Bizarro Justice League''' - featured in [[Action Comics]] ''Escape from Bizarro World'' storyline, Bizarro members included: Bizarro Batman, wearing a smiley-face on his chest, and possessing a bat-treehouse; Bizarro [[Hawkgirl]], who screeches like an actual hawk; Bizarro [[Wonder Woman]], who ties herself up with her lasso to make others lie; [[Yellow Lantern]], a reluctant member of the [[Sinestro Corps]]; and Bizarro Flash, a greatly overweight Bizarro, who collapses after a few seconds of running. Other Bizarro versions featured in the storyline were a Bizarro Lex Luthor, [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

*'''[[Match (DC Comics)|Match]]''' - a clone of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]], the character was reintroduce by Geoff Johns as a deteriorated clone resembling Bizarro in both appearance and speech.

*'''[[A. Bizarro]]''' -  a Bizarro duplicate of an ordinary man who happened to look like Superman., the character was introduced in the self-titled miniseries by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[M.D. Bright]].

*'''[[Project Cadmus]]''' - created a cloning process for Lex Luthor in their attempts to [[Cloning|clone]] Superman.  This led to Bizarro clones of: [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]; [[Harley Quinn]]; [[Linda Danvers|Supergirl]]; and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  

*'''[[Lord Havok]] and the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]]''' - a Bizarro version of Wonder Woman, called Wonderzarro, is shown to be a member of [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch's]] army. <ref>[[Lord Havok]] and the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]] #4 </ref>

===Alternate universe depictions===
*'''[[Superman: Red Son]]''' - Lex Luthor creates a imperfect clone of Superman, as a champion for the United States.  The  creature sacrifices himself to save [[London]] from a nuclear missile, saying "Hello, everybody. Me very pleased to meet you," seconds before his death. He has red hair and lumpy blister-like skin, and his costume resembles that of the original Superman except that the monogram on his chest reads "US".

*'''[[The Superman Monster]]''' - in the [[Frankenstein]] pastiche, Viktor Luthor's Creature originally resembles Bizarro, although he sloughs off the chalky skin later in the story.

*'''[[JLA: The Nail]]''' - Lex Luthor discovered Kal-El's abandoned spaceship and taken DNA samples from it in creating clones; the [[Justice League]] encounters these Bizarro-like duplicates used as Luthor's henchmen. 

*'''[[All-Star Superman]]''' - Bizarro clones are the workforce used by [[Project Cadmus|P.R.O.J.E.C.T.]] under Leo Quintum. They reside in a universe with tremendous gravity called the Underverse, and they speak like the regular DC Universe Bizarro. Superman turns into an evil Bizarro-like being under the influence of black [[kryptonite]], which is drawn from the Underverse. <ref> ''All-Star Superman'' #4 </ref> The Bizarros are a form of infection that the planet spreads to Earth; they are immune to the Underverse's harsh environment and can survive in space. At first, the Bizarros appear as emaciated, gray humanoids with hollow eye sockets and pale, lumpy skin, but when they touch a person, that person becomes a version of a Bizarro. One Bizarro grabs Superman, and it takes on the appearance of the regular Bizarro.

<span id="Zibarro"/>
*'''[[Zibarro]]''' from ''All-Star Superman''. On Bizarro World, only one out of billions has the mental abilities of a normal human being. This Bizarro introduces himself to Superman as Zibarro. Although Zibarro resembles Superman, he has no apparent powers. He helps Superman to escape from Bizarro world, unselfishly giving up his own chance to do so. However, Superman promises to return to rescue him.

*'''[[Justice League Adventures]]''' - An entire team of Bizarros is introduced in the ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' comic book, including one based on the all-new character ''All-Star''.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Bzro.JPG|185px|thumb|[[Tom Welling]] as Bizarro in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'']]

*Bizarro appears in the ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'', voiced by Bill Calloway.

*Bizarro appears in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', voiced by [[Danny Dark]].

*Bizarro appears in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Tim Daly]], and its successor ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[George Newbern]]

*Bizarro appears in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' series, played by Barry Meyers. He is to date the only live-action appearance of the traditional version of the character, complete with angular white features.

*A clone of Superman analogous to Bizarro appears in [[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]] played by [[Dean Cain]]. Created by Lex Luthor for the purpose or replacing Superman, he does not have Bizarro's distinct appearance, and is visually indistinguishable from Superman, as well as possessing all his normal powers and weaknesses. Although he does not speak backwards he does appear childlike and slightly simple-minded, and Lois refers to him at one point as seeming "bizarre".

*A villain nicknamed Bizarro appears in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', played by  [[Tom Welling]]. However, this version differs significantly from comic book versions of the character, being neither unintelligent nor "backwards", and appearing as a perfect duplicate. This version of Bizarro was once a wraith who was trapped in the [[Phantom Zone]] until Clark accidentally released him. It was revealed that this wraith needed to switch between human bodies every 24 hours, and that he needed a Kryptonian body in order for him to sustain life. He is able to steal Clark's cells, and becomes a carbon copy of him. However, whereas the yellow sun of Earth powers Clark, it turns the phantom's skin into stone. The phantom attempts to replace Clark & live his life, but is sent to Mars. He returns shortly after, and is able to fool Clark's friends into believing it's him. Clark returns, and finds that the phantom's true weakness is Blue Kryptonite. Lana is able to get the Blue Kryponite close enough to Bizarro, in which it causes his strength to grow exponentially. Because his body could not contain that kind of power, he imploded, and was killed.

*The Bizarro world was the focus of the [[Seinfeld]] episode "[[The Bizarro Jerry]]". Also, a Bizarro model can be seen in the background of an apartment.
[[Image:NuclearMan1.jpg|200px|thumb|The Bizarro-esque prototype [[Nuclear Man]], from a deleted sequence in ''Superman IV''.]]
*An episode of [[Space Ghost Coast To Coast]] featured a Bizarro form of Santa Claus, which was a large  flesh-coloured tentacled blob with two faces under a Santa hat.  He was an enemy of the Tooth Fairy.  He wanted to take the teeth of children to make evil twisted toys for his own amusement.  In the episode, he battled the Tooth Fairy in Space Ghost's set.

*An episode of [[Sealab 2021]] featured Bizarro forms of the cast, who invaded Sealab to take a Death Ray and jewelry they didn't have.

=== Video games ===
*Bizarro appears in ''[[Superman 64]]''.

*Bizarro appears in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel (video game)|Superman: The Man of Steel]]''.

*Bizarro is a villain and playable character in the ''[[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]]'' video game.

*Bizarro is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

===Film===
*In ''[[Superman III]]'' a Bizarro-like villain appears when synthetic kryptonite causes Superman to split into a heroic Clark Kent and an [[Evil Superman]], although the character shares more characteristics with [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]].

*In ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'', a similar idea to Bizarro is used when Luthor attempts to clone Superman. Although the final product, [[Nuclear Man]] has different abilities and looks nothing like Superman, a deleted scene involves an intermediate stage in the character's creation which produces a creature closer in concept to Bizarro, with white skin, low intelligence and unusual speech.
