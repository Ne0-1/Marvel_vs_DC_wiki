'''Bizarro''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[doppelgänger]] of [[DC Comics]]’ [[Superman]]. Created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[George Papp]], he first appeared in ''[[Superboy]]'' #68 ([[1958#October|October 1958]]). 

Due to a somewhat disjointed [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], several versions of Bizarro have appeared in DC [[comic book]]s, all of them inversions of Superman with gray or chalk-white skin, a twisted sense of logic which typically manifests as a superficial "opposite" of anything Superman would do or say and a resultant speech pattern ("Me am going to kill you" would mean "I will save you" in Bizarro speech).  Due to his imperfections, Bizarro is frequently a foe of Superman, but sometimes finds himself in the role of hero (in this case, an [[anti-hero]]).

The original Bizarro was created when Superman was exposed to a "duplicate ray."  In accordance with the [[science fiction]] concepts of Superman stories of the era, Bizarro relocated to "the [[Bizarro World]]," a cubical planet called Htrae [in keeping with Bizarro logic, Earth spelled backwards] which operated under "Bizarro logic" (it was a crime to do anything good or right) and which Bizarro populated with inverted versions of Superman’s [[List of supporting characters in Superman|supporting cast]] and other DC heroes.

The [[1986]] event ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[reboot (continuity)|rewrote]] DC’s continuity, eliminating Htrae.  Since then, two Bizarro characters have appeared, one of them a flawed clone created by [[Lex Luthor]].  The second, longer lasting Bizarro, was an idea of the [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], brought to life by the cosmic [[Mister Mxyzptlk]].

Bizarro has been a consistent enemy of Superman since his first appearance.  Faithful adaptations of Bizarro appeared in the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' and series in the subsequent [[DC animated universe]].  Also, doppelgängers of Superman with some attributes of Bizarro appeared in live action adaptations.

Bizarro and the Bizarro World have become somewhat well known in popular culture, and the term Bizarro is used as to describe anything that utilizes twisted logic or that is the opposite of something else. <ref>[http://www.neca.org/source/NECA_2840.asp Bizarro reference] Reference to Bizzaro logic in FCC pleading.</ref>
==Pre-Crisis Bizarro==
The original Bizarro was created in a laboratory accident.  A scientist was demonstrating his newly invented "duplicating ray" to [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]], testing it on a [[radium]] pellet and a jewel.  However, the duplicated radium was non-radioactive and the jewel melted.  The scientist then stumbled and knocked the machine, inadvertently creating an imperfect Superboy.  Although the scientist insisted the duplicate was not alive, it nonetheless escaped from the lab. Although Bizarro wanted to be accepted, his appearance and erratic behavior scared people, especially since he had no idea of his own super-strength. He was befriended by a blind girl, shortly before Superboy realized the remains of the machine would act as Kryptonite to him.  Bizarro headed straight towards Superboy, having somehow realized that the shockwave from his destruction would cure his friend's blindness.

The later Bizarro was created by [[Lex Luthor]], who used the "duplicating ray" on the adult Superman and hoped to use the duplicate to attack Superman.  However, this Bizarro did not cooperate and instead tried to emulate Superman.  Unfortunately, his attempts to match the original's heroics were clumsy and destructive, and he kidnapped Lois.  This was resolved when Lois created a Bizarro-Lois for Bizarro using the "duplication ray".  Feeling rejected by the people of Earth, they moved to the world of Htrae, which had ancient advanced technology which was used to populate the planet with other Bizarros created in the same manner.  Almost everyone on Htrae looked like an ugly Superman (and possessed super powers) or an ugly [[Lois Lane]].  On Superman's first visit to Htrae in ''[[Action Comics|Action Comics #264]]'' (May 1960), he was arrested for being normal, but he plea-bargained a proposal to change the shape of the world into a cube (thereby making it imperfect) for his release.

Bizarro's only weakness is blue [[Kryptonite]], created by using the same machine to duplicate green Kryptonite.  Though Bizarro acts in what he believes to be the best manner, his Bizarro logic often causes him to act for evil.

Originally Bizarro's abilities were the same as Superman's but he was hit by a meteorite which reversed his powers: flame breath, ice vision, microscopic vision that actually increased the size of things, X-ray vision that could only see through lead, etc.  Superman had to deal with these new powers in ''Superman'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #333 (1979) when Bizarro says he is going to save Lois Lane (meaning in Bizarro logic, he is going to kill her). Superman manages to trick Bizarro into thinking he has 'saved' Lois and returns to Bizarro World.

===Appearance===
Bizarro has chalky and sometimes rock-like skin, a pale complexion, and a misshapen face.  While the original Bizarro costume was identical to Superman's, he later changed it to one with a reversed S-shield so he could be even more imperfect; subsequent modifications to the costume have included a dented belt buckle and poorly fitting boots, although these modifications weren't consistent between stories.  Bizarro wears a medallion that says "Bizarro #1", in order to distinguish himself from the other Bizarros on Htrae.

===The Bizarro World===

{{main|Bizarro World}}
In the Bizarro world, a cube-shaped planet known as "Htrae" (Earth spelled backwards), society is ruled by the Bizarro Code, which states that it is a crime to do anything well or to make anything perfect or beautiful.

Later stories introduced Bizarro versions of [[List of supporting characters in Superman|Superman's supporting cast]], including Bizarro-[[Perry White]] and Bizarro-[[Jimmy Olsen]], created by using the duplicator ray on characters other than Superman and Lois Lane, as well as the children of Bizarro and Bizarro Lois.  There was even a Bizarro-[[Justice League]] and [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], as well as a "Bizarro-[[Mr. Mxyzptlk|Kltpzyxm]]".

"Tales of the Bizarro World" became a recurring segment in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' from 1961 to 1962.

On one occasion, [[Keith Giffen]] portrayed Htrae itself as being ''sentient'' - "Me am the Bizarro World.  Planet Earth not think... therefore, me do" - and its only sane inhabitant was the Bizarro [[Ambush Bug]].

===Linguistics===
Bizarro and the other inhabitants of the Bizarro world used an odd but predictable form of English.  The most notable characteristics were:
* The lack of [[nominative case]] when using pronouns; Bizarro replaces pronouns that should be nominative with their analogues in the [[accusative case]].  Bizarro might introduce himself by saying "Me am Bizarro" instead of "I am Bizarro," for example.
* The lack of proper [[Grammatical conjugation|verb conjugation]]; Bizarro only uses the [[grammatical person|first person]] conjugation for any verb.  For example, the verb "is" is always conjugated as "am", leading to sentences like "This am great".
* Speaking the opposite of what is really meant in a situation.  Thus, "This am great" would mean that the thing '''isn't''' great at all.  The exception would be "Me am Bizarro", which would actually mean what was said.  Bizarro-English words are thus [[antonym]]s of the corresponding English words.

===Death===
In ''Superman'' #423 & ''Action Comics'' #583,  [[Alan Moore]] wrote [[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|the final Superman]] story for the Pre-Crisis era (though subsequent writers have retconned it into being an alternate reality).  In the beginning of ''Superman'' #423, Superman has his final encounter with Bizarro, who had gone on a killing spree.

Superman has been off the Earth, doing research for the government.  When he returns, he finds complete city blocks horribly destroyed, and is told Bizarro has gone berserk, smashing buildings and injuring innocent people.

Confronted by Superman, Bizarro tells him, "This am part of genius Bizarro self-improvement plan."  Bizarro tells Superman that he has destroyed Bizarro world, as Krypton had been destroyed.  His reason for killing so many humans is that Superman never kills, so Bizarro reasons that he should do the opposite.  Bizarro then exposes himself to blue [[kryptonite]], and dies.  His last words are "... everything, him go d-dark... Hello, Superman.  Hello." dies.''

Not much later, Superman's secret identity is exposed and all the members of his rogues gallery attempt to kill him and everyone associated with him.  Superman later discovers that [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] is the villain orchestrating the attacks, and was most likely responsible for Bizarro's strange(r) behavior.

===Post-Crisis appearances of Pre-Crisis Bizarro===
Though Bizarro was destroyed in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], his character later to be reimagined and reintroduced, the original Bizarro was able to make a few appearances.  For instance:
* In the ''[[Animal Man]]'' storyline "Deus Ex Machina", [[Psycho Pirate]], while in [[Arkham Asylum]], recreates characters removed from continuity, exposing the [[fourth wall]] to the protagonist.  Bizarro appears as he did pre-Crisis.

==Post-Crisis Bizarro==
[[Image:Manofsteel5.jpg|right|thumb|Post-Crisis Bizarro debut in ''Man of Steel'' #5.]]
===LexCorp Bizarros===

Bizarro World was erased from the history of the [[DC Universe]] during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].  Since then, two Bizarros have been created by [[Lex Luthor]].  However, in the post-Crisis version, the imperfections in the duplicates are eventually fatal.  The first Bizarro created Post-Crisis appeared in ''Man of Steel'' #5 (1986), and made several attempts to "be" Superman, including wearing a jacket and glasses over his costume, although leaving it visible.  He was apparently not capable of speech.  As his non-living matter was continually flaking off, he was destroyed when he and Superman smashed into each other (the flakes of his body restoring [[Lucy Lane]]'s vision, in homage to the original story). 

Luthor later recreated Bizarro to see if it would offer insight into how to stop the "Clone Plague".  This Bizarro escaped, and kidnapped Lois Lane, taking her to "Bizarro World"; a warehouse set up like a surreal version of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].  He subjected her to danger, so that he would be able to rescue her from it.  She managed to escape, and Bizarro was recaptured by Lexcorp, where it subsequently died.

These Bizarros were similar to the original in appearance and abilities, although the second was less angular.  While the first did not speak, the second had the speech patterns of the original.

===Emperor Joker===
A later version of Bizarro has a very different origin, having been created by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] by the use of the powers of [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]; his first appearance was in ''Superman'' vol. 2, #160, and he seems to be the longest lived Post-Crisis Bizarro yet; in a nod to Htrae, Jokerworld, the Joker's twisted version of Earth, is a perfect cube with Joker's image on each facet. Bizarro also retains most of the classic Bizarro speech patterns. The "Emperor Joker" Bizarro is not as chalky and angular as the original Bizarro.  He has a light greyish skin-tone, yellow and red eyes, an overly muscular body, and a maniacal smile.  Bizarro has a purple and indigo uniform, and the logo on his chest is inverted, so the "S" is backwards.  The current Bizarro has the classic "Bizarro #1" engraved stone amulet.

Originally created as the greatest hero of Jokerworld and leader of that world's JLA (Joker's League of Anarchy), Bizarro was one of a number of characters Mxyzptlk saved from that world after Joker lost the powers he had stolen from the imp. He was subsequently captured by the Pokolistanian dictator [[General Zod#Russian Zod|General Zod]], who used to torture him for months, apparently just for the pleasure of beating someone who resembled Superman.

After escaping from Pokolistan with Superman's help, Bizarro recreated his Jokerworld headquarters, the Graveyard of Solitude, and at erratic intervals emerges to help or hinder Superman; the decision as to which being seemingly random, and the same amount of trouble caused either way.

To decide whether or not to join the new Secret Society of Supervillains, Bizarro challenged Zoom to a race (obviously meant as a homage/parody to the Superman/Flash races).  However, due to Bizarro's complicated speech patterns, Zoom and Cheetah were not sure which end result of the race would convince Bizarro to join.  Also, Zoom soon grew frustrated since Bizarro wouldn't run in a straight line (Bizarro would just zig-zag across the planet).

Bizarro (probably unknowingly) became a killer in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1 (Oct, 2005) while a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. After the [[Human Bomb]] killed [[Doctor Polaris]], Bizarro, commenting that he liked the flashes of light that the Human Bomb's powers created, attacked the Bomb, hammering his face to produce more colorful explosions. Lincoln's body was pulped by the brutal beating received, his explosive nature not harming the impervious Bizarro. The explosions stopped even though Bizarro continued punching, indicating that the power ended at the instant of death. 

During the publication of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' [[limited series]], the majority of [[DC Comics]]' superhero line advanced one year. [[One Year Later|One year later]], Bizarro is a captive of [[Lex Luthor]] and has been watching television in a small room for thirteen months. As a result, he is much smarter than before (although still not close to an average intellect) and instead of talking backwards he talks similar to the early version of the [[Incredible Hulk]], making him similar to [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Recently, Bizarro has once again become affiliated with a Bizarro World reminiscent of its pre-crisis counterpart but under a blue sun. Also, unlike Htrae, on this world he is the world's most hated hero, and his alias Kent Clark is the man that Bizarro Lois loves, effectively reverse the original setup in Superman history.

===Abilities===
Originally, this Bizarro's abilities were the same as Superman's, but in homage to his Pre-Crisis counterpart, this Bizarro also developed reversed powers as well as adding things like "x-ray hearing" and "spotlight vision". <ref>Superman/Batman #19</ref> Instead of possessing heat vision and freeze breath like Superman, he has freeze vision and flame breath, the latter recently shown in ''Batman/Superman'' #22 (Loeb, McGuinness, Vines).  He is physically as powerful as Superman and can hold his own against him.  In ''Action Comics'' #855 (Part one of the "Escape From Bizarro World" storyline), it is revealed that the light of a blue sun can give Bizarro extra powers, such as "Bizarro Vision", which creates Bizarro duplicates of any person it hits.

Post-Crisis Bizarro has encountered Blue Kryptonite on two occasions.  The first was pre-Infinite Crisis [[Batzarro]] presented him with a ring set with a stone of it. <ref>Superman/Batman #20</ref> <ref>Superman/Batman #25</ref>  The ring caused Bizarro to speak normally and act rationally, as well as granting him a 12th level intellect. The effect seems to be the opposite of the expected outcome. Instead of killing this Bizarro, it has the imperfect effect of making him intelligent. Still, he feared the ring.  The ring appeared to have no effect on Batzarro since he is a [[Batman]] clone.  Post-Infinite Crisis Luthor created a version of Blue Kryptonite that affects Bizarro just like Green Kryptonite affects Superman (''Action Comics Annual'' #10).

====Linguistics====
Post-Crisis Bizarro adopted all of the linguistic idiosyncrasies of his Pre-Crisis self, but also negated every possible word in the sentence.  Though the usage was slightly inconsistent, this usually included:
* Negating verbs.
* Replacing [[adjective]]s with their opposite.
* Replacing certain [[noun]]s with their opposite.
The ultimate end of this caused sentences to frequently have [[double negative|double]] and triple negatives.  Combined with the fact that Bizarro's logic is already flawed, this caused some of his dialogue to be very difficult to follow.

As of ''Action Comics'' #845, Bizarro has learned how to speak more normally by watching television for thirteen months. As a result, he no longer negates the meaning of every possible word in the sentence and now speaks almost exactly like his Pre-Crisis self.

==Other Bizarro characters==
While the Superman-like Bizarro is the predominant one, anyone with milky-white or crystalline skin (depending on the artists' design) and who speaks with Bizarro's odd linguistic pattern can be considered to be ''a'' Bizarro in the [[DC Universe]]. 

===[[Batzarro]]===
A Bizarro version of Batman debuted in ''World's Finest Comics'' #156.  [[Jeph Loeb]] introduced a Bizarro-[[Batman]], [[Batzarro]], into the DC universe in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #20 (June 2005).  His origin is unknown, but his speech patterns are almost identical to those of Bizarro.  According to Bizarro, "Him no come from same place as Bizarro #1.  That am why we am so different."  This can be taken to mean that they come from the same place, which is why they are so similar.  Unfortunately, because of Bizarro's twisted logic and grammar, this may very well be incorrect.

===Others===
In [[DC One Million]], for example, there are references to a future Bizarro epidemic where the condition spreads like zombism.  In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', the [[Justice League]] encounters Bizarro duplicates used as henchmen.

Many Bizarro duplicates would break down and disintegrate after enduring a relative amount of stress.  This was attributed to the imperfect nature of the duplication process, originally unable to deal with Superman's extraterrestrial nature.

A Bizarro-[[Superboy]] was created by [[Project Cadmus]], when they used Luthor's process in their attempts to [[Cloning|clone]] Superman.  It was also used to create a Bizarro-[[Harley Quinn]] after Bizarro developed a crush on Quinn.  Similar processes to Luthor's were used by [[Two-Face]] to create a Bizarro-[[Linda Danvers|Supergirl]] and [[Brainiac 5|Brainiac 5.1]] to create a post-Crisis Bizarro-Legion.  There was also a miniseries by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[M.D. Bright]], ''[[A. Bizarro]]'', about a Bizarro who was the duplicate of an ordinary man who happened to look like Superman.

In ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' [[Match (DC Comics)|Match]], a clone of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]], has deteriorated to the point where he resembles Bizarro and speaks backwards like Bizarro does.

In ''[[Superman Family]]'' a non-living duplicate of the Earth-Two [[Superman (Kal-L)|Superman]]'s villainous alter ego, the [[Kal-L#Adversaries|Flying Tiger]], was created with similar powers to his living template. This copy manifested a weakness to green kryptonite, unlike Bizarro's weakness to blue Kryptonite, and was phased out of existence by the same device that created him.

In May of 2005, a fake news website set during DC's [[52 (comic book)|lost year]] reported that the [[Kentucky Derby]] had been won by a talking horse named Bizarabo, who won the race by running ''backwards''.

Many new Bizarro characters were featured in [[Action Comics]] ''Escape from Bizarro World'' storyline, such as a Bizarro [[Justice League]], featuring:
*Bizarro Batman, wearing a smily-face on his chest, and possessing a bat-treehouse.
*Bizarro [[Hawkgirl]], who screeches like an actual hawk.
*Bizarro [[Wonder Woman]], who ties herself up with her lasso to make others lie.
*Yellow Lantern, a reluctant member of the [[Sinestro Corps]].
*Bizarro Flash, a greatly overweight Bizarro, who collapses after a few seconds of running.

Other Bizarro's featured in the storyline were a Bizarro Lex Luthor, [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

==Other versions==
===Elseworlds===
[[Image:RedSonBizarro.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bizarro from ''Superman: Red Son''.]]

In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', Bizarro was an imperfect clone of Superman created by Lex Luthor.  His costume resembled that of the "normal" Superman, but his monogram was a shield with "U.S." printed on it.  He had red hair and odd-looking skin with blisters and distended veins.  He sacrificed himself to save [[London]] from a nuclear missile.

In the [[Frankenstein]] pastiche, ''[[The Superman Monster]]'', Viktor Luthor's Creature originally resembles Bizarro, although he sloughs off the chalky skin later in the story.

DC produced an [[anthology]], ''Bizarro Comics'', featuring offbeat and irreverent stories by alternative comics writers and artists featuring various [[DC Universe]] characters.  The anthology's chief conceit was that all of its contents (aside from the [[framing sequence]]) were created by Bizarro himself.  A second, conceptually similar, anthology entitled ''Bizarro World'' has been released.

In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Lex Luthor discovered Kal-El's abandoned spaceship and taken DNA samples from it in creating Bizarro clones.

===All-Star Superman===
In the pages of ''[[All-Star Superman]]'', there are several different versions of Bizarro.

• Bizarro clones are the workforce used by P.R.O.J.E.C.T. under [[Leo Quintum]]. They reside in a universe with tremendous gravity called the '''Underverse''', and they speak like the regular DC Universe Bizarro. 

• In #4, Superman turns into an evil, Bizarro-like being under the influence of Black [[Kryptonite]], which is drawn from the Underverse.

• A new Bizarro World is introduced in #7, a cuboid "planet-eater" comes from the Underverse, which "in its own crude way is trying to mimic the Earth - to appear less threatening as it moves in for the kill". Once Superman injures the planet (by smashing into it at a high rate of speed), it retreats into the Underverse.

In the eighth issue, Superman is stranded on Bizarro World as his powers fade in the red sun. He meets an intelligent Bizarro (see below) who informs him that Bizarro World fears him and wishes to keep him happy. Besides the previously-created Bizarro Superman, Bizarro versions of [[Green Lantern]] and [[The Flash]], (as well as a Bizarro [[Jor-El]] called 'Le-Roj') appear to help Superman escape Bizarro World.

• The Bizarros are a form of infection that the planet spreads to Earth; they are immune to the Underverse's harsh environment and can survive in space. At first, the Bizarros appear as emaciated, grey humanoids with hollow eye sockets and pale, lumpy skin. When they touch a person, that person becomes a version of a Bizarro. One Bizarro grabs Superman, and it takes on the appearance of the regular Bizarro. The Bizarros hate sunlight and warmth, and people who take steroids and performance pills are immune to their touch. Once the 'All Night' comes (when the Bizarro World organism returns home to the Underverse) most Bizarros are absorbed by the planet.

On Bizarro World, only one out of billions has the mental abilities of a normal human being. This Bizarro introduces himself to Superman as '''[[Zibarro]]'''. Although Zibarro resembles Superman, his powers are not revealed.

===Justice League Adventures===
An entire team of Bizarros is introduced in the ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' comic book, including one based on the all-new character ''All-Star''.

==In other media==
=== ''Challenge of the SuperFriends'' ===
Bizarro's first non-comics appearance was in the animated series ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]].'' In this series, Bizarro was depicted almost as an outright villain, and part of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]]. In addition to his appearance in the "Challenge" episodes, Bizarro also appeared in "The Revenge of Doom," "Bizarroworld," "Revenge of Bizarro," and "Video Victims," which were all Superfriends shorts. [[Bill Calloway]] provided the voice of Bizarro.

=== ''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'' ===
''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' had a more faithful depiction as a well meaning bumbler. In the episode "The Bizarro Super Powers Team", he made Bizarro clones of [[Wonder Woman]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and even a Bizarro-Mxyzptlk who goes by the name Kltpzyxm. [[Danny Dark]] provided Bizarro's voice in this episode.

===''Superman III''===
In ''[[Superman III]]'', Superman is turned evil by a computer genius named [[Gus Gorman]], an associate to the villainous [[Ross Webster]]. Gorman discovers Superman's weakness to be [[Kryptonite]], and attempts to synthesize it. Laced with tobacco tar as a substitute component, the resulting synthetic Kryptonite behaved like Red and Black Kryptonite, aside from the standard green coloring. Upon exposure, Superman slowly became evil and eventually split into two people. Although this [[evil Superman]] shared similarities to Bizarro, he was not called that in the film nor possessed any linguistic problems. He did, however, appear closer in personality design to [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]]. Despite being an equal match, Clark Kent managed to kill this evil incarnation at the climax to their junkyard brawl by strangling him, whereby the evil Superman vanished into thin air as a result.

=== ''Superboy'' ===
Until recently, the only live-action appearances to date of the traditional Bizarro were in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' TV series which aired from 1988-1992. He was played by [[Barry Meyers]] and appeared in 7 episodes.  The first two-part story featuring Bizarro, titled "Bizarro the Thing of Steel" (part one) and "The Battle with Bizarro" (part two), was based on the first Bizarro story from the comics. In this version, Bizarro was created when Superboy jumped in front of a duplicating machine created by Professor Peterson (played by [[George Chakiris]]) after it was struck and activated by a lightning bolt. Like in the comic, Bizarro was not truly a villain, but his backward ways of thinking led him to cause trouble and fight Superboy. This Bizarro was an unstable duplicate, meaning he would eventually spontaneously explode. Superboy and Professor Peterson attempted to "kill" the supposedly non-living being with green [[kryptonite]], but this attempt failed. They then duplicated a chunk of kryptonite with the machine and created white kryptonite, which instead of killing Bizarro, actually cured and stabilized him.  

In a later two-part story, entitled "Bride of Bizarro", Bizarro was manipulated by [[Lex Luthor]] into attempting to kill Superboy with the promise that Luthor would create a Bizarro female for him to love.  Luthor eventually kidnapped [[Lana Lang]] and created a Bizarro duplicate of her. This Bizarro-Lana prevented Bizarro from killing Superboy by convincing him that Luthor was an evil man.  

Later still, in another two-part story ("To Be Human") Bizarro-Lana exploded due to the inherent instability in Bizarro duplicates, sending Bizarro into a deep depression.  Superboy took Bizarro to a research lab where a scientist found a way to make Bizarro human by transferring Superboy's brainwaves into him.  The transfer cleared up Bizarro's confused mind, making him think like a human, and removed his powers.  He was made into the image of the scientist's deceased son through skin grafts.  But the transfer process left Superboy's mind clouded and weakened his powers and he was injured and taken captive by a villain called "Chaos", who planned to kill him by throwing him off the tallest building in the city. The only one who could save Superboy was Bizarro (now going by the name Bill Zarro).  But to do so, he had to reverse the transfer process and become Bizarro again.  He saved Superboy at the cost of his humanity.

=== ''Lois & Clark : The New Adventures of Superman'' ===
In the first season episode ''Vatman'' [[Lex Luthor]] creates a clone of [[Superman]] which he intends to kill the real Man of Steel and replace him with one he can control.  Even though the clone appeared identical to Superman in appearance, also played by [[Dean Cain]], he clearly was the series version of Bizarro.  The character was portrayed as immature and naive. In fact at one point [[Lois Lane]], starting to suspect that the clone was not the real Superman, referred to him as "bizarre".

=== ''Superman: The Animated Series'' ===
In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Bizarro is a combination of Pre-Crisis, Post-Crisis, and original material; he was voiced by [[Tim Daly]], who also provided [[Superman]]/[[Clark Kent]]'s voice.  The animated series attempted to portray Bizarro as a tragic figure - cursed with Superman's powers and desire to use his powers to help people, but lacking the intelligence to do so properly.

As seen in his first episode "[[Identity Crisis (Superman: The Animated Series episode)|Identity Crisis]]", Bizarro is a failed experiment of Luthor's, who wanted to create a Superman clone that would follow his orders.  The clone is created from a blood sample taken from Superman when he was weakened by Kryptonite during "A Little Piece of Home".  At first the clone looks and acts like Superman, but does not seem to be aware of his alter ego Clark Kent when he rescues the real Kent from falling off a cliff.  The duplication breaks down, and Bizarro's form and costume changes.  This version has washed-out colors on his costume with a deformed (but still forward) S-shield, pale skin, and his posture suggests that his limbs are twisted.  After his sudden confusion, he asks "what am me?" only to be teased by [[Mercy Graves]] replying "Bizarro! that's what you am". Bizarro's logic does not follow an opposite pattern; his "Bizarro logic" is resultant of his atrophied Superman mindset. Instead of doing bad because Superman does good, Bizarro tries to do good but can't understand what he sees. Bizarro, as far as he knows, ''is'' Superman, so the appearance of the real Superman confuses him, and he believes the real Superman is an impostor. Once he sees Superman saving Lois Lane; Bizarro realizes he is the duplicate, and sacrifices himself so that Superman and Lois can escape the explosion that destroys the lab where he was created. 

In "Bizarro's World", Bizarro stumbles on the [[Fortress of Solitude]], where the Fortress' computer mistakes him for Superman and tells him that he is Kal-El, explaining his Kryptonian heritage. Bizarro sets out to recreate Krypton in Metropolis, and then decides that he needs to toss a missile at "Krypton" to destroy it again.  Superman stops him, and gives him an alien moon which he can call home.  

Bizarro remains pleased with this until his third appearance, "Little Big Head Man", where [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] convinces Bizarro to attack Superman because he and his friends were supposedly making fun of him. This is a lie, of course, and at the end, a de-powered Mxyzptlk is stuck on Bizarro's moon as his "friend."

=== ''Justice League Unlimited'' ===
There seems to have been a change in Bizarro's (voiced by [[George Newbern]]) mind by the time ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' rolls around, though, because in "Ultimatum" he returns, now in confused love with [[Giganta]] (even though she's just using him to break [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]] out of jail):

Bizarro: Me do anything for woman I love!  Even break her boyfriend out of jail!

Wonder Woman: And what's gonna happen then?

Bizarro: Uh... (punched out by Wonder Woman)

He had also joined the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] near the end of the series, now functioning under "Bizarro logic" as commanded by Luthor - Luthor says, "Superman is your best friend," and Bizarro immediately understands that he must kill him. The reason for this change in Bizarro's mindset is not explained in the episode, but producer Bruce Timm pointed out at [[Toon Zone]] that Bizarro is, in fact, a victim of brain surgery. He's been altered by Luthor specifically to do as he commands (coming full circle with Lex's original intention for Bizarro). The clue for this in the episodes where he appears is that Bizarro now has a big gray gash across his forehead - scarring from the operation. It is worth noting that when Lex Luthor and the Flash switch minds in The Great Brain Robbery, Bizarro is the only one who notices anything is amiss, though his thought process precludes his being helpful: "Ever since you plug into monkey's head (referring to the brain machine), you am acting perfectly sane and rational... am you Bizarro's mommy?"

=== Video games ===
Bizarro appeared in ''[[Superman 64]]'' and ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel (Xbox game)|Superman: Man of Steel]]'' as a supervillain.

Bizarro also appears as a villain and playable character in the [[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]] video game. Bizarro is only playable for a short period of time and during that time you have to cause as much damage that's indicated on the screen. A cheat code exists for the Superman Returns Two-Disc DVD which allows you to play as him for an unlimited period of time.

===Smallville===
[[Image:Bizarro.PNG|230px|thumb|right|Bizarro in [[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]] ]]In the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' season 6 finale "Phantom", the last of the escaped Phantom Zone criminals requires a Kryptonian host to survive. The creature, who was consistently referred to as "the phantom," was designed and built on Krypton, using genetic modification, but was trapped in the Phantom Zone when it became dangerous. The creature bonds with Clark Kent's DNA and becomes an exact duplicate of the Kryptonian (though wearing a dark navy-blue jacket and dark reddish purple shirt, as opposed to Clark's red jacket and blue shirt). Lionel Luthor attempts to use green kryptonite against the duplicate, but it only strengthens it.  When Clark asks "What the hell are you?" the duplicate replies, "I'm you, only a little more bizarre." A short time later the duplicate's face changes from an exact copy of Clark's to one resembling Bizarro's signature rock-like, misshapen face, as it will continue to do briefly during any moment of weakness. He also exhibits the ability to fly, unlike Clark himself. Bizarro Clark is strengthened when exposed to meteor rock, and weakened by sunlight (This is opposite of Clark, who is strengthened by the sunlight and weakened by Kryptonite). Clark was able to defeat Bizarro in the season seven premiere, entitled "Bizarro", when Clark uppercuts him towards the sun, and [[Martian Manhunter#Smallville|Martian Manhunter]] flies by and catches him, flying him to the sunny side of Mars and stranding him there. <!--The phantom is the phantom until it copies Clark, only then is it a "bizarro" copy of Clark.  So you can't say "Bizarro appears at the end of 'Zod'", or "on the DVD", because that isn't Bizarro, that's just the phantom!-->

In the episode "Gemini," Clark begins to behave unusually after his return from the Fortress of Solitude. At the episodes end it is revealed that "Clark" is actually Bizarro, while the real Clark is still in the Fortress trapped within a block of ice by Jor-El, probably for his defiance in "Blue".

=="Bizarro" references in pop culture==
{{Trivia|date=October 2007}}
In popular culture, "Bizarro ___" eventually became a popular term for a version of a character who, while not always evil, is unsettling or creepy to those who know the original version.

* The [[television]] series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', with its many Superman references and in-jokes, devoted an episode to the Bizarro concept, "[[The Bizarro Jerry]]", with Elaine dating a mirror opposite of Jerry who had his own Bizarro versions of friends George, Kramer, and Newman. He has an apartment that is a mirror image of Jerry's. To complete the allusion, Kevin (the Bizarro Jerry character) even uses the peculiar way of speaking, ending the episode with "Me so happy; me want to cry" and has a statue of Bizarro (to Jerry's Superman) in his apartment.
* ''[[Sealab 2021]]'' (which aired on [[Cartoon Network]]) has satirized the Bizarro concept (episode #17). 
* The [[reality television]] parody, ''[[Drawn Together]]'', featured a Bizarro Captain Hero at one point and as Captain Hero laments "What happens in Bizarro world, stays in Bizarro world" regarding a homosexual fling with his Bizarro Self. Although as Bizarro Captain Hero pointed out, a public restroom at a [[bus depot]] didn't actually count as Bizarro World. Later on in the episode, it is hinted that Captain Hero killed his Bizarro counterpart to silence him, and made it look like [[suicide]].
* In the [[Pilot (Ugly Betty)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', [[Marc St. James|Marc]] refers to [[Betty Suarez|Betty]], [[Christina (Ugly Betty)|Christina]], [[List of minor characters on Ugly Betty#The "Uglies"|Nancy]] and [[List of minor characters on Ugly Betty#The "Uglies"|Zelda]] as "The Bizzaro version of [[Sex and the City]]."
* Sometimes, when a ''[[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]'' show comes from Canada, [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] refers to the country as "bizarro world", where the locals root for heels like [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] because they hail from Canada.
* In the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode "[[The Wish (Buffy episode)|The Wish]]," [[Cordelia Chase]] refers to that reality as "Bizarro World." She uses the term again later in the ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'' episode "[[You're Welcome (Angel episode)|You're Welcome]]", when she learns that former evil vampire [[Spike (Buffyverse)|Spike]] has reformed and become a hero and Angel is now head of the Los Angeles office of the evil law firm [[Wolfram and Hart]] ("What kind of freakin' Bizarro World did I wake up in?!").
*  In the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' episode "Ripple Effect" Col. Mitchell refers to an SG-1 team from an alternate reality as "The Bizarro SG-1"

* In an episode of ''[[The O.C.]]'', [[Ryan Atwood]] refers to a character named [[List of recurring characters in The O.C.#Dennis .22Chilli.22 Childress|Chili]] as "Bizarro Seth", pointing out that he is the exact opposite of [[Seth Cohen]] in every way. 
* In the 1980s, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' lampooned [[NBC]] (its home network) in grey-and-white sketches depicting The Bizarro Network ("Here's a million dollars - Go make ''[[Supertrain]]''!")
*On the 2003 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon, in the episode "Turtles in Space - Part One", the Turtles walk pass a turtle sensei with four rat ninjas, one of whom says something in an alien language that's subtitled as "Cowabunga!" Michelangelo jokes by saying "Bizarro World".
*On Season 3 episode 4 of ''Robot Chicken'' titled Tapping of a Hero has a part in "Superheroes tonight where Bizarro (voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]) is seen dating [[Paris Hilton]]. He says, "Bizarro hate Paris, he hate Paris very little." Paris Hilton says, "Awww... isn't he the cutest." Bizarro continues, "Paris crotch smell very sweet. Paris vagina very tight."  There are a few seconds of silence and she finally understands what he meant.
* There is a fledgling literary movement calling itself Bizarro (see [[bizarro fiction]]) featuring a collection of authors (including [[Carlton Mellick III]], [[Chris Genoa]], Jeremy Robert Johnson, [[Kenji Siratori]] and [[Steve Aylett]]) and [[small press]]es (Eraserhead Press, Raw Dog Screaming Press, and Afterbirth Books) who specialize in weird, offbeat [[fiction]].
* [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (comic book series)|Sandman]]'' comic used the Bizarro concept (although using the name '''Weirdzo''') as an important plot element; it was a comic book titled '''Hyperman''' read by the characters in the [[story arc]] ''[[The Sandman: A Game of You|A Game of You]]''.
* The comic strip ''[[This Modern World]]'' occasionally transforms into "This Bizarro World" in which all the characters are crude duplicates of our world and speak in a Bizarro-like manner. 
* [[Al Franken]]'s book ''[[Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations]]'' features a parody of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[politician]]s and other [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] personalities using "Bizarro speak" - in other words, saying the opposite of what they really mean. [[Newt Gingrich]], former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], is referred to as "Bizarro Newt".
* In an issue of [[Radioactive Man]], Radioactive man travels to a mysterious world where there are several clones of him with stone faces known by the name of "Strange-o's". Unlike Bizarro, their grammar is near perfect.
*''[[Cartoon Network Presents]]'' #12 featured a ''[[Peter Potamus]]'' story in which Peter and So-so pay an unexpected visit to Bizarro World. The story shows off opposite versions of various [[Hanna-Barbera]] characters and situations, such as [[Yogi Bear]] cleaning up [[Jellystone Park]] and refusing the picnic baskets that [[Ranger Smith]] steals for him, Mr. Peebles not wanting to sell [[Magilla Gorilla]], and [[Wally Gator]] wanting to stay in the zoo.
*In the Norwegian Comic strip [[M]], there are several strips featuring bizarromads from htrae. This twisted inverted version of the main character Mads loves to clean, speaks with weird grammar and reads the holy bible every night before going to sleep.
*A drawing in Gay Comics took the concept to this conclusion: same sex Superman and Lois Lane couples declare "Everyone am Gay in Bizarro world!"
*The band None more Black reference Bizarro in the song title "Bizarro Me". This however may be an indirect reference via [[Seinfeld]] as many other song titles on the album are Seinfeld references.  It may also be a reference to the [[Sealab 2021]] episode, since in that episode the word "bizarro" is repeatedly used as a euphemism for a multitude of sex acts.  At one point while they're sleeping together, Bizarro Deb says to Dr. Quinn, "Bizarro me in the bizarro."
*In the first [[Destroy All Humans!]] game, one of the G-men, when scanned, may say: "Bizarro... world... pretty."
