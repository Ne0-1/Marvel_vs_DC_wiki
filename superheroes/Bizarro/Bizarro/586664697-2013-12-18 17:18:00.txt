'''Bizarro''' is a super villain who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[George Papp]] as a "mirror image" of [[Superman]] and first appeared in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #68 (1958). Since then, various iterations of Bizarro have appeared in which he is often, but not always, portrayed as an antagonist to Superman.

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956 - c. 1970), the character has appeared in both [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s, and other DC Comics-related products such as [[animated]] and [[live-action]] [[television series]], [[trading card]]s, [[toy]]s, and [[video game]]s.

Bizarro was Ranked #25 on [[IGN]]'s List of 100 Top Comic Book Villains, and the term itself has entered the lexicon beyond [[pop culture]].<ref>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/guide-deceptions-word-games-obfuscations-officials-use-mislead-public-about-nsa</ref>

==Publication history==
Bizarro [[first appearance|debuted]] in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #68 (Oct. 1958), writer [[Otto Binder]] casting the character as a [[Frankenstein's monster]] [[pastiche]] that possessed all the powers of Superboy. Shunned for his grotesque appearance, the teen version of Bizarro only appeared in a single comic book story. An adult version, however, followed soon after, debuting in the [[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]] daily [[newspaper comic strip]], featured in Episode 105: "The Battle With Bizarro" (Strips 6147-6242 :Aug. 25, 1958 to Dec. 13, 1958). This storyline also introduced the strange speech patterns that became synonymous with the character, with all of Bizarro's comments meaning the opposite (''e.g.''. "bad" means "good"). The newspaper version also wore a "B" on his chest, as opposed to the distinctive "S".<ref>http://www.thespeedingbullet.com/</ref>

Writer of the strip, [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Alvin Schwartz]] stated:{{cquote|I was striving, you might say, for that mirror-image, that opposite. And out of a machine which would reveal the negative Superman, came the mirror image — always remembering that in a mirror everything is reversed... The times were such that one-dimensional characters, your standard superheroes, even in comics, seemed rather simplistic, like paper cut-outs. What was demanded was the full dimensional personality — a figure that carried a shadow, if you like. I was certainly inspired to some degree also by C.G. Jung's archetype of "the shadow" — and Bizarro certainly reflected that, as well.<ref name="ConroyMike">Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

Binder revised the character, this time wearing an "S" in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #254 (July 1959). Bizarro proved popular, and starred in the back-up feature in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' for fifteen issues, running from issue #285 - 299 (June 1961 - Aug. 1962). The character made forty appearances<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/whoswho.php</ref> in the Superman family of titles — ''[[Action Comics]]'', ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'', ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'', ''[[Adventure Comics]]'', ''[[Secret Society of Super Villains]]'', and ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' — from 1959 to 1984, prior to a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the DC Universe as a result of the limited series [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] #1 - 12 (April 1985 - March 1986).

Bizarro was reintroduced into the DC Universe in ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' #5 (Dec. 1986). An unrelated four-issue [[limited series]] titled ''[[A. Bizarro]]'' (July - Oct.) was published in 1999.

Yet another version was introduced during the "Emperor Joker" storyline in ''Action Comics'' #769 – 770 (Sep. - Oct. 2000), ''[[Superman (comic book)#The Adventures of Superman|Adventures of Superman]]'' #582 – 583 (Sep. - Oct. 2000), ''Superman'' #160 – 161 (Sep. - Oct. 2000), ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #104 – 105 (Sep. - Oct. 2000), and ''Superman: Emperor Joker'' #1 (Oct. 2000). Remaining in DC Comics continuity, Bizarro continued to make semi-regular guest appearances that firmly established the character as part of the Superman mythos. The character appeared in ''Action Comics'' #785 (Jan. 2002), ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1 (Oct. 2005), the [[Superman: Last Son]] storyline in  ''Action Comics'' 844-846 (Dec. 2006 - Feb. 2007), 851 (Aug. 2007), #855 - 857 (Oct. 2007 - Dec. 2007), Annual #11 (July 2008), and #873 (March 2009).

The character appeared in the limited series ''Rann/Thanagar Holy War'' #1 - 8 (July 2008 - Feb. 2009), ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #1 - 8 (May - Dec. 2009), and ''[[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]'' #1 - 7 (May - Nov. 2009). Bizarro also appeared in a chapter of the '' [[Blackest Night]]'' storyline in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #66 - 67 (Jan. - Feb. 2010).

==Biography==

===Pre-Crisis Bizarro===
[[General Zod|General Dru-Zod]] had originally created bizarro duplicates of himself to dominate the planet, [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. The bizarros had no power because they were not under a yellow sun, but they were soldiers ready to kill and die without hesitation. This was the reason why Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone for 25 Krypton sun-cycles (Phantom Zone #1).

Some 12 years later, totally oblivious to these facts, a scientist on the Earth is demonstrating his newly invented "duplicating ray" to [[Superman]], and an accident causes the ray to duplicate the superhero. The copy, quickly labeled "Bizarro", is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior. Shunned by the people of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], Bizarro befriends a blind girl, and loses all hope when he realizes that the girl didn't shun or flee from him, because she was blind. Superman is eventually forced to "kill" the [[doppelgänger|"less than perfect" clone]], using the remains of the duplicating machine, which acts like [[blue kryptonite]] (as opposed to [[green kryptonite]], Superman's weakness) on the copy.<ref>''Superboy'' (vol. 1) #68 (November 1958)</ref> The whole business proved unexpectedly easy as Bizarro deliberately destroyed himself by colliding with the duplicating machine's fragment. The ensuing explosion miraculously restores the girl's eyesight.

Years after this adventure, Superman's arch-foe [[Lex Luthor]] recreates the "duplicating ray" and uses it on the hero, hoping to control the duplicate.  The Bizarro that is created, however, is confused, stating: "Me not human... me not creature... me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don't belong in world of living people! Me don't know difference between right and wrong — good and evil!"<ref name="ConroyMike" /> Luthor is arrested by Bizarro for re-creating him, but forgotten as Bizarro attempts to emulate Superman, creating havoc in the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and almost exposing Superman's secret identity as [[Clark Kent]]. When Bizarro falls in love with reporter [[Lois Lane]], she uses the duplicating ray on herself to create a "Bizarro Lois", who is instantly attracted to Bizarro. The Bizarros leave Earth together, determined to find a home where they can be themselves.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #254-255 (July–August 1959)</ref>

Superman encounters the couple once again, discovering that Bizarro — now called Bizarro #1 —  has used a version of the duplication ray to create an entire world of Bizarros, who now reside on a cube-shaped planet called "Htrae" (Earth spelled backwards).<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #263-264 (April–May 1960)</ref> Bizarro #1 and Bizarro-Lois #1 also give birth to a child who while super-powered, appears to be totally human. Considered a freak by Bizarro standards (out of resentment for the way he was treated by earth humans, Bizarro #1 made a law that they must act the opposite of humans,causing no end of lunacy), the child is the catalyst for a brief war between Htrae and Earth.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #140 (October 1960)</ref> Blue Kryptonite is also invented during this war, as well as the -temporary- existence of Bizarro-Supergirl. Bizarro also has a series of adventures on Htrae, aiding a normal [[Jimmy Olsen]] when he is accidentally trapped on the Bizarro world,<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #287 (June 1961)</ref> preventing an invasion of blue kryptonite statues,<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #290 (November 1961)</ref> and stopping the Bizarro version of [[Titano]].<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #295 (April 1962)</ref>

Bizarro's influence is also felt on Earth: Jimmy Olsen is inadvertently turned into a Bizarro for a time,<ref>''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #80 (October 1964)</ref> and a new teen version of Bizarro travels to the 30th century, attempting to join the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. When rejected by the Legion, the Bizarro teen creates his own Bizarro version of the Legion, which Superboy eventually persuades him to disband.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #329 (February 1965)</ref>

When Bizarro encountered Superman once again, he had developed certain powers that were the opposite of Superman's (such as possessing freeze vision as opposed to heat vision and heat breath as opposed to freeze breath), and unsuccessfully attempts to once again kidnap Lois Lane.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #306 (December 1976)</ref> Bizarro also temporarily joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to battle the [[Justice League of America]] and [[Captain Comet]].<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains Special'' #1 (January 1977)</ref><ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #10 (October 1977)</ref>

Bizarro was seen going berserk in an imaginary 2-parter and, after destroying the Bizarro World,and its inhabitants, goes to Metropolis and, after wreaking havoc and mayhem there,commits suicide. This and many other deaths turn out to be the machinations of Mr. Mxylptlk who had begun a rampage of crime. Superman is unable to undo the deaths, but kills Mr. Mxylptlk and then uses gold kryptonite on himself.

Bizarro's final pre-Crisis appearance was in [[DCCP]] #99, which was also the final issue of that series. After being empowered by a hideously disfigured Phantom Zone sorceror, Mr. Mzylptlk destroys [[Zrfff]] and then causes the Bizarro world to implode, killing all its inhabitants. Bizarro's broken off head is caused to crash onto Clark Kent's desk and address Clark Kent before his simulated life ends. Bizarro does not appear in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], apparently because of this story's events.

This story directly contradicts a [[World's Finest Comics|World's Finest]] story where it is revealed that sometime in the future, Htrae is transformed into a more normal world (egg-shaped rather than cubical) by the radiation from an exploding celestial body. The Bizarroes are changed into normal non-powered people as well. Yet they still retained vestiges of their Bizarro laws (curtains hung outside the windows of a house, etc.)

===Post-Crisis===
After the events of [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Lex Luthor orders his scientific team to create a [[Human cloning|clone]] of Superman. However, wrongfully starting from the assumption that Superman is a human with metahuman abilities (his alien origin had not yet been discovered by Superman, let alone publicly revealed), the process results in a flawed copy, which Luthor dismissively refers to as "...this bizarre -- Oh, forget it", before ordering for the subject to be disposed of. The monstrous clone survives and, although mute and possessed of only limited intelligence and vague memories of Clark Kent's life, attempts to mimic Superman; he kidnaps Lois Lane and is finally destroyed when colliding with Superman in mid-air.<ref>''Man of Steel'' #5 (December 1986)</ref> Each time he exerted himself, the clone crumbled slightly, and, upon being exposed to this dust, Lois Lane's sister, blinded by a terrorist's acid, began to see again.The cure was completed when she was hit by a shower of the dust when Superman smashed the clone.
[[File:ActionComicsCvr785.jpg|thumb|185px|The new "Bizarro": cover of ''[[Action Comics]]'' #785 (Jan. 2002).<br>Art by [[Ed McGuinness]].]]

A 2nd Bizarro, able to speak and think better due to genetic engineering by Luthor prior to using the clone process, appeared in Superman #87 in a 5-issue substory in the clone plague story-arc. Before he died, this Bizarro seriously injured [[Happersen]], kidnapped Lois, created a ramshackle dummy version of Metropolis in a warehouse (to parody Superman's frequently having to rescue her, he deliberately exposed her to- and "rescued" her from-one lethal danger after another), abducted Lana Lang, proposed to Lois (presenting her with a ring, actually a stolen table display)and finally died in Luthor's labs (Superman #88). During this period, Superman also had to cope with an unending increase in his powers due to exposure to "purple kryptonite" in the climax of the [[Death of Superman]] and [[Reign of the Supermen]] story-arcs.

There was one other Bizarro created by Lex Luthor's clone process,by Lex Luthor's estranged wife. shortly after Superman regained his normal powers when he expended his electromagnetic ones . This Bizarro abducted Lex Luthor's baby daughter and intended to send her by rocket to another planet, emulating Kal-El's escape from Krypton. His pile of explosives and bombs -meant to launch the rocket-however, would have killed her instead, and Superman had to shield her when Bizarro threw the launch switch. Bizarro 2,already self-destructing from a genetic booby trap,encoded into him by his creator, perished in the terrific explosion.

The version of Bizarro currently depicted in DC's mainstream continuity possesses all the abilities of Superman but with a childlike mentality and method of speech. He is created by [[Batman]]'s arch-foe the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] when the villain steals the powers of the fifth-dimensional [[imp]] [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. Creating a twisted version of Earth called "Jokerworld" — a perfect cube with Joker's image on each facet — the villain designates Bizarro to be the planet's greatest hero and leader of a reimagined "JLA" (the "Joker's League of Anarchy"). When Mxyzptlk regains his powers, the imp allows Bizarro and several other beings to remain on the restored Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #769–770 (September–October 2000)</ref><ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #582–583 (September–October 2000)</ref><ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #160–161 (September–October 2000)</ref><ref>''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #104–105 (September–October 2000)</ref><ref>''Superman: Emperor Joker'' #1 (October 2000)</ref>

Bizarro suffers a setback when captured by the [[Pokolistan]]ian dictator [[General Zod#Russian Zod|General Zod]]. Zod beats and tortures Bizarro, apparently simply because the creature resembles Superman. The hero rescues Bizarro, and to help him adjust to the normal Earth rebuilds Bizarro's "Graveyard of Solitude" (the opposite of Superman's [[Fortress of Solitude]]).<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #785 (January 2002)</ref> During the [[Infinite Crisis]], Bizarro is tricked into joining the reformed [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] by [[Wally West|Flash]]'s foe [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], and during a battle with superteam the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] accidentally kills the [[Human Bomb]], constantly hitting the hero to observe the flashes of light that are produced from the kinetic energy of the blows.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1 (October 2005)</ref>

Bizarro becomes involved when Kryptonian criminals led by [[General Zod]] escape to Earth,<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #844-846 (December 2006-February 2007)</ref> but wishing to create a home for himself, Bizarro travels into deep space to a solar system occupied by a blue sun. After creating a [[Bizarro World|cube shaped planet]], filled with abstract versions of various buildings and locations on Earth, Bizarro is still lonely. The blue sun, however, gives Bizarro a new ability called "Bizarro Vision", which allows him to create new Bizarros. When this fails, Bizarro kidnaps [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan Kent]], Superman's adopted father on Earth. Superman rescues his father and helps Bizarro become his world's greatest hero.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #855-857 (October–December 2007)</ref>

Bizarro eventually appears on the planet Throneworld, befriending and aiding Earth hero [[Adam Strange]] and allies [[Starman (comics)#Prince Gavyn|Prince Gavyn]], [[Captain Comet]], and the [[Weird (comics)|Weird]]. Together they participate in the war between alien worlds [[Rann]] and [[Thanagar]],<ref>''Rann/Thanagar Holy War'' #1-8 (July 2008-February 2009)</ref> and against villains [[Lady Styx]] and Synnar.<ref>''Strange Adventures'' #1-8 (May–December 2009)</ref> Bizarro eventually visits the grave of a deceased Jonathan Kent, and is then sent (by rogue Kryptonians) with other Superman foes to the inter-dimensional prison, the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #682 (January 2009)</ref>

Bizarro has a series of encounters with former Secret Society ally [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]],<ref>''Solomon Grundy'' #1-8 (May–November 2009)</ref> and during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Bizarro confronts the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] version of Grundy. Bizarro eventually destroys Grundy by driving him into the heart of the Sun.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #66-67 (January–February 2010)</ref>

Later, while investigating an object that crashes into a Metropolis park and leaves a massive crystallized crater in its center, [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]] and [[Gangbuster]] discover a Bizarro-like creature that resembles Supergirl.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #53 (June 2010)</ref> The Bizarro Supergirl takes the heroes hostage, but is ultimately defeated in battle by the real Supergirl.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #54 (July 2010)</ref> It is revealed that the Bizarro Supergirl is a refugee from the cube-shaped Bizarro World, and was sent to Earth by her cousin after their planet was attacked by a being known as the Godship. Dr. Light attempts to take the Bizarro Supergirl to S.T.A.R. Labs, only to be violently knocked unconscious by Supergirl, who then absconds with her doppelganger and her ship, hoping to stop the Godship and save Bizarro World.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #55 (August 2010)</ref> After taking Bizarro Supergirl back to Bizarro World, Bizarro Superman is reunited with Bizarro Supergirl.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #56 (September 2010)</ref>

===The New 52===
In "[[The New 52]]" (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Bizarro is seen in the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline. As a part of "Villains Month" in ''Superman'' 23.1, or ''Bizarro'' #1, Lex Luthor attempted to splice Superman's DNA with human DNA and decides to inject it into a teenage test subject named Bobby in order to create his personal army of Supermans. Instead, Bobby is transformed into a hulking white-skinned monster with cryonic vision, incendiary breath, and immunity to Kryptonite. Deducing his weakness, Lex kills him with concentrated solar radiation that over saturates the Kryptonian cells causing him to explode. Lex then takes samples of the creature to continue his experiment. This time, Lex Luthor tries to clone a purely Kryptonian body. Five years later, a capsule labeled B-0 is shown.<ref>''Superman'' vol. 3 #23.1</ref> After the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] takes over the world, Luthor releases his new clone. Though his transformation has not yet been completed (Luthor comments it needed another five years), he kills a security guard on Luthor's orders. Luthor is pleased and uses Bizarro in his plan to take the Syndicate down.<ref>"Forever Evil" #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{main|Powers and abilities of Superman}}
Bizarro is depicted as having all the abilities of Superman, although in some incarnations several of these traits have been reversed, such as
* "freeze vision" instead of heat vision
* "flame breath" instead of freeze breath
* "vacuum breath" instead of super breath
* "Bizarro telescopic vision" which allows Bizarro to see a "short distance behind his head" rather than a "long distance in front of his head"
* "Bizarro microscopic vision" which makes objects "actually smaller to everyone" rather than merely "appear to be bigger to only the user" 
* "Bizarro X-ray vision" which allows Bizarro to "only see through lead" rather than the ability to "see through anything except lead"

This also applies to weaknesses, as Bizarro is vulnerable to [[blue kryptonite]], as opposed to [[green kryptonite]], which is lethal to Superman.
Bizarro is actually strengthened by [[green kryptonite]] as opposed to [[blue kryptonite]].

==Other versions==
The limited series ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' (Jan. 2006 - Oct. 2008) features Bizarro clones from an alternate universe called the "Underverse". They can "infect" a normal human and change them into a Bizarro clone by touch.<ref>''All Star Superman'' #2</ref> One of these creatures is called "Zibarro" and is unique in that he has the mental capacity of a normal human.<ref>''All Star Superman'' #7-8</ref>

In the 2004 graphic novel, [[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity mini-series]], by [[Matt Wagner]], Bizarro is a genetic clone of Superman that is the result of Luthorcorp's "Project Replica". The creature was then sealed away in the frozen wasteland of [[Antarctica]], encased within ice, until it was released by [[Ra's Al Ghul]], who used him as a pawn in his plan to use nuclear warheads to decimate Gotham as well as destroy a cluster of communication satellites, causing a major communications blackout, the end goal of his mission being to incite chaos and purge the Earth of the "cancer" that is civilization. Bizarro loses his hand and is thrown into a [[volcano]] and is presumably deceased, however, his hand is turned into [[red kryptonite]] at the bottom of the ocean.<ref>''Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity'' #1-3</ref>

Several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] versions of the character exist: the Silver Age Bizarro appears in ''[[Justice (comics)|Justice]]'' as a member of the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]];<ref>''Justice'' #4</ref> one-shot ''[[The Superman Monster]]'' (1999), essentially a [[Frankenstein]] [[pastiche]] features a monstrous copy of Bizarro created by a Viktor Luthor;<ref>''The Superman Monster'' #1</ref> one-shot ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' (2004) features a "Superman 2" created by genius Lex Luthor for the [[United States]] to stop the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-based Superman;<ref>''Superman: Red Son'' #1</ref> and Lex Luthor creates Bizarro-like duplicates called "Liberators" in the limited series ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' (1998).<ref>''JLA: The Nail'' #3</ref>

The 2002 graphic novel ''Bizarro Comics'' is an anthology of short comics by artists of the independent scene handling various DC Comics characters in [[humoristic]] tales set outside of any continuity. All the stories are bookended by ''Bizarro Wars'', a comic written by Chris Duffy with art by Stephen DeStefano in which [[Mxyzptlk]] seeks the aid of Superman to save the fifth dimension from a cosmic conqueror named "A", but ends up with Bizarro (here introduced as a new character that neither Superman nor Mxyzptlk formerly knew of) instead. The other comics in the volume (including one short story by Bizarro creator Alvin Schwartz) are presented as creations of the deranged mind of Bizarro himself.<ref>[http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/graphic_novels/?gn=3765 The "Bizarro Comics" anthology at dccomics.com]</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Bizarro appears in the ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', voiced by [[William Callaway]]. He is seen as a member of the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]] as an unambiguous villain. In one story he shows knowledge of how to construct a Growth Ray that makes someone 100 feet tall.

* Bizarro appears in the 1980 ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]''. In "The Revenge of Doom," Bizarro is seen with the Legion of Doom when they get back together. In two other episodes, Bizarro is a lone villain.

* Bizarro appears in the ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' episode "The Bizarro Super Powers Team" voiced by [[Danny Dark]]. This version is a more faithful adaptation from the comics as a well meaning bumbler.

* Bizarro appears in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' series, played by Barry Meyers, and is the traditional version of the character, complete with angular white features.

* A clone of Superman analogous to Bizarro appears in ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'' played by [[Dean Cain]] in the episode "Vatman". Created by Lex Luthor for the purpose of replacing Superman, the clone does not have Bizarro's distinctive appearance, and is visually indistinguishable from Superman, as well as possessing all the usual powers and weaknesses of Superman. Although he does not speak backwards, he does appear childlike and slightly simple-minded, and Lois refers to him at one point as seeming "bizarre".

* Bizarro later appears in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Tim Daly]] (who also voiced the title character). Unlike other versions, his S-shield is not reversed. His origin is the same as the Post-Crisis Bizarro from the comics, and his appearance, along with the typical traits, also bears resemblance to [[Frankenstein's monster]]. Homage is paid to his angular featured design in the first few seconds of his arrival. He is kindhearted and childlike, and although he has trouble distinguishing good, evil or harm, he wishes to protect innocents in the same way as Superman.

* Bizarro appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Ultimatum" voiced by [[George Newbern]]. He is attracted to [[Giganta]] and fights [[Wonder Woman]] for her when they try to break [[Gorilla Grodd]] from prison. Later on, Bizarro starts to both speak and comprehend things backwards, a nod to the comic version. In later episodes, Bizarro appears as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Legion of Doom. Noticeably, Bizarro is seen sporting a scar across his forehead indicating Bizarro's mind was altered so that he did anything Luthor commanded, as in backwards logic.

[[File:Bzro.JPG|185px|thumb|[[Tom Welling]] as Bizarro in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.]]
* A villain nicknamed Bizarro appears in ''[[Smallville]]'', played by [[Tom Welling]] and introduced in the Season 6 finale, "Phantom". This version differs significantly from other renditions of the character and is presented as the result of a Kryptonian experiment (similar to [[Davis Bloome|Davis Bloome/Doomsday]]) who - upon being deemed unfit for society - was turned into a [[Ghost|wraith]] and imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]], remaining there until Clark accidentally released him. In his subsequent search for a Kryptonian - from whom he could siphon a portion of DNA and create a host body for himself - he took possession of several unwilling human hosts, all of whom each died within 24 hours from the time of possession. Once Bizarro finds Clark and successfully clones his body, it is revealed that his strengths and weaknesses are the opposite of Clark's, drawing power from kryptonite but being weakened by sunlight, which turns Bizarro's skin into a jagged stone-like substance. Bizarro eventually attempts to replace Clark - who was imprisoned in the Fortress of Solitude at the time - and live his life, even falling in love with Lana himself, but his plans are thwarted when the [[Martian Manhunter]] traps him on Mars. He returns some time later in the episode "Gemini", and continues to carry on his prior plans without arousing suspicion from Clark's friends. Clark returns in the episode "Persona" - having been released to deal with his duplicate - and finds that the phantom's true weakness is Blue Kryptonite; continuing Bizarro's inverted ability to process external energy, while blue kryptonite strips Clark of his superhuman strength upon contact, contact with it elevates Bizarro's powers to such an extreme degree that he explodes, compared to the results of attempting to power a lightbulb with a nuclear reactor. In the final confrontation, Lana managed to lower Bizarro's guard long enough to place the Blue Kryptonite in his hands, resulting in Bizarro being imbued with so much power that his body self-destructed.

* In an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', Bizarro is portrayed as [[Paris Hilton]]'s boyfriend using his Bizarro speech to insult Paris in what on the surface appears to be a compliment. In another episode, [[Superman]] states that Bizarro "looks like someone threw up in an ice cube tray," and makes an additional, more vulgar comparison to Kryptonite as he, Flash and Wonder Woman are comparing 'reverse villains'.

* In the second season episode of ''[[Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu]]'', "Double Trouble", Lord Garmadon creates replicas of the original four ninja to that are referred to as "Bizarro Ninjas" in closed captioning.
