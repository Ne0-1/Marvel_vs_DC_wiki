'''Bizarro''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[doppelgänger]] of [[DC Comics]]’ [[Superman]]. Created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[George Papp]], he first appeared in ''[[Superboy]]'' #68 ([[1958#Octover|October 1958]]).

Due to a somewhat disjointed [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], several versions of Bizarro have appeared in DC [[comic book]]s, all of them inversions of Superman with gray or chalk-white skin, a twisted sense of logic and a resultant speech pattern ("Me am going to kill you" would mean "I will save you" in Bizarro speech).  Due to his imperfections, Bizarro is frequently a foe of Superman, but sometimes finds himself in the role of hero (In this case, an [[anti-hero]]).

The original Bizarro was created when Superman was exposed to a "duplicate ray."  In accordance with the outlandish [[science fiction]] concepts of Superman stories of the era, Bizarro relocated to "the Bizarro world," a square planet called [[Htrae]] which operated under "Bizarro logic" (it was a crime to do anything good or right) and which Bizarro populated with inverted versions of Superman’s [[Superman supporting characters|supporting cast]] and other DC heroes.

The [[1986]] event ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[reboot (continuity)|rewrote]] DC’s continuity, eliminating Htrae.  Since then, two Bizarro characters have appeared, one of them a flawed clone created by [[Lex Luthor]].  The second, longer lasting Bizarro, was an idea of the [[Batman]] [[supervillain|villain]] [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], brought to life by the cosmic [[trickster]] [[Mister Mxyzptlk]].

Although some fans find him irritating, Bizarro has been a consistent enemy of Superman since his first appearance.  Faithful adaptations of Bizarro appeared in the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' and series in the subsequent [[DC animated universe]].  Also, doppelgängers of Superman with some attributes of Bizarro appeared in live action adaptations.

Bizarro and the Bizarro World have become somewhat well-known in popular culture and the term Bizarro is used as to describe anything that utilizes twisted logic or that is the opposite of something else.

==Pre-Crisis Bizarro==
[[Image:Superboy68.png|Cover to ''Superboy'' #68 (October 1958), the first appearance of Bizarro.  Art by Curt Swan.|thumb]]
The original Bizarro was created in a laboratory accident.  A scientist was demonstrating his newly invented "duplicating ray" to [[Superboy]], testing it on a [[radium]] pellet and a jewel.  However, the duplicated radium was non-radioactive and the jewel melted.  The scientist then stumbled and knocked the machine, inadvertently creating an imperfect Superboy.  Although the scientist insisted the duplicate was not alive, it nonetheless escaped from the lab.  Although Bizarro wanted to be accepted, his appearance and erratic behavior scared people, especially as he had no idea of his own super-strength.  He was befriended by a blind girl, shortly before Superboy realized the remains of the machine would act as Kryptonite to him.  Bizarro headed straight towards Superboy, having somehow realized that the shockwave from his destruction would cure his friend's blindness.

The later Bizarro was created by [[Lex Luthor]], who used the "duplicating ray" on the adult Superman and hoped to use the duplicate to attack Superman.  However, this Bizarro did not cooperate and instead tried to emulate Superman.  Unfortunately, his attempts to match the original's heroics were clumsy and destructive, and he kidnapped Lois.  This was resolved when Lois created a Bizarro-Lois for Bizarro using the "duplication ray".  Feeling rejected by the people of Earth, they moved to the world of Htrae, which had ancient advanced technology which was used to populate the planet with other Bizarros created in the same manner.  Almost everyone on Htrae looked like an ugly Superman (and possessed super powers) or an ugly [[Lois Lane]].  On Superman's first visit to Htrae in ''[[Action Comics|Action Comics #264]]'' (May 1960), he was arrested for being normal, but he plea-bargained a proposal to change the shape of the world into a cube (thereby making it imperfect) for his release.

Bizarro's only weakness was blue [[Kryptonite]], created by using the same machine to duplicate green Kryptonite.  Though Bizarro acts in what he believes to be the best manner, his Bizarro logic often causes him to act for evil.

Originally Bizarro's abilities were the same as Superman's but he was hit by a meteorite which reversed his powers: flame breath, ice vision, microscopic vision that actually increased the size of things, X-ray vision that could only see through lead, etc.  Superman had to deal with these new powers in ''Superman'' (1st series) #333 (1979) when Bizarro says he is going to save Lois Lane (meaning in Bizarro logic, he is going to kill her).

===Appearance===
Bizarro has chalky and sometimes rock-like skin, a pale complexion, and a misshapen face.  In addition, his version of Superman's famous S-shield is usually backwards.  Bizarro wears a medallion that says "Bizarro #1", in order to distinguish himself from the other  Bizarros on Htrae.

===The Bizarro World===
[[Image:Bizarroworld.PNG|250px|"Bizarro World". Art by Wayne Boring.|thumb]]
{{main|Bizarro World}}
In the Bizarro world, a cube-shaped planet known as "Htrae" (Earth spelled backward), society is ruled by the Bizarro Code, which states that it is a crime to do anything well or to make anything perfect or beautiful.  In one episode, for example, a salesman is doing a brisk trade selling "Bizarro bonds. Guaranteed to lose money for you."  Later in this episode, the mayor appoints Bizarro #1 to investigate a crime, "Because you are stupider than the entire Bizarro police force put together."  This is intended and taken as a great compliment.

Later stories introduced Bizarro versions of Superman's supporting cast, including Bizarro-[[Perry White]] and Bizarro-[[Jimmy Olsen]], created by using the duplicator ray on characters other than Superman and Lois Lane, as well as the children of Bizarro and Bizarro Lois.  There was even a Bizarro-[[Justice League]] and [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

"Tales of the Bizarro World" became a recurring segment in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' from 1961 to 1962.

On one occasion, [[Keith Giffen]] portrayed Htrae itself as being ''sentient'' - "Me am the Bizarro World.  Planet Earth not think... therefore, me do" - and its only sane inhabitant was the Bizarro [[Ambush Bug]].

In the new comic books, Bizarro lives in a Metropolis graveyard he calls "The Graveyard of Solitude."

===Linguistics===
Bizarro and the other inhabitants of the Bizarro world used an odd but predictable form of English.  The most notable characteristics were:
* The lack of [[nominative case]] when using pronouns; Bizarro replaces pronouns that should be nominative with their analogues in the [[accusative case]].  Bizarro might introduce himself by saying "Me am Bizarro" instead of "I am Bizarro," for example.
* The lack of proper [[Grammatical conjugation|verb conjugation]]; Bizarro only uses the [[first person]] conjugation for any verb.  For example, the verb [[to be]] is always conjugated as "am", leading to sentences like "This am great".
* Speaking the opposite of what is really meant in a situation.  Thus, "This am great" would mean that the thing '''isn't''' great at all.  The exception would be "Me am Bizarro", which would actually mean what was said.

===Death===

In ''Superman'' #423 & ''Action Comics'' #583,  [[Alan Moore]] wrote [[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|the final Superman]] story for the Pre-Crisis era (though subsequent writers have retconned it into being an alternate reality).  In the beginning of ''Superman'' #423, Superman had his final encounter with Bizarro, who had gone on a killing spree.

Superman had been off the Earth, doing research for the government.  When he returned, he found complete city blocks horribly destroyed, and was told Bizarro had gone berserk, smashing buildings and injuring innocent people.

Confronted by Superman, Bizarro told him, "This am part of genius Bizarro self-improvement plan."  Bizarro tells Superman that he had destroyed Bizarro world, as Krypton had been destroyed. 
[[Image:Bizarrodeath.PNG|The death of Bizarro.  Art from ''Superman'' #423 (Sept 1986), by Curt Swan.|thumb]]
<blockquote>
"Bizarro? Come on out and show yourself! I want an explanation for this!"<br />
"Ha! That easy! It am part of genius Bizarro self-improvement plan! See, me suddenly realize that me am not perfect imperfect duplicate! Maybe me not trying hard enough.  Example: when your planet Krypton blow up by accident, you am coming to Earth as baby... so me decide to blow up whole Bizarro world on purpose and come to Earth as adult!"<br />
"The Bizarro World? Blown up?!"<br />
"Th-that's right! Ha ha! Pretty imperfect, huh?"<br />
"Bizarro... what's happened to you? I can't believe you've really destroyed your homeworld!"<br />
"Ha! That am only the beginning! Next, me realize that Superman never kill, so me kill lots of people! Them very grateful! Scream with happiness!"<br />
"Killed people? Oh, merciful Rao..."<br />
"...But then me finally understand what me need to be perfect imperfect duplicate: it am little Blue Kryptonite meteor that me carry in lead case for good luck!"<br />
''Bizarro holds the Blue Kryptonite before him.''<br />
"See... you am alive Superman... and if me am perfect imperfect duplicate, then me have to be... h-have to be..."<br />
''Bizarro staggers and collapses to the floor.''<br />
"Bizarro!"<br />
"Uh... everything, him go d-dark... Hello, Superman.  Hello."<br />
''Bizarro dies.''
</blockquote>

Not much later, Superman's secret identity was exposed and all the members of his rogues gallery attempt to kill him and everyone associated with him.  Superman later discovers that [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] is the villain orchestrating the attacks, and was most likely also the one responsible for Bizarro's strange(r) behavior.

===Post-Crisis appearances of Pre-Crisis Bizarro===
Though Bizarro was destroyed in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], his character later to be reimagined and reintroduced, the original Bizarro was able to make a few appearances.  For instance:
* In [[Animal Man]]'s ''Deus Ex Machina'' storyline, [[Psycho Pirate]], while in [[Arkham Asylum]], recreates characters removed from continuity, exposing the [[fourth wall]] to the protagonist.  Bizarro appears as he did pre-Crisis.

==Post-Crisis Bizarro==

[[Image:Bizarrobyrne.png|The Lexcorp Bizarro. Art by John Byrne.|100px|thumb]]
===LexCorp Bizarros===

Bizarro World was erased from the history of the [[DC Universe]] during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].  Since then, two Bizarros have been created by [[Lex Luthor]].  However, in the post-Crisis version, the imperfections in the duplicates are eventually fatal.  The first Bizarro created Post-Crisis appeared in ''Man of Steel'' #5 (1986), and made several attempts to "be" Superman, including wearing a jacket and glasses over his costume, although leaving it visible.  He was apparently not capable of speech.  As his non-living matter was continually flaking off, he was destroyed when he and Superman smashed into each other (the flakes of his body restoring [[Lucy Lane]]'s vision, in homage to the original story). 

Luthor later recreated Bizarro to see if it would offer insight into how to stop the "Clone Plague".  This Bizarro escaped, and kidnapped Lois Lane, taking her to "Bizarro World"; a warehouse set up like a surreal version of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].  He subjected her to danger, so that he would be able to rescue her from it.  She managed to escape, and Bizarro was recaptured by Lexcorp, where it subsequently died.

These Bizarros were similar to the original in appearance and abilities, although the second was less angular.  While the first did not speak, the second had the speech patterns of the original.

===Emperor Joker===

The current version of Bizarro has a very different origin, having been created by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] by the use of the powers of [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]; his first appearance was in ''Superman'' (2nd series) #160, and he seems to be the longest lived Post-Crisis Bizarro yet.

Originally created as the greatest hero of a twisted world created by the Joker, Bizarro was one of a number of characters Mxyzptlk saved from that world.  He was subsequently captured by the Pokolistanian dictator [[General Zod#Russian Zod|General Zod]], who used to torture him, apparently just for the pleasure of beating someone who resembled Superman.

After escaping from Pokolistan with Superman's help, Bizarro recreated his Jokerworld headquarters, the Graveyard of Solitude, and at erratic intervals emerges to help or hinder Superman; the decision as to which being seemingly random, and the same amount of trouble caused either way.

====Appearance====
Unlike the original Bizarro, the "Emperor Joker" Bizarro is not chalky and angular.  Instead, he has a greyish skin-tone, red eyes, an overly muscular body, and a maniacal smile.  Bizarro has a purple and green uniform, and the logo on his chest is inverted, so the "S" is backwards.  The current Bizarro has a necklace that says "Bizarro #1" on it.

====Abilities====
Originally, this Bizarro's abilities were the same as Superman's, but in homage to his Pre-Crisis counterpart, this Bizarro also developed reversed powers as well as adding things like "x-ray hearing" and "spotlight vision."  Instead of possessing heat vision and cold breath like Superman, he has cold vision and flame breath, the latter recently shown in ''Batman/Superman'' #22 (Loeb, McCGuinness, Vines) He has also been discovered to be physically more powerful than Superman, but the nature of his fractured mind leaves him unable to access that potential.

Post-Crisis Bizarro has only encountered Blue Kryptonite on one occasion, when Batzarro presented him with a ring set with a stone of it (''Batman/Superman'' #25).  The ring caused Bizarro to speak normally and act rationally, as well as granting him a 12th level intellect. The effect seems to be the opposite of the expected outcome. Instead of killing this Bizarro, it has the imperfect effect of making him intelligent. Still, he feared the ring.  The ring appeared to have no effect on Batzarro since he is a [[Batman]] clone.

====Linguistics====
Post-Crisis Bizarro adopted all of the linguistic idiosyncrasies of his Pre-Crisis self, but also negated every possible word in the sentence.  Though the usage was slightly inconsistent, this usually included:
* Negating verbs.
* Replacing [[adjective]]s with their opposite.
* Replacing certain [[noun]]s with their opposite.
The ultimate end of this caused sentences to frequently have [[double negative|double]] and triple negatives.  Combined with the fact that Bizarro's logic is already flawed, this caused some of his dialogue to be very difficult to follow.

As of ''Action Comics'' #845, Bizarro has learned how to speak more normally by watching television for thirteen months. As a result, he no longer negates the meaning of every possible word in the sentence and now speaks almost exactly like his Pre-Crisis self.

===[[Batzarro]]===
A Bizarro version of Batman debuted in ''World's Finest Comics'' #156.  [[Jeph Loeb]] introduced a Bizarro-[[Batman]], [[Batzarro]], into the DC universe in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #20 (June 2005).  His origin is unknown, but his speech patterns are almost identical to those of Bizarro.  According to Bizarro, "Him no come from same place as Bizarro #1.  That am why we am so different."  This can be taken to mean that they come from the same place, which is why they are so similar.  Unfortunately, because of Bizarro's twisted logic and grammar, this may very well be incorrect.

===Bizarro's new attitude===
During the publication of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' [[limited series]], the majority of [[DC Comics]]' superhero line advanced one year. [[One Year Later|One year later]], Bizarro is a captive of [[Lex Luthor]] and has been watching television in a small room for thirteen months. As a result, he is much more angry, violent, and intimidating than before.

===Other Bizarro characters===
While the Superman-like Bizarro is the predominant one, anyone with milky-white or crystalline skin (depending on the artists' design) and who speaks with Bizarro's odd linguistic pattern can be considered to be ''a'' Bizarro in the [[DC Universe]]. 

In [[DC One Million]], for example, there are references to a future Bizarro epidemic where the condition spreads like zombism.  In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', the [[Justice League]] encounters Bizarro duplicates used as henchmen.

Many Bizarro duplicates would break down and disintegrate after enduring a relative amount of stress.  This was attributed to the imperfect nature of the duplication process, originally unable to deal with Superman's extraterrestrial nature.

A Bizarro-[[Superboy]] was created by [[Project Cadmus]], when they used Luthor's process in their attempts to [[Cloning|clone]] Superman.  It was also used to create a Bizarro-[[Harley Quinn]] after Bizarro developed a crush on Quinn.  Similar processes to Luthor's were used by [[Two-Face]] to create a Bizarro-[[Supergirl]] and [[Brainiac 5|Brainiac 5.1]] to create a post-Crisis Bizarro-Legion.  There was also a miniseries by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[M.D. Bright]], ''[[A. Bizarro]]'', about a Bizarro who was the duplicate of an ordinary man who happened to look like Superman.

In ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' the Superboy clone [[Match (DC Comics)|Match]] has been redesigned to resemble Bizarro.  Ironically, Match was initially introduced as an ''improved'' duplicate of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]].

In ''[[Superman Family]]'' a non-living duplicate of the Earth-Two [[Superman (Kal-L)|Superman]]'s villainous alter ego, the Flying Tiger, was created with similiar powers to his living template. This copy manifested a weakness to green kryptonite, unlike Bizarro's weakness to blue Kryptonite, and was phased out of existence by the same device that created him.

In May of 2005, a news website set during DC's [[52 (comics)|lost year]] reported that the [[Kentucky Derby]] had been won by a talking horse named Bizarabo, who won the race by running ''backwards''. The horse went on to give the website a quote: "Me hate carrots because they am so tasty".

===Elseworlds===
[[Image:RedSonBizarro.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bizarro from ''Superman: Red Son''.]]

In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' Bizarro was an imperfect clone of Superman created by Lex Luthor.  His costume resembled that of the "normal" Superman, but his monogram was a shield with "U.S." printed on it.  He had red hair and odd-looking skin with blisters and distended veins.  He sacrificed himself to save [[London]] from a nuclear missile.

In the [[Frankenstein]] pastiche, ''The Superman-Monster'', Viktor Luthor's Creature originally resembles Bizarro, although he sloughs off the chalky skin later in the story.

In [[Amalgam Comics]], one of [[Spider-Boy]]'s enemies in a Cadmus Project DNAlien called "Bizarnage", an amalgam of Bizarro and the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]] from ''[[Spider-Man]]''.  In ''Unlimited Access'' #4, [[Access (comics)|Access]] visits a number of alternate Amalgam Universes, one of which is a version of Bizarro World, inhabited by numerous imperfect [[Clone Saga|Spider-Clones]].

DC produced an [[anthology]], ''Bizarro Comics'', featuring offbeat and irreverent stories by alternative comics writers and artists featuring various [[DC Universe]] characters.  The anthology's chief conceit was that all of its contents (aside from the [[framing sequence]]) were created by Bizarro himself.  A second, conceptually similar, anthology entitled ''Bizarro World'' has been released.

==In Other Media==
[[Image:Bizarro2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bizarro from ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]''.]]

=== ''Super Friends'' ===

Bizarro's first non-comics appearance was in the animated series ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]].'' In this series, Bizarro was depicted almost as an outright villain, and part of the [[Legion of Doom]]; although the last season had a more faithful depiction as a well meaning bumbler. In the episode "The Bizarro Super Powers Team", he made Bizarro clones of [[Wonder Woman]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and even a Bizarro-Mxyzptlk who goes by the name Kltpzyxm.

[[Image:ClarkVsSuperman.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clark battles the evil Superman in ''[[Superman III]]''.]]

===''Superman III''===
In ''[[Superman III]]'', Superman is turned evil by a computer genius named [[Gus Gorman]], an associate to the villainous [[Ross Webster]].  Gorman discovers Superman's weakness to be Kryptonite, and attempts to synthesize it. Laced with tobacco tar as a substitute component, the resulting synthetic Kryptonite behaved like Red and Black Kryptonite, aside from the standard green coloring. Upon exposure, Superman slowly became evil and eventually split into two people. However, this [[evil Superman]] was not called Bizarro in the film nor possessed any of the linguistic problems attributed to his comic book counterpart. Despite being an equal match, Clark Kent managed to kill this evil incarnation at the climax to their junkyard brawl.

[[Image:NuclearMan1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The first Nuclear Man from ''[[Superman IV]]''.]]

===''Superman IV: The Quest For Peace''===
In scenes that were ultimately deleted from the original theatrical release of ''[[Superman IV: The Quest For Peace]]'', a being known as the [[Nuclear Man]] was created by [[Lex Luthor]] using a strand of Superman's hair. In terms of the film's continuity, this was the predecessor of the Nuclear Man that appeared in the final theatrical cut.  This first Nuclear Man had a somewhat inhuman appearance and spoke in a stilted manner similar to the speech pattern usually associated with Bizarro.  This Bizarro-like Nuclear Man did appear in the novelization and comic book adaptations of the film.  Warner Brothers has confirmed that this and other "lost" footage from ''Superman IV'' has been found, and may be included as "deleted scenes" in the 2006 DVD reissue of the film.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Human16.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Barry Meyers as Bizarro in ''The Adventures of [[Superboy (TV series)]]''.]] -->

=== ''Superboy'' ===

The only live-action appearances to date of the traditional Bizarro were in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' TV series which aired from 1988-1992. He was played by [[Barry Meyers]] and appeared in 7 episodes. The first two-part story featuring Bizarro, titled "Bizarro the Thing of Steel" (part one) and "The Battle with Bizarro" (part two), was based on the first Bizarro story from the comics. In this version, Bizarro was created when Superboy jumped in front of a duplicating machine created by Professor Peterson (played by [[George Chakiris]]) after it was struck and activated by a lightning bolt. Like in the comic, Bizarro was not truly a villain, but his backward ways of thinking led him to cause trouble and fight Superboy. This Bizarro was an unstable duplicate, meaning he would eventually spontaneously explode. Superboy and Professor Peterson attempted to "kill" the supposedly non-living being with green [[kryptonite]], but this attempt failed. They then duplicated a chunk of kryptonite with the machine and created white kryptonite, which instead of killing Bizarro, actually cured and stabilized him.  

In a later two-part story, entitled "Bride of Bizarro", Bizarro was manipulated by [[Lex Luthor]] into attempting to kill Superboy with the promise that Luthor would create a Bizarro female for him to love. Luthor eventually kidnapped Lana and created a Bizarro duplicate of her. This Bizarro-Lana prevented Bizarro from killing Superboy by convincing him that Luthor was an evil man.  

Later, in the two-part story "To Be Human" Bizarro-Lana exploded due to the inherent instability in Bizarro duplicates, sending Bizarro into a deep depression. Superboy took Bizarro to a research lab where a scientist found a way to make Bizarro human by transferring Superboy's brainwaves into him. The transfer cleared up Bizarro's confused mind, making him think like a human, and removed his powers. He was made into the image of the scientist's deceased son through skin grafts. But the transfer process left Superboy's mind clouded and weakened his powers and he was injured and taken captive by a villain called "Chaos", who planned to kill him by throwing him off the tallest building in the city. The only one who could save Superboy was Bizarro (now going by the name Bill Zarro). But to do so, he had to reverse the transfer process and become Bizarro again. He saved Superboy at the cost of his humanity.

=== ''Lois & Clark'' ===

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Superman vs Superman.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Superman confronts his Clone in an episode of ''[[Lois & Clark]]''.]] -->
In ''Vatman'' an episode of ''[[Lois & Clark]]'', [[Lex Luthor]] creates a clone of [[Superman]] which he intends to kill the real Man of Steel and replace him with a Superman he can control. Even though the clone appeared identical to Superman in appearance, also played by [[Dean Cain]], he clearly was the series version of Bizarro. The character was portrayed as immature and naive. In fact at one point [[Lois Lane]], starting to suspect that the clone was not the real Superman, referred to him as "bizarre".

=== ''Superman: The Animated Series'' ===

In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Bizarro is a combination of Pre-Crisis, Post-Crisis, and original material; he was voiced by [[Tim Daly]], who also provided [[Superman]]/[[Clark Kent]]'s voice. As seen in his first episode "Identity Crisis", Bizarro is a creation of Luthor's, although he was never intended to be what he became. Rather, Luthor wanted to make an exact Superman clone, one whose only difference was that he followed Lex's orders. He took samples of Superman's DNA (gathered from blood left from his Kryptonite-induced weakness during "A Little Piece of Home") and grew Superman clones, the first of which to be released looked and acted exactly like Superman, down to the do-gooding, yet he does not seem to be aware of his alter ego Clark Kent when he rescues the real Kent from falling off a cliff. The duplication breaks down, though, and Bizarro's form and costume changes (as angular as Pre-Crisis, but colored like Post-Crisis).  This version has washed-out colors on his costume with a deformed (but still forward) S-shield, pale skin, and his posture suggests that his limbs are twisted.  
[[Image:Superman-bizarroworld1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bizarro from ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]

Closer to the original Superboy character, or the post-Crisis Luthor-created Bizarros than the more familiar versions, Bizarro's logic does not follow a purposefully opposite pattern; his "Bizarro logic" is resultant of his atrophied Superman mindset. Instead of doing bad because Superman does good, Bizarro is distinctly trying to do good but can't understand what he sees. For example, he sees a bridge folding up to let in a boat and thinks the bridge is breaking, causing him to push it together again and seal it with heat vision, failing to recognize what the boat was doing there. Also, he tried to save an elderly woman from being run over by a bus by punching the bus, unaware that the bus contained passengers. Bizarro, as far as he knew, ''was'' Superman, so the appearance of the real Superman confused him, and he tried to maintain the idea within his own mind that he indeed was Superman with the real Superman being an imposter ("Me am Superman! Me am hero!"). This dissipated when he saw Superman saving Lois Lane; since he associated saving Lois with being Superman, he realized the truth and then, apparently sacrificed himself so that Superman and Lois could escape the explosion that destroyed the lab where he was created ("Me am not Superman.  You am Superman... Superman always save Lois...). Despite a few gags at his expense, the animated series attempted to portray Bizarro as a tragic figure - cursed with Superman's powers, fragmented parts of his mind, memories, feelings (such as the attraction to Lois) and even Superman's desire to use his powers to help people, but lacking the intelligence to do so properly. 

"Bizarro's World", his next episode, highlighted the next step in Bizarro's confusion. Now aware that he is not Superman, he wanders for months before accidentally stumbling on the [[Fortress of Solitude]], where the Fortress' computer mistakes him for Superman and tells him that he is Kal-El, explaining his Kryptonian heritage. Now with a new mistaken identity, Bizarro sets out to recreate Krypton in Metropolis, and then his faulty logic presumes that he needs to toss a missile at "Krypton" to destroy it again. Superman stops him, and gives him an alien moon which he can call home. Bizarro remains pleased with this until "Little Big Head Man", where [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] convinces Bizarro to attack Superman because he and his friends were supposedly making fun of him. This is a lie, of course, and at the end, a de-powered Mxyzptlk is stuck on Bizarro's moon as his "friend."

=== ''Justice League Unlimited'' ===
There seems to have been a change in Bizarro's mind by the time ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' rolls around, though, because in "Ultimatum" he returns, now in confused love with [[Giganta]] (even though she's just using him to break [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]] out of jail). He has also joined the [[Legion of Doom]] in the most recent season, now functioning under "Bizarro logic" as commanded by Luthor - Luthor says, "Superman is your best friend," and Bizarro immediately understands that he must kill him. The reason for this change in Bizarro's mindset is not explained in the episode, but producer Bruce Timm pointed out at [[Toon Zone]] that Bizarro is, in fact, a victim of brain surgery. He's been altered by Luthor specifically to do as he commands (coming full circle with Lex's original intention for Bizarro). The clue for this in the episodes where he appears is that Bizarro now has a big gray gash across his forehead - scarring from the operation.

=== Video games ===
Bizarro appeared in Superman 64 and Superman: Man of Steel as a supervillain.

Bizarro also appears as a villain and playable character in the [[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]] video game. Bizarro is only playable for a short period of time and during that time you have to cause as much damage that's indicated on the screen. But there is a cheat code found on the Superman Returns Two-Disc DVD which allows you to play as him for an unlimited period of time.

=="Bizarro" references==
'Bizarro ___' eventually became a popular term for a version of a character who, while not always evil, is unsettling or creepy to those who know the original version.
