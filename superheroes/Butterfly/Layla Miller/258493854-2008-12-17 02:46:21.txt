'''Layla Rose Miller''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She first appeared in ''[[House of M]]'' #4, and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Oliver Coipel]].  [[Peter David]] has developed the character, placing Layla at the center of the ensemble of mutant private detectives in his title ''[[X-Factor]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
===House of M===
{{main|House of M}}
Layla Miller is first seen as a young mutant girl who lives in [[Hell%27s_Kitchen%2C_Manhattan|Hell’s Kitchen]]. When she wakes up one morning, she finds [[House of M|everything has changed]] and is one of a small number of unaffected characters. Layla was instrumental in bringing down the "House of M" by using her ability to restore the memories of superheroes who rebelled and helped restore reality. Dr. Strange suggested that the Scarlet Witch had created Layla as a fail safe to help the heroes in case something went wrong. 

===Origin=== 
Contradicting [[Dr. Strange]]'s theory of her origin, Layla's life prior to the events of House of M has been described: she was a young mutant living in an orphanage where she was picked on by the other orphans. When asked, Layla has purported to understand how it is that she "knows stuff." However, she claims that if she were to tell anyone, she would be struck down and die on the spot. Since she has proven to be capable of manipulation, the veracity of her contention is in doubt.

===X-Factor Investigations===
{{main|X-Factor Investigations}}
After Layla joins X-Factor Investigations, she helps the other team members in various, indirect ways. When an operative of Singularity Investigations tries to murder Rictor, Layla electrocutes him. She then sends his body back to Singularity Investigations with a note that says stay out of Mutant Town. After being taken back to an abusive orphanage, Jamie makes an arrangement that allows her to return at X-Factor where she would be safe. When [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] arrives to inform Siryn that her father, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], has died, he pretends not to recognize Layla.

Layla has taken steps to deal with Singularity Investigations, a rival investigations firm. When X-Factor have their final showdown with Singularity Investigations, she helps uncover that [[Strong Guy|Guido]] has been brainwashed by them at some point in his past and rescuing a client. Jamie organizes all X-Factor members to see [[Doc Samson]] for psychiatric evaluations, they play chess and she reveals she is willing to make sacrifices for the greater good and that she is herself expendable.

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Marvel Civil War]], Quicksilver makes repeated attempts to enter X-Factor Investigations Headquarters. Each time, however, he is thwarted by Layla, who Quicksilver comes to consider his nemesis.

When the rest of the team are discussing their stance in the war, they eventually begin to talk about [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Later it comes to light that she knew the truth about why and how it happened leaving the other members distrustful of her.

===Silent War===
{{main|Silent War}}
When the Inhumans come looking for [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], Layla advises him that Black Bolt isn’t going to kill him during the confrontation and that he should take a small trip to the future to see the outcome of what happens to them. She and Jamie go to the meeting where she reveals to Jamie that she tried to kill Pietro but couldn’t because he escaped and that his actions are meant to happen.<ref>''Silent War'' #2</ref>

===X-Cell and Nicole===
A group made up of ex-mutants by the name of [[X-Cell]], who believes the government had depowered mutants, are hiding in Mutant Town. When Siryn and Monet return from [[France]] they bring an ex-mutant called Nicole, which shocks Layla because she didn’t know of her arrival. Layla visits Quicksilver who had restored most of X-Cell's powers. She reveals to [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] that it was he and Wanda Maximoff who caused the Decimation, the government did not depower them, and Pietro has lied. After a failed attempt on Layla's life, Nicole is tripped by Layla and falls in front of a train, destroying her.

Around this time she is also offered a place among [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Secret Warriors]] by [[Daisy Johnson]] but declines, claiming the mutants will need her more.  Daisy Johnson was recruiting 'Caterpillars,' children of non-mutant superhumans, which implies that at least one of Layla Miller's parents is a non-mutant superhuman.  This may explain why various kinds of mutant detecting technology have difficulty sensing her.  It also implies that at least [[Nick Fury]] is aware of her true origin.

===Messiah Complex===
{{main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
Layla goes with one of Jamie's dupes to investigate an alternate future caused by the birth of the mutant messiah. While there, they discover that the mutants are living in [[internment camps]]. They learn from a child version of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] that the mutant messiah had caused this world. Layla then proceeds to kill the dupe to send the information back to the original Jamie, leaving her alone and stranded in the future.

===Divided We Stand===
{{main|X-Men: Divided We Stand}}
Despite being trapped in an alternate future, Layla is still seen interacting with Jamie as a figment of his imagination. This figment serves as "stuff [Jamie] knows deep down", appearing in moments of self-realization, such as when Jamie admitted to himself that he knows about Siryn's pregnancy.

===The Summers Rebellion===
Layla eventually escapes the camp and helps a new mutant called Linqon. After revealing to some people of an operation called ''Operation Purity''; which involves people being tested for mutant genes. She goes to Atlantic City and meets up with Cyclops and his daughter [[Ruby Summers|Ruby]]. Together with Ruby, she initiates the '''Summers Rebellion'''.  The issue ends with Layla stating that, while she is unsure of the future, she is confident in her ability to "know stuff."

==Powers and abilities==
During House of M she had the ability to "awaken" heroes and make them remember their former lives. By making eye contact and exhibiting an unexplained power, Layla restored the memories of victims of a combination of Scarlet Witch's reality manipulation and Charles Xavier's telepathy. She has not exhibited this ability recently.

After M-Day, she purports to "know stuff": she exhibits an ability to see paths of causality to their ultimate conclusion, allowing her to alter events to prevent or cause certain occurrences. However, a few times she has encountered blind spots: her abilities did not enable her to discern that her teammate Strong Guy was brainwashed, the machinations of Singularity CEO Damian Tryp, or that Frenchwoman Nicole was actually a robot created by [[Isolationist (comics)|Josef Huber]].
