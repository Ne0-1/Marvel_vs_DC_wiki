'''Layla Rose Miller''', also known as '''Butterfly''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She first appeared in ''[[House of M]]'' #4, and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Oliver Coipel]].  [[Peter David]] has developed the character, placing Layla at the center of the ensemble of mutant private detectives in his title ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
===House of M===
{{Main|House of M}}
Layla Miller is first seen as a young mutant girl who lives in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell’s Kitchen]]. When she wakes up one morning, she finds [[House of M|everything has changed]] and is one of a small number of unaffected characters. Layla was instrumental in bringing down the "House of M" by using her ability to restore the memories of superheroes who rebelled and helped restore reality. Dr. Strange suggested that the Scarlet Witch had created Layla as a fail safe to help the heroes in case something went wrong. 

===Origin===
Contradicting [[Doctor Strange]]'s theory of her origin, Layla's life prior to the events of House of M has been described: she was a young mutant living in an orphanage where she was picked on by the other orphans. However, Layla was shown to have fabricated a large portion of her experiences at the orphanage in order to facilitate her entry into X-Factor Investigations<ref>''X-Factor v.3 #6''</ref>. The extent of what really occurred is unknown. When asked, Layla has purported to understand how it is that she "knows stuff." However, she claims that if she were to tell anyone, she would be struck down and die on the spot. Since she has proven to be capable of manipulation, the veracity of her contention is in doubt.

===X-Factor Investigations===
{{Main|X-Factor Investigations}}
After Layla joins X-Factor Investigations, she helps the other team members in various, indirect ways. When an operative of Singularity Investigations tries to murder Rictor, Layla electrocutes him. She then sends his body back to Singularity Investigations with a note that says stay out of Mutant Town. After being taken back to an abusive orphanage, Jamie makes an arrangement that allows her to return at X-Factor where she would be safe. When [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] arrives to inform Siryn that her father, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], has died, he pretends not to recognize Layla.

Layla has taken steps to deal with Singularity Investigations, a rival investigations firm. When X-Factor have their final showdown with Singularity Investigations, she helps uncover that [[Strong Guy|Guido]] has been brainwashed by them at some point in his past and rescuing a client. Jamie organizes all X-Factor members to see [[Doc Samson]] for psychiatric evaluations, they play chess and she reveals she is willing to make sacrifices for the greater good and that she is herself expendable.

===Civil War===
{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Marvel Civil War]], Quicksilver makes repeated attempts to enter X-Factor Investigations Headquarters. Each time, however, he is thwarted by Layla, who Quicksilver comes to consider his nemesis.

When the rest of the team are discussing their stance in the war, they eventually begin to talk about [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Later it comes to light that she knew the truth about why and how it happened leaving the other members distrustful of her.

===Silent War===
{{Main|Silent War}}
When the Inhumans come looking for [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], Layla advises him that Black Bolt isn’t going to kill him during the confrontation and that he should take a small trip to the future to see the outcome of what happens to them. She and Jamie go to the meeting where she reveals to Jamie that she tried to kill Pietro but couldn’t because he escaped and that his actions are meant to happen.<ref>''Silent War'' #2</ref>

===X-Cell and Nicole===
A group made up of ex-mutants by the name of [[X-Cell]], who believes the government had depowered mutants, are hiding in Mutant Town. When Siryn and Monet return from [[France]] they bring an ex-mutant called Nicole, which shocks Layla because she didn’t know of her arrival. Layla visits Quicksilver who had restored most of X-Cell's powers. She reveals to [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] that it was he and Wanda Maximoff who caused the Decimation, the government did not depower them, and Pietro has lied. After a failed attempt on Layla's life, Nicole is tripped by Layla and falls in front of a train, which destroys her, revealing she was actually a robot.

Around this time she is also offered a place among [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Secret Warriors]] by [[Daisy Johnson]] but declines, claiming the mutants will need her more.

===Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
Layla goes with one of Jamie's dupes to investigate an alternate future caused by the birth of the mutant messiah. While there, they discover that the mutants are living in [[internment camps]]. While in an internment camp, the mutant scanners alternate between detecting Layla as a mutant and detecting Layla as human. They learn from a child version of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] that the mutant messiah had caused this world. Layla then proceeds to kill the dupe to send the information back to the original Jamie, leaving her alone and stranded in the future.

===Divided We Stand===
{{Main|X-Men: Divided We Stand}}
Despite being trapped in an alternate future, Layla is still seen interacting with Jamie as a figment of his imagination. This figment serves as "stuff [Jamie] knows deep down", appearing in moments of self-realization, such as when Jamie admitted to himself that he knows about Siryn's pregnancy.

It is implied in Layla's final words in the story- 'but not the right stuff' (in response to Jamie's 'I'm Jamie Madrox. I know stuff.'), as well as her 8 days in a trance in the Layla Miller one-shot (after which she whispers the same lines she says to Jamie, 'One of us, One of us') that this 'figment' of Jamie's imagination is actually Layla contacting Jamie to give him some guidance.

===The Summers Rebellion===
Layla eventually escapes the camp and helps a new mutant called Linqon. After revealing to some people an operation called ''Operation Purity'', which involves every citizen being tested for mutant genes, she goes to Atlantic City and meets up with Cyclops and his daughter [[Ruby Summers|Ruby]]. Together with Ruby, she initiates the '''Summers Rebellion'''. Layla is last seen stating that, while she is unsure of the future, she is confident in her ability to "know stuff."

Layla finds a way back into the past but is now much older than she was before. She pretends to be a nun and works with John Maddox, a duplicate who settled down to raise a family. When she arrives at John's church, she finds Jamie about to kill himself. She stops him and reveals who she really is, much to his shock.<ref>''X-Factor'' #40</ref> She reveals herself to be a holographic projection and takes Jamie into the alternate future.<ref>''X-Factor'' #41</ref> When Layla and Jaime return to the future, Jamie meets Ruby, who berates Layla for traveling back in time when warned not to.  The group is then attacked by Sentinels.

After Layla and Jamie argue about how they never came for one another, the two finally give into their emotions and share a kiss. Jamie is awkward about starting a relationship with Layla, feeling she is still a child, though Layla tells him she never really was.<ref>''X-Factor'' #43</ref>

Later, Layla, Jamie and Ruby go find a old, frail [[Doctor Doom]], requesting his help in time-travel.<ref>''X-Factor'' 44-45</ref> Doom reveals he has met Layla before and informs the trio about ''Doomlocks''. They are then attacked by sentinels and saved by [[Trevor Fitzroy]].<ref>''X-Factor'' 46</ref> They bring the frail Doom back to their stronghold in Atlantic City where she gets into an argument with Cyclops about bringing him with them and Trevor Fitzroy's future.<ref>''X-Factor'' 48</ref> Taking Doom to an old lab, he creates a Doomlock and turns on them, bringing forth Cortex, the rogue Madrox dupe. Cortex kills Trevor and Ruby asks Layla if she can bring him back. Layla reveals that her ability isn't to "know stuff" but to bring back the dead. However there are consequences to bringing back a human: the cost of their soul, conscience and morality. 

When the battle is over and Layla explains what her powers are to Jamie, they are teleported by a Doomlock back in time and Jamie ends up back with X-Factor while Layla is transported back to before she joined up at X-Factor Investigations. She ends up at the orphanage she lived at before M-Day and after talking with her younger self. She sets forth the motions that lead her to joining X-Factor by downloading all her knowledge into her younger version's brain which causes her to passout and give her the ability to "know stuff", Layla then gets up and walks away, contemplating what she did to herself.<ref>''X-Factor'' 50</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
During House of M she had the ability to "awaken" heroes and make them remember their former lives. By making eye contact and exhibiting an unexplained power, Layla restored the memories of victims of a combination of Scarlet Witch's reality manipulation and Charles Xavier's telepathy. She has not exhibited this ability since ''House of M''.

After M-Day, she purports to "know stuff": she claims to have the ability to see paths of causality to their ultimate conclusion, allowing her to alter events to prevent or cause certain occurrences. However, a few times she has encountered blind spots: her abilities did not enable her to discern that her teammate [[Strong Guy]] was brainwashed, the machinations of Singularity CEO [[Damian Tryp]], or that Frenchwoman Nicole was actually a robot created by [[Isolationist (comics)|Josef Huber]]. While trapped in the future, Layla also explains that "knowing stuff" does not mean knowing all that she would like to - for example, any information about how/if/when she would get back to her own time. This is explained in ''X-Factor'' #50 when the grown up Layla visits her younger self before she meets the team and uploads all her knowledge into her younger version's brain.  The sheer volume of knowledge is too much for a normal brain to take, and that causes several gaps in her knowledge.  Her precognition abilities were revealed to be a ploy to explain her knowledge of future events.

In actuality, Layla has the power to resurrect someone from the dead, however at the cost of their souls.  This is explained when she resurrects [[Trevor Fitzroy]] after being killed by Cortex, knowing the villain he'll become due to her bringing him back to life.<ref>''X-Factor'' #50</ref>

In the "Caterpillar Files" in the back of [[Secret Warriors]] #1, her power is listed as "[[causality]]".<ref>Secret Warriors #1</ref>
