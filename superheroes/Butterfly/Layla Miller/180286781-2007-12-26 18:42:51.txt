'''Layla Rose Miller''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She first appeared in ''[[House of M]]'' #4, and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Oliver Coipel]].  [[Peter David]] has developed the character, placing Layla at the center of the ensemble of mutant private detectives in his title ''X-Factor''.

==Fictional character biography==

===House of M===

Layla Miller is a young girl with precognitive powers. However, it was recently revealed that Layla is not a mutant.  When the [[Scarlet Witch]] warped reality and provided everyone with false memories of living in the new, mutant-dominant world, Layla was instrumental in bringing down the "[[House of M]]".  

Layla was one of a small number of unaffected characters, and she was able to restore other characters' memories, helping them rebel against the House and restore reality.  [[Dr. Strange]] suggested that the Scarlet Witch had created Layla as a failsafe to help the heroes in case something went wrong.<ref>''House of M'' #7</ref>

===X-Factor Investigations===
After the world is restored, Layla joins [[X-Factor Investigations]] and has knowledge of certain private matters and future events.  In her own words: "I'm Layla Miller.  I know stuff."  Contradicting Dr. Strange's theory of her origin, Layla's life prior to the events of [[House of M]] has been described: she was a young mutant living in an [[orphanage]]. At the close of [[House of M]], Layla lost her powers when the Scarlet Witch made her "no more mutants" statement,

When asked, Layla has purported to understand how it is that she "knows things."  However, she claims that if she were to tell anyone, she would be struck down and die on the spot.  Since she has proven to be capable of manipulation, the veracity of her contention is in doubt.

Layla can be seemingly emotionally detached in pushing events in a direction that she perceives as "right".  She has admitted that she had prior knowledge of the vicious attack [[Siryn]] would suffer, and appears to have withheld this information because she surmised that X-Factor's reluctant leader [[Jamie Madrox]] would respond forcefully, directing his efforts against the source of the assault.

Layla's mission is to make certain the members of the team never learn the truth about the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].  However, this mission is made obsolete when Siryn acquires the details of the House of M and Decimation from [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #8</ref>  Siryn learns that Quicksilver, who has settled in the same area of [[New York City]] in which X-Factor operates, coerced his sister into warping reality and creating the House of M.  

Layla refers to herself as Quicksilver's nemesis.  At the same time she works to steer events in certain directions guided by the "stuff" she knows, Quicksilver desires to reverse some of the effects of the Decimation, using abilities he has gained (by inhaling the mists from terrigen crystals he has stolen) to restore mutants' lost powers.  According to what Layla knows, Quicksilver's path is somehow dangerous in the grand scheme of things, and she believes the best thing for the world would be a future in which Quicksilver dies in an accident &mdash; a future which events beyond her control have rendered null and void.  

Layla has taken steps to deal with [[Singularity Investigations]], a rival firm determined to eliminate X-Factor Investigations by any means necessary. (Singularity arranged the vicious assault on Siryn).  Layla has provided cryptic, yet useful, advice to X-Factor members in their confrontations with Singularity, and set into motion the events that lead to the death of a Singularity operative who had broken in to X-Factor's base of operations.  (She then shipped the corpse, packed in bubblewrap, to Singularity's headquarters.)

Layla reveals to the [[X-Cell]] members, discontented former-mutants working with Quicksilver, that the Scarlet Witch caused the Decimation &mdash; the government did not de-power them, and Pietro has lied.

On several occasions, Layla has remarked that she and Jamie Madrox will eventually be married. Since Layla is his junior by at least a decade, this utterance causes Jamie repeated and considerable discomfort. This, however, may be a possible outcome for the two as Rahne Sinclair ([[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) revealed that she had seen a future in which she murders Layla and Jamie on their wedding night.

In ''X-Factor'' #22, Nicole, a young French orphan rescued by Siryn and Monet, attacks an unsuspecting Layla with a rock and leaves her for dead.  In the following issue, Quicksilver fishes her out of the lake: he views Layla as a nemesis whom he must defeat himself.

===Messiah Complex===

Layla was recently lost alongside a duplicate of Multiple Man while investigating an alternate timeline.

She and the Madrox "dupe" arrived 80 years in the future to find that the only mutants left were in [[internment camps]]. They learned that this was the result of a mutant/human war that had been started by a mutant. But since her ability to know "stuff" no longer seems to work in the future for an unknown reason, she is unable to "know" anything about the event and must find information using conventional ways, such as searching libraries.

==Powers and abilities==
During House of M she had the ability to "awaken" heroes and make them remember their former lives. By making eye contact and exhibiting an unexplained power, Layla restored the memories of victims of a combination of Scarlet Witch's reality manipulation and Charles Xavier's telepathy.  She has not exhibited this ability recently.

After M-Day, she exhibits an ability to see paths of causality to their ultimate conclusion, allowing her to alter events to prevent or cause certain occurrences.  However, a few times she has encountered blind spots: her abilities did not enable her to discern that her teammate [[Strong Guy]] was brainwashed, or the machinations of Singularity CEO [[Damian Tryp]].

After the destruction of Singularity Industries, [[Damian Tryp]] reveals to Layla that her very existence had foiled his plans and that she is a force of chaos like he is.  Tryp reveals that when he comes into conflict with Layla, terrible events occur as a result.  Following her encounter with Tryp, Layla appears genuinely shocked for the first time: the glass of milk she is pouring unexpectedly overflows, spilling onto the floor.

==Triva==
The numbers [[46664]] on Layla's shirt in X-Factor #25 are in reference to the [[46664 (concerts)|46664 AIDS charity concerts]].
