'''Layla Miller''' is a fictional comicbook character. She first appeared in ''[[House of M]]'' #3, and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Oliver Coipel]].

Layla Miller is a young [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] girl with the ability to restore the minds of others. She was instrumental in bringing down the ''House of M'', when the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s reality warp changed reality and gave everyone false memories of living in the new, mutant-dominant world. Layla was one of the only unaffected characters, and she was able to restore the others' minds, helping them rebel against the House and restore reality. In ''House of M'' #7, it is hinted by [[Doctor Strange]] that she was created by the [[Scarlet Witch]] to help the heroes in tracking her back.

Layla has recently been seen in the first of the new [[X-Factor Investigations]] comics. She desires to join the new team and seems to have knowledge on somewhat private events.
