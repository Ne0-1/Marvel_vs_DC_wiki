'''The Master of the World''' (real name '''Eshu''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. He was a [[caveman]] who was experimented on by a Plodex spacecraft for thousands of years, after which he gained different powers. His first appearance was in ''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 1) #2. He is the [[archnemesis]] of Alpha Flight, and one of the most recurring villains in that comic book.

==Fictional character biography==
Forty thousand years ago, a [[caveman]] warrior named Eshu was cast out of his tribe in what is now northern Asia. He wanders the Earth and is soon [[psionics|psionically]] called to the beacon of an [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[space ship|ship]].

The ship was owned by the [[Plodex]] race. After it crashed on the [[North Pole]], it sent out a message, to seek out the dominant life form on [[Earth]]. After an exhausting [[Travel|journey]], the hunter Eshu finds the ship and is captured upon entering it. For thousands of years Eshu was [[experiment]]ed on by the Plodex ship. The experiments were excruciating. He was dissected and reassembled, just to be dissected again. His intelligence increased over the years until his mind and body were developed to the peak of perfection. After some time he learned to tap into the ship's systems with his mind, which eventually enables him to take them all over. He finds he is actually unable to leave the ship. He sends out a signal to a member of the Plodex race called [[Marrina Smallwood|Marrina]]. She responds and brings the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]] with her to his starship base in the Arctic. By this time, Eshu is calling himself The Master of the World. He took Marrina captive, and revealed his origin. He was confronted by [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Invisible Woman]], and his starship exploded during the confrontation with Alpha Flight. His plans succeed and the Master is able to escape the ship by submarine.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #2-4</ref>

He was no longer bound to the alien ship and sought to be a conqueror, but in order to execute his plans for world domination, he would still need the ship's [[technology]]. Using his knowledge of the alien technologies, he gains control of Marrina and her Plodex Mate. The Master caused Marrina to revert to savagery, and captured Namor and Alpha Flight's [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]. The Master plotted to destroy the [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]]. His helmet was torn from his head by Puck, severely injuring him; the upper half of his head was severely scarred due to Puck's forcible removal of his helmet, which had been physically joined to his flesh. The Master's submarine exploded, thwarting his plans to dominate the world.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #15-16</ref>

It turned out that he escaped, and in order to preserve his body, entered a state of [[suspended animation]]. He was revived from that state by [[Llan the Sorcerer]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #78</ref> With the help of [[enzymes]] from the corpse of [[Scramble (comics)|Scramble, the Mixed Up Man]], the resulting mutagenic fluid rebuilds his body to a perfect human specimen.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #96</ref> His next plan was to take over the Canadian [[government]] with the alias Joshua Lord, because of the [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] that was triggered by the Super Power Registration Act. During that time The Master reforms [[Omega Flight]] to stop Alpha Flight from getting in his way. The Master finds [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]] entrapped in some sort of dimensional limbo. He returns him from the dead as The Antiguard, in order for The Guardian to kill Alpha Flight and his wife. However, The Guardian, with the help of his wife Heather Hudson, managed to break out of the Master's mental control. The Master seemingly kills himself to avoid prison.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

He returns, to cross paths with [[Heroes for Hire]] and the mercenary team headed by [[Silver Sable]]. One of his goals was to kill [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. This is because the mystical land of K'un Lun, which manifests where Iron Fist is, poses a threat to his plans. He again apparently kills himself,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} but his death was proven false again. He appears during the [[Kang Dynasty]] storyline, where Marrina is glimpsed inside a stasis tube in his laboratory. His alien technology is used in an attempt to protect the cities of the world, but this does not stop earth from being conquered.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The Master seemingly dies again, at the hands of [[Ms. Marvel|Warbird]], when she kills him so that the Avengers can use his weapons to help attack Kang's forces.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #48</ref> Although Warbird requested that she be tried for the Master's death, a tribunial headed by [[Captain America]] concluded that there would be no punishment, as Warbird was acting as a soldier during a time of war as well as an Avenger, and had simply taken the only available course of action at a time when timing was critical and no alternatives were available.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #55</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, it was revealed that Master of the World was behind the motives of the Unity Party which targeted Alpha Flight. When Alpha Flight had escaped from [[Department H]], he used his powers to have Vindicator and Department H assemble Alpha Strike (consisting of [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]], Ranark, a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], and a brainwashed [[Citadel (Marvel Comics)|Citadel]]) to spread the "Unity" program and take down Alpha Flight. He even introduces himself to a kidnapped Kyle Jinadu.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Master of the World is approximately 40,000 years old. After he was experimented on by the Plodex ship, he underwent the reconstruction of his entire body (except for his brain) by Plodex technology, granting him superhuman powers. The master has the [[agility]] beyond that of a normal human, which he gained after he altered his body. He has enhanced [[reflexes]], that were fast enough to slice [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] with a sword. His [[speed]] can reach 61- {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. His [[endurance|stamina]] is so high that he can sustain peak physical extertion for several hours before fatigue impairs performance. Also, his [[Superhuman strength|strength]] is enhanced, and he was able to break [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]'s arm by, after dodging Sasquatch's attack, grabbing it with both hands and breaking it. He is also a master of hand to hand combat, as he learned the techniques 40,000 years ago, retaining his knowledge of hand-to-hand combat from his days as a tribal warrior. He knows all human pressure points, which was shown when he knocked out Namor the Sub-Mariner with a single punch. The Master is virtually immortal, having lived for forty thousand years; although not invulnerable, he ages at a very slow rate. The Master was once mentally integrated with his Plodex starship base, so that he was physically unable to leave it until it was destroyed in a conflict with Alpha Flight. He then underwent further reconstruction of his entire body by a mutagenic fluid concocted from the remains of Scramble the Mixed-Up Man.

His suit also has many benefits, allowing him [[teleportation]] and [[flight]]. His helmet and battlesuit are composed of an unknown metal, including cybernetic [[mesh]] enabling the Master to control Plodex technology through mental commands. Devices within the Master’s helmet and battlesuit enable him to cast [[illusion]]s disguising his appearance. He is able to create a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] that can ward off attacks. Also, he is able to shoot energy blasts with his suit, and it enables him to disperse electromagnetism, which was shown when he was able to control Guardian I's suit. The Master designed this battlesuit using his knowledge of Plodex technology. He is self-educated in all recorded knowledge of Earth humanity up to the present, and of the alien Plodex (as of forty thousand years ago) through mental linkage with computers in the starship base. He has utilized various skycraft and underwater craft.
