==Fictional character history==
40000 years ago, a [[caveman]] named Eshu was cast out of his tribe. As he wandered around the [[Earth]], he was [[psionics|psionically]] called to a beacon of an [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[space ship|ship]], as well as many other [[being]]s and [[species]]. The ship was owned by the [[Plodex]] race, and after it crashed on the [[North Pole]], it sent out a message, to seek out the dominant life form on [[Earth]]. After an exhausting [[journey]], Eshu found the ship, and as he entered it, he was captured. For thousands of years Eshu was [[experiment]]ed on by the Plodex ship. The experiments were excruciating. He was dissected and reassembled, just to be dissected again. He became more and more [[intelligent]] over the years he was experimented on, and after some time learned to tap into the ship's systems with his mind, which eventually enabled him to take them all over. But he was unable to leave the ship. He sent out a signal to a member of the Plodex race named [[Marrina]], and she responded and brought the [[Alpha Flight]] with her. By this time, Eshu called himself The Master of the World. He made a plan to use Alpha Flight's Marrina as bait, as he knew something of Alpha Flight's potential. His plan succeeded, and he escaped the Plodex ship by a [[submarine]]. 

He was no longer bound to the alien ship, but in order to execute his plans for [[world domination]], he would still need the ship's [[technology]]. Using his knowledge of the alien technologies, he gained control of Marrina and her Plodex Mate. After he gained control of them, he wanted to dominate the world, but Alpha Flight's [[Puck]] and Marrina, assisted by [[Namor, the Sub-Mariner]], thwarted his plans, after what he disappeared for an amount of time. 
It turned out that he escaped, and in order to preserve his body, entered a state of [[suspended animation]]. He was revived from that state by [[Llan the Sorcerer]], and with the help of [[enzymes]] from the corpse of [[Scramble, the Mixed Up Man]], rebuilt his body to a perfect human specimen. His next plan was to take over the Canadian [[government]] with the alias Joshua Lord, because of the [[chaos]] that was trigerred by the Super Power Registration Act. During that time The Master reformed [[Omega Flight]] to stop Alpha Flight from getting in his way. The Master found [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]] entrapped in some sort of dimensional limbo. He returned him from the dead as The Antiguard, in order for The Guardian to kill Alpha Flight and his wife. However, The Guardian, with the help of his wife Heather Hudson, managed to break out of the Master's mental control, and it seemed that The Master destroyed himself to avoid going to prison. 

After his fake death, he crossed path with [[Heroes For Hire]]. He again apparently suicided himself, but it is very unlikely that his death is real.

==Powers and abilities==

The Master of the World is approximately 40,000 years old. After he was experimented on by the Plodex ship, he gained different powers. The master has the [[agility]] beyond that of a normal human, which he gained after he altered his body. He has enhanced [[reflexes]], that were fast enough to slice [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] with a sword. His [[speed]] can reach 61- 65 mph. His [[stamina]] is so high that he can sustain peak physical extertion for several hours before fatigue impairs performance. Also, his [[Superhuman strength|strength]] is enhanced, and he was able to break [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]'s arm by, after dodging Sasquatch's attack, grabbing it with both hands and breaking it. He is also a master of hand to hand combat, as he learned the techniques 40000 years ago. He knows all human pressure points, which was shown when he knocked out Namor the Sub-Mariner with a single punch. His suit also has many benefits, allowing him [[teleportation]] and [[flight]]. His helmet and battlesuit are composed of an unknown metal, including cybernetic [[mesh]] enabling the Master to control Plodex technology through mental commands. Devices within the Masterâ€™s helmet and battlesuit enable him to cast [[illusion]]s disguising his appearance. He is able to create a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] that can ward off attacks. Also, he is able to shoot energy blasts with his suit, and it enables him to disperse electromagnetism, which was shown when he was able to control Guardian I's suit.
