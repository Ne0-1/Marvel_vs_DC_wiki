'''The Master of the World''' (real name '''Eshu''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in publications from [[Marvel Comics]].  He was a [[caveman]] who was experimented on by a [[Plodex]] spacecraft for thousands of years, after which he gained different powers. His first appearance was in ''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 1) #2 He is the [[archnemesis]] of Alpha Flight, and one of the most recurring villains in that comic book.

==Fictional character biography==
Forty thousand years ago, a [[caveman]] named Eshu was cast out of his tribe. He wanders the Earth and is soon [[psionics|psionically]] called to a beacon of an [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[space ship|ship]].

The ship was owned by the [[Plodex]] race. After it crashed on the [[North Pole]], it sent out a message, to seek out the dominant life form on [[Earth]]. After an exhausting [[journey]], Eshu finds the ship and is captured upon entering it. For thousands of years Eshu was [[experiment]]ed on by the Plodex ship. The experiments were excruciating. He was dissected and reassembled, just to be dissected again. He became more and more [[intelligent]] over the years he was experimented on until his mind and body were developed to the peak of perfection, and after some time learned to tap into the ship's systems with his mind, which eventually enables him to take them all over. He finds he is actually unable to leave the ship. He sends out a signal to a member of the Plodex race called [[Marrina]]. She responds and brings the superhero team  [[Alpha Flight]] with her. By this time, Eshu is calling himself The Master of the World. His plans succeed and the Master is able to escape the ship by submarine.

He was no longer bound to the alien ship, but in order to execute his plans for [[world domination]], he would still need the ship's [[technology]]. Using his knowledge of the alien technologies, he gains control of Marrina and her Plodex Mate. Alpha Flight's [[Puck]] and Marrina, assisted by [[Namor, the Sub-Mariner]], thwarted his plans to dominate the world. The Master vanishes for a short time.

It turned out that he escaped, and in order to preserve his body, entered a state of [[suspended animation]]. He was revived from that state by [[Llan the Sorcerer]], and with the help of [[enzymes]] from the corpse of [[Scramble, the Mixed Up Man]], rebuilds his body to a perfect human specimen. His next plan was to take over the Canadian [[government]] with the alias Joshua Lord, because of the [[chaos]] that was trigerred by the Super Power Registration Act. During that time The Master reforms [[Omega Flight]] to stop Alpha Flight from getting in his way. The Master finds [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]] entrapped in some sort of dimensional limbo. He returns him from the dead as The Antiguard, in order for The Guardian to kill Alpha Flight and his wife. However, The Guardian, with the help of his wife Heather Hudson, managed to break out of the Master's mental control. The Master seemingly kills himself to avoid prison.

He returns, to cross paths [[Heroes For Hire]] and the mercenary team headed by [[Silver Sable]]. One of his goals was to kill [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. This is because the mystical land of K'un Lun, which manifests where Iron Fist is, poses a threat to his plans. He again apparently kills himself, but his death was proven false again. He appears during the [[Kang Dynasty]] storyline, where [[Marrina]] is glimpsed inside a stasis tube in his laboratory. His alien technology is used in an attempt to protect the cities of the world, but this does not stop earth from being conquered.

The Master dies again, seemingly, at the hands of [[Warbird (comics)|Warbird]]. But this death too, will not be permanent as [[Michael Oeming]] has confirmed the Master will be appearing in the new Omega Flight series beginning in 2007.

==Powers and abilities==

The Master of the World is approximately 40,000 years old. After he was experimented on by the Plodex ship, he gained different powers. The master has the [[agility]] beyond that of a normal human, which he gained after he altered his body. He has enhanced [[reflexes]], that were fast enough to slice [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] with a sword. His [[speed]] can reach 61- 65 mph. His [[stamina]] is so high that he can sustain peak physical extertion for several hours before fatigue impairs performance. Also, his [[Superhuman strength|strength]] is enhanced, and he was able to break [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]'s arm by, after dodging Sasquatch's attack, grabbing it with both hands and breaking it. He is also a master of hand to hand combat, as he learned the techniques 40,000 years ago. He knows all human pressure points, which was shown when he knocked out Namor the Sub-Mariner with a single punch. His suit also has many benefits, allowing him [[teleportation]] and [[flight]]. His helmet and battlesuit are composed of an unknown metal, including cybernetic [[mesh]] enabling the Master to control Plodex technology through mental commands. Devices within the Masterâ€™s helmet and battlesuit enable him to cast [[illusion]]s disguising his appearance. He is able to create a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] that can ward off attacks. Also, he is able to shoot energy blasts with his suit, and it enables him to disperse electromagnetism, which was shown when he was able to control Guardian I's suit.
