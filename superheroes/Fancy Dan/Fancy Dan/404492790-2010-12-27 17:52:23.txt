He states that Spider-Man's 'butt is too big' and is roundly mocked for looking at the man's butt. Dan is proven right when the true Spider-Man does show up several minutes later. The Enforcers decide to get revenge on The Bookie, capturing him. The Bookie's father calls Spider-Man for assistance, and he agrees to help.
