In a now alternate future timeline, '''Lord Chaos''' was the son of [[Donna Troy]] and her husband Terry Long. He was born with the full powers of a god and full awareness of them, which drove him mad. He instantly aged himself, killed his mother and he became the dictator Lord Chaos. Inspired by the legend of the original [[Titans (comics)|Titans]], a group of superpowered youths who called themselves the Team Titans travelled to the past to kill Donna before her child was born. Lord Chaos followed them to the past and was able to prevent the Team Titans from killing Donna and her son Robert Long was born. However, the Titans of Myth intervened at Donna's request, and stripped the baby and herself of their godlike powers. The Titans of Myth took Lord Chaos with them to make him learn humility.

As a result of the events of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], he may have ceased to exist.
