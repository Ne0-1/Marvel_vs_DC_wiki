Although the attempt fails and Black Bolt manages to defeat Ronan in personal combat, the Inhuman people choose to leave with the Kree and pursue a new future. This leaves Black Bolt and the Royal Family alone to fend for themselves.<ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1 - 3 (June - Aug. 2000) & #4 (Oct. 2000)</ref>

Interdimensional adventurers the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] also encounter an alternate universe version of Black Bolt.<ref>''Exiles'' #23 - 25 (May - June 2003)</ref> Black Bolt decides to attempt reintegration with Earth, and several younger Inhumans - recently exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]]s - explore Earth with mixed results, including at one stage the intervention of the Fantastic Four.

In the title ''[[New Avengers]]'',<ref>''New Avengers'' #7 (July 2005)</ref> Black Bolt is revealed to be a member of a superhero council called the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. Via a [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] of Marvel continuity the group form during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]<ref>''Avengers'' #88 - 97 (June 1971 - Mar. 1972)</ref> to deal with threats to Earth. During the [[Son of M]] storyline the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] steals a canister of Terrigen crystals from Attilan, with Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family attempting to retrieve it.<ref>Issue #6 (July 2006). ''Son of M'' #1 - 6 (Feb. - July 2006)</ref> 

Black Bolt also rejects the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] and refuses to become involved in the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Courtesy of the hero [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]], Black Bolt monitors the situation.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 – 7 (July 2006 – Jan. 2007)</ref>  In the limited series ''[[Silent War]]'', the [[United States armed forces|US military]] attacks the Inhumans to prevent them from retrieving the crystals. Believing the stolen crystals should be returned to Attilan, Black Bolt issues a warning to the [[United States]] concerning further acts of aggression, and eventually launches an offensive against the nation. Gorgon and other Inhumans are captured during the attack, which prompts Black Bolt to personally head a team to rescue his subjects and retrieve the crystals. While the mission is successful, Maximus takes advantage of the situation and overthrows and temporarily incarcerates Black Bolt.<ref>''Silent War'' # 1 - 6 (Jan. – Aug. 2007)</ref>

The Illuminati also collect the [[Infinity Gems]], and to prevent the abuse of power by the Titan [[Thanos]] and others, split the gems between themselves, vowing that they never be used in unison again. Black Bolt is given the '''Space''' gem.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #1 - 2 (Feb. - Mar. 2007); #3 (July 2007); #4 (Sep. 2007) & #5 (Jan. 2008)</ref>

The character apparently suffers a setback when brutally beaten by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], on an rampage during the [[World War Hulk]] storyline and seeking revenge on Black Bolt for his role in the Hulk's exile from Earth.<ref>Issue #1 (Aug. 2007) ''World War Hulk'' #1 - 5 (Aug. - Jan. 2008)</ref> During the events of the [[Secret Invasion]] limited series it is revealed that this was not in fact Black Bolt but rather a [[Skrull]], who is killed in battle by members of the Illuminati.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3 (Dec. 2008)</ref><ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5 (June 2007)</ref> The true Black Bolt is captured by the Skrulls, who intended to use his voice as a weapon of mass destruction.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #1 (Oct. 2008)</ref> The character is rescued when the heroes of Earth defeat the Skrull army and discover the location of their captured teammates.<ref>Issue #6 (Jan. 2009) ''Secret Invasion'' #1 - 6 (June 2008 - Jan. 2009)</ref>

Black Bolt, angered by the repercussions caused by the Skrull invasion, changes tactics and embarks on an aggressive campaign against all former persecutors of the Inhumans in the [[War of Kings]] limited series. At his command the Inhumans attack the Kree and overthrow Ronan the Accuser, with Black Bolt declaring himself supreme ruler of the Kree Empire. This is followed by a preemptive strike against the [[Shi'ar]] empire, now controlled by the usurper [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. Black Bolt intends to release the Terrigen Mist across the galaxy and end the war when, courtesy of the subsequent mutations, all are rendered equal, but the plan is stopped by Vulcan, with both characters apparently dying in an explosion.<ref>See ''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #1 - 5 (Nov. 2007 - Mar. 2008); ''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' #1 - 4 (Feb. - May 2009) & War of Kings #1 - 6 (May. - Oct. 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Via [[electron]] manipulation, Black Bolt can perform matter transformation, the controlled projection of energy as concussive blasts or force fields, broadcast jamming frequencies and achieve flight. The character can also channel power into a single devastating attack termed "The Master Blow". This act, however, leaves the character temporarily drained. 

Black Bolt's final and most prominent offensive weapon is his voice, as his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain. Speaking triggers a massive disturbance with a word capable of leveling a city.<ref>''Thor'' #148 (Jan. 1968)</ref> Due to the extreme danger posed by this power, the character has undergone rigorous mental training to prevent himself from uttering a sound, even in sleep. The fork-like antenna on Black Bolt's forehead allows more controlled use of his voice.
