'''Black Bolt''' ('''Blackagar Boltagon''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]] and king of the offshoot of humanity known as the [[Inhumans]]. Black Bolt was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #45. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Black Bolt''' is the son of two formerly pre-eminent Inhumans â€” Agon , head of the ruling Council of Genetics, and Rynda, director of the Prenatal Care Center. In accordance with Inhuman standard practice, Black Bolt is subjected to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]] while still an embryo. As an infant, he demonstrates the ability to manipulate energy, particularly the ability to generate quasi-sonic energy through his voice. To protect the community, Black Bolt is placed inside a sound-proofed chamber and given an energy-harnessing suit. Agon then tutors his son in how to control his powers, until permitted to re-enter society as a young man - having vowed never to speak. His younger brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] attacks Black Bolt upon his release from confinement, in an attempt to prove that Black Bolt cannot control his sonic powers.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #148 - 149</ref>

Only a month after being awarded his freedom, Black Bolt discovers Maximus in the process of making a pact with emissaries of the alien [[Kree]], the race whose genetic experiments first created the Inhumans. Black Bolt uses his powers to stop an escaping Kree vessel, but due to his inexperience miscalculates, causing it to crash and accidentally kill several members of the Council of Genetics - including his parents. These events drive Maximus insane.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #95 (flashback)</ref> Despite his guilt, Black Bolt reluctantly accepts rulership of the Inhumans, and together with his cousins [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], they form the Royal Family, with giant pet bulldog [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] completing their entourage. Black Bolt eventually marries his cousin Medusa <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual #18</ref> and they have a son called [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]].<ref>''The Inhumans'' Graphic Novel (1988)</ref>

Black Bolt is later driven from Attilan by Maximus' creation, the [[Trikon]], <ref>Revealed in ''Inhumans Special'' #1 (Apr. 1990)</ref> but later regains the throne and befriends the [[Fantastic Four]]. Maximus then traps Black Bolt within Attilan using a "negative zone" barrier. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #45 - 48</ref>, although Black Bolt manages to shatter the barrier, and leaves the Great Refuge to visit the outside world. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #59 - 61</ref>

Black Bolt has made several significant decisions in his time as ruler, the first one being when Triton was kidnapped by humans, when Triton escaped, Black Bolt decided to move Attilan. He relocated the Inhuman city of Attilan several times (from an island in the Atlantic to the Himalayas <ref>''What If'' vol. 1, #30</ref> to the Blue Area of the Moon <ref>''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #240</ref> to the raised city of [[Atlantis]]<ref>''Atlantis Rising'' #2 (1995)</ref> to the Himalayas again <ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 2, #12</ref> and even into outer space <ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1</ref> before returning to the Moon <ref>''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 3, #54</ref>), dismantling the Genetic Council's power <ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #2 (1993)</ref> and freeing the [[Alpha Primitives]], the slave caste of Attilan. <ref>''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #132</ref> While Black Bolt has also successfully fended off several attempts by both [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]<ref>''Inhumans'' vol. 1, #5 - 6 + ''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #240 + ''Avengers'' vol. 1, Annual #12</ref> and the [[Kree]] <ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1 - 4</ref> to seize power and destroy the Royal Family, his reign has also been marked by a period of exile, <ref>''The Inhumans: Untold Story'' (1990)</ref> voluntary abdication, <ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' vol. 1, #2</ref> and rejection by his subjects. <ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3, #4</ref>

While the Inhumans choose to live in segregation, Black Bolt and the other members of the Royal Family have come into contact with modern age superheroes time and again. Some of Black Bolt's feats include smashing a machine devised by the time-traveling [[Kang the Conqueror]] to imprison the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; <ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 1, #11</ref> defeating the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]]; <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual #12</ref> aiding [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] against mutated villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]; <ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #4</ref> defusing a missile launched at Attilan by the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] <ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' vol. 1, #72</ref> and empowering heroine [[Dazzler]] so that she could defeat the [[Absorbing Man]]. <ref>''Dazzler'' vol. 1, #19</ref>

On several occasions Black Bolt has also required the aid of the heroes - to assist with the defeat of robotic villain [[Ultron]]; <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #150</ref> and later the immortal mutant, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], <ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1, #65-68</ref> an escape for the Inhumans from Earth's harmful pollutants <ref>''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #240</ref> and captivity by Maximus. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, Annual #12</ref> 

===[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]===
The [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)| Sentry]] traveled to Attilan and informed the Inhuman royal court of his hidden past, the events of [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]], [[House of M]], [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], and Civil War. Many of the Inhumans were moved to tears at the tragedy of it all. Black Bolt had also chosen to remain neutral in the recent superhuman Civil War after hearing about this. Although a one-time member of the superhero council the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] (and current possessor of the Space [[Infinity Gem]]), Black Bolt rejected the Superhuman Registration Act and refused to become involved. Courtesy of the Sentry, Black Bolt monitored the situation.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (2006 - 2007) </ref>

===[[Silent War]]===
When the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] steals a canister of Terrigen crystals from Attilan, Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family attempt to retrieve them. The US military, however, wants the crystals and attacks the Inhumans. Believing the stolen crystals should be returned to Attilan, Black Bolt issues a warning to the United States concerning further acts of aggression, and eventually launches an offensive against the nation. Gorgon and others are captured attempt during their foray, which prompts Black Bolt to personally head a team to rescue their fellow Inhumans and retrieve the crystals. While the mission is successful, Maximus takes advantage of the situation and overthrows and incarcerates Black Bolt. <ref>''Son of M'' #6</ref><ref>''Silent War'' # 1 - 5</ref> 

===[[World War Hulk]]===
Black Bolt then suffered another serious setback. He is brutally beaten when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] arrives upon the Moon, seeking revenge on Black Bolt for his role in Hulk's exile from Earth. <ref>''World War Hulk'' #1 (2007)</ref> 

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
It has been revealed that Black Bolt has been impersonated by an alien [[Skrull]] agent for an unknown period of time. While the Skrull doppleganger is killed by [[Namor]], the whereabouts and status of the real Black Bolt are unknown. <ref>[[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] #5 (2007)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Black Bolt's powers are the result of electron manipulation. The speech center of Black Bolt's brain contains an organic mechanism able to generate an as yet unknown type of particle which interacts with ambient electrons to create certain phenomena determined by mental control. Through electron gathering and manipulation, Black Bolt can increase any aspect of his physical nature to superhuman levels, including his strength, speed, stamina and durability. He can channel his power into a single devastating punch called "The Master Blow". This act, however, leaves Black Bolt exhausted and he must recover afterwards. Black Bolt can also harness the electrons for matter transformation, the controlled projection of energy as concussive blasts or quasi-solid particle/electron fiends, broadcasting jamming frequencies, and flight.

Black Bolt's most prominent offensive weapon is his voice, as a hypersonic shout can level a city <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #148</ref> or awaken distant volcanoes and cause tremors on a continent on the far side of the planet.<ref>''Inhumans'' vol. 3, #4</ref> It has even been stated as capable of destroying a planet. It once took Black Bolt a mere whisper to stun the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after the latter had defeated the entire Inhuman Royal Family. <ref>''Hulk'' vol. 1, Annual #1</ref> Due to the extreme danger posed by his voice, Black Bolt has undergone rigorous mental training to prevent himself from uttering a sound, even in his sleep. The fork-like antenna on Black Bolt's forehead allows him to use his voice in a more channeled manner.
