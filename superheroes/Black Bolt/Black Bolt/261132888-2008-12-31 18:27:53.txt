'''Black Bolt''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (Dec. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Blackagar Boltagon''' is the son of two formerly pre-eminent Inhumans — [[Agon (comics)|Agon]], head of the ruling Council of Genetics, and Rynda, director of the Prenatal Care Center. In accordance with Inhuman standard practice, Black Bolt is subjected to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]] while still an embryo. As an infant, he demonstrates the ability to manipulate energy, particularly the ability to generate quasi-sonic energy through his voice. To protect the community, Black Bolt is placed inside a sound-proof chamber and given an energy-harnessing suit. Agon then tutors his son in how to control his powers, until permitted to re-enter society as a young man - having vowed never to speak. His younger brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] attacks Black Bolt upon his release from confinement, in an attempt to prove that Black Bolt cannot control his sonic powers.<ref>''Thor'' #148 - 149 (Jan. - Feb. 1968)</ref>

Only a month after being awarded his freedom, Black Bolt discovers Maximus in the process of making a pact with emissaries of the alien [[Kree]], the race whose genetic experiments first created the Inhumans. Black Bolt uses his powers to stop an escaping Kree vessel, but due to his inexperience miscalculates, causing it to crash and accidentally kill several members of the Council of Genetics — including his parents. These events drive Maximus insane.<ref>''Avengers'' #95 (Jan. 1972)(flashback)</ref> Despite his guilt, Black Bolt reluctantly accepts rulership of the Inhumans, and together with his cousins [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], they form the Royal Family, with giant pet bulldog [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] completing their entourage. Black Bolt eventually marries his cousin Medusa<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #18 (1984)</ref> and they have a son named [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]].<ref>''The Inhumans'' Graphic Novel (1988)</ref>

Black Bolt is later driven from Attilan by Maximus' creation, the Trikon,<ref>Revealed in ''Inhumans Special'' #1 (Apr. 1990)</ref> but later regains the throne and befriends the [[Fantastic Four]]. Maximus then traps Black Bolt within [[Attilan]] using a [[Negative Zone]] barrier,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45 - 48 (Dec. 1965 - Mar. 1966)</ref> although Black Bolt manages to shatter the barrier, and leaves the Great Refuge to visit the outside world.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59 - 61 (Feb - Apr. 1967)</ref>

Black Bolt has made several significant decisions in his time as ruler. When Triton was kidnapped by humans and subsequently escaped, Black Bolt decided to move Attilan. He relocated the Inhuman city of Attilan several times (from an island in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Himalayas]]<ref>''What If'' #30 (Dec. 1981)</ref> to the Blue Area of the Moon<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #240 (Mar. 1982)</ref> to the raised city of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]<ref>''Atlantis Rising'' #2 (1995)</ref> to the Himalayas again<ref>''The Inhumans'' #12 vol. 2 (1989)</ref> and even into [[outer space]] <ref name=inhumans>''The Inhumans'' #1 - 4 vol. 3 (2000)</ref> before returning to the Moon<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #54 (Jun. 2002)</ref>, dismantling the Genetic Council's power<ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #2 (1993)</ref> and freeing the [[Alpha Primitive]]s, the slave caste of Attilan.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #132 (Mar. 1973)</ref> While Black Bolt has also successfully fended off several attempts by both [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]<ref>''Inhumans'' #5 - 6 (Jun. - Jul. 1975) + ''Fantastic Four'' #240 (Mar. 1982) + ''Avengers'' Annual #12 (1982)</ref> and the [[Kree]] <ref name=inhumans/> to seize power and destroy the Royal Family, his reign has also been marked by a period of exile,<ref>''The Inhumans: Untold Story'' (1990)</ref> voluntary abdication,<ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #2 (1993)</ref> and rejection by his subjects. <ref name=inhumans/>

While the Inhumans choose to live in segregation, Black Bolt and the other members of the Royal Family have come into contact with modern age superheroes time and again. Some of Black Bolt's feats include smashing a machine devised by the time-traveling [[Kang the Conqueror]] to imprison the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]];<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #11 (Jan. 1973)</ref> defeating the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]];<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #12 (1977)</ref> aiding [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] against mutated villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]];<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #4 (1979)</ref> defusing a missile launched at Attilan by the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]]<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #72 (Feb. 1981)</ref> and empowering heroine [[Dazzler]] so that she could defeat the [[Absorbing Man]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #19 (Sept. 1982)</ref>

On several occasions Black Bolt has also required the aid of the heroes - to assist with the defeats of robotic villain [[Ultron]] <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> and later the immortal mutant, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]],<ref>''X-Factor'' #65 - 68 (Apr. - July 1991)</ref> and escapes for the Inhumans from Earth's harmful pollutants <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #240 (March 1982)</ref> and captivity by Maximus.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #12 (1982)</ref> 

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comic book)|l1=Civil War}}
Although a one-time member of the superhero council the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]] (and current possessor of the Space [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gem]]), Black Bolt rejected the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] and refuses to become involved. Courtesy of the hero [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]], Black Bolt monitors the situation.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (2006 - 2007) </ref>

When the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] steals a canister of Terrigen crystals from Attilan, Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family attempt to retrieve it. The US military, however, wants the crystals and attacks the Inhumans. Believing the stolen crystals should be returned to Attilan, Black Bolt issues a warning to the United States concerning further acts of aggression, and eventually launches an offensive against the nation. Gorgon and others are captured during their foray, which prompts Black Bolt to personally head a team to rescue their fellow Inhumans and retrieve the crystals. While the mission is successful, Maximus takes advantage of the situation and overthrows and temporarily incarcerates Black Bolt.<ref>''Son of M'' #6 (Feb. - July 2006)</ref><ref>''Silent War'' # 1 - 6 (Jan - Aug 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Black Bolt's powers are the result of electron manipulation. The speech center of Black Bolt's brain contains an organic mechanism able to generate a currently unknown type of particle which interacts with ambient electrons to create certain phenomena determined by mental control. Through electron gathering and manipulation, Black Bolt can increase any aspect of his physical nature to superhuman levels, including his strength, speed, stamina, and durability. He can channel his power into a single devastating punch called "The Master Blow". This act, however, leaves Black Bolt exhausted and he must recover afterwards. Black Bolt can also harness the electrons for matter transformation, the controlled projection of energy as concussive blasts or quasi-solid particle/electron fields, broadcasting jamming frequencies, and flight.

Black Bolt's most prominent offensive weapon is his voice, as his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain. Speaking triggers a disturbance of the particle / electron interaction field: a word can level a city, <ref>''Thor'' #148 (Jan. 1968)</ref>, a shout can awaken distant volcanoes and cause tremors on a continent on the far side of the planet.<ref name=inhumans/> It has even been stated as capable of destroying a planet. It once took Black Bolt a mere whisper to stun the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after the latter had defeated the entire Inhuman Royal Family.<ref>''Hulk'' King-Size Special #1 (1968)</ref> Due to the extreme danger posed by his voice, Black Bolt has undergone rigorous mental training to prevent himself from uttering a sound, even in his sleep. The fork-like antenna on Black Bolt's forehead allows him to use his voice in a more channeled manner.
