'''Black Bolt''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is a member of the Inhuman race, the king of the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family.  His real name is Blackagar Boltagon.

Black Bolt has the ability to unleash great destructive power through the use of his voice, but even the slightest whisper will release his power.  Therefore the most part he remains silent. This "quasi-sonic" scream is powered by electron energy that he draws in from the environment. Other possible manifestations of this harnessed electron energy include electron energy blasts, flight, enhanced strength (the "Master Blow" being a superhuman punch), ability to survive in space, and the ability to analyze and manipulate matter. The "tuning fork" antenna on his forehead helps him to control and optimize his powers.

He is married to [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and they have a daughter named [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]] . He is usually attended by his cousins [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. His frequent nemesis is his brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]].

==Ultimate Black Bolt==
Black Bolt appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] during the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] issue, ''Annual 1: Inhuman''. In it he had the same abilities and limitations as the [[Marvel Universe]] Black Bolt. He used his abilities to decimate Atillan after it was infiltrated by the Fantastic Four, before he led his people to a new location.
