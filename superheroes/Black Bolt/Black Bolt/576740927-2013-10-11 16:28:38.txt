'''Black Bolt''' ('''Blackagar Boltagon''') is a [[fictional]] [[character (arts)|character]] that appears in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. Black Bolt is the ruler of the [[Inhumans]]. His most prominent offensive weapon is his voice, as his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain. Speaking triggers a massive disturbance capable of leveling a city. Due to the extreme danger posed by this power, the character has undergone rigorous mental training to prevent himself from uttering a sound, even in sleep.

The character of Black Bolt has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as arcade and [[video game]]s, animated [[television program|television series]], and merchandise such as [[trading card]]s.

===1960s===
Black Bolt's first appearance established the character as being a member of the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] ruling class.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-46 (Dec. 1965 – Jan. 1966)</ref><ref>{{Cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/ | title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 261 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 18, 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> The title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' featured a back-up feature called "Tales of the Inhumans", which recounts the character's origin story. The son of two preeminent Inhumans, Black Bolt is exposed to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]] while still an embryo, and eventually demonstrates the ability to manipulate [[electron]]s. To protect the Inhuman community from his devastating voice, Black Bolt is placed inside a sound-proof chamber and is tutored in the use of his powers. Reentering Inhuman society as a young man — having vowed never to speak — the character is attacked by his younger brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], who attempts, unsuccessfully, to goad him into speaking.<ref>''Thor'' #146 (Nov. 1967); #148-149 (Jan. – Feb. 1968); #152 (May 1968)</ref>

===2000s===
The character is featured — again with the Royal Family — in a third self-titled limited series that has major developments for the Inhumans. [[Ronan the Accuser]] leads the Kree in a surprise attack, capturing Attilan and forcing the Royal Family into service against Kree enemies the [[Shi'ar]]. Karnak, Gorgon, and Triton covertly join the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] while Black Bolt and Medusa must attempt the [[assassination]] of the Shi'ar ruler [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] at a ceremony ratifying an alliance between the Shi'ar and the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#S|Spartoi]]. Although the attempt fails and Black Bolt manages to defeat Ronan in personal combat, the Inhuman people choose to leave with the Kree and pursue a new future. This leaves Black Bolt and the Royal Family alone to fend for themselves.<ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1-4 (June – Oct. 2000)</ref>

Interdimensional adventurers the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] also encounter an alternate universe version of Black Bolt.<ref>''Exiles'' #23-25 (May – June 2003)</ref> Black Bolt decides to attempt reintegration with Earth, and several younger Inhumans — recently exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]]s — explore Earth with mixed results, including at one stage the intervention of the Fantastic Four.

In the title ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'',<ref>''New Avengers'' #7 (July 2005)</ref> Black Bolt is revealed to be a member of a superhero council called the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. Via a [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] of Marvel continuity, the group form during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]<ref>''The Avengers'' #88-97 (June 1971 – March 1972)</ref> to deal with threats to Earth. During the "[[Son of M]]" storyline, the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] steals a canister of Terrigen crystals from Attilan, with Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family attempting to retrieve it.<ref>''Son of M'' #1-6 (Feb. – July 2006)</ref>

Black Bolt also rejects the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] and refuses to become involved in the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Courtesy of the hero [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]], Black Bolt monitors the situation.<ref>''Civil War'' #1–7 (July 2006 – Jan. 2007)</ref> In the limited series ''[[Silent War]]'', the [[United States armed forces|US military]] attacks the Inhumans to prevent them from retrieving the crystals. Believing the stolen crystals should be returned to Attilan, Black Bolt issues a warning to the [[United States]] concerning further acts of aggression, and eventually launches an offensive against the nation. Gorgon and other Inhumans are captured during the attack, which prompts Black Bolt to personally head a team to rescue his subjects and retrieve the crystals. While the mission is successful, Maximus takes advantage of the situation and overthrows and temporarily incarcerates Black Bolt.<ref>''Silent War'' #1-6 (Jan. – Aug. 2007)</ref>

The Illuminati also collect the [[Infinity Gems]], and -- to prevent the [[abuse of power]] by the Titan [[Thanos]] and others -- split the gems between themselves, vowing that they never be used in unison again. Black Bolt is given the "Reality" gem.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #1-5 (Feb. 2007 – Jan. 2008)</ref>

The character apparently suffers a setback when brutally beaten by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], on a rampage during the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline and seeking revenge on Black Bolt for his role in the Hulk's exile from Earth.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1-5 (Aug. 2007 – Jan. 2008)</ref> During the events of the [[Secret Invasion]] limited series it is revealed that this was not in fact Black Bolt, but rather a [[Skrull]], who is killed in battle by members of the Illuminati.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3 (Dec. 2008)</ref><ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5 (June 2007)</ref> The true Black Bolt is captured by the Skrulls, who intended to use his voice as a weapon of mass destruction.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #1 (Oct. 2008)</ref> The character is rescued when the heroes of Earth defeat the Skrull army and discover the location of their captured teammates.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1-6 (June 2008 – Jan. 2009)</ref>

Black Bolt, angered by the repercussions caused by the Skrull invasion, changes tactics and embarks on an aggressive campaign against all former persecutors of the Inhumans in the [[War of Kings]] limited series. At his command, the Inhumans attack the Kree and overthrow Ronan the Accuser, with Black Bolt declaring himself supreme ruler of the Kree Empire. This is followed by a preemptive strike against the [[Shi'ar]] empire, now controlled by the usurper [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. Black Bolt intended to release the Terrigen Mist across the galaxy and end the war when, courtesy of the subsequent mutations, all are rendered equal, but the plan was interrupted by Vulcan, the two clashing as the bomb charged up. Although Vulcan was nearly killed by Black Bolt's voice, Black Bolt prepared to abandon his plan when Crystal pointed out that the powers produced by the explosion would only inspire more harm rather than good. However, an enraged Vulcan retained enough strength to stop Black Bolt from teleporting away with Crystal and Lockjaw, which resulted in Black Bolt and Vulcan apparently dying in the subsequent explosion of the Terrigen bomb, as Crystal only negated the Terrigen Mists within the bomb without shutting down its ability to explode.<ref>''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #1-5 (Nov. 2007 – March 2008); ''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' #1-4 (Feb. – May 2009); ''War of Kings'' #1-6 (May – Oct. 2009)</ref>

===2010s===
He in fact survived the explosion. It was revealed that Black Bolt likely represents the anomaly of the Kree Inhuman genetics program that had been predicted hundreds of thousands of years ago. The genetic prophecy was that this anomaly would bring about the end of the Supreme Intelligence. To prevent this outcome, the Kree Supreme Intelligence had ordered the destruction of all the worlds where the genetic experiments took place. Only five colonies escaped, including Earth's: these were the [[Inhumans#Universal Inhumans|Universal Inhumans]]. After his return to Attilan, Black Bolt joined the Universal Inhumans and was presented with four new brides, one from each of the other colonies.<ref>''FF'' #6-7</ref>

They returned to Earth to help defeat the last four Reeds of the Interdimensional Council.<ref>''FF'' #8-10</ref> They then faced the Kree Armada, who had been ordered by the resurrected Kree Supreme Intelligence to wipe out Earth and the Inhumans.<ref>''FF'' #11</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #600-603</ref> After the Kree fled in defeat, the Inhumans followed in pursuit.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #603</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Black Bolt's Terrigen-mutated physique surpasses the superhuman physique of typical Inhumans: his strength, stamina, durability and reflexes are all well above typical Inhuman or human levels. His speed and agility are also highly enhanced. An organic mechanism in his brain's speech center produces an unknown particle that interacts with ambient electrons, enabling him to produce certain mentally-controlled phenomena. The most devastating of the effects is Black Bolt's "quasi-sonic scream". Because his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain, any attempt to use his vocal cords triggers an uncontrollable disturbance of the particle/electron interaction field. Because of this limitation, Black Bolt must be constantly vigilant of even the softest of utterances lest he destroy anything or anyone in its path. At full strength, his voice generates a shockwave equivalent to that of a nuclear weapon, while a whisper can rock a battleship. When Black Bolt was captured and experimented on by the Skrulls, it was shown that his "Sonic Scream" is triggered by, and at least partially dependent on, his emotional state.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref>

The fork-like antenna worn upon his forehead helps Black Bolt control his powers. He can channel his powers inward to increase his strength and speed, and can focus it through his arms as concussive blasts. Black Bolt is capable of channeling all available energy into one devastating punch called his Master Blow, which renders him extremely vulnerable subsequently. By concentrating his electrons into anti-electrons, he can fly at speeds up to 500&nbsp;mph for a period of 6 hours, protected by an anti-graviton field. Black Bolt can create a nearly impenetrable force field by focusing his energy around himself, and can use his electron abilities as extrasensory probes, highly sensitive to electromagnetic phenomena, and he can also jam certain electromagnetic mechanisms. Though exhausting, he can create particle/electron interaction fields solid enough to be traversed upon.

Black Bolt also is at least partially resistant against telepathy and shares a semi-telepathic bond with those of his blood (such as the Inhuman royal family and certain others), as was evident when he was able to resist the mental abilities of his telepathically powerful brother, Maximus, and on different occasions, use his own abilities to overpower and take control of Maximus' mind. One of Black Bolt's main uses for his telepathic ability is to communicate his wishes to his wife, Medusa the Queen, who then acts as his mouthpiece to the rest of his subjects. He can also use this limited telepathy to communicate his destination wishes to the royal family's teleporting dog, Lockjaw.
