'''Black Bolt (Blackagar Boltagon)''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}} and king of the offshoot of humanity known as the [[Inhumans]]. Black Bolt was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first makes a cameo appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #45.

==Fictional character history==
'''Black Bolt''' is the son of two formerly pre-eminent Inhumans - '''Agon''', head of the ruling Council of Genetics, and '''Rynda''', director of the Prenatal Care Center . In accordance with Inhuman standard practice, Black Bolt is subjected to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]] while still an embryo. As an infant, he demonstrates the ability to manipulate energy, particularly the ability to generate quasi-sonic energy through his voice. To protect the community, Black Bolt is placed inside a sound-proofed chamber and given an energy-harnessing suit. Agon then tutors his son in how to control his powers, until permitted to re-enter society as a young man - having vowed never to speak. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #148 - 149</ref>

Only a month after being awarded his freedom, Black Bolt discovers his younger brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] in the process of making a pact with emissaries of the alien [[Kree]], the race whose genetic experiments first created the Inhumans. Black Bolt uses his powers to stop an escaping Kree vessel, but due to his inexperience miscalculates, causing it to crash and accidentally kill several members of the Council of Genetics - including his parents. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #95 (flashback)</ref> Despite his guilt, Black Bolt reluctantly accepts rulership of the Inhumans, and together with his cousins [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], they form the Royal Family, with giant pet bulldog [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] completing their entourage. Black Bolt eventually marries his cousin Medusa <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual #18</ref> and they have a son called Ahura. <ref>''The Inhumans'' Graphic Novel (1988)</ref>

Black Bolt has made several significant decisions in his time as ruler, including relocating the Inhuman city of Attilan several times (from the ocean floor to the Himalayas, <ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 2, #12</ref> and later to the Blue Area of the Moon <ref>''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #240</ref> and finally outer space <ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1</ref>), dismantling the Genetic Council's power <ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #2 (1993)</ref> and freeing the Alpha Primatives, the slave caste of Attilan. He has also successfully fended off several attempts by both [[Maximus]] <ref>''Inhumans'' vol. 1, #5 - 6 + ''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #240 + ''Avengers'' vol. 1, Annual #12</ref> and the [[Kree]] <ref>''The Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1 - 4</ref> to seize power and destroy the Royal Family. 

While the Inhumans choose to live in segregation, Black Bolt and the other members of the Royal Family have come into contact with modern age superheroes time and again. Some of Black Bolt's feats include smashing a machine devised by the time-travelling [[Kang]] to imprison the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; <ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 1, #11</ref> defeating the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]]; <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual #12</ref> aiding [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] against mutated villain [[Graviton]]; <ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #4</ref> defusing a missile launched at Attilan by the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] <ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' vol. 1, #72</ref> and empowering heroine [[Dazzler]] so that she could defeat the [[Absorbing Man]]. <ref>''Dazzler'' vol. 1, #19</ref>

On several occasions Black Bolt has also required the aid of the heroes - to assist with the defeat of robotic villain [[Ultron]]; <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #150</ref> an escape for the Inhumans from Earth's harmful pollutants <ref>''The Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #240</ref> and from captivity by Maximus. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, Annual #12</ref>

When the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] steals a canister of Terrigen crystals from Attilan, Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family attempt to retrieve them. The US military, however, want the crystals and attack the Inhumans. Believing the stolen crystals should be returned to Attilan, Black Bolt issues a warning to the United States concerning further acts of aggression, thereby alienating the Inhumans further. <ref>''Son of M'' # 1 - 6</ref>

Black Bolt has also chosen to remain neutral in the current [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Although a one-time member of the superhero council the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], Black Bolt rejects the Superhuman Registration Act and refuses to become involved. Courtesy of ally [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], Black Bolt is still monitoring the situation. <ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (2006 - 2007) '''Note this series has yet to finish'''.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
[[Image:MarvelTeamUp11.jpg|right|thumb|Black Bolt uses his hypersonic scream in ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 1, #11. Art by Jim Mooney]]
Black Bolt's powers are the result of electron manipulation. The speech center of Black Bolt's brain contains an organic mechanism able to generate an as yet unknown type of particle which interacts with ambient electrons to create certain phenomena determined by mental control. Through electron gathering and manipulation, Black Bolt can increase any aspect of his physical nature, including his strength, speed, stamina and resistance. He can channel his power into single devastating punch called "The Master Blow", which is strong enough to momentarily drive back even a being with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s level of strength. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #46</ref> This act, however, leaves Black Bolt exhausted and he must recover afterwards. Black Bolt can also harness the electrons for matter transformation, the controlled projection of energy and flight. 

Black Bolt's most prominent offensive weapon is his voice, as a hypersonic shout can level a city. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #148</ref> It once took Black Bolt's whisper to stop an enraged [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after he had defeated the entire Inhuman Royal Family. <ref>''Hulk'' vol. 1, Annual #1</ref> Due to the extreme danger posed by his voice, Black Bolt has undergone rigorous mental training to prevent himself from uttering a sound, even in his sleep.
