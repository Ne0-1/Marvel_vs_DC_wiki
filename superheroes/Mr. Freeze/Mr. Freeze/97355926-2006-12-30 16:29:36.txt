'''Mister Freeze''' (Dr. '''Victor Fries''') (Pronounced as Victor "Freese" or "Freeze") is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 ([[1959#February|February 1959]]).

Mr. Freeze was one of many [[gimmick]]-focused [[comic book]] villains. He was a [[mad scientist]] who plotted crimes around ice and cold. In most incarnations, this desire stems from a medical condition in which his body temperature was permanently lowered and he required a refrigerated “ice suit” to survive.

Originally called '''Mr. Zero''', he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors. Over two decades later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]],'' retold Mr. Freeze’s origin, introducing [[Nora Fries|his terminally ill, cryogenically frozen wife]], which greater explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds. The animated series version was also more calm and composed than previous, campier versions and the [[comic book]] version has been altered to resemble it.

Elements of this personal tragedy, but not Freeze's calm demeanor, were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Character history==
From the time of his first appearance in 1959 onward, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|The Mad Hatter]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.  Originally called Mr. Zero, the producers of the 1960's ''[[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "Dr. Schimmell"), and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. 

Nearly thirty years later, Mr. Freeze would owe even more to television. In ''Batman: The Animated Series'', the "[[Heart of Ice]]" episode, he was made into a more complex, [[tragic]] character. This version of Mr. Freeze was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself which, previously had the character casually killed by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Freeze was hastily resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.

===Origin===
[[Pre-Crisis]] Mr. Zero/Mr. Freeze was a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" had led to his inadvertently spilling cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing sub-zero temperatures to survive. His motives for turning to crime were not explored beyond this.

In the ''Batman: Mr. Freeze'' special (based closely on the animated series episode "Heart of Ice") Victor Fries (appropriately pronounced freeze) was fascinated with freezing animals as a child, which would lead to his career in [[cryogenics]] research. 

His parents, horrified by his "hobby", sent him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he was miserable, feeling detached from humanity. However, at university, he met [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he befriended and ultimately married.

Unfortunately, Nora later fell [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. Fries took on a job working for a large company run by the ruthless [[Ferris Boyle]]. Fries did not like the job but needed money to help Nora. 

Fries discovered a way to put Nora into [[Suspended animation|cryo-stasis]] (using company equipment), hoping to sustain her until a cure could be found. Boyle (after realizing how much keeping Nora in stasis cost) attempted to have her brought out of [[stasis]], overruling Fries' frantic objections. A struggle ensued, in which Boyle kicked Fries into a table full of chemicals and left Fries for dead. He survived, but his body temperature was lowered dramatically and from then on he could only live at [[sub-zero]] temperatures, forced to wear a special refrigerating suit to stay alive. As Mr. Freeze, he used cryonic technology to create a gun, which fired a beam that froze any target within its range.

Mr. Freeze's first action in his new identity was to seek revenge on Boyle. Batman intervened and, when Victor fired his freeze-gun at him, he dodged, causing the beam to shatter Nora's capsule. Freeze blamed Batman for this, and swore to destroy whatever the hero held dear (mainly Gotham City, and eventually Robin). 

The television series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' gives a different origin story, it lacks Nora but makes Batman indirectly responsible for his powers: Victor Fries, a petty thief, is robbing a bank when Batman intervenes. A chase ensues, but Batman breaks off just before Fries crashes into a cryogenics lab. He falls into a cryogenic freezing chamber with an electrical cable, and is electrocuted at the same time that his blood is frozen. When he awakes and leaves the chamber, ice forms under his feet, meaning that he can create and control ice. He can also survive for short times at normal temperatures. Armed with these powers, Fries vows revenge on Batman.     

Mr. Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into, which seems to satisfy his urge to get even with a hard, cruel world. In addition, he hardly ever forges alliances with the other criminals in [[Gotham City]], preferring to work alone, although he has worked as a hired enforcer/hitman for the [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]].  He also (in the hope of curing and reviving his wife) allied himself with [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Society]], fashioning for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. Attempting to bring back Nora without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals, he revives her as the twisted [[Nora Fries|Lazara]], and escapes after his now-estranged wife, who blames her husband for her condition.

While he displays no obvious signs of [[insanity]] (at least, in comparison to the likes of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] or [[Two-Face]]), he is usually imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]] when apprehended by Batman, as it is the only local penal facility that can accommodate his medical requirements for a refrigerated cell.

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold. In darker incarnations of the Batman [[mythos]], Mr. Freeze's obsession with ice stems from personal tragedy, and his crimes are inspired by his desire to make the rest of the world as cold and miserable as he is. He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment. His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]]. Some interpretations also suggest that because he has been soaked in the serum he intended to use for cryo-preservation, his age progression has slowed drastically.

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline Mr Freeze was granted the ability to generate sub-zero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit. Unlike most villains granted boons by the demon [[Neron]], Freeze's new powers proved temporary.

According to the animated Batman series, Freeze understands how to reproduce his powers.  Upon being offered enough money to bankroll large scale research into Nora's condition, Freeze turns a terminally ill and wealthy man into another "Mr. Freeze"-like being (on the theory that the "Mr. Freeze condition" would arrest the disease). However, Grant Walker, the wealthy man whom Freeze changed, was left stranded in an chunk of ice after an attempt to turn the world into a desolate ice land. Freeze froze him up in a block of ice as Walker's "World of Tomorrow" Oceana collapsed around him. For two years, Walker remained in the iceberg, driving him insane. Althought he did not reappear in the animation, the "second Mr. Freeze", reappered in the "Batman: Gotham Adventures" comic book series (based on the The New Gotham Adventures cartoon). In his last appearance, he broke into Wayne Foundation and kidnapped all of the scientists who had been working to cure Mr Freeze's head. With Batman out of action due to a concussion, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Robin save the scientists, with the help of Mr Freeze. Walker was eventually caught after a short fight with Freeze, and then sent to Arkham.

==In other media==

===Adam West TV Series===
In the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders (actor)|George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]]. In his first appearance (''Instant Freeze''), it is revealed that it was Batman who spilt the cryogenic chemicals on him during a fight, causing his hatred of the Caped Crusader. Only the last two appearences of Mr. Freeze {Preminger and Wallach} showed the freeze suit-the first appearence {Sanders} showed Freeze using a climate control unit to "freeze" a room he was in. Sanders and Preminger also played Freeze with a German accent; Wallach played him with a "New York Accent". Preminger also used the "Freeze Gun" either as a "green laser" instant freeze spray or as a "smoke" like instant freeze spray.

In some [[Galician language|Galician]] translations of the series, Mr. Freeze is mistakenly translated as "O Siñor Xeo" ("Mr. Ice"), which led to confusion with Spanish translation of Marvel hero [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].

===DC Animated Universe===
[[Image:Juytht.jpg|thumb|150 px|Mr. Freeze as depicted in ''Batman: The Animated Series'']]
Mr Freeze was a significant villain in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', as noted above, but is portrayed as a sympathetic villain  with elements of the film ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' possibly incorporated. He is voiced by [[Michael Ansara]] in the series, and its spin-offs. Mr. Freeze's appearance in the series was designed by ''[[Hellboy]]'' creator [[Mike Mignola]], at the request of series creator [[Bruce Timm]]. 

In the direct-to-video film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Nora's condition begins to rapidly deteriorate due to an accident, so Freeze enlists the help of Dr. Gregory Belson to find a cure. Belson determines that Nora Fries needs an organ transplant, and due to her rare [[blood type]] there are not many suitable donors, so Freeze declares that they will use a live donor. [[Barbara Gordon]] (a.k.a. [[Batgirl]]) is a perfect match, so Freeze abducts her and takes her to an abandoned [[oil rig]] out in the ocean that Freeze is using as a hideout.

In the ''[[New Batman Adventures]]'' episode, ''Cold Comfort'', Mr. Freeze has returned, but not to a happy reunion as he had hoped: Nora, having accepted that he had likely been killed in the oil rig's collapse, has remarried and left Gotham, leaving Mr. Freeze with nothing for which to live. Furthermore, he learns that the serum that mutated his body was deteriorating it, and although he had kidnapped many scientists to try and stop the process, they only succeeded after the process had claimed all but his head. Afterwards he begins committing crimes in order to inflict the loss he's suffered on others by taking away the things they value most.

Freeze, though having his seemingly last battle with Batman in "Cold Comfort", has had numerous appearances in the comics set in the same universe. In ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' issue #5 he was found shortly after the battle and back in action. He has had further appearances in ''Batman Adventures'' as well as two appearances in ''Justice League Adventures''. In the first, he claimed that [[Captain Cold]] had stolen his freeze gun design, but in the second they were working together, alongside other cold-based villains.[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/jl/guides/comic/12.jpg] 

*Batman Adventures #15 was written to be the final story for Mr. Freeze.  Though the issue's ending is ambigious, it does set up for his final fate in Batman Beyond.  Nora finally encounters Victor after nearly witnessing her current husband (Francis D'Anjou) getting killed (In truth he created Freeze robot to attack him to prove to Nora that Victor was a monster).  The story ends with Mr. Freeze's head falling into a pond at the arctic.
**Deleted material from the comic has Ferris Boyle and [[Grant Walker]] (Who appeared in the episode Deep Freeze and Gotham Adventures #5) being killed by Francis' robot.  While the end of the story is left up in the air, it was intended for Mr Freeze to be taken by Powers Technology (Owned by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Powers#Father Warren Powers] and put in storage.  Warren stated that the the secret to immortality is locked inside that head. [http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batribute/backstage/15.php]

In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', it is discovered that the disembodied head of Victor Fries did indeed survive the events of "Cold Comfort" (''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'') and that the cryogenic process had made him essentially [[Immortality|immortal]]. A doctor working for [[Derek Powers]], the villain [[Derek Powers|Blight]], used him as a test subject for a process she hoped would be able to cure Powers' condition. She created a clone body for him and transferred Fries' memories into it. Given a normal life back, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he did as a criminal (which impresses the new Batman). However, the new body soon begins to revert to the same sub-zero biology as Fries' original body. The doctor and Powers betrayed Fries, hoping to learn more from an [[autopsy]]. Fries escapes, recovers an old suit of armor (with ice guns built into the arms), and becomes Mr. Freeze again. He seeks revenge/suicide by blowing up a Wayne-Powers complex (with Freeze, the doctor & Powers in it), but is stopped by Batman. He manages to redeem himself by saving Batman from Blight (who makes his supervillain "debut"), but apparently dies when he refuses to escape the exploding complex with Batman.

Originally in the aforementioned series, Mr. Freeze's fate was to be explained in a brief, comedic scene in which Bruce Wayne sends his successor, [[Terry McGinnis]], to the fridge to get him something to drink, and he opens it to find Freeze's head staring back at him. The producers decided that joke didn't do the character justice, however, and did not use it.

===Batman & Robin===
In the film ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 film)|Batman & Robin]]'', Mr. Freeze (played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) teamed up with [[Poison Ivy]] in a scheme to freeze Gotham City solid. In this largely [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation, the character spouts [[pun]]s related to cold weather and temperatures (e.g., "You’re not sending me to the cooler!", "Let's... kick some ice!"). His tragic origin is the same, however, and he is not without sympathetic qualities, though many fans couldn't stand this version of the character. Also, the source of energy to Freeze's suit was diamonds which Freeze robs the items to power his suit.  Here, he teamed up with Poison Ivy and her assistant, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], to take down Batman, Robin and Batgirl, even freezing Gotham, after Ivy claimed that Batman had turned off his wife's life-support system.  But the heroes foiled Freeze's plan and, revealing Ivy's betrayal to him, give him a chance at redemption by reminding him that anyone can kill, but only a few people can save lives. As a result, Freeze gives Batman a means of curing the disease that Alfred, their butler, has recently been diagnosed with, revealing that his wife is still alive and that she will be moved to the Arkham Asylum laboratory so that Freeze can continue working on a cure. After Ivy was incarcerated, Freeze visited her and tells her "Winter has come at last."

===''The Batman''===
[[Image:MrFreeze.gif|thumb|left|125px|Mr. Freeze as seen in [[The Batman]]]]
[[Image:VFMF.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The future Mr. Freeze as to be seen in [[The Batman]]]]
In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', Mr. Freeze was a simple crook who was pursued by the Batman one night after a [[jewelry]] heist. Running into a cryogenics lab, he was knocked into one of the freeze chambers and electrocuted as his body was frozen. The experience somehow turned him into a quasi-[[undead]] being that constantly generated extreme cold around him; he was forced to wear a special suit (developed by a cryogenicist he coerced into working for him) to prevent him from freezing everything he comes in contact with. He could also (presumably) channel/focus his abilities. Batman had a hard time beating him until [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] made a winter-themed bat-suit which the Caped Crusader used to defeat Mr. Freeze. In a later episode, Mr. Freeze teamed up with [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]] to put Gotham in a permanent winter. Though his background is different, in a flashback of his accident there is a picture of him and a woman with him in his car, suggesting that Nora (or another love interest) does indeed exist in this [[fictional universe|universe]] of the Batman mythos. In '''"The Icy Depths"''', he competed against [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] to claim an umbrella that's a map to a sunken treasure. Recently, an upcoming episode entitled '''"Artifacts"''' has been revealed, its plot basing around Gotham City one thousand years in the future. Mr Freeze returns to terrorize it once again, and the city must learn how to deal with such a threat without Batman. In this series, Mr. Freeze is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].  Also, besides of using his powers, Freeze uses a sonic ice pack that ice explodes when it was touched.[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/thebatman/?x=guides/04]

In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translations of ''The Batman'', Mr. Freeze is mistakenly translated as "Capitán Frío". That name is a more accurate translation to another DC ice-themed villain, [[Captain Cold]].

==Video Game Appearances==
* Mr. Freeze also appeared in several Batman video games. He was a boss in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] (in which Freeze was the game's final boss), the video game adaptation of the movie ''Batman & Robin'', ''Batman: Chaos in Gotham'', ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]'' (the only game to feature the comic book version of Mr. Freeze, as all other games use the animated or movie version). Micheal Ansara reprised his role as Mr. Freeze for ''Batman Vengeance''.

==Trivia==
*[[Mr. Freeze (Roller Coaster)|Mr. Freeze]] is also the name of two LIM [[roller coasters]] at two [[Six Flags]] parks ([[Six Flags St. Louis]] and [[Six Flags Over Texas]])
*Danish Toymaker [[Lego]]'s [[Lego Batman| Batman line]] features one set, 7783-The Batcave: [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] and Mr. Freeze's Invasion, which includes a [[minifigure]] incarnation of the supervillain. This version most closely resembles Freeze's appearance in Batman: The Animated Series.
*Mr. Freeze appeared in [[Batman vs. Predator]]'s third comic book, Blood Ties. His gang members were killed by the Predators and was spared since he was unarmed, and not visible to the Predator because of his body temperature.
