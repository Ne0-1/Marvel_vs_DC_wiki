'''Mr. Freeze''' ('''Victor Fries''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Created by writer Dave Wood and artist [[Sheldon Moldoff]], the character first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 (February 1959),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> where he was known as '''Mr. Zero'''. Mr. Freeze is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]].

In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former [[cryogenics]] expert in [[Gotham City]] who was involved in a laboratory accident while attempting to cure his [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife [[Nora Fries]]. The disaster lowered his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive, and he utilizes a "freeze gun" that freezes its targets solid.

Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]] in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', and by [[Nathan Darrow]] on the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''. He was voiced by [[Michael Ansara]] in the [[DC animated universe]], by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', and by [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game franchise. [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |title=Mr. Freeze is Number 67 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213184608/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |archivedate=2010-12-13 |df= }}</ref>

==Overview==
Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/ |title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze |accessdate=May 10, 2008 |publisher=[[UGO]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527232551/http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/ |archivedate=May 27, 2008 }}</ref> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.<ref name="Freeze 1"/><ref name="Freeze 2"/><ref name="Freeze 3"/>

Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze's origin in "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]", an episode by writer [[Paul Dini]]. The episode introduced his terminally ill, [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]], which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller=[[Tom Lyle|Lyle, Tom]]|inker=[[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]]|colorist=[[Adrienne Roy|Ray, Adrienne]]|letterer=[[Tim Harkins|Harkins, Tim]]|editor=[[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]|story=Joker's Wild|title=[[Robin (comic book)|Robin]]|volume=2|issue=1|date=October 1991|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller=[[Barry Kitson|Kitson, Barry]]|inker=[[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]]|colorist=[[Adrienne Roy|Roy, Adrienne]]|letterer=[[John Costanza|Costanza, John]]|editor=[[Scott Peterson (comics)|Peterson, Scott]]|story=Cold Cases|title=[[Detective Comics]]|volume=1|issue=670|date=January 1994|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City}}</ref>

The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the rest of the series. This backstory was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been the character's official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman until September 2011, when [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity.

Elements of this origin story were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news|first1= Steve| last1= Daly| first2= Anne| last2= Thompson|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 8, 1996|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|upright|thumb|The character's first appearance as "Mr. Zero" in ''Batman'' #121 (Feb. 1959). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]
From the time of his first appearance in 1959 onwards, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "'''Dr. Schivel'''"),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. The three actors who portrayed Mr Freeze were [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]].

===Silver Age===
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in him needing [[wiktionary:subzero|subzero]] temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Modern Age===
[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-''Crisis'']], Freeze was revamped using a similar backstory to the one created by Paul Dini for ''Batman: The Animated Series''.<ref name="wf interview page 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/heartofice/interview/02.php |title=''Heart of Ice'' interview "The Role of Mr. Freeze In The Animated Universe" page 2 - Finding a Voice|accessdate=2008-02-08 |publisher= worldsfinestonline.com}}</ref> '''Dr. Victor Fries, Ph.D.''' (surname pronounced "freeze") was a brilliant [[cryogenics|cryogenicist]]. As a child, he was fascinated with [[cryonics]], so he began freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", sent him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he was miserable and felt detached from humanity. In college, he met a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he fell in love with and ultimately married.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

A year and a half after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, Nora contracts a fatal illness, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for [[GothCorp]] in order to preserve her in [[suspended animation|cryo-stasis]] until a cure can be found. Fries' boss [[Ferris Boyle]] decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle  interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first supervillain Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, however, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun. However, Batman eventually apprehends him.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he encounters<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructs a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman, Freeze's equipment allowing Hush to preserve [[Catwoman]]'s surgically-removed heart to use as a means of threatening her life.

During his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted Lazara, and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and she estranges herself from him.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, during the ''[[Night of the Owls]]'' crossover, the [[Court of Owls]] sends assassins known as Talons to kill 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr. Freeze. [[Jason Todd|The Red Hood]], [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] choose to save him, and subsequently remand him into [[Batgirl]]'s custody.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Scott Lobodell|Lobodell, Scott]]|penciller=[[Kenneth Rocafort|Rocafort, Kenneth]]|inker=[[Kenneth Rocafort|Rocafort, Kenneth]]|letterer=[[Dezi Sienty|Sienty, Dezi]]|editor=[[Bobbie Chase|Chase, Bobbie]]|story=Last Regrets - I've Had a Few|title=[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]| volume=1|issue=8| date=June 2012| publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>

''Batman Annual'' #1 introduces a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with an incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.

Eventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|inker=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|colorist=[[Peter Steigerwald|Steigerwald, Peter]]|letterer=[[Sal Cipriano|Cipriano, Sal]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=Night of the Owls: First Snow|title=[[Batman Annual]]|volume=2|issue=1|date=July 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>

The Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives, but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]]. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and take Nora, whom he believes to be his wife, so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora. Batman defeats Mr. Freeze by injecting his suit with the thawing formula, which he had intended to use to revive Nora from suspended animation.

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Mr. Freeze appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] arrived from their world.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=[[Richard Friend|Friend, Richard]]|colorist=[[Sonia Oback|Oback, Sonia]]|letterer=[[Rob Leigh|Leigh, Rob]]| editor=[[Brian Cunningham|Cunningham, Brian]]|story=Nightfall| title=[[Forever Evil]]|volume=1|issue=1|date=November 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]] later visits Mr. Freeze to let him know of the war going on at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Szymon Kudranski|Kudranksi, Szymon]]|inker=[[Szymon Kudranski|Kudranksi, Szymon]]|colorist=[[John Kalisz|Kalisz, John]]|letterer=[[Dezi Sienty|Sienty, Dezi]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=City of Fear| title=The Scarecrow|volume=2|issue=23.3|date=November 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> The [[Man-Bat]]s are able to bring the remaining Talons to Mr. Freeze after Man-Bat and Scarecrow steal them from Blackgate.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Scot Eaton|Eaton, Scot]]|inker=[[Jaime Mendoza|Mendoza, Jaime]]|colorist=[[Andrew Delhouse|Delhouse, Andrew]]|letterer=[[Taylor Esposito|Esposito, Taylor]]|editor=[[Rachel Gluckstern|Gluckstern, Rachel]]|story=Batman Death March| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Arkham War]]|volume=1|issue=1|date=December 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Scot Eaton|Eaton, Scot]]|inker=[[Jaime Mendoza|Mendoza, Jaime]]|colorist=[[Andrew Dalhouse|Dalhouse, Andrew]]|letterer=[[Travis Lanham|Lanham, Travis]]|editor=[[Rachel Gluckstern|Gluckstern, Rachel]]|story=Das Bat!| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Arkham War]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=February 2014| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> Mr. Freeze and [[Clayface]] later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[Brian Buccellato|Buccallato, Brian]]|penciller=[[Scott Hepburn|Hepburn, Scott]]|inker=[[Andre Coehlo|Coehlho, Andre]]|colorist=[[Nick Filardi|Filardi, Nick]]|letterer=[[Dezi Sienty|Sienty, Dezi]]|editor=[[Brian Cunningham|Cunningham, Brian]]|story=Dark Knight| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=February 2014| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}</ref> Mr. Freeze tells [[Mirror Master]] II he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their heads, only to use [[Weather Wizard]] to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham.

Victor Fries appears in the 2017 series [[Batman: White Knight]]. In this series, Victor Fries has retired from his criminal lifestyle to focus on curing his wife's disease. It is later revealed that, due to his unique, cryogenically-dependent physiology, Fries's aging had been slowed considerably, and that his father was a member of the Nazi SS during the Second World War, but acted as a double agent, allowing America to stay one step ahead of Germany on the Scientific front. As a result of this, a massive freeze cannon was constructed beneath a lighthouse off the coast of [[Gotham City]]. The superweapon is discovered by Neo-Joker (the second [[Harley Quinn]] who felt that by taking pills to retain his sanity, [[Joker (character)|Jack Napier]] was destroying the most beautiful part of himself), and is used to freeze most, if not all, of Gotham. Freeze is able to reverse the effects with the aid of [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. It is also revealed that Fries had been contacted by Batman in an attempt to secure the villains aid to save the life of [[Alfred Pennyworth]], but unfortunately their efforts were in vain.

While the George Sanders version wore the classic refrigerated suit, the Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach versions wore a "Freeze Collar" around their neck that went with Mr. Freeze's cooling suit. Before Mr. Freeze was on the series, he was always called Mr. Zero. In this version, he continues to be [[camp (style)|campy]] like the comic books and is given an alias of "Dr. Art Schivel". In his first appearance "Instant Freeze", it is revealed that it was [[Batman]] who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on Schivel during an attempted arrest. Freeze ends up stealing diamonds from the Gotham City Diamond Exchange. When Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] try to stop him, he freezes them with his freeze gun. In the next episode "Rats Like Cheese", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles and offers to return his hostage in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin save Diamante and apprehend Freeze. During this appearance, Mr. Freeze's hideout has "warm lights" so that his henchmen can interact with him. In the episode "Green Ice", Mr. Freeze escapes from prison and captures [[Miss Iceland]] from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode "Deep Freeze", Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to his bribes. Batman and Robin managed to find Freeze's hideout, rescue Miss Iceland, and defeat Freeze before he can freeze all of Gotham. Batman arranges for Warden Crichton to have a special refrigerated cell made for Mr. Freeze. In the episode "Ice Spy", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Icelandic scientist Professor Isaacson in order to obtain an "Instant Ice" formula. In the episode "The Duo Defy", Mr. Freeze finally obtains the "Instant Ice" formula and ends up building a large freeze ray. He is thwarted by Batman and Robin again. As he is taken away by the police, Freeze tells the police officers not to touch the Freeze Collar's dials.

To this end, he freezes Gotham's citizens with a cryogenic gun and uses them as test subjects. Horrified at what Victor has become, Nora indirectly kills herself during one of the experiments (replacing a perfected coolant with a failed, lethal formula).

Home Video}}</ref> Cryogenic scientist Victor Fries was working for Gothcorp and [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds for an experiment in order to save his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife [[Nora Fries]] by cryogenically freezing his wife until a cure could be found. However, the company's CEO Ferris Boyle (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) broke into the lab with guards, demanding an end be put to the experiment. When Fries desperately grabbed a security guard's pistol to aim at Boyle, the corrupt CEO kicked him into a table of chemical beakers filled with cryogenic substance, leaving Victor to die. He survived but was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances. Unable to live outside subzero conditions, he wears a cryogenic suit to survive and also triples his strength. Mister Freeze is introduced in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning episode "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series)|Heart of Ice]]" (for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program). He steals the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his vendetta against Boyle. This leads to Freeze's first confrontation with Batman. When he freezes Boyle up to the waist, Boyles now begging for his life, Freeze confronts Batman, fighting one-on-one until Freeze's transparent head dome is broken when Batman uses [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s thermos of [[chicken soup]], inducing [[thermal shock]] and rendering Freeze unconscious. The Dark Knight then presents evidence of Boyle's crime involving Nora to the press and leaving Boyles in this frozen condition for his horrible act. Freeze is imprisoned in a special [[Arkham Asylum]] cell kept at subzero temperatures.<ref name="Heart of Ice">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|title=Heart of Ice|quote=Mr. Freeze targets the industrialist responsible for his wife's death.|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428110756/http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|archivedate=2008-04-28|df=}}</ref> Mister Freeze later appears in the episode "Deep Freeze". After being kidnapped by a giant robot and brought to the off-shore Oceana city, he meets billionaire amusement park designer Grant Walker (voiced by [[Daniel O'Herlihy]]), a man that wants to become immortal like Freeze to create a frozen world for selected residents. Freeze agrees to help when Walker promises to cure Nora. Batman and Robin arrive and try to reason with Freeze that if he were to help Walker, Nora would hate him. Freeze eventually turns on Walker, freezing his benefactor to a wall. Freeze overloads Oceana's power-core which starts the city's destruction as he instructs its inhabitants to evacuate. Freeze stays behind to die with his wife, and he along with Nora and Walker disappear in the explosion. The episode's ending reveals that they all survive, trapped in [[iceberg]]s.<ref name="Deep Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/df.html|title=Deep Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> Mister Freeze's next appearance is in the direct-to-animated film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''. After Nora's tank is shattered, Freeze kidnaps [[Barbara Gordon]] to harvest organs to cure Nora. Freeze makes a deal with greedy former colleague Gregory Belson (voiced by [[George Dzundza]]) to help cure his wife in exchange for gold. Batman and Robin thwart this plan and Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig. Wayne Enterprises then finances a surgery that saves Nora's life. Freeze is last seen at the [[North Pole]], crying tears of joy as he learns of Nora's recovery. 
** Mister Freeze appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', sporting a new, sleeker design.<ref>{{cite video|date=2005|title=Batman: The Animated Series Volume Four|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Brother Home Video}}</ref> As his mutation slowly destroys his body, Victor Fries kidnapped two scientists (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Lauren Tom]]) to try and stop the process, only succeeding in saving his head which is supported by four robotic legs built separately from his suit. When a cured Nora Fries married her own doctor and left Gotham permanently, the [[psychological trauma|trauma]] destroys whatever is left of Fries' humanity. Mister Freeze vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered in the episode "Cold Comfort" by taking away the things they value most, much to the confusion of [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and Batgirl. When Freeze is confronted at his hideout by Batman and Batgirl, he reveals his true condition to them as well as his goal of destroying [[Gotham City]] &mdash; all the Dark Knight holds dear &mdash; by dropping a 'reverse fusion bomb' that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb. However, he is followed by Batman and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses a grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Although Freeze is presumed dead, his head is seen to be missing as the episode ends.<ref name="Cold Comfort">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/tnba/cc.html|title=Cold Comfort| accessdate= 2008-05-09| publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |episodelink= |series=The New Batman Adventures |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

** In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', several of Mister Freeze's guns have been procured by the elderly Bruce Wayne and are displayed in the Batcave. The new [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] (Terry McGinnis) uses one to freeze [[Inque]] in the episode "Black Out", however, Inque destroys this one in the episode "Disappearing Inque". Another one is seen in the Batcave's background during subsequent episodes. The tragic villain personally appears in the episode "Meltdown". His disembodied head is revealed to have [[Immortality|survived for decades]] thanks to cryogenic technology. Wayne-Powers' CEO [[Derek Powers]] and Dr. Stephanie Lake (voiced by [[Linda Hamilton]]) use him as a test subject for a process that could cure Powers's own mutation. Transferring his mind into a [[cloning|clone]] built from his own baseline [[DNA]], Victor Fries sees this as a second chance. Fries initially tries to right some of the wrongs he has committed by creating a charitable organization with all his legitimate earnings from before he was imprisoned, which impresses Terry. However, Victor's new body soon begins to revert to his original body's same subzero [[biology]]. Although Lake and Powers betray him when he returns to Wayne-Powers for help, Fries escapes. After recovering an advanced suit of sub-zero armor that fires ice blasts directly out of gauntlets equipped onto his hands, Mister Freeze seeks revenge by freezing Lake and Powers and attempting to blow up Wayne-Powers' complex to commit suicide. In the middle of his plan, Freeze battles Batman and then fights with Blight. Freeze redeems himself by saving the new Dark Knight from Blight. Batman attempts to rescue Freeze from the collapsing building, however, Freeze refuses help and presumably dies in the explosion.<ref name="Meltdown">{{cite web| url= http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/bb/meltdown.html| title= Meltdown| accessdate= 2008-05-09| publisher= Toon Zone}}</ref><ref name="BB - Meltdown">{{cite episode |title=Meltdown |episodelink= |series=Batman Beyond |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

[[Image:Ourgovernor.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Mr. Freeze in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'']]
* Mr. Freeze appears as the main antagonist in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (who received top billing ahead of George Clooney, who portrayed Batman). In the film, Dr. Victor Fries was in an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the (fictional) [[terminal illness]] MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a [[diamond]]-powered subzero suit to keep cold or he would die. Mister Freeze crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's [[life support]] and deceives Mister Freeze into thinking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to freeze up Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl in which she brags about killing Nora, revealing her real colours to him. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and trechery. The character's penchant for cold and ice-related puns was noted by critics.<ref>{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html |title=Batman and Robin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=May 23, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970620/REVIEWS/706200301 |title=Batman & Robin |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] of [[Reelviews]] commented that "Schwarzenegger, aside from looking like a cross between the [[Michelin Man]] and [[Robocop]], appears totally confused about what he's doing.

* Mr. Freeze is also one of the main villains in the PC game ''Toxic Chill''. Mr. Freeze pairs up with the Riddler in an attempt to change the very weather of Gotham.

It is suggested that Mr. Freeze tortures the Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Robert Kraft]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Freeze appears when the player, using a Villain character, is attempting to steal some diamonds from a Wayne Enterprises warehouse. Joker orders the player via communicator to give the diamonds to Freeze, only to later command him or her to go inside Freeze's base in Gotham Mercy Hospital and steal the diamonds back, right when Freeze is once again trying to bring back Nora and thus sabotaging the procedure. The villain player must then confront Mr. Freeze, who is enraged and willing to kill the player. Freeze also appears in the Arkham Asylum alert, where he has allied with Scarecrow and Poison Ivy to spread chaos in the Asylum, under doctor Jeremiah Arkham's orders. Freeze has taken over one of the wings in the asylum, covering the whole area with ice and snow.

He joins the group to retrieve the LOTUS virus, hoping to use it to cure Nora. However, during the raid at the lab where it is kept, he is betrayed by Quinn and infected with the virus.

Regardless of the decision, his fate is left ambiguous.

====Lego====
* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He appears as an enemy of [[Batman]], a follower of the [[Riddler]],<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> and the second boss of Chapter 1 "The Riddler's Revenge." In it his design is based mainly on the animated series, and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins. The Riddler assigns him to get a freeze cannon in his old factory. It is shown in the story that, while he aids the Riddler in his pursuit for Gotham City's Gold Reserves, he is shown to be formulating plans of his own, which involve raising an army of Freeze Maids, which he uses in his boss fight. The player has to be quick, and attack him right after he shuts down his freeze gun. After he's defeated, he attempts to run away, but Batman throws a Batarang at him, causing his pack to backfire and make him bounce across the room and then land on the floor in front of Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] playing with dolls of him and a freeze girl. 
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a cameo in the fourth level "Asylum Assignment" where he is seen in a cell constantly tapping on the glass. In Free-play mode, the player can actually kill him once s/he sends one of the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin's]] bombs inside and attack him. Outside of the story, he appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character found at the observatory. His intro catchphrase is, "Is it just me, or is it really cold in here?"
* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] through an [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] impression. He first appears as a boss in the story, on which player helps [[Plastic Man]] defeat him in the Watchtower so that they can proceed to defeat [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The player as Batman in his Sensor-suit must attack Mr. Freeze while the character is in stealth mode. Mr. Freeze is later found in [[Qward]] in a side-quest where he requests the player to find another fuel cell for his freezer after the other was damaged by [[Killer Moth]]. The ''Batman Beyond'' version of Mr. Freeze is also playable via downloadable content.
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced again by [[Eric Bauza]].<ref>[http://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc18-lego-dc-super-villains-cast-and-devs-dish-on-funever-evil/]</ref><ref>[https://mailchi.mp/mi5communications/lego-dc-super-villains-reveals-darkseids-villainy-in-action-in-new-clip-890165?e=49aaf48973]</ref>

====''Batman: Arkham''====
* Mr. Freeze appears in the ''Batman Arkham'' series where he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Mr. Freeze's frost and icicles covered cell can be seen in the Penitentiary area which can be scanned to unlock his bio. According to the game's writer [[Paul Dini]], Freeze was originally planned to be featured in the game, but his inclusion was dropped as he didn't fit as part of the game.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6126146/Batman-Arkham-Asylum-interview-with-Paul-Dini.html</ref>
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', he appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cryus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows [[Ra's al Ghul|someone]] who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure, and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries]] from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: "Get well soon!" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]] had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure, and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', his origins and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC Story "Cold, Cold Heart" which is based on the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "Heart of Ice". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the DLC featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to backstab Mr. Freeze into giving him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold, and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze, and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voice-over states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.
** Mr. Freeze is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze hasn't been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December "Season of Infamy" downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side misson "In From The Cold". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryochamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It's also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies "merely days". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Fries'.
** Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld''. He is unlocked after the player completes a mission for him, after which he becomes playable, wielding his freeze gun with different firing modes.

===Web series===
* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She blames Freeze for Nora's death, and dons his freezing equipment in a quest for revenge. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.
* In the ''[[Batman Unlimited]]'' shorts, Mr. Freeze appears on a rampage in a gigantic robot suit. Batman manages to destroy the suit and Freeze ejects. Freeze then attacks Batman only for Batman to shatter his helmet. Batman puts a gas mask on him and handcuffs him, comforting Mr. Freeze until the cops arrive.

===Miscellaneous===
* Mr. Freeze appears in the direct-to-video original animation ''[[DC Super Friends]]: The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010), voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].
