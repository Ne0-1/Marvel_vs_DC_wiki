'''Mr. Freeze''', real name '''Dr. Victor Fries''' (pronounced as Victor "Frees" or "Freeze"), is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 ([[1959#February|February 1959]]).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

Freeze is a scientist who must wear a [[cryogenic]] suit in order to survive, and bases his crimes around a "cold" or "ice" theme, complete with a "cold gun" that freezes its targets solid. In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former [[cryogenic]]s expert who suffered an industrial accident while attempting to treat his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]].

In the original ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played in various episodes by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]].  He was voiced in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' by [[Michael Ansara]], and by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.  In the 1997 film, ''[[Batman and Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]'', he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Overview==
Originally called '''Mr. Zero''',<ref name="UGO - Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/|title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[UGO]]}}</ref> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.<ref name="Freeze 1"/><ref name="Freeze 2"/><ref name="Freeze 3"/> Over two decades later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]],'' retold Mr. Freeze’s [[origin story|origin]], introducing his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], [[cryogenics|cryogenically]] frozen wife, which greater explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/>

Elements of this [[back story]] were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
From the time of his first appearance in 1958 onward, '''Mr. Freeze''' was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|The Mad Hatter]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Originally called Mr. '''Zero''',<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. '''Freeze''' (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "Dr. Schimmel"),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. 

Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Freeze would owe even more to television. In the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "[[Heart of Ice (Batman episode)|Heart of Ice]]", he was made into a more complex, [[tragic]] character.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> This version of Mr. Freeze was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Modern Age===
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|right|175px|thumb|''Batman'' #121 (1959), the first appearance of Mr. Freeze as "Mr. Zero". Cover art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] [[continuity]] [[book series|series]], it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills [[cryogenic]] chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing sub-zero temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

As a child, he is fascinated by freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", send him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he is miserable, feeling detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he falls in love with and ultimately marries.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Nora later falls [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. Freeze takes on a job working for a large company run by the ruthless Ferris Boyle. Freeze discovers a way to put Nora into [[Suspended animation|cryo-stasis]] (using company equipment without permission), and places her in that state hoping to sustain her until a cure could be found. Boyle finds out about the experiment and attempts to have her brought out of [[stasis]], overruling Freeze's frantic objections. A struggle ensues, in which Boyle kicks Freeze into a table full of chemicals and leaves him for dead. Freeze survives, but his body temperature is lowered dramatically; he can now only live at [[sub-zero]] temperatures, forced to wear a special refrigerating suit to stay alive. As Mr. Freeze, he uses cryonic technology to create a gun, which fires a beam that freezes any target within its range.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/622/622304p2.html|title=IGN: The Best & Worst Batman Villains|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2005-06-03|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

His first act as a costumed criminal is to take revenge upon Boyle, a plan with which Batman interferes.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref name="Heart of Ice"/> Mr. Freeze fires his freeze-gun at Batman, but he dodges, causing the beam to shatter Nora's capsule. Freeze blames Batman, and swears to destroy whatever the Dark Knight holds dear (mainly [[Gotham City]], and eventually [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> In addition, he hardly ever forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone, although he has worked as a hired enforcer/hitman for the [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]].<ref name="The Batman - episode">{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Burnett|url=http://www.tv.com/the-batman/the-batman-superman-story-1/episode/1127696/recap.html|title=The Batman: The Batman/Superman Story (1) Recap|accessdate=2008-05-11|date=2007-09-22|publisher=TV.com}}</ref>

In ''[[Villains United]]'' #1, Freeze has frozen everyone inside a courtroom. While using a frozen man as a chair, he talks with the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], who convinces him to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. During his time with the group, he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted [[Lazara]], and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and estranges herself from him.<ref>{{Cite comic

He is usually imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]] when apprehended by Batman, as it is the only facility in Gotham that can accommodate his medical requirements for a refrigerated cell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.batmantas.com/cmp/freeze.htm|title=Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-18|publisher=Batman The Animated Series}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>  In darker incarnations of the Batman [[mythos]], Mr. Freeze's obsession with ice stems from personal tragedy, and his crimes are inspired by his desire to make the rest of the world as miserable as he is.<ref name="Cold Comfort"/>  He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld "cold gun".  His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> He has even shown to be a formidable opponent for [[Superman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=1262|title=Batman: No Man's Land Volume 3|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>  Some interpretations suggest that because Fries has been soaked in the serum he intended to use for cryo-preservation, his age progression has slowed drastically.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/>

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate sub-zero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit.  However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and Purgatory in Central Park, he reverted back to his original subzero biology.  He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.<ref>{{Cite comic

===Animated abilities===
According to ''Batman: The Animated Series'', Freeze understands how to reproduce his powers.<ref name="BTAS"/>  Upon being offered enough money to bankroll large scale research into Nora's condition, Freeze turns the wealthy, terminally ill Grant Walker into another "Mr. Freeze"-like being (on the theory that the "Mr. Freeze condition" would arrest the disease).  However, Walker reveals that he wants to use his new abilities to turn the world into a frozen wasteland, leaving him and a few chosen followers to live eternally in Oceana, his underwater "World of Tomorrow".  Freeze imprisons him in a block of ice as Oceana collapses around him.  For two years, Walker remains in the iceberg, driving him [[insanity|insane]].<ref name="Deep Freeze"/>  Although he does not reappear in the animated series, the "second Mr. Freeze" reappeared in the comic book ''[[Batman: Gotham Adventures]]'' (based on the cartoon of the same name).  In his last appearance, he breaks into the Wayne Foundation and kidnaps all of the scientists working to cure the original Mr. Freeze.  With Batman out of action due to a concussion, [[Batgirl]], [[Nightwing]], and Robin save the scientists, with the help of Mr. Freeze.  Walker is eventually caught after a short fight with Freeze, and then sent to Arkham.<ref name="Cold Comfort"/>

In ''The Batman'', Freeze has the ability to generate ice and cold with his hands.<ref name="TB - Big Chill">{{cite episode |title=The Big Chill |episodelink= |series=The Batman |serieslink= |credits=Seung Eun-Kim |network=The WB |station= |airdate=2004-11-06 |season=1 |number=5 |minutes= }}</ref>

[[Image:Mister Freeze BTAS.jpg|195px|left|thumb|Mr. Freeze as depicted in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.

In his appearances in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its spin-offs, Mr. Freeze is voiced by [[Michael Ansara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/actors/villains.html#ansara|title=Batman: The Animated Series - Actors - Villains|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> 

Freeze is introduced in the episode "[[Heart of Ice (Batman episode)|Heart of Ice]]", which won an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program. Freeze leads a band of henchmen and makes several raids on the company Gothcorp, stealing the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his battle against the company. This leads to his first confrontation with Batman, whom he defeats easily and traps in a block of ice. Later on, before another attack on Gothcorp after the machine is complete, Freeze catches Batman in the security room, watching an archive video revealing Freeze's [[tragedy|tragic]] origin. While working for Gothcorp, Victor Fries had been using illegal funding for an experiment to save his dying wife, Nora, by cryogenically freezing her to preserve her until a cure could be found. At the last moment, however, the ruthless Gothcorp CEO, Ferris Boyle, had broken into the lab with guards and kicked Fries into a batch of chemicals, leaving him to die. Fries survived, but was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances and transformed into Mr. Freeze. Now, on a vendetta against Boyle, Freeze traps Batman and leaves him in his hideout, confronting Boyle at the Gothcorp Humanitarian Party and freezing him up to the waist. Batman, however, escapes and confronts Freeze at the party, fighting him one-on-one until he breaks Freeze's helmet with a flask of chicken soup. Freeze is defeated, and arrested along with Boyle, as Batman presented evidence of Boyle's crimes to the press. Freeze is then imprisoned in Arkham.<ref name="Heart of Ice">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|title=Heart of Ice|quote=Mr. Freeze targets the industrialist responsible for his wife's death.|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref>

Freeze later appears in "Deep Freeze", where he is sprung out of prison (against his will) and taken to an off-shore city named Oceana by an [[android]] owned by theme-park builder Grant Walker, who is fascinated with Freeze and needs his technology to condition his body to become like Freeze's, for his maniacal plan of a Global Deep Freeze to create a new world for his selected residents of Oceana. Freeze, at first, refuses to help Walker, but when Walker shows Freeze his wife, alive but still cryogenically frozen, Freeze accepts. Batman and Robin arrive and tell him that if Freeze helps Walker freeze Gotham, Nora would hate him. Freeze finally sees the truth, and helps Batman and Robin stop Walker at the last minute. Freeze battles Walker, who has been placed in a cryo-suit identical to Freeze's, and wins by pinning Walker to a wall with his gun. Freeze then proceeds to overload Oceana's power-core, blowing the city to smithereens and warning the inhabitants to flee for their lives. Freeze opts to stay behind and die with his wife, and freezes Robin to stop Batman from following him. Freeze, Nora and Walker disappear in the explosion, but the episode's end reveals that they all survive, temporarily trapped in [[iceberg]]s.<ref name="Deep Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/df.html|title=Deep Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref>

====''Batman and Mr. Freeze: SubZero''====
In the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Freeze has found a home in the Arctic and started a family (of sorts) with the still cryogenically-encased Nora, an [[Inuit]] boy named Kunac, and two pet [[polar bear]]s, Notchka and Chokka. Nora's condition begins to rapidly deteriorate due to a [[submarine]] accidentally emerging from underwater directly underneath them, shattering Nora's chamber.  Freeze returns to Gotham City with his companions, and enlists the help of Dr. Gregory Belson to find a cure. Belson determines that Nora needs an organ transplant, and due to her rare [[blood type]] there are not many suitable donors. Freeze declares that they will use a live donor. Belson is at first reluctant to kill an innocent girl, but Freeze bribes him with a gold nugget and even more gold from the Arctic that will put an end to Belson's financial problems. [[Barbara Gordon]] (a.k.a. [[Batgirl]]) is a perfect match, and Freeze learns from her roommate that she is at a restaurant with her boyfriend, [[Dick Grayson]] (Robin). Freeze attacks the restaurant and kidnaps Barbara, taking her to an abandoned oil rig where he and Belson are hiding. Freeze and Belson explain the situation to Barbara, who claims that she is willing to help Nora for the "blood transfusion", but not at the oil rig, prompting Freeze to chain Barbara in her room. The time for the operation comes, but Barbara escapes. Belson gives pursuit and almost catches her, but for the arrival of Batman and Robin. Freeze follows, and in the ensuing confrontation, Belson accidentally shoots one of the fuel tanks and starts a rapidly-spreading fire as Freeze traps Batman and Robin in a crane. Freeze insists that Belson perform the operation, despite the oil rig collapsing and ready to explode, but Belson betrays Freeze and attempts to escape alone, dying in the process (killed by falling wreckage). Freeze's leg is broken after a pile of rubble falls on him, and thus he decides to help Batman and Robin save him and Barbara as long as they find Nora and Kunac first. Nora, Kunac and Barbara are taken to safety in the Batwing (Freeze wished for them to be rescued first for Batman to come back for him), but Batman fails to save the weakened Freeze in time, due to a pipe falling on them and sending Freeze plummeting into the ocean below. The oil rig finally explodes, but Freeze escapes just in time and swims back to shore with Notchka and Chokka. Freeze then returns with his polar bears to the Arctic to resume his life alone, but sees on television that Nora has been revived after an organ transplant operation funded by Wayne Enterprises, moving him to tears.<ref>{{cite video|year=1998|title=Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros.}}</ref>

====''The New Batman Adventures''====
[[Image:Freeze-tnba.png|150px|thumb|right|Mr. Freeze as he appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'']]
In the ''[[New Batman Adventures]]'', Mr. Freeze featured a new, sleeker and darker look, in which his head is mounted on four thin, [[robot]]ic legs. Director [[Dan Riba]] admitted that his change was because of his recurring loss that his wife had no more hope for recovery, incorporating this darker, colder personality.<ref>{{cite video|year=2005|title=Batman: The Animated Series Volume Four|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Brother Home Video}}</ref> His robotic form crawled into a suit and locked into it.

In the episode "Cold Comfort", Mr. Freeze's wife, Nora, who has now fully recovered, having accepted that Freeze had likely been killed in the oil rig's collapse, has remarried the doctor assigned to her case and left Gotham permanently. Furthermore, he learns that the serum that mutated his body is slowly destroying it; although he has kidnapped many scientists to try and stop the process, they only succeed after the process has claimed all but his head. The [[psychological trauma|trauma]] of this revelation destroys what little remains of Freeze's humanity, and he begins committing crimes in order to inflict the loss he's suffered on others by taking away the things they value most. One of his targets, however, is Bruce Wayne, and he almost kills [[Tim Drake]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] at [[Wayne Manor]]. At his hideout, Freeze is confronted by an enraged Batman and [[Batgirl]], where he reveals his true condition to them and also his goal of taking away what Batman holds dear: all of Gotham, by dropping a Reverse Fusion Bomb that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb, but Batman follows him, and they engage in one last duel in which Batman emerges the victor by using his grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where they both disappear in an explosion that creates a huge iceberg. Freeze is presumed killed, but the episode's end reveals that Freeze's head is missing from his frozen armour,<ref name="Cold Comfort">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/tnba/cc.html|title=Cold Comfort|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |episodelink= |series=The New Batman Adventures  |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

====''Batman Beyond''====
{{main|Batman Beyond}}
In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', which is set 40 years in the future, Bruce Wayne still has one of Mr. Freeze's guns in the [[Batcave]]. His successor as Batman, [[Terry McGinnis]], uses it to freeze [[Inque]] when she infiltrates the Batcave.  

The episode "Meltdown" reveals that the disembodied head of Victor Fries survives the events of "Cold Comfort"; thanks to the cryogenics technology, he is now essentially [[immortal]]. Stephanie Lake, a doctor working for Derek Powers, uses Mr. Freeze as a test subject for a process she hoped would be able to cure Powers' condition. She creates a [[clone]] body for him and transfers Fries' mind into it. Given a normal life back, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he committed as a criminal. However, the new body soon begins to revert to the same sub-zero biology. Lake and Powers betray Fries, hoping to learn more from an [[autopsy]]. He escapes, recovers an old suit of sub-zero armor, and becomes Mr. Freeze again. He seeks revenge by killing Lake and by attempting to blow up up a Wayne-Powers complex (with both himself and Powers in it), but McGinnis foils the plan. Freeze redeems himself by saving Batman from Powers, now mutated into the [[supervillain]] Blight, but apparently perishes when he refuses to escape the exploding complex with Batman.<ref name="Meltdown"/><ref name="BB - Meltdown"/>

====''Gotham Girls''====
In the third season of the Flash series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: Dora Smithy, Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She dons his freezing equipment in a quest to wipe out every supervillain possible, by any means necessary, due to a misunderstanding that Mr. Freeze's actions killed her only sister. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.

Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 film)|Batman & Robin]]'', played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The film features a largely [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation of the character, although it includes the animated series version's tragic origin.

In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', he is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].<ref name="The Batman - episode"/> Mr. Freeze is a simple criminal who is condemned to life in a cryogenic suit by an accident while being pursued by Batman after a [[jewelry]] heist. The criminal runs into a cryogenics lab and is knocked into one of the freeze chambers, electrocuting him as his body is frozen. The accident turns him into a quasi-[[undead]] being that generates extreme cold around him; he is forced to wear a special suit (developed by a cryogenicist he coerces into working for him) to prevent him from freezing everything he comes in contact with. Batman has a hard time beating him, reaching the point where the criminal nearly freezes him alive. Alfred saves the day by making a winter-themed bat-suit which the Caped Crusader uses to defeat Mr. Freeze.<ref name="TB - Big Chill"/> In a later episode, Mr. Freeze teams up with [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]] to put Gotham in a permanent winter.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Fire and Ice |episodelink= |series= The Batman|serieslink= |credits=Seung Eun-Kim, Michael Jelenic |network=The WB |station= |airdate=2005-05-28|season=2 |number=21 |minutes= }}</ref> In "The Icy Depths", he competes against [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] to claim an umbrella that is in fact a map to a sunken treasure.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Icy Depths |episodelink= |series=The Batman |serieslink= |credits=Anthony Chun, Steven Melching |network=The CW |station= |airdate=2006-05-06 |season=3|number=38 |minutes= }}</ref>

In the episode "Artifacts", set in 2027, Freeze's powers increase to the point that he wears a special mech suit. However, he loses an unhealthy amount of weight and the use of his legs, and now uses mechanical spider legs. After a near-death escape, Freeze places himself in cryogenic suspension, until someone wakes him up 1,000 years in the future in 3027. Once his suit is repaired, Mr. Freeze resumes terrorizing Gotham. Eventually, law enforcement officers use the same methods saved for the future by Batman to defeat Freeze in case of his return, while confusing him with [[hologram]] projections.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Artifacts |episodelink= |series=The Batman |serieslink= |credits=Brandon Vietti, Greg Weisman |network=The CW |station= |airdate=2007-02-03 |season=4 |number=46 |minutes= }}</ref>
