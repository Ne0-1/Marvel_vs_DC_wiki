'''Mr. Freeze''', real name '''Dr. Victor Fries''' (pronounced as Victor "Frees" or "Freeze"), '''[[Ph.D]]''', is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 ([[1959#February|February 1959]]).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

Freeze is a scientist who must wear a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] suit in order to survive, and bases his crimes around a "cold" or "ice" theme, complete with a "cold gun" that freezes its targets solid. In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former cryogenics expert who suffered an industrial accident while attempting to treat his [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]].

In the original ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played in various episodes by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]].  He was voiced in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' by [[Michael Ansara]], and by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. In the 1997 film, ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html Mr. Freeze is Number 67]</ref>

==Overview==
Originally called '''Mr. Zero''',<ref name="UGO - Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/|title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[UGO]]}}</ref> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.<ref name="Freeze 1"/><ref name="Freeze 2"/><ref name="Freeze 3"/> Over two decades later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze’s origin in a landmark episode by writer [[Paul Dini]] , introducing his terminally ill, cryogenically frozen wife, which greater explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the complex moral motivations seen constantly in the rest of the series. This backstory was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been Fries' official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman since. This leads many fans to think of him as the most sympathetic villain.

Elements of this [[back story]] were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
From the time of his first appearance in 1958 onward, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|The Mad Hatter]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "Dr. Schivell"),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. 

Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Freeze would receive another update on television. In the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "[[Heart of Ice (Batman episode)|Heart of Ice]]", he was made into a more complex, [[tragic]] character.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> This version of Mr. Freeze was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Silver Age===
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|175px|thumb|''Batman'' #121 (1959), the first appearance of the character as "Mr. Zero". Cover art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] [[book series|series]], it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing [[wiktionary:subzero|subzero]] temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

===Modern Age===
[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]], Freeze was revamped utilizing Paul Dini's backstory. Dr. Victor Fries is an expert molecular biologist. As a child, he is fascinated by freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", send him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he is miserable, feeling detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he falls in love with and ultimately marries.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Nora later falls terminally ill. Fries takes on a job working for a large company run by the ruthless Ferris Boyle. Fries discovers a way to put Nora into [[Suspended animation|cryo-stasis]] (using company equipment without permission), and places her in that state hoping to sustain her until a cure could be found. Boyle finds out about the experiment and attempts to have her brought out of cryo-stasis, overruling Fries' frantic objections. A struggle ensues, in which Boyle kicks Fries into a table full of chemicals and leaves him for dead. Fries survives, but his body temperature is lowered dramatically due to mutations triggered by the chemicals; he can now only live at subzero temperatures and is thus forced to wear a special refrigerating suit to stay alive. As Mr. Freeze, he uses cryonic technology to create a gun, which fires a beam that freezes any target within its range.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/622/622304p2.html|title=IGN: The Best & Worst Batman Villains|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2005-06-03|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

His first act as a costumed criminal is to take revenge upon Boyle, a plan with which Batman interferes.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref name="Heart of Ice"/> Mr. Freeze fires his freeze-gun at Batman, but he dodges, causing the beam to shatter Nora's capsule. Freeze blames Batman, and swears to destroy whatever the Dark Knight holds dear (mainly [[Gotham City]], and eventually [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into <ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> so he hardly ever forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, such as the time he was a hired enforcer/hitman for the [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]].<ref name="The Batman - episode">{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Burnett|url=http://www.tv.com/the-batman/the-batman-superman-story-1/episode/1127696/recap.html|title=The Batman: The Batman/Superman Story (1) Recap|accessdate=2008-05-11|date=2007-09-22|publisher=TV.com}}</ref>

In ''[[Villains United]]'' #1, Freeze has frozen everyone inside a courtroom. While using a frozen man as a chair, he talks with the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], who convinces him to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. During his time with the group, he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted [[Lazara]], and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and estranges herself from him.<ref>{{Cite comic

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> In darker incarnations of the Batman [[mythos]], Mr. Freeze's obsession with ice stems from personal tragedy, and his crimes are inspired by his desire to make the rest of the world as miserable as he is.<ref name="Cold Comfort"/> He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld "cold gun". His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Some interpretations suggest that because the serum Freeze was soaked in was intended to be used for cryo-preservation, his age progression has slowed drastically.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/>

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit.  However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and Purgatory in Central Park, he reverted back to his original subzero biology.  He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.<ref>{{Cite comic

===Television===
====Live-action ''Batman'' TV series====
In the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders (actor)|George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]].<ref>[[:Wallach.Mr freeze tv series.jpg|thumb|[[Eli wallach]] as mr. freeeze in the [[Batman tv series]].</ref><ref name="Freeze 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze2.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 2|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze3.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 3|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref> 

Before Mr. Freeze was on the show he was always called Mr. Zero. The show's version of him continues to be campy like the comic books. 
In his first appearance, "Instant Freeze", it is revealed that it was Batman who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on him during an attempted arrest. Batman thus feels a certain amount of guilt for his condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/batman-1966/instant-freeze/episode/6142/summary.html|title=Batman (1966): Instant Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=TV.com}}</ref> Mister Freeze was also given a different name: Dr. Schivel.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Sanders and Wallach put on German accents for the role, while Preminger used his own Austrian accent.

====Filmation produced Batman series====
Mr. Freeze appeared in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' episode "The Cruel, Cool Mr. Freeze" voiced by [[Ted Knight]].

Mr. Freeze appears in one episode of [[Filmation]]'s 1977 animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', in which he is voiced by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. The Filmation series changes his origin, stating he was an [[extraterrestrial]] who would die if exposed to any temperature hotter than -50 degrees Fahrenheit, and that firearms from his world are used as "freeze guns".<ref>{{cite video|date=2007|title=The New Adventures Of Batman|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros.

====DC animated universe====
[[Image:Mister Freeze BTAS.jpg|195px|right|thumb|Mr. Freeze as depicted in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
Mr. Freeze appears in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' played by voice-actor [[Michael Ansara]] (who also played him in the spin-offs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/actors/villains.html#ansara|title=Batman: The Animated Series - Actors - Villains|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> His appearance in the series was designed by ''[[Hellboy]]'' creator [[Mike Mignola]], at the request of series creator [[Bruce Timm]]<ref name="BTAS">{{cite video|date=2004|title=Batman: The Animated Series|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Home Video}}</ref> Mr. Freeze is introduced in the episode "Heart of Ice", which won an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program. In flashback, viewers see that while working for the company Gothcorp, Victor Fries had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds for an experiment, in order to save his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife, Nora, by cryogenically freezing her until a cure could be found. At the last moment, however, Gothcorp CEO, Ferris Boyle, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]], broke into the lab with guards, demanding an end be put to the experiment. When a panicked Fries grabbed a pistol from a security guard and aimed it at Boyle, the CEO kicked Fries into a table of chemical beakers, leaving him to die. Fries survived, but was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances and transformed into Mr. Freeze. 

Freeze leads a band of henchmen and makes several raids on Gothcorp, stealing the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his battle against the company. This leads to his first confrontation with Batman, whom he defeats easily and traps in a block of ice. Later, before another attack on Gothcorp after the machine is complete, Freeze catches Batman in the security room, watching an archive video, revealing Freeze's tragic origin in flashback. Freeze traps Batman and leaves him in his hideout, confronting Boyle at the Gothcorp Humanitarian Party and freezing him up to the waist. Batman escapes, then confronts Freeze at the party, fighting him one-on-one until he breaks Freeze's protective helmet, rendering him unconscious. Batman then presents evidence of Boyle's crimes to the press; and leaves him half encased in ice. Freeze is imprisoned in Arkham in a special cell that is kept at ultralow temperatures.<ref name="Heart of Ice">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|title=Heart of Ice|quote=Mr. Freeze targets the industrialist responsible for his wife's death.|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref>

Freeze later appears in "Deep Freeze", in which he is taken from prison against his will and brought to an off-shore city named Oceana. There, he meets billionaire Grant Walker, who wants to become like Freeze so he can create a frozen world for selected residents. In return for Freeze's help, Walker promises to cure Nora. Batman and Robin arrive and try to reason with Freeze that if he helps Walker, Nora would hate him. Freeze eventually turns on Walker, pinning him to a wall. Freeze overloads Oceana's power-core, which starts the destruction of the city. Freeze stays behind to die with his wife, and they all disappear in the explosion, though the episode's end reveals that they survive, trapped in [[iceberg]]s.<ref name="Deep Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/df.html|title=Deep Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref>

In the direct to video movie, ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Nora's tank is shattered and Freeze kidnaps [[Batgirl]] in order to perform a vital organ transplant.  Batman and Robin thwart this plan and Mr. Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig.  Wayne Enterprises then finances Nora's surgery, saving her life, which Freeze overhears while watching in on researchers in the [[North Pole]].

[[Image:Freeze-tnba.png|150px|thumb|Mr. Freeze as he appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.]]
In the ''[[New Batman Adventures]]'', Mr. Freeze returns with a new, sleeker look, in which his head is mounted on four thin, [[robot]]ic legs, and which crawl and lock into a suit. Director [[Dan Riba]] admitted that his change was because of his recurring loss, and belief that his wife had no hope for recovery, leading to this darker, colder personality.<ref>{{cite video|date=2005|title=Batman: The Animated Series Volume Four|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Brother Home Video}}</ref> In the episode "Cold Comfort", Freeze learns that the serum that mutated his body is slowly destroying it; although he has kidnapped many scientists to try and stop the process, they only succeed after the process has claimed all but his head.  Because of this, Freeze felt unable to return to Nora who, believing her husband had died in the events of ''Subzero'', married the doctor assigned to her case and left Gotham permanently. The [[psychological trauma|trauma]] destroys whatever is left of Freeze's humanity, and he begins committing crimes in order to inflict on others the loss he's suffered, by taking away the things they value most. One of his targets is Bruce Wayne, and he almost kills [[Alfred Pennyworth]] at [[Wayne Manor]]. At his hideout, Freeze is confronted by Batman and Batgirl, and he reveals his true condition to them as well as his goal of taking away what Batman holds dear: all of Gotham, by dropping a "Reverse Fusion Bomb" that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb, but Batman follows him, and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses his grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Freeze is presumed killed, but the episode's end reveals that Freeze's head is missing from his frozen armor,<ref name="Cold Comfort">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/tnba/cc.html|title=Cold Comfort|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |episodelink= |series=The New Batman Adventures  |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

The story ends with Mr. Freeze's head falling into a pond at the [[Arctic]]. Deleted material from the comic portrays Ferris Boyle and Grant Walker being killed by the Mr. Freeze robot. While the end of the story is left ambiguous, it was intended for Mr. Freeze to be taken by Powers Technology and put in storage. The company's owner, Warren Powers, father of [[Derek Powers|Derek]], a ''Batman Beyond''' villain, states that the secret to [[immortality]] is locked inside that head.<ref name="World's Finest">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batribute/backstage/15.php|title=The World's Finest - Batman Adventures: #15|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=World's Finest}}</ref>

In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', which is set 50 years in the future, Bruce Wayne still has one of Mr. Freeze's guns in the [[Batcave]]. His successor as Batman, [[Terry McGinnis]], uses it to freeze [[Inque]] when she infiltrates the Batcave. The episode "Meltdown" reveals that the disembodied head of Victor Fries survives the events of "Cold Comfort"; thanks to the cryogenics technology, he now essentially possesses [[Immortality|eternal life]]. Stephanie Lake, a doctor working for Derek Powers, uses Mr. Freeze as a test subject for a process she hoped would be able to cure Powers' mutation (suffered in the series' pilot episode). She creates a [[clone]] body for him and transfers Fries' mind into it. Given a normal life, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he committed as a criminal. However, the new body soon begins to revert to the same sub-zero [[biology]]. Lake and Powers betray Fries when he returns to their lab for help, hoping to learn more from a [[biopsy]]. He escapes, recovers an old suit of sub-zero armor, and becomes Mr. Freeze again. He seeks revenge by killing Lake, freezing Powers, unintentionally revealing Powers' mutation into the villain Blight, and attempting to blow up a Wayne-Powers complex. Batman foils the plan while Freeze and Blight do battle. Freeze redeems himself by saving Batman from Blight, but apparently perishes when he refuses to escape the exploding complex with Batman.<ref name="Meltdown"/><ref name="BB - Meltdown"/> He later appears in the second issue of the ''Batman Beyond'' comic, revealing that he survived.

Mr. Freeze made two appearances in ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' comics. In the first, he claims that [[Captain Cold]] has stolen his freeze gun design, but in the second they are working together, alongside other cold-based villains.<ref>Justice League Adventures #12</ref> He never appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, but his freeze gun is used by [[Thanagar]]ian attackers in the Batcave, as seen in the episode "[[Starcrossed (Justice League episode)|Starcrossed]]".  It is fired in a desperate attempt to stop Superman, who blows the freeze charge back onto the Thanagarian leader.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Starcrossed |episodelink= |series=Justice League |serieslink= |credits=Butch Lukic, Dan Riba, Rich Fogel, Dwayne McDuffie |network=Cartoon Network |station= |airdate=2004-05-29 |season=2 |number=50, 51, 52 |minutes= }}</ref>

In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: Dora Smithy, Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She dons his freezing equipment in a quest to wipe out Gotham's supervillain, due to a misunderstanding that Mr. Freeze's actions killed her only sister. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.

====''The Batman''====

In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', he is played by voice-actor [[Clancy Brown]]. Unlike other sources, this Freeze was not a former cryogenics expert, but a simple criminal who is condemned to life in a cryogenic suit after an accident in a cryogenics lab while being pursued by Batman after a [[jewelry]] heist.<ref name="The Batman - episode"/>  The accident turns him into a being who generates extreme cold and is forced to wear a special suit to prevent him from freezing everything he comes in contact with.<ref name="TB - Big Chill"/> In a later episode, Mr. Freeze teams up with [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]] to put Gotham in a permanent winter.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Fire and Ice |episodelink= |series= The Batman|serieslink= |credits=Seung Eun-Kim, Michael Jelenic |network=The WB |station= |airdate=2005-05-28|season=2 |number=21 |minutes= }}</ref> In "The Icy Depths", he competes against [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] to claim an umbrella that is in fact a map to a sunken treasure.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Icy Depths |episodelink= |series=The Batman |serieslink= |credits=Anthony Chun, Steven Melching |network=The CW |station= |airdate=2006-05-06 |season=3|number=38 |minutes= }}</ref> He was hired by [[Lex Luthor in other media#The Batman|Lex Luthor]] (played by Clancy Brown), along with [[Black Mask]], [[Basil Karlo|Clayface]], and [[Bane]] to kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and use her as bait for Superman.

In the episode "Artifacts", set in 2027, Freeze's powers have increased to the point that he wears a special mecha suit. However, he loses an unhealthy amount of weight and becomes unable to walk, and now uses mechanical spider legs. After a near-death escape, Freeze places himself in cryogenic suspension, until someone wakes him up 1,000 years in the future in 3027. Once his suit is repaired, Mr. Freeze continues terrorizing Gotham. Eventually, law enforcement officers use methods saved for the future by Batman to defeat Freeze.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Artifacts |episodelink= |series=The Batman |serieslink= |credits=Brandon Vietti, Greg Weisman |network=The CW |station= |airdate=2007-02-03 |season=4 |number=46 |minutes= }}</ref>

The film features a largely [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation of the character, although it includes the animated series version's tragic origin. Throughout the movie, he spouts puns related to cold weather and temperatures (e.g., "You’re not sending me to the cooler!", "Allow me to break the ice", etc).

The suit, as in the comics and animated representations, is depicted as giving Freeze enhanced strength. Interestingly, Freeze possesses a cure for an early infection of the same virus from which his wife suffers, which he gives to Batman upon being defeated.

He is eventually betrayed and nearly killed by Riddler, who sets off a volcanic eruption. Both are sent to Arkham Asylum, and are made cellmates. It is suggested that Freeze tortures Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.
