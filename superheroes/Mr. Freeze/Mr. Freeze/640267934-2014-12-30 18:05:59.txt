'''Dr. Victor Fries''', also referred to as '''Mr. Freeze''', is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. He frequently serves as an enemy of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], David Wood and [[Sheldon Moldoff]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 (February 1959).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Freeze is a scientist who must wear a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] suit in order to survive, and bases his crimes around a "cold" or "ice" theme, complete with a "freeze gun" that freezes its targets solid. In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former cryogenics expert who suffered an [[industrial accident]] while attempting to cure his [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]].

Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]] in the original ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, and by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. He was also voiced by [[Michael Ansara]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |title=Mr. Freeze is Number 67 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

==Overview==
Originally called '''Mr. Zero''',<ref name="UGO - Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/|title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[UGO]]}}</ref> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.<ref name="Freeze 1"/><ref name="Freeze 2"/><ref name="Freeze 3"/>

Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze's origin in "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]", an episode by writer [[Paul Dini]]. The episode introduced his terminally ill, [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]], which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].<ref>''Robin II: Joker's Wild'' #1 (1991)</ref> Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol.1 #670 (1993)</ref>

The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the rest of the series. This back story was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been the character's official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman until New 52.

Elements of this origin story were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze| accessdate= 2008-05-08| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first1= Steve| last1= Daly| first2= Anne| last2= Thompson |date=8 March 1996}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
From the time of his first appearance in 1959 onwards, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "'''Dr. Schivel'''"),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. Three actors who portrayed Mr Freeze were [[George Sanders]]; [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]].

===Silver Age===
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|175px|thumb|''Batman'' #121 (1959), the first appearance of the character as "Mr. Zero". Cover art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] series, it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing [[wiktionary:subzero|subzero]] temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Modern Age===
[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-''Crisis'']], Freeze was revamped utilizing Paul Dini's backstory. '''Dr. Victor Fries''' (surname pronounced "freeze") was a brilliant [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]]. As a child, he was fascinated by freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", sent him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he was miserable, feeling detached from humanity. In college, he met a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he fell in love with and ultimately married.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

A year and a half after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, Nora contracts a terminal illness, while Fries works on a [[freeze ray]] for [[GothCorp]]. Fries' boss [[Ferris Boyle]] decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. Fries decides to use the device on Nora, to put her in [[suspended animation|cryo-stasis]]. His boss interrupts and tampers with the experiment, however, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first supervillain Batman faces in this continuity.

Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun. Batman eventually apprehends him, however.<ref>''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight'' #192-196: "Snow"</ref>

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructed a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman.

During his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted Lazara, and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and she estranges herself from him.

===The New 52===
During the [[Night of the Owls]] crossover as part of [[The New 52]], the Court of Owls send assassins known as Talons to kill almost 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr Freeze. [[Jason Todd|The Red Hood]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] choose to save him, and subsequently remand him into [[Batgirl]]'s custody.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #8 (2012)</ref>

''Batman Annual'' #1 introduces a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into a lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with an incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.

Eventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>''Batman Annual'' Vol. 2 #1 (2012)</ref>

The Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives, but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]]. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and take Nora, whom he believes to be his wife, so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora. Batman defeats Mr. Freeze by injecting his suit with the thawing formula, which he had intended to use to revive Nora from suspended animation.

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Mr. Freeze appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] arrived from their world.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref> [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]] later visits Mr. Freeze to let him know of the war going on at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]].<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol. 2 #23.3</ref> The [[Man-Bat]]s are able to bring the remaining Talons to Mr. Freeze after Man-Bat and Scarecrow steal them from Blackgate.<ref>''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #3</ref> Mr. Freeze and [[Clayface]] later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory.<ref>''Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion'' #3</ref> Mr. Freeze tells [[Mirror Master]] he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their head, only to use [[Weather Wizard]] to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham. As the Rogues are fighting the two, Black Mask (alongside his False Face society) arrives to capture the Rogues to receive the bounty.<ref>''Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld "Freeze gun". His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit.  However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and [[Purgatory (comics)|Purgatory]] in Central Park, he reverted to his original subzero biology. He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.<ref>{{Cite comic

* In the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders]] in the first two-part appearance, [[Otto Preminger]] in the second two-part appearance, and [[Eli Wallach]] in the third two-part appearance.<ref name="Freeze 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze2.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 2|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze3.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 3|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref> Sanders and Wallach used German accents for the role, while Preminger used his own Austrian accent. While the George Sanders version wore the classic refrigerated suit, the Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach versions wore a "Freeze Collar" around their neck that went with Mr. Freeze's cooling suit. Before Mr. Freeze was on the series, he was always called Mr. Zero. The series' version of him continues to be [[camp (style)|campy]] like the comic books and is given an alias Dr. Art Schivel. In his first appearance, "Instant Freeze", it is revealed that it was Batman who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on Schivel (portrayed by Sanders) during an attempted arrest. Mr. Freeze ends up stealing diamonds from the Gotham City Diamond Exchange. When Batman and Robin try to stop him, he freezes them with his freeze gun. In the next episode "Rats Like Cheese", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles and offers to return him in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin save Diamante and apprehend Mr. Freeze. During this appearance, Mr. Freeze's hideout has "warm lights" so that his henchmen can interact with him. In "Green Ice", Mr. Freeze (portrayed by Preminger) escapes from prison and captures [[Miss Iceland]] from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode "Deep Freeze", Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to his bribes. Batman and Robin managed to find Mr. Freeze's hideout, rescue Miss Iceland, and defeat Mr. Freeze before he can freeze all of Gotham. In "Ice Spy", Mr. Freeze (portrayed by Wallach) kidnaps Icelandic scientist Professor Isaacson in order to obtain an "Instant Ice" formula. In "The Duo Defy", Mr. Freeze finally obtains the "Instant Ice" formula and ends up building a large freeze ray. He is thwarted by Batman and Robin again. As he is taken away by the police, Mr. Freeze tells the police officers not to touch the Freeze Collar's dials.

* Mr. Freeze appeared in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' voiced by [[Ted Knight]]. The Filmation series has Mr. Freeze make extensive use of his self-made technology such as making certain parts of his hideout "warm corridors" to accommodate his underlings.<ref>{{cite video|date=2007|title=The New Adventures Of Batman|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Home Video}}</ref>

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' episode "The Deep Freeze" voiced by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. Unlike his appearance in the theme song, Mr. Freeze is shown without the helmet that goes with his freeze suit. He and his henchman Professor Frost plot to steal the N-1000 (a superfast submarine) to pull off the "Crime of the Century". When Batman and Robin raid his hideout, Mr. Freeze manages to freeze both of them and takes Robin with him as he escapes. When Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost steal the N-1000, they steer it to the [[North Pole]]. When Batman, Robin and [[Bat-Mite]] face Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost at the North Pole, Batman and Robin fire a beam that reverses the polarity of Mr. Freeze's freeze gun so that it warms up. They then apprehend Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost where they are both placed into prison.

[[Image:Mister Freeze BTAS.jpg|195px|left|thumb|Mr. Freeze depicted in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]According to flashbacks, cryogenic scientist Victor Fries was working for the company Gothcorp and [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds for an experiment in order to save his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]] by cryogenically freezing her until a cure could be found. However, Gothcorp CEO Ferris Boyle (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) broke into the lab with guards, demanding an end be put to the experiment. When Fries desperately grabbed a security guard's pistol and aimed it at Boyle, the corrupt CEO kicked him into a table of chemical beakers filled with cryogenic substance, leaving him to die. He survived, but was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances. Unable to live outside subzero conditions, he must wear a cryogenic suit to survive, which also triples his strength. He becomes the criminal "Mr. Freeze", and steals the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his vendetta against Boyle. This leads to his first confrontation with Batman, whom he traps in a block of ice. He then freezes Boyle up to the waist. Batman escapes, then confronts Mr. Freeze, fighting him one-on-one until he breaks a thermos of [[chicken soup]] on Freeze's transparent head dome, causing it to shatter with the induced [[thermal shock]], rendering Freeze unconscious. Batman then presents evidence of Boyle's crime to the press. Mr. Freeze is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum in a special cell that is kept at subzero temperatures.<ref name="Heart of Ice">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|title=Heart of Ice|quote=Mr. Freeze targets the industrialist responsible for his wife's death.|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> Mr. Freeze later appears in "Deep Freeze", in which he is kidnapped by giant robots and brought to an off-shore city called Oceana. There, he meets billionaire amusement park designer Grant Walker (voiced by [[Daniel O'Herlihy]]), who wants to become like Freeze so he can create a frozen world for selected residents. Mr. Freeze agrees to help when Walker promises to cure his wife. Batman and Robin arrive and try to reason with Freeze that if he were to help Walker, Nora would hate him. Freeze eventually turns on Walker, freezing him to a wall. Freeze overloads Oceana's power-core, which starts the destruction of the city as he instructs its inhabitants to evacuate. Freeze stays behind to die with his wife, and he, Nora and Walker disappear in the explosion. The episode's ending reveals that they all survive, trapped in [[iceberg]]s.<ref name="Deep Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/df.html|title=Deep Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> Mr. Freeze's next appearance is in the direct to animated film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''. After Nora's tank is shattered, Mr. Freeze kidnaps [[Barbara Gordon]], intending to harvest her organs to cure Nora. Mr. Freeze makes a deal with a greedy former colleague to help cure his wife in exchange for gold. Batman and Robin thwart this plan and Mr. Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig. [[Wayne Enterprises]] then finances a surgery that saves Nora's life. Mr. Freeze is last seen at the [[North Pole]], crying tears of joy as he learns of Nora's recovery.

Although he has kidnapped many scientists to try and stop the process, they only succeed after the process has claimed all but his head, which is supported by four robotic legs built into his suit. By this time, Nora has married the doctor assigned to her case and left Gotham permanently. The [[psychological trauma|trauma]] destroys whatever is left of Mr. Freeze's humanity, and he vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered by taking away the things they value most. One of his targets is Bruce Wayne, and he almost kills [[Alfred Pennyworth]] at [[Wayne Manor]]. At his hideout, Mr. Freeze is confronted by Batman and Batgirl, and he reveals his true condition to them, as well as his goal of destroying Gotham &mdash; and thus all Batman holds dear &mdash; by dropping a "reverse fusion bomb" that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb, but Batman follows him and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses his grappling gun to hook Mr. Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg.

** [[Image:Mr. Freeze (future).jpg|left|thumb|Mr. Freeze as he appears in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.]] In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Bruce Wayne still has one of Mr. Freeze's guns in the [[Batcave]]. His successor as Batman, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], uses the gun to freeze [[Inque]] in the episode "Black Out", but Inque destroys it in "Disappearing Inque". Yet another gun is seen in the Batcave's background in subsequent episodes. In the episode "Meltdown", Victor Fries' disembodied head is revealed to have survived for 40 years thanks to cryogenic technology, which has granted him [[Immortality|eternal life]]. Wayne-Powers CEO [[Derek Powers]] has Dr. Stephanie Lake (voiced by [[Linda Hamilton]]) use Fries as a test subject for a process she hopes will cure Powers' own mutation. She creates a [[cloning|clone]] body for Fries using his baseline [[DNA]] and transfers Fries' mind into it. Given a second chance, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he has committed, creating a charitable organization with all his legitimate earnings from before he was imprisoned. However, Fries' new body soon begins to revert to the same subzero [[biology]]. Lake and Powers betray Fries when he returns to their lab for help, but he escapes. After he recovers an advanced suit of sub-zero armor, Fries seeks revenge by freezing Lake and Powers and attempting to blow up a Wayne-Powers complex for suicide. In the middle of his plan, Freeze fights Batman and then does battle with Powers' villainous alter ago, Blight. Fries redeems himself by saving Batman from Blight, and Batman attempts to rescue Fries from the collapsing building.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] in a [[German language|German]] accent. He first appears in his [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] appearance (under the name "Mr. Zero") in the episode "Legends of the Dark Mite", where he is among the Batman villains in [[Bat-Mite]]'s fantasy. Batman defeats him by throwing a [[batarang]] at his helmet. Mr. Freeze makes a cameo in the teaser for the episode "Sidekicks Assemble" as one of the villain holograms that Robin, [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Aqualad]] fight. Mr. Freeze later appears in "[[Chill of the Night!]]" with a design resembling George Sanders' depiction. He is among the villains at a weapons auction held by [[Joe Chill]]. In "Bold Beginnings!", Mr. Freeze has captured [[Aquaman]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Plastic Man]]. Batman rescues them and recruits them to fight Mr. Freeze and his henchmen.

===Film===
[[Image:Ourgovernor.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Mr. Freeze in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].]]
* Mr. Freeze appears in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The film employs a variation of the most common origin story: He was formerly Dr. Victor Fries, who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]], who suffers from the [[terminal illness]] MacGregor's Syndrome. Freeze later crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mr. Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. Ivy cuts off Nora's life support and convinces Mr. Freeze that Batman was responsible for the deed; enraged, he vows to destroy Gotham City by freezing it solid. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, in which she brags about killing Nora. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham, where he exacts his revenge on Ivy, his new cellmate. The character's penchant for cold and ice-related puns was noted by critics.<ref>{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html |title=Batman and Robin |accessdate=2008-05-23 |date=1997-06-20 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970620/REVIEWS/706200301 |title=Batman & Robin |accessdate=2013-03-08 |date=1997-06-20 |work=Chicago Sun Times}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] of Reelviews commented that "Schwarzenegger, aside from looking like a cross between the [[Michelin Man]] and [[Robocop]], appears totally confused about what he's doing.

He also noted that Freeze's backstory and motivation were "too complex for Schwarzenegger to convey effectively (wasn't there a point when [[Patrick Stewart]] was being mentioned for this role?) or for [[Joel Schumacher|[director Joel] Schumacher]] to care about exploring. As a result, Mr. Freeze ends up being a frustratingly incomplete brute who's out to smother Gotham City under a blanket of ice."<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Berardinelli |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=770 |title=Batman and Robin |accessdate=2013-03-08 |date=1997-06-20 |work=ReelViews}}</ref> Robin Dougherty of [[Salon (website)|Salon]] lamented that "Schwarzenegger’s exuberance is pinned down.

*Although Mr. Freeze does not appear in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', his gadgets, including his Freeze Gun, are found by [[Killer Frost]] in Arkham Asylum's Warehouse.

===Video games===

* Mr. Freeze appears in the video game adaptation of the movie ''Batman & Robin''.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''Batman: Chaos in Gotham''.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman Vengeance]]''. He was seen targeting a scientist named Isaac Evers, whom he blames for sending him a video promoting Promethium gas in order to spite him, unaware that the real culprit was the Joker, who planned to use Freeze's invasion of the lab as a distraction for him to steal large quantities of the gas. Michael Ansara reprised his role as Mr. Freeze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/batman-vengeance|title=Batman Vengeance - MobyGames|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Moby Games}}</ref>

* He is also one of the main villains in the PC game ''Toxic Chill'', in which Mr. Freeze pairs up with the Riddler in an attempt to change the very weather of Gotham. He is eventually betrayed and nearly killed by the Riddler, who sets off a volcanic eruption. Both are sent to Arkham Asylum, and are made cellmates. It is suggested that Freeze tortures the Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.

* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He appears as an enemy of Batman and a follower of the [[Riddler]].<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> In it his design is based mainly on the animated series, and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins.

* Mr. Freeze's cell, covered in frost and icicles, can be seen in the Penitentiary area of ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' which can be scanned to unlock his bio.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' voiced by [[Robert Kraft]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Freeze appears when the player, using a Villain character, is attempting to steal some diamonds from a Wayne Enterprises warehouse. Joker orders the player via communicator to give the diamonds to Freeze, only to later command him or her to go inside Freeze´s base in Gotham Mercy Hospital and steal the diamonds back, right when Freeze is once again trying to bring back Nora and thus sabotaging the procedure. The villain player must then confront Mr. Freeze, who is enraged and willing to kill the player. Freeze also appears in the Arkham Asylum alert, where he has allied with Scarecrow and Poison Ivy to spread chaos in the Asylum, under doctor Jeremiah Arkham´s orders. Freeze has taken over one of the wings in the asylum, covering the whole area with ice and snow. The team of 4 players (Heroes or Villains) must defeat Freeze one time in his area, and then face him again when he is fighting side by side with Scarecrow and Ivy.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. He appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] poisons Batman he has the Dark Knight find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s men, who reveal that Penguin is holding Freeze hostage in the Cryus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that the Penguin stole Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat the Penguin. After the Penguin is apprehended and Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for the Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows someone who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries; [[Ra's al Ghul]]. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of Ra's' DNA to complete the cure, and Batman proceeds to track down Ra's using one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with a sample of Ra's' blood, Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries|Nora]] from the Joker. Batman fights Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: "Get well soon!" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]], had stolen the cure while he was distracted fighting Freeze. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure, and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character, found at the observatory.

* Mr. Freeze has an interactable object in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' in which the character can be frozen by it.

* Mr. Freeze's origins and first encounter with Batman is featured in the Story DLC of ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', ''Cold, Cold Heart'', with Maurice LaMarche reprising his role. The DLC is reportedly based on the "Heart of Ice" episode of ''Batman: The Animated Series''. Freeze also has a new design for the DLC featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds the Penguin trying to backstab Mr. Freeze into giving him what the cyrogenicist is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps the Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold, and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze, and that Boyle is in possession of Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife Nora. Batman later confronts Mr. Freeze and defeats him. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voice-over states that Mr. Freeze, the Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.

* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]]. His ''Batman Beyond'' version will also be playable via downloadable content.

===Web series===
* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She dons his freezing equipment in a quest to wipe out Gotham's supervillain, due to a misunderstanding that Mr. Freeze's actions killed her only sister. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.

===Merchandising===
Mr. Freeze is also the name of two [[Linear induction motor|LIM]] [[roller coaster]]s at two [[Six Flags]] parks ([[Six Flags St. Louis]] and [[Six Flags Over Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixflags.com/stLouis/rides/MrFreeze.aspx|title=Mr. Freeze: Six Flags, St. Louis|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Six Flags}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixflags.com/overTexas/rides/MrFreeze.aspx|title=Mr. Freeze: Six Flags Over Texas|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Six Flags}}</ref>
