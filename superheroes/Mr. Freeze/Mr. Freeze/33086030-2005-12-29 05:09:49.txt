'''Mister Freeze''' (Victor Fries) is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of [[Batman]]. He first appeared in ''Batman'' #121 (1959).

Originally called '''Mr. Zero''' (and on one occasion '''Dr. Zero'''), Mr. Freeze was renamed and popularized in the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|1960s Batman television series]]. Other interpretations of the character appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (as well as the [[direct-to-video]] off-shoot of the series ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'') and ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 movie)|Batman and Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Character history==

From the time of his first appearance in 1959 onward, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]], [[The Mad Hatter]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.  Originally called Mr. Zero, the producers of the 1960's ''[[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "Dr. Schimmell"), and the name quickly carried over to the comic books.  

Nearly thirty years later, Mr. Freeze would owe even more to television. In ''Batman: The Animated Series'', the "Heart of Ice" episode, he was made into a more complex, [[tragic]] character. This version of Mr. Freeze was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comicbook series themselves.

===Origin===
As shown in "Heart of Ice", Victor Fries was fascinated with freezing animals as a child, which would lead to his career in [[cryogenics]] research. He was sent to a strict [[boarding school]] by his father, where he met [[Nora Fries|Nora]], an attractive and gentle girl whom he subsequently [[marriage|married]].

Unfortunately, Nora later fell [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. Fries took on a job working for a large company run by the ruthless Ferris Boyle, working in his field. Fries did not like the job but needed money to help Nora. 

Fries discovered a way to put Nora into [[Suspended animation|cryo-stasis]], hoping to sustain her until a cure could be found. Boyle attempted to have her brought out of [[stasis]], overruling Fries' frantic objections. A struggle ensued, in which Boyle kicked Fries into a table full of chemicals and he was left for dead. He survived, but his body temperature was lowered dramatically, and from then on he could only live at [[sub-zero]] temperatures, forced to wear a special refrigerating suit to stay alive. As Mr. Freeze, he used cryonic technology to create a gun, which fired a beam that freezes any target within its range.

Mr. Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into, which seems to satisfy his urge to get even with a hard, cruel world. In addition, he hardly ever forges alliances with the other criminals in [[Gotham City]], preferring to work alone.

While he displays no obvious signs of [[insanity]] (at least, in comparison to the likes of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] or [[Two-Face]]) he is usually imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]] when apprehended by Batman. His cell is kept at sub-zero temperature to house him.

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific theme; in his case, [[ice]] and cold. In darker incarnations of the Batman mythos, Mr. Freeze's obsession with ice stems from personal tragedy, and his crimes are attempts to make the world as cold and miserable as he is. He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment. His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a rather more powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]]. Some interpretations also suggest that because he has been soaked in the serum he intended to use for cryo-preservation, his age progression has slowed drastically.

==In other media==
* In the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders (actor)|George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]]. In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its spin-offs, Mr. Freeze is voiced by [[Michael Ansara]]. 

* In the direct-to-video film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Freeze is initially happy, living in the [[Arctic]]. However, a submarine breaks through into the cave where he lives, causing a cave-in. As the floor cracks and splits, the glass cylander that contains Nora Fries tips over and shatters. Nora's condition begins to rapidly deteriorate, so Freeze enlists the help of Dr. Gregory Belsen to find a cure. Belson is strapped for cash, but agrees to work with Freeze in exchange for all of the [[gold]] from a large vein that Freeze discovered in the Arctic. Belson determines that Nora Fries needs a organ transplant, and due to her rare [[blood type]] there are not any suitable donors, so Freeze declares that they will use a live donor. Barbara Gordon (a.k.a. [[Batgirl]]) is a perfect match, so Freeze abducts her (with the help of his two [[polar bear]]s) and takes her to an abandoned [[oil rig]] out in the ocean that Freeze is using as a hideout. Batman discovers where Barbara is, and shows up to rescue her. During this time, the oil rig catches on fire. Batman manages to get Nora out safely with Freeze's help, but Freeze sustains damage to his suit and falls off of the rig into the ocean when the rig begins to fall apart. Later, Freeze learns that Nora has been cured, and he is overjoyed to know that his technology has saved her life.
* In the ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'' episode, ''Cold Comfort'', Mr. Freeze has returned, but any hope or happiness he may have had from Nora's return to life has left him. Nora, it turns out, had married Doctor Benson and left Gotham forever, so he has nothing left to live for. Freeze is plotting to release his vengeance on Gotham. The motive is revealed later in the episode: Freeze's body has deteriorated to the point where all that is left of him is his head. Batman tracks Freeze to his hideout, where it is revealed that Freeze's suit is mostly a robotic construct, and Freeze himself uses four spider legs to get around when he is not in his suit. Freeze plans to drop some sort of freezing bomb on Gotham city, but is overpowered by Batman, and is tied to his bomb and dropped into the sea.  
* Mr. Freeze was played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in the film ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 movie)|Batman and Robin]]'' where he teamed up with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. In this interpretation, he is a campy, "joke" character who spouts cold-related [[pun]]s ("You won't put me in the cooler!") His origin is largely the same, however, and he is not without sympathetic qualities.
* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', it is discovered that the disembodied head of Victor Fries did indeed survive the events of Cold Comfort ([[Batman: TAS]]) and that the cryogenic process had made him essentially immortal. A doctor working for [[Derek Powers]], the villain Blight, used him as a test subject for a process she hoped would be able to cure Powers' condition. She created a clone body for him, and transferred Fries' memories into it. Given a normal life back, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he did as a villain. However, the new body soon was found to suffer from the same condition as Fries' original body, and the doctor and Powers betray Fries, hoping to learn more from an autopsy. Fries escapes, recovers an old suit of armor, and becomes Mr. Freeze again. He seeks revenge on those who betrayed him, but is stopped by Batman. He manages to redeem himself by saving Batman from Blight, but apparently dies from his injuries. 
* In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', Mr. Freeze was a simple crook who was pursued by the Batman one night after a [[jewelry]] heist. Running into a cryogenics lab, he was knocked into one of the freeze chambers and electrocuted as his body was frozen. The experience somehow turned him into a quasi-[[undead]] being that constantly generated extreme cold around him; he was forced to wear a special suit (developed by a cryogenicist he coerced into working for him) to prevent him from freezing everything he comes in contact with. He could also (presumably) channel/focus his abilities, however. Batman had a hard time beating him until [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] made a winter-themed bat-suit which the Caped Crusader used to defeat Mr. Freeze. In a later episode, Mr. Freeze teamed up with [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]] to put Gotham in a permanent winter.  After Firefly stole a technological firm, Freeze made a break-in at Wayne Industries to get liquid canisters, but he was interfered by Batman, but Freeze makes an escape.  At the cyro-accelerator, he and Firefly freezes the police force, but Batman breaks free.  At the fight, Freeze was defeated by Batman, after he uses heat to melt Mr. Freeze's helmet, and he and Firefly are turned in by the police. Though his background is different, in a flashback of his accident there is a picture of him and a woman with him in his car, suggesting that Nora (or another love interest) does indeed exist in this universe of the Batman mythos. In this series, Mr. Freeze is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]].

==Trivia==
* In some spanish translations of the different Batman series, Mr. Freeze is mistakenly translated as "Capitán Frío". That name is a more accurate translation to another DC ice-themed villain's name: [[Captain Cold]]

*In [[Batman Beyond]],The appearance of Victor Freeze was originally going to be a brief comedic scene where Bruce sends Terry to the fridge to get him something to drink, and he opens it to find Victor's head staring back at him. The producers decided that joke didn't do the character justice and wrote this story

* The ''Batman TAS'' design was done by ''Hellboy'' creator Mike Mignola, at the request of Bruce Timm.

* Mr. Freeze is also the name of two [[LIM]] [[roller coasters]] at two [[Six Flags]] parks ([[Six Flags Saint Louis]] and [[Six Flags Over Texas]]
