'''Mr. Freeze''' (Dr. '''Victor Fries''') (Pronounced as Victor "Frees" or "Freeze") is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 ([[1959#February|February 1959]]).

Mr. Freeze was one of many [[gimmick]]-focused [[comic book]] villains. He was a [[mad scientist]] who plotted crimes around ice and cold. In most incarnations, this desire stems from a medical condition in which his body temperature was permanently lowered and he required a refrigerated “ice suit” to survive.

==Overview==
Originally called '''Mr. Zero''', he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors. Over two decades later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]],'' retold Mr. Freeze’s origin, introducing [[Nora Fries|his terminally ill, cryogenically frozen wife]], which greater explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds. The animated series version of Freeze was also more calm and composed than previous, campier versions and the [[comic book]] version has been altered to resemble it.

Elements of this personal tragedy, but not Freeze's calm demeanor, were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Fictional character biography==
From the time of his first appearance in 1959 onward, '''Mr. Freeze''' was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|The Mad Hatter]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.  Originally called Mr. '''Zero''', the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. '''Freeze''' (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "Dr. Schimmell"), and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. 

Nearly thirty years later, Mr. Freeze would owe even more to television. In ''Batman: The Animated Series'', the "[[Heart of Ice]]" episode, he was made into a more complex, [[tragic]] character. This version of Mr. Freeze was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Freeze was hastily resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.

===Modern Age===
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] [[continuity]], Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills [[cryogenic]] chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing sub-zero temperatures to survive. 

[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|left|175px|thumb|''Batman'' #121 (1959), the first appearance of Mr. Freeze as "Mr. Zero". Cover art by [[Curt Swan]].]]

In the ''Batman: Mr. Freeze'' special (based closely on the animated series episode "Heart of Ice") he is given a backstory.  As a child, he is fascinated by freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", send him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he is miserable, feeling detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he befriends and ultimately marries.

Nora later falls [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. Fries takes on a job working for a large company run by the ruthless [[Ferris Boyle]]. Fries discovers a way to put Nora into [[Suspended animation|cryo-stasis]] (using company equipment), hoping to sustain her until a cure could be found. Boyle finds out about the experiment and attempts to have her brought out of [[stasis]], overruling Fries' frantic objections. A struggle ensues, in which Boyle kicks Fries into a table full of chemicals and leaves him for dead. Fries survives, but his body temperature is lowered dramatically; he can now only live at [[sub-zero]] temperatures, forced to wear a special refrigerating suit to stay alive. As Mr. Freeze, he uses cryonic technology to create a gun, which fires a beam that freezes any target within its range.

His first act as a costumed criminal is to take revenge upon Ferris Boyle, a plan with which Batman interferes. Mr. Freeze fires his freeze-gun at Batman, but he dodges, causing the beam to shatter Nora's capsule. Freeze blames Batman, and swears to destroy whatever the Dark Knight holds dear (mainly [[Gotham City]], and eventually [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]). 

Mr. Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into. In addition, he hardly ever forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone, although he has worked as a hired enforcer/hitman for the [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. 

In "[[Villains United]]" #1, Freeze has frozen everyone inside a Gotham City courtroom. While using a frozen man as a chair, he talks with the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] on speakerphone, who convinces him to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. During his time with the group, he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However; she returns to life as the twisted [[Lazara]], and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and estranges herself from him.

He is usually imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]] when apprehended by Batman, as it is the only facility in Gotham that can accommodate his medical requirements for a refrigerated cell.

Most recently, he has been seen among the new [[Injustice League]] and is one of the villains featured in [[Salvation Run]].

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold. In darker incarnations of the Batman [[mythos]], Mr. Freeze's obsession with ice stems from personal tragedy, and his crimes are inspired by his desire to make the rest of the world as cold and miserable as he is. He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment. His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]]. Some interpretations also suggest that because he has been soaked in the serum he intended to use for cryo-preservation, his age progression has slowed drastically. In the cartoon The Batman he has the power to generate ice and cold with his hands

In the [[No Man's Land]] storyline, Fries was even shown to be a formidable opponent for Superman.

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate sub-zero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit. Unlike most villains granted superpowers by the demon, Mr. Freeze's new abilities were only temporary.

According to ''Batman: The Animated Series'', Freeze understands how to reproduce his powers. Upon being offered enough money to bankroll large scale research into Nora's condition, Freeze turns the wealthy, terminally ill Grant Walker into another "Mr. Freeze"-like being (on the theory that the "Mr. Freeze condition" would arrest the disease). However, Walker reveals that he wants to use his new abilities to turn the world into a frozen wasteland, leaving him and a few chosen followers to live eternally in Oceana, his underwater "World of Tomorrow". Freeze imprisons him in a block of ice as Oceana collapses around him. For two years, Walker remains in the iceberg, driving him insane. Although he does not reappear in the animated series, the "second Mr. Freeze" reappeared in the comic book ''[[Batman: Gotham Adventures]]'' (based on the cartoon of the same name). In his last appearance, he breaks into the Wayne Foundation and kidnaps all of the scientists working to cure the original Mr Freeze. With Batman out of action due to a concussion, [[Batgirl]], [[Nightwing]], and Robin save the scientists, with the help of Mr. Freeze. Walker is eventually caught after a short fight with Freeze, and then sent to Arkham.

==In other media==
===1960s TV Series===
In the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, '''Mr. Freeze''' was played by [[George Sanders (actor)|George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]]. In his first appearance (''Instant Freeze''), it is revealed that it was Batman who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on him during an attempted arrest. Batman thus feels a certain amount of guilt for his condition. Mister Freeze was also given a different name: Dr. Schivel.

===The New Adventures of Batman===
Mr. Freeze appears in one episode of [[Filmation]]'s 1977 animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', in which he is voiced by [[Lennie Weinrib]].

===Batman: The Animated Series===
{{main|Batman: The Animated Series}}
[[Image:Mister Freeze BTAS.jpg|120px|thumb|Mr. Freeze as depicted in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'']]
Mr. Freeze was a significant villain in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', as noted above, but is portrayed as a sympathetic villain. He is voiced by [[Michael Ansara]] in the series and its spin-offs. Mr. Freeze's appearance in the series was designed by ''[[Hellboy]]'' creator [[Mike Mignola]], at the request of series creator [[Bruce Timm]]. 

In the direct-to-video film ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Nora's condition begins to rapidly deteriorate due to an accident, so Freeze enlists the help of Dr. Gregory Belson to find a cure. Belson determines that Nora needs an organ transplant, and due to her rare [[blood type]] there are not many suitable donors. Freeze declares that they will use a live donor. [[Barbara Gordon]] (a.k.a. Batgirl) is a perfect match, so Freeze abducts her and takes her to an abandoned [[oil]] rig out in the ocean that Freeze is using as a hideout.

[[Image:Freeze-tnba.gif|thumb|left|Mr. Freeze in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.]]
In the ''[[New Batman Adventures]]'' episode, ''Cold Comfort'', Mr. Freeze has returned, but not to a happy reunion as he had hoped: Nora, having accepted that he had likely been killed in the oil rig's collapse, has remarried and left Gotham, leaving Mr. Freeze with nothing to live for. Furthermore, he learns that the serum that mutated his body is deteriorating it; although he has kidnapped many scientists to try and stop the process, they only succeed after the process has claimed all but his head. Afterwards, he begins committing crimes in order to inflict the loss he's suffered on others by taking away the things they value most.
Batgirl and Batman are able to save the scientists, (who were bound, gagged with duct tape, and hanging from meat hooks in a meat locker), from freezing to death, and Batman defeats Mr. Freeze in a brutal confrontation.

Freeze has made numerous appearances in the comics set in the same universe. In ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' issue #5 he was found shortly after the battle and back in action. He has made further appearances in ''Batman Adventures''. 

*Batman Adventures #15 was written to be the final story for Mr. Freeze. Though the issue's ending is ambiguous, it does set up for his eventual fate, as revealed in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. Nora finally encounters Victor after her new husband is nearly killed (In truth, the man had created a robot in Freeze's image to attack him to prove to Nora that her first husband was a monster). The story ends with Mr. Freeze's head falling into a pond at the [[Arctic]].
**Deleted material from the comic portrays Ferris Boyle and Grant Walker being killed by the Mr. Freeze robot. While the end of the story is left ambiguous, it was intended for Mr Freeze to be taken by Powers Technology and put in storage. The company's owner, Warren Powers (Father of [[Derek Powers|Derek]], one of ''Batman Beyond'''s chief villains) states that the secret to immortality is locked inside that head. <ref>[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batribute/backstage/15.php Worlds' Finest Onlne]</ref>

===Batman Beyond===
{{main|Batman Beyond}}
In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', which is set 40 years in the future, Bruce Wayne still has one of Mr. Freeze's guns in the [[Batcave]]. His successor as Batman, [[Terry McGinnis]], uses it to freeze [[Inque]] when she infiltrates the Batcave.  

In the episode "Meltdown," we learn that the disembodied head of Victor Fries survives the events of "Cold Comfort"; thanks to the cryogenics technology, he is now essentially [[Immortality|immortal]]. Stephanie Lake, a doctor working for Derek Powers, uses Mr. Freeze as a test subject for a process she hoped would be able to cure Powers' condition. She creates a clone body for him and transfers Fries' essence into it. Given a normal life back, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he committed as a criminal. However, the new body soon begins to revert to the same sub-zero biology as Fries' original body. The doctor and Powers betray Fries, hoping to learn more from an [[autopsy]]. He escapes, recovers an old suit of sub-zero armor, and becomes Mr. Freeze again. He seeks revenge by blowing up a Wayne-Powers complex (with Freeze, the doctor and Powers in it), but he is foiled by [[Terry McGinnis]], Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman. Freeze redeems himself by saving Batman from Powers, now mutated into the supervillain Blight, but apparently dies when he refuses to escape the exploding complex with Batman.

Originally in the aforementioned episode, Mr. Freeze's fate was to be explained in a brief, comedic scene in which Bruce Wayne sends McGinnis to the fridge to get him something to drink, and he opens it to find Freeze's head staring back at him. The producers decided that joke didn't do the character justice, however, and did not use it.

===''Batman & Robin''===
[[Image:Ourgovernor.jpg‎|thumb|Mr. Freeze in ''[[Batman & Robin (1997 film)|Batman & Robin]]'' played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].]]
In the film ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 film)|Batman & Robin]]'', Mr. Freeze (played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) teams up with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] in a scheme to freeze Gotham City solid. In this largely [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation, the character spouts [[pun]]s related to cold weather and temperatures (e.g., "You’re not sending me to the cooler!", "Allow me to break the ice", "Let's kick some ice!"). His tragic origin is the same; however, he often appears to be enjoying himself, despite his condition.

Here, he teams up with Poison Ivy and her henchman, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], to battle Batman and Robin, after the Duo thwart his attempts to steal large diamonds that he requires to properly operate his freezing technology. Unbeknownst to him, however, Poison Ivy unplugs his wife's life-support machine and blames Batman for it, encouraging him to freeze the world to get revenge on the society that created Batman and Robin and subsequently repopulating it with Ivy's plants. Batman, Robin, and the new Batgirl foil Freeze's plan, reveal Ivy's betrayal, and give him a chance at redemption, Batman reminding him that anyone can take a life, but only a select few people- like Freeze prior to his accident- can actually ''give'' life. Freeze gives Batman a means of curing the disease that his faithful butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], has recently been diagnosed with; the same disease was currently affecting his wife, but although her condition has advanced too far for Freeze to cure it at the moment, he has found a cure for Alfred's stage of the disease. Batman tells him that his wife is still alive and that she will be moved to Arkham Asylum's laboratory so that Freeze can continue working on a cure. After Ivy is incarcerated, Freeze visits her and tells her "Winter has come at last."

===Justice League===
Mr. Freeze made two appearances in ''Justice League Adventures'' comics. In the first, he claims that [[Captain Cold]] has stolen his freeze gun design, but in the second they are working together, alongside other cold-based villains. He never appeared in the Justice League animated series but his freeze gun is a primary weapon Batman uses against a [[Thanagar]]ian attack in the Batcave, as seen in the episode [[Starcrossed (Justice League episode)|Starcrossed]].

===''The Batman''===
[[Image:MrFreeze.gif|thumb|125px|left|Mr. Freeze as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'']]

In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', Mr. Freeze is a simple criminal who is condemned to life in a cryogenic suit by an accident while being pursued by Batman after a [[jewelry]] heist. The criminal runs into a cryogenics lab and is knocked into one of the freeze chambers, electrocuting him as his body is frozen. The accident turns him into a quasi-[[undead]] being that generates extreme cold around him; he is forced to wear a special suit (developed by a cryogenicist he coerces into working for him) to prevent him from freezing everything he comes in contact with. Batman has a hard time beating him, reaching the point where the criminal nearly freezes him alive. Alfred saves the day by making a winter-themed bat-suit which the Caped Crusader uses to defeat Mr. Freeze. In a later episode, Mr. Freeze teams up with [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]] to put Gotham in a permanent winter. In "The Icy Depths", he competes against [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] to claim an umbrella that is in fact a map to a sunken treasure.

In the episode "Artifacts", set years later in 2027, Freeze's powers increase to the point that he wears a special mech suit. However, he loses an unhealthy amount of weight and the use of his legs, and now uses mechanical spider legs. After a near-death escape, Freeze places himself in cryogenic supension, until someone wakes him up 1,000 years in the future in 3027. Once his suit is repaired, Mr. Freeze resumes terrorizing Gotham. Eventually, law enforcement officers use the same methods saved for the future by the Batman to defeat Freeze in case of his return, while confusing him with hologram projections.

Mr. Freeze is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]] in the English version of the series, and by [[Tesshō Genda]] in the Japanese dub. [[Tesshō Genda]] played Batman in the Japanese dub of [[Batman: The Animated Series]]

===Dark Horse Comic Books===
Mr. Freeze appeared in ''[[Batman vs. Predator]]'' 's third comic book, ''Blood Ties''. His gang members were killed by the Predators. He was spared since he was not visible to the Predator because of his body temperature.

===Video Game Appearances===
* Mr. Freeze also appeared in several ''Batman'' video games. He was a boss in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] (in which Freeze was the game's final boss), the video game adaptation of the movie ''Batman & Robin'', ''Batman: Chaos in Gotham'', ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]'' (the only game to feature the comic book version of Mr. Freeze, as all other games use the animated or movie version). Micheal Ansara reprised his role as Mr. Freeze for ''Batman Vengeance''.

===Merchandising===
*[[Mr. Freeze (Roller Coaster)|Mr. Freeze]] is also the name of two LIM [[roller coasters]] at two [[Six Flags]] parks ([[Six Flags St. Louis]] and [[Six Flags Over Texas]])
*Danish Toymaker [[Lego]]'s [[Lego Batman|Batman line]] features one set, 7783-The Batcave: [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] and Mr. Freeze's Invasion, which includes a [[minifigure]] incarnation of the supervillain. This version most closely resembles Freeze's appearance in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.
