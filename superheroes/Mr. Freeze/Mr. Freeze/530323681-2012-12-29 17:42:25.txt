'''Mr. Freeze''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. He frequently serves as a sympthetic enemy of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 (February 1959).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

Freeze is a scientist who must wear a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] suit in order to survive, and bases his crimes around a "cold" or "ice" theme, complete with a "freeze gun" that freezes its targets solid. In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former cryogenics expert who suffered an [[industrial accident]] while attempting to cure his [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]].

In the original ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played in various episodes by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]]. He was voiced in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' by [[Michael Ansara]], and by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. In the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |title=Mr. Freeze is Number 67 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

==Overview==
Originally called '''Mr. Zero''',<ref name="UGO - Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/|title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[UGO]]}}</ref> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.<ref name="Freeze 1"/><ref name="Freeze 2"/><ref name="Freeze 3"/> 

Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze's origin in a landmark episode by writer [[Paul Dini]], introducing his terminally ill, [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]], which greater explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> As a result, this more complex and [[tragedy|tragic]] [[antiheroic]] character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].<ref>''Robin II: Joker's Wild'' #1 (1991)</ref> Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol.1 #670 (1993)</ref>

The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the complex moral motivations seen constantly in the rest of the series. This backstory was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been Fries' official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman since.

Elements of this [[back story]] were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze| accessdate= 2008-05-08| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first1= Steve| last1= Daly| first2= Anne| last2= Thompson |date=8 March 1996}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
From the time of his first appearance in 1958 onward, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "'''Dr. Schivell'''"),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> and the name quickly carried over to the comic books.

===Silver Age===
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|175px|thumb|''Batman'' #121 (1959), the first appearance of the character as "Mr. Zero". Cover art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] [[book series|series]], it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing [[wiktionary:subzero|subzero]] temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Modern Age===
[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-''Crisis'']], Freeze was revamped utilizing Paul Dini's backstory. '''Dr. Victor Fries''' (surname pronounced "freeze") is an expert molecular biologist. As a child, he is fascinated by freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", send him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he is miserable, feeling detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he falls in love with and ultimately marries.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

A year and a half after [[Bruce Wayne]] becomes Batman, Nora has contracted a disease, while Fries works on a freeze ray. Fries' boss decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. Fries decides to use the device on Nora, to put her in [[suspended animation|cryo-stasis]], but due to tampering from his boss, Nora is frozen and shattered and Fries becomes insane. Targeting those responsible for the death of his wife (who he talks to often), Fries becomes Mr. Freeze, Batman's first super villain (as opposed to the humans with no weapons he had been fighting). When Batman's operatives find Freeze, one is shot by his cold gun. Eventually, Batman catches Freeze and lets all of his operatives go, realizing he can only trust one person to help him out after his group's bickering amongst themselves and the fallout with Freeze,<ref>''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight'' #192-196: "Snow"</ref> and decides to go visit the [[Dick Grayson|circus]] as Bruce Wayne.

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> so he hardly ever forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. Freeze has at times shown a belief that Nora has reincarnated.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #800—808, #811—814: City of Crime</ref> In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructed a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on an old enemy.

During his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]], he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted Lazara, and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and she estranges herself from him.

===The New 52===
During the [[Night of the Owls]] crossover as part of ''[[The New 52]]'', the Court of Owls send assassins known as Talons to kill almost forty of the most important citizens of Gotham with Mr Freeze being one of them. [[Jason Todd|The Red Hood]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] choose to save him, and subsequently remand him into Batgirl's custody.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #8 (2012)</ref>

''Batman Annual'' #1 introduces a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor's fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for rescue to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries's wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with an incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Victor, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body. Eventually, Victor fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Victor's fixation on Nora. Furious, Victor hurled a chair at Bruce, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Victor and caused his transformation into Mr. Freeze.<ref>''Batman Annual'' Vol. 2 #1 (2012)</ref>

The Court of Owls used Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons and then tried to kill him. Freeze barely escapes assassination, but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to Arkham. Escaping shortly thereafter and rearming himself with the Penguin's help, Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and take Nora, whom he deludedly believes to be his wife, so that he can leave Gotham City behind forever. Infiltrating Wayne Enterprises, Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora. During their fight, Batman berates Freeze on his obsession and readers learn that Nora is not really Freeze's wife. Batman defeats Mr. Freeze by injecting his suit with the thawing formula, which he had intended to use to revive Nora from suspended animation.

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld "Freeze gun". His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit.  However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and [[Purgatory (comics)|Purgatory]] in Central Park, he reverted back to his original subzero biology. He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.<ref>{{Cite comic

* In the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders]] in the first two-part appearance, [[Otto Preminger]] in the second two-part appearance, and [[Eli Wallach]] in the third two-part appearance.<ref name="Freeze 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze2.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 2|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze3.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 3|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref> Sanders and Wallach used German accents for the role, while Preminger used his own Austrian accent. While the George Sanders version wore the classic refrigerated suit, the Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach versions wore a "Freeze Collar" around their neck that went with Mr. Freeze's cooling suit. Before Mr. Freeze was on the show, he was always called Mr. Zero. The show's version of him continues to be [[campy]] like the comic books and is given an alias Dr. Schivel.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 
**In his first appearance, "Instant Freeze", it is revealed that it was Batman who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on Dr. Schivell (portrayed by Sanders) during an attempted arrest. Batman thus feels a certain amount of guilt for his condition. Mr. Freeze ends up stealing some famous diamonds from the Gotham City Diamond Exchange. When Batman and Robin try to stop him, he ends up freezing them with his freeze gun. In the next episode, "Rats Like Cheese," Mr. Freeze kidnaps Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles Team and offers to return him in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin were able to apprehend Mr. Freeze. During this appearance, Mr. Freeze's hideout has "warm lights" so that his henchmen can interact with Mr. Freeze. 
**In "Green Ice," Mr. Freeze (portrayed by Preminger) escapes from prison and captures [[Miss Iceland]] from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode "Deep Freeze," Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to Mr. Freeze's bribes. Batman and Robin managed to find Mr. Freeze's hideout, rescue Miss Iceland, and defeat Mr. Freeze (who was placed in the same freezer that he placed Miss Iceland in after his Freeze Collar was knocked off). 
**In "Ice Spy," Mr. Freeze (portrayed by Wallach) kidnaps Icelandic scientist Professor Isaacson in order to obtain an "Instant Ice" formula. In "The Duo Defy," Mr. Freeze finally obtains the "Instant Ice" formula and ends up building a large freeze ray. He is thwarted by Batman and Robin again. As Mr. Freeze and his henchmen are arrested by the police, he told the police officers that apprehended him not to touch the dials on his Freeze Collar.

* Mr. Freeze appeared in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' voiced by [[Ted Knight]]. The Filmation series has Mr. Freeze make extensive use of his self made technology such as making certain parts of his hideout "warm corridors" to accommodate underlings.<ref>{{cite video|date=2007|title=The New Adventures Of Batman|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Home Video}}</ref>

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' episode "The Deep Freeze" voiced by [[Lennie Weinrib]] in a Russian-like accent. Unlike the theme song, Mr. Freeze was shown without the helmet that goes with his refrigerated suit. He and his henchman Professor Frost plot to steal the N-1000 (a superfast submarine) to pull of the Crime of the Century. When Batman and Robin raid his hideout, Mr. Freeze manages to freeze both of them but takes Robin with him and Professor Frost. When Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost managed to steal the N-1000, Mr. Freeze has Professor Frost steer it to the North Pole. When Batman and Bat-Mite catch up, Robin makes his escape while Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost continue to the North Pole. When Batman, Robin, and Bat-Mite catch up to Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost at the North Pole, Batman and Robin fire a beam from their device that reverses the polarity of Mr. Freeze's freeze gun so that it warms up. Batman and Robin managed to defeat Mr. Freeze and remand him to prison.

*Mr. Freeze appears in several series for the [[DC animated universe]] voiced by [[Michael Ansara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/actors/villains.html#ansara| title= Batman: The Animated Series - Actors - Villains|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref>
** Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' with his design created by ''[[Hellboy]]'' creator [[Mike Mignola]] as per request of series creator [[Bruce Timm]].<ref name="BTAS">{{cite video|date=2004|title=Batman: The Animated Series|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Home Video}}</ref> Mr. Freeze is introduced in the episode "Heart of Ice", which won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program. [[Image:Mister Freeze BTAS.jpg|195px|left|thumb|Mr. Freeze depicted in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]According to flashbacks, cryogenic scientist Victor Fries was working for the company Gothcorp and [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds for an experiment in order to save his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife (Nora Fries) by cryogenically freezing her until a cure could be found. However, Gothcorp CEO Ferris Boyle broke into the lab with guards, demanding an end be put to the experiment. When Fries desperately grabbed a security guard's pistol and aimed it at Boyle, the corrupt CEO kicked Victor into a table of chemical beakers filled with cryogenic substance, leaving him to die. But he survived and was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances. Unable to live outside subzero conditions and incapable of feeling emotion, he must wear a cryogenic suit to survive, which also triples his strength. In the present day, he now calls himself "Mr. Freeze" as he leads a band of henchmen and makes several raids on Gothcorp, stealing the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his vendetta against Boyle. This leads to his first confrontation with Batman, whom he traps in a block of ice. Freeze leaves the trapped Batman in his hideout, confronting Boyle at the Gothcorp Humanitarian Party and freezing him up to the waist. Batman escapes, then confronts Freeze at the party, fighting him one-on-one until he breaks a thermos of [[chicken soup]] on Freeze's transparent head dome to cause it to shatter with the induced [[thermal shock]], rendering Mr. Freeze unconscious. Batman then presents evidence of Boyle's crime to the press. Mr. Freeze is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum in a special cell that is kept at subzero temperatures. As the episode ends, he's begging his wife for forgiveness.<ref name="Heart of Ice">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|title=Heart of Ice|quote=Mr. Freeze targets the industrialist responsible for his wife's death.|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> Mr. Freeze later appears in "Deep Freeze", in which he is kidnapped by giant robots and brought to an off-shore city called Oceana. There, he meets billionaire amusement park designer Grant Walker wanting to become like Freeze so he can create a frozen world for selected residents. Mr. Freeze agrees to help when Walker promises to cure his wife (whose cryogenic tank is in his possession). Batman and Robin arrive and try to reason with Freeze that if he were to help Walker, Nora would hate him. Freeze eventually turns on Walker, freezing him to a wall. Freeze overloads Oceana's power-core, which starts the destruction of the city as he instructs its inhabitants to evacuate. Freeze stays behind to die with his wife, and they all disappear in the explosion, though the episode's end reveals that they survive, trapped in [[iceberg]]s.<ref name="Deep Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/df.html|title=Deep Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> Mr. Freeze's next appearance is as the main antagonist in the direct to video movie ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''. Nora's tank is shattered and Mr. Freeze kidnaps [[Barbara Gordon]] in order to perform a vital organ transplant and uses Barbara to get it. Freeze makes a deal with a greedy old colleague of his to help cure his wife in exchange for gold. Batman and Robin thwart this plan and Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig. [[Wayne Enterprises]] then finances Nora's surgery saving her life which Freeze overhears while watching in on researchers in the [[North Pole]], bringing tears to his eyes.
** In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Mr. Freeze returns with a new, sleeker look.

Although he has kidnapped many scientists to try and stop the process, they only succeed after the process has claimed all but his head, which is supported by four robotic legs built into his suit. By this time, Nora has married the doctor assigned to her case and left Gotham permanently. The [[psychological trauma|trauma]] destroys whatever is left of Freeze's humanity, and he vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered by taking away the things they value most. One of his targets is Bruce Wayne, and he almost kills [[Alfred Pennyworth]] at [[Wayne Manor]]. At his hideout, Freeze is confronted by Batman and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]], and he reveals his true condition to them, as well as his goal of destroying Gotham and thus all Batman holds dear by dropping a "reverse fusion bomb" that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb, but Batman follows him and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses his grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg to which Freeze is presumed dead.

[[Image:Mr. Freeze (future).jpg|left|thumb|Mr. Freeze as he appears in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.]]In the episode "Meltdown", Victor Fries' disembodied head survived for 40 years thanks to the cryogenics technology, which has granted him [[Immortality|eternal life]]. [[Derek Powers]] has Doctor Stephanie Lake (voiced by [[Linda Hamilton]]) use Fries as a test subject for a process she hopes will cure Powers' own mutation (suffered since "Rebirth"). She creates a [[cloning|clone]] body for him using his baseline [[DNA]] and transfers Victor's mind into it. Given a normal life, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he has committed, creating a charitable organization with all his legitimate earnings from before he was imprisoned. However, Victor's new body soon begins to revert to the same sub-zero [[biology]]. Lake and Powers betray Fries when he returns to their lab for help, hoping to learn more from a [[biopsy]] but he escapes. After recovers an advanced suit of sub-zero armor to which he becomes Mr. Freeze again, he seeks revenge by freezing Lake, freezing Powers (unintentionally revealing Powers' mutation into the villain Blight), and attempting to blow up a Wayne-Powers complex.

After Freeze redeems himself by saving Batman from Blight, Batman attempts to save Freeze from the collapsing building, but Freeze refuses help and presumably dies in the explosion.<ref name="Meltdown"/><ref name="BB - Meltdown"/>
** While Mr. Freeze never appeared in neither the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series nor ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', his freeze gun is seen in the former series episode "Starcrossed" used by the [[Thanagar]]ian Kragger in the Batcave as   Kragger attempts to use it on [[Superman]] to which the [[Kryptonian]] blows the freeze charge back, freezing Kragger instead,<ref>{{cite episode |title=Starcrossed |episodelink= |series=Justice League |serieslink= |credits=Butch Lukic, Dan Riba, Rich Fogel, Dwayne McDuffie |network=Cartoon Network |station= |airdate=2004-05-29 |season=2 |number=50, 51, 52 |minutes= }}</ref> and is mentioned in the latter series episode "Epilogue" when [[Terry McGinnis]] (the second Batman) thought of his own father.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "The Big Chill", voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. This version of Mr. Freeze is a bank robber who is condemned to life in a cryogenic suit after an accident in a cryogenics lab while being chased by Batman. Unlike other versions of the character, ''The Batman''{{'}}s interpretation of Freeze fires ice blasts directly out of his hands rather than from a gun. After emerging from a cryogenic chamber, he forces a scientist to create a special refrigerated suit for him.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] in a [[German language|German]] accent. He first appears in his [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] appearance under the name "Mr. Zero" in the episode "Legends of the Dark Mite" where he is among the Batman villains in [[Bat-Mite]]'s fantasy. Batman defeats him by throwing a [[batarang]] at his helmet. Mr. Freeze makes a cameo in the teaser for "Sidekicks Assemble" as one of the villain holograms that Robin, Speedy, and [[Aqualad]] fight. Mr. Freeze later appears in "[[Chill of the Night!]]" with a design resembling the George Sanders depiction. He is among the villains at a weapons auction held by [[Joe Chill]]. In "Bold Beginnings!", Mr. Freeze has captured [[Aquaman]], [[Green Arrow]], and [[Plastic Man]]. Batman rescues them and recruits them to fight Mr. Freeze and his henchmen. After Mr. Freeze is defeated, Aquaman remains behind to wait for the police and continue telling Mr. Freeze of his first team-up with Batman against [[Black Manta (comics)|Black Manta]]. Mr. Freeze also appears in the opening for "Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth," in which he is one of the villains at the Joker's [[celebrity roast]] &mdash; a party in which the assembled villains are literally roasting Batman alive. With help from [[Jeffrey Ross]], Batman breaks free from his death trap and defeats Mr. Freeze and the other villains present.

* Mr. Freeze appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Independence Day" Pt. 1 voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]].

In "Terrors," Mr. Freeze is seen as an inmate at [[Belle Reve]] alongside [[Captain Cold]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Jr.]], and [[Killer Frost]]. He and the other villains collaborate with [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Sr.]] in a breakout plot. When Mr. Freeze is brought to the prison's warden, [[Amanda Waller]], he ends up freezing his own collar and then taking out the guards. He is defeated when [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] shatters his helmet, forcing Mr. Freeze to turn his powers on himself in order to survive. In "Coldhearted," Mr. Freeze and the other ice-based villains are seen in their cells.

===Film===

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. He serves as one of the movie's chief antagonists, alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], albeit being depicted as an [[anti-villain]]. The film features a largely [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation of the character, although it includes the animated series version's tragic origin. Throughout the movie, he spouts puns related to cold weather and temperatures (e.g., "You’re not sending me to the cooler!", "Allow me to break the ice", "Let's kick some ice", etc.). The film's characterization of Mr. Freeze, as well as Schwarzenegger's performance, was widely panned by critics and fans alike.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Swaim|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_15665_7-least-faithful-comic-book-movies.html|title=The 7 Least-Faithful Book Movies|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Cracked.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html|title=Batman and Robin|quote=In other words they're a lot smarter than, say, Mr. Freeze, whose deadliest weapon in the film is an arsenal of puns.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''Batman: Chaos in Gotham''.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'', targeting a scientist named Isaac Evers, whom he blames for sending him a video promoting Promethium gas in order to spite him, unaware that the real culprit was the Joker, who planned to use Freeze's invasion of the lab as a distraction for him to steal large quantities of the gas. Michael Ansara reprised his role as Mr. Freeze for ''Batman Vengeance''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/batman-vengeance|title=Batman Vengeance - MobyGames|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Moby Games}}</ref>

* He is also one of the main villains in the PC game ''Toxic Chill'', in which Freeze pairs up with the Riddler in an attempt to change the very weather of Gotham. He is eventually betrayed and nearly killed by the Riddler, who sets off a volcanic eruption. Both are sent to Arkham Asylum, and are made cellmates. It is suggested that Freeze tortures the Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.

* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He appears as an enemy of Batman and a follower of the [[Riddler]].<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> In it his design is based mainly on the animated series, and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins.

* Mr. Freeze's cell, covered in frost and icicles, can be seen in the Penitentiary area of ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' which can be scanned to unlock his bio.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' voiced by [[Robert Kraft]]{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Freeze appears when the player, using a Villain character, is attempting to steal some diamonds from a Wayne Enterprises warehouse. Joker orders the player via communicator to give the diamonds to Freeze, only to later command him or her to go inside Freeze´s base in Gotham Mercy Hospital and steal the diamonds back, right when Freeze is once again trying to bring back Nora and thus sabotaging the procedure. The villain player must then confront Mr. Freeze, who is enraged and willing to kill the player. Freeze also appears in the Arkham Asylum alert, where he has allied with Scarecrow and Poison Ivy to spread chaos in the Asylum, under doctor Jeremiah Arkham´s orders. Freeze has taken over one of the wings in the asylum, covering the whole area with ice and snow. The team of 4 players (Heroes or Villains) must defeat Freeze one time in his area, and then face him again when he is fighting side by side with Scarecrow and Ivy.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]] as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] poisons Batman he has the Dark Knight find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the [[Penguin]]'s men, who reveal that Penguin is holding Freeze hostage in the Cryus Pinkney National History Institute. Batman saves Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Freeze for the cure to the Titan toxin, only for Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. After the Penguin is defeated and Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for the Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has also bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows someone who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries; [[Ra's al Ghul]]. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of Ra's' DNA to complete the cure, and Batman proceeds to track down Ra's using one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had somehow captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with a sample of Ra's' blood, Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries|Nora]] from the Joker or he will never get the last of the cure. Batman fights Freeze to override the safe, which proves difficult as Freeze alters the environment around him to defeat the Dark Knight and uses his mind to strategically challenge Batman as well as seeker drones and his own freezing gun, though his powerful armor makes him move slowly. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find a wall missing and the cure gone, realizing [[Harley Quinn]] stole the cure while he fought Freeze. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure, and gives him Nora's location, begging him to save her. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Freeze with his frozen wife, Batman tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive Titan-thug bosses from the previous game.

* Mr. Freeze appears as a minor antagonist in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character, found at the observatory.

===Web series===
* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She dons his freezing equipment in a quest to wipe out Gotham's supervillain, due to a misunderstanding that Mr. Freeze's actions killed her only sister. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.

===Merchandising===
