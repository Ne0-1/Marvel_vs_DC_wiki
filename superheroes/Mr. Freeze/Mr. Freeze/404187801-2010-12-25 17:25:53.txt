'''Mr. Freeze''', real name '''Dr. Victor Fries''' (pronounced as Victor "Frees" or "Freeze"),  is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 ([[1959#February|February 1959]]).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

Freeze is a scientist who must wear a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] suit in order to survive, and bases his crimes around a "cold" or "ice" theme, complete with a "cold gun" that freezes its targets solid. In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former cryogenics expert who suffered an [[industrial accident]] while attempting to cure his [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]].

In the original ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played in various episodes by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]]. He was voiced in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' by [[Michael Ansara]], and by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. In the 1997 film, ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |title=Mr. Freeze is Number 67 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

==Overview==
Originally called '''Mr. Zero''',<ref name="UGO - Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/|title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[UGO]]}}</ref> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.<ref name="Freeze 1"/><ref name="Freeze 2"/><ref name="Freeze 3"/> His character was used because the series creators had originally wanted to use the character of [[Two-Face]] (aka [[Harvey Dent]]), but network executives thought the character would be too scary for the numerous children who watched the show; as a result, an alternative villain with a physical deformity and a more serious personality, Mr Freeze, was substituted.

Over two decades later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze’s origin in a landmark episode by writer [[Paul Dini]] , introducing his terminally ill, cryogenically frozen wife, which greater explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the complex moral motivations seen constantly in the rest of the series. This backstory was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been Fries' official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman since. This leads many fans to think of him as the most sympathetic villain.

Elements of this [[back story]] were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
From the time of his first appearance in 1958 onward, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]], cast as stock enemies of Batman.)<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "Dr. Schivell"),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. 

Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Freeze would receive another update on television. In the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "[[Heart of Ice (Batman episode)|Heart of Ice]]", he was made into a more complex, [[tragedy|tragic]] character.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> This version of Mr. Freeze was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Silver Age===
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|175px|thumb|''Batman'' #121 (1959), the first appearance of the character as "Mr. Zero". Cover art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] [[book series|series]], it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing [[wiktionary:subzero|subzero]] temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

===Modern Age===
[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-''Crisis'']], Freeze was revamped utilizing Paul Dini's backstory. Dr. Victor Fries is an expert molecular biologist. As a child, he is fascinated by freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", send him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he is miserable, feeling detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he falls in love with and ultimately marries.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Nora later falls terminally ill. Fries takes on a job working for a large company run by the ruthless Ferris Boyle. Fries discovers a way to put Nora into [[Suspended animation|cryo-stasis]] (using company equipment without permission), and places her in that state hoping to sustain her until a cure could be found. Boyle finds out about the experiment and attempts to have her brought out of cryo-stasis, overruling Fries' frantic objections. A struggle ensues, in which Boyle kicks Fries into a table full of chemicals and leaves him for dead. Fries survives, but his body temperature is lowered dramatically due to mutations triggered by the chemicals; he can now only live at subzero temperatures and is thus forced to wear a special refrigerating suit to stay alive. As Mr. Freeze, he uses cryonic technology to create a gun, which fires a beam that freezes any target within its range.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/622/622304p2.html|title=IGN: The Best & Worst Batman Villains|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2005-06-03|publisher=IGN}}</ref>

His first act as a costumed criminal is to take revenge upon Boyle, a plan with which Batman interferes.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/><ref name="Heart of Ice"/> Mr. Freeze fires his freeze-gun at Batman, but he dodges, causing the beam to shatter Nora's capsule. Freeze blames Batman, and swears to destroy whatever the Dark Knight holds dear (mainly [[Gotham City]], and eventually [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into <ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> so he hardly ever forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, such as the time he was a hired enforcer/hitman for the [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]].<ref name="The Batman - episode">{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Burnett|url=http://www.tv.com/the-batman/the-batman-superman-story-1/episode/1127696/recap.html|title=The Batman: The Batman/Superman Story (1) Recap|accessdate=2008-05-11|date=2007-09-22|publisher=TV.com}}</ref> 
In ''[[Villains United]]'' #1, Freeze has frozen everyone inside a courtroom. While using a frozen man as a chair, he talks with the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], who convinces him to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. During his time with the group, he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted [[Lazara]], and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and estranges herself from him.<ref>{{Cite comic

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld "Freeze gun". His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> 

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit.  However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and Purgatory in Central Park, he reverted back to his original subzero biology. He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.<ref>{{Cite comic

===Animated abilities===
According to ''Batman: The Animated Series'', Freeze understands how to reproduce his condition.<ref name="BTAS"/> Also his obsession with ice stems from personal tragedy, and his crimes are inspired by his desire to make the rest of the world as miserable as he is.<ref name="Cold Comfort"/> Furthermore, since the serum Freeze was soaked in was intended to be used for cryo-preservation, his age progression has slowed drastically to the point he is virtually immortal.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/>

In ''The Batman'', Freeze has the ability of [[cryokinesis]] (i.e. to generate ice and cold with his mind, channeled via his hands).<ref name="TB - Big Chill">{{cite episode |title=The Big Chill |episodelink= |series=The Batman |serieslink= |credits=Seung Eun-Kim |network=The WB |station= |airdate=2004-11-06 |season=1 |number=5 |minutes= }}</ref>

===Television===
* In the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders]] in the first two appearance, [[Otto Preminger]] in the second two appearance, and [[Eli Wallach]] in the third two appearance.<ref name="Freeze 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze2.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 2|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name="Freeze 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze3.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 3|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref>[[:Wallach.Mr freeze tv series.jpg|thumb|[[Eli Wallach]] as Mr. Freeeze in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series]].</ref> Sanders and Wallach put on German accents for the role, while Preminger used his own Austrian accent. Before Mr. Freeze was on the show, he was always called Mr. Zero. The show's version of him continues to be campy like the comic books and is given an alias Dr. Schivel.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> In his first appearance "Instant Freeze", it is revealed that it was Batman who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on Dr. Schivel (portrayed by [[George Sanders]]) during an attempted arrest. Batman thus feels a certain amount of guilt for his condition. He ends up stealing some famous diamonds from the Gotham City Diamon Exchange. When Batman and Robin try to stop him, he ends up freezing them with his freeze gun. In the next episode "Rats Like Cheese," Mr. Freeze ends up Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles Team and would return him in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin were able to apprehend Mr. Freeze. In "Green Ice," Mr. Freeze (portrayed by [[Otto Preminger]]) escapes from prison and captures Miss Iceland from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode "Deep Freeze," Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to Mr. Freeze's bribes. Batman and Robin managed to find Mr. Freeze's hideout, rescue Miss Iceland, and defeat Mr. Freeze. In "Ice Spy," Mr. Freeze (now portrayed by [[Eli Wallach]]) kidnaps Icelandic scientist Professor Isaacson in order to obtain an "Instant Ice" formula. In "The Duo Defy," Mr. Freeze finally obtains the "Instant Ice" formula and ends up building a large freeze ray. He is thwarted by Batman and Robin again.

* Mr. Freeze appeared in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' episode "The Cruel, Cool Mr. Freeze" voiced by [[Ted Knight]].

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' episode "The Deep Freeze" voiced by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. The Filmation series changes his origin, stating he was an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] who would die if exposed to any temperature hotter than -50 degrees Fahrenheit, and that firearms from his world are used as "freeze guns". Mr. Freeze also makes extensive use of technology, such as making certain parts of his hideout "warm corridors" to accommodate his human underlings.<ref>{{cite video|date=2007|title=The New Adventures Of Batman|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros.

[[Image:Mister Freeze BTAS.jpg|195px|right|thumb|Mr. Freeze as depicted in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Michael Ansara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/actors/villains.html#ansara|title=Batman: The Animated Series - Actors - Villains|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> His appearance in the series was designed by ''[[Hellboy]]'' creator [[Mike Mignola]], at the request of series creator [[Bruce Timm]]<ref name="BTAS">{{cite video|date=2004|title=Batman: The Animated Series|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Home Video}}</ref> Mr. Freeze is introduced in the episode "Heart of Ice", which won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program. In flashback, viewers see that while working for the company Gothcorp, Victor Fries had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds for an experiment, in order to save his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife, Nora, by cryogenically freezing her until a cure could be found. At the last moment, however, Gothcorp CEO, Ferris Boyle, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]], broke into the lab with guards, demanding an end be put to the experiment. When a panicked Fries grabbed a pistol from a security guard and aimed it at Boyle, the CEO first calmly spoke to Fries not to be rash and to see if something can be done to help Nora. When Fries relaxed and was distracted into thinking there is a peaceful solution, the CEO kicked Fries into a table of chemical beakers, leaving him to die. Fries survived, but was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances and transformed into Mr. Freeze. Freeze leads a band of henchmen and makes several raids on Gothcorp, stealing the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his battle against the company. This leads to his first confrontation with Batman, whom he defeats easily and traps in a block of ice. Later, before another attack on Gothcorp after the machine is complete, Freeze catches Batman in the security room, watching an archive video, revealing Freeze's tragic origin in flashback. This was one of the first times that Batman actually had sympathy for a villain, seeing Fries' a victim of harm and deception at the hands of Boyle, but did not condone his plan to attack Boyle's party, which had the potential to harm innocent people. Freeze traps Batman and leaves him in his hideout, confronting Boyle at the Gothcorp Humanitarian Party and freezing him up to the waist. Batman escapes, then confronts Freeze at the party, fighting him one-on-one until he smashes Freeze's protective helmet with a thermos of [[chicken soup]] given to him by Alfred, rendering Fries unconscious. Batman then presents evidence of Boyle's crimes to the press; and leaves him half encased in ice. Freeze is imprisoned in Arkham in a special cell that is kept at ultralow temperatures, and the episode ends with him remorseful that he failed to save his wife.<ref name="Heart of Ice">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/hoi.html|title=Heart of Ice|quote=Mr. Freeze targets the industrialist responsible for his wife's death.|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref> Freeze later appears in "Deep Freeze", in which he is taken from prison against his will and brought to an off-shore city named Oceana. There, he meets billionaire amusement park designer Grant Walker, who wants to become like Freeze so he can create a frozen world for selected residents. Walker also notes that Freeze's mutation has retarded his aging process almost completely and Walker, being infermed, wants to be like him. Freeze warns Walker that his condition is one he would not wish upon anyone, but agrees to help when Nora is mentioned. In return for Freeze's help, Walker promises to cure/revive Nora. Batman and Robin arrive and try to reason with Freeze that if he helps Walker, Nora would hate him. Freeze eventually turns on Walker, freezing him to a wall. Freeze overloads Oceana's power-core, which starts the destruction of the city. Freeze stays behind to die with his wife, and they all disappear in the explosion, though the episode's end reveals that they survive, trapped in [[iceberg]]s.<ref name="Deep Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/df.html|title=Deep Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref>

[[Image:Freeze-tnba.png|150px|right|thumb|Mr. Freeze as he appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.]]
* In the ''[[New Batman Adventures]]'', Mr. Freeze (again voiced by [[Michael Ansara]]) returns with a new, sleeker look, in which his head is mounted on four thin, [[robot]]ic legs, and which crawl and lock into a suit. Director [[Dan Riba]] admitted that his change was because of his recurring loss, and belief that his wife had no hope for recovery, leading to this darker, colder personality.<ref>{{cite video|date=2005|title=Batman: The Animated Series Volume Four|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Brother Home Video}}</ref> In the episode "Cold Comfort", Freeze learns that the serum that mutated his body is slowly destroying it; although he has kidnapped many scientists to try and stop the process, they only succeed after the process has claimed all but his head.  Because of this, Freeze felt unable to return to Nora who, believing her husband had died in the events of ''Subzero'', married the doctor assigned to her case and left Gotham permanently. The [[psychological trauma|trauma]] destroys whatever is left of Freeze's humanity, and he begins committing crimes in order to inflict on others the loss he's suffered, by taking away the things they value most. One of his targets is Bruce Wayne, and he almost kills [[Alfred Pennyworth]] at [[Wayne Manor]]. At his hideout, Freeze is confronted by Batman and Batgirl, and he reveals his true condition to them as well as his goal of taking away what Batman holds dear: all of Gotham, by dropping a "Reverse Fusion Bomb" that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb, but Batman follows him, and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses his grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Freeze is presumed killed, but the episode's end reveals that Freeze's head is missing from his frozen armor,<ref name="Cold Comfort">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/tnba/cc.html|title=Cold Comfort|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |episodelink= |series=The New Batman Adventures  |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

[[Image:Mr. Freeze (future).jpg|right|thumb|Mr. Freeze as he appears in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.]]
* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', which is set 50 years in the future, Bruce Wayne still has one of Mr. Freeze's guns in the [[Batcave]]. His successor as Batman, [[Terry McGinnis]], uses it to freeze [[Inque]] when she infiltrates the Batcave, and Inque destroys it in a later episode. The episode "Meltdown" reveals that the disembodied head of Victor Fries (again voiced by [[Michael Ansara]]) survives the events of "Cold Comfort" thanks to the cryogenics technology, he has [[Immortality|eternal life]]. Stephanie Lake, a doctor working for Derek Powers, uses Mr. Freeze as a test subject for a process she hoped would be able to cure Powers' mutation (suffered in the series' pilot episode). She creates a [[cloning|clone]] body for him using his baseline DNA and transfers Fries' mind into it. Given a normal life, Fries tries to right some of the wrongs he committed, creating a charitable organization with all his legitmate earnings from before he was imprisoned. However, the new body soon begins to revert to the same sub-zero [[biology]]. Lake and Powers betray Fries when he returns to their lab for help, hoping to learn more from a [[biopsy]]. He escapes, recovers an advanced suit of sub-zero armor, and becomes Mr. Freeze again. He seeks revenge by killing Lake, freezing Powers, unintentionally revealing Powers' mutation into the villain Blight, and attempting to blow up a Wayne-Powers complex. Batman foils the plan while Freeze and Blight do battle. Freeze redeems himself by saving Batman from Blight and later keeps Batman from saving him so he would not perish in the explosion with Freeze because the new Dark Knight is the only person who cares whether he lives or not.<ref name="Meltdown"/><ref name="BB - Meltdown"/> He later appears in the second issue of the ''Batman Beyond'' comic, although the canonicity of the comic is debatable.

* Mr. Freeze never appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, but his freeze gun is used by the [[Thanagar]]ian Kragger in the Batcave as seen in the episode "Starcrossed".

Though Brown was on hand to reprise his role of Luthor from ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Brown had no lines as Freeze. In the episode "Artifacts", set in 2027, Freeze's powers have increased to the point that he wears a special mecha suit. However, he loses an unhealthy amount of weight and becomes unable to walk, and now uses mechanical spider legs. After a near-death escape, Freeze places himself in cryogenic suspension, until someone wakes him up 1,000 years in the future in 3027.

* In the direct to video movie, ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Nora's tank is shattered and Freeze kidnaps [[Batgirl]] in order to perform a vital organ transplant and uses [[Batgirl]] to get it. Mr. Freeze makes a deal with a greedy old colleague of his to help cure his wife in exchange for gold. Batman and Robin thwart this plan and Mr. Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig. Wayne Enterprises then finances Nora's surgery, saving her life which Freeze overhears while watching in on researchers in the [[North Pole]].

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. He serves as a main antagonist in the movie. The film features a largely [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation of the character, although it includes the animated series version's tragic origin, but portrayed it as being a machinery accident, falling into a vat of [[Liquid Nitrogen]]. Throughout the movie, he spouts puns related to cold weather and temperatures (e.g., "You’re not sending me to the cooler!", "Allow me to break the ice", "Let's kick some ice", etc.). The film's characterization of Mr. Freeze, as well as Schwarzenegger's performance, was widely criticized.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Swaim|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_15665_7-least-faithful-comic-book-movies.html|title=The 7 Least-Faithful Book Movies|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Cracked.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html|title=Batman and Robin|quote=In other words they're a lot smarter than, say, Mr. Freeze, whose deadliest weapon in the film is an arsenal of puns.

Interestingly, Freeze possesses a cure for an early infection of the same virus from which his wife suffers, which he gives to Batman upon being defeated, Batman having revealed that he saved Freeze's wife, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Ivy]] having previously attempted to kill her and claim that Batman did it so Ivy could win Freeze's assistance- and reminding Freeze that, while anyone can kill, only a few people like Victor Fries can legitimately save lives like he can save thousands of people from the virus. He is last seen at Arkham, becoming Ivy's cellmate in hopes of making her life a living hell for almost killing his wife, while at the same time is allowed access to the research labs in the hope of finding a cure for Nora.

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]''. He is seen trying to kill [[Superman]], and meets up with Batman. He is seen with the cold warriors ([[Icicle (comics)|Icicle II]], [[Killer Frost]], and [[Captain Cold]]).

In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: Dora Smithy, Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She dons his freezing equipment in a quest to wipe out Gotham's supervillain, due to a misunderstanding that Mr. Freeze's actions killed her only sister. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.
