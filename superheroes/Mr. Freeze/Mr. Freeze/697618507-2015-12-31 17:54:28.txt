'''Mr. Freeze''', real name '''Victor Fries''', is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], David Wood and [[Sheldon Moldoff]], the character first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 (February 1959).<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Mr. Freeze is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]].

Freeze is a scientist who must wear a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] suit in order to survive, and bases his crimes around a "cold" or "ice" theme, complete with a "freeze gun" that freezes its targets solid. In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former cryogenics expert who suffered an [[industrial accident]] while attempting to cure his [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife [[Nora Fries]].

Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]] in the original ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', was voiced by [[Michael Ansara]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', and has been voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game franchise.

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |title=Mr. Freeze is Number 67 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

==Overview==
Originally called '''Mr. Zero''',<ref name="UGO - Freeze">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/|title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=[[UGO]]}}</ref> he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.<ref name="Freeze 1"/><ref name="Freeze 2"/><ref name="Freeze 3"/>

Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze's origin in "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]", an episode by writer [[Paul Dini]]. The episode introduced his terminally ill, [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]], which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.<ref name="Heart of Ice"/> This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].<ref>''Robin II: Joker's Wild'' #1 (1991)</ref> Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol.1 #670 (1993)</ref>

The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the rest of the series. This back story was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been the character's official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman until New 52.

Elements of this origin story were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze| accessdate= 2008-05-08| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first1= Steve| last1= Daly| first2= Anne| last2= Thompson |date=8 March 1996}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
From the time of his first appearance in 1959 onwards, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> Originally called Mr. Zero,<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "'''Dr. Schivel'''"),<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. Three actors who portrayed Mr Freeze were [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]].

===Silver Age===
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|175px|thumb|''Batman'' #121 (1959), the first appearance of the character as "Mr. Zero". Cover art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] series, it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in his needing [[wiktionary:subzero|subzero]] temperatures to survive.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

===Modern Age===
[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-''Crisis'']], Freeze was revamped utilizing Paul Dini's backstory. '''Dr. Victor Fries, Ph.D.''' (surname pronounced "freeze") was a brilliant [[cryogenics|cryogenicist]]. As a child, he was fascinated with [[cryonics]], as he began his "hobby" of freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his fascination, sent him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he was miserable and felt detached from humanity. In college, he met a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he fell in love with and ultimately married.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

A year and a half after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, Nora contracts a fatal illness, while Fries works on a [[freeze ray]] for [[GothCorp]]. Fries' boss [[Ferris Boyle]] decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. Fries decides to use the device on Nora, to put her in [[suspended animation|cryo-stasis]]. His boss interrupts and tampers with the experiment, however, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first supervillain Batman faces in this continuity.

Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun. Batman eventually apprehends him, however.<ref>''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight'' #192-196: "Snow"</ref>

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he runs into<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructed a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman.

During his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted Lazara, and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and she estranges herself from him.

===The New 52===
During the [[Night of the Owls]] crossover as part of [[The New 52]], the [[Court of Owls]] send assassins known as Talons to kill almost 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr Freeze. [[Jason Todd|The Red Hood]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] choose to save him, and subsequently remand him into [[Batgirl]]'s custody.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #8 (2012)</ref>

''Batman Annual'' #1 introduces a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into a lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with an incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.

Eventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>''Batman Annual'' Vol. 2 #1 (2012)</ref>

The Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives, but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]]. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and take Nora, whom he believes to be his wife, so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora. Batman defeats Mr. Freeze by injecting his suit with the thawing formula, which he had intended to use to revive Nora from suspended animation.

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Mr. Freeze appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] arrived from their world.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref> [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]] later visits Mr. Freeze to let him know of the war going on at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]].<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol. 2 #23.3</ref> The [[Man-Bat]]s are able to bring the remaining Talons to Mr. Freeze after Man-Bat and Scarecrow steal them from Blackgate.<ref>''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #3</ref> Mr. Freeze and [[Clayface]] later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory.<ref>''Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion'' #3</ref> Mr. Freeze tells [[Mirror Master]] he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their head, only to use [[Weather Wizard]] to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham. As the Rogues are fighting the two, Black Mask (alongside his False Face society) arrives to capture the Rogues to receive the bounty.<ref>''Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice and cold.<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/> He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld "Freeze gun". His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]].<ref name="UGO - Freeze"/>

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit. However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and [[Purgatory (comics)|Purgatory]] in Central Park, he reverted to his original subzero biology. He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.<ref>{{Cite comic

While the George Sanders version wore the classic refrigerated suit, the Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach versions wore a 'Freeze Collar' around their neck that went with Mr. Freeze's cooling suit. Before Mr. Freeze was on the series, he was always called Mr. Zero. In this version, he continues to be [[camp (style)|campy]] like the comic books and is given an alias "Dr. Art Schivel". In his first appearance "Instant Freeze", it is revealed that it was Batman who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on Schivel during an attempted arrest. Mr. Freeze ends up stealing diamonds from the Gotham City Diamond Exchange. When Batman and Robin try to stop him, he freezes them with his freeze gun. In the next episode "Rats Like Cheese", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles and offers to return him in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin save Diamante and apprehend Mr. Freeze. During this appearance, Mr. Freeze's hideout has 'warm lights' so that his henchmen can interact with him. In the episode "Green Ice", Mr. Freeze escapes from prison and captures [[Miss Iceland]] from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode "Deep Freeze", Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to his bribes.

However, Gothcorp's CEO Ferris Boyle (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) broke into the lab with guards, demanding an end be put to the experiment. When Fries desperately grabbed a security guard's pistol to aim at Boyle, the corrupt CEO kicked him into a table of chemical beakers filled with cryogenic substance, leaving Victor to die. He survived but was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances. Unable to live outside subzero conditions, he wears a cryogenic suit to survive and also triples his strength. Mister Freeze is introduced in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning episode "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series)|Heart of Ice]]" (for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program). He steals the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his vendetta against Boyle. This leads to Mister Freeze's first confrontation with [[Batman]]. When he freezes Boyle up to the waist, Mister Freeze confronts Batman, fighting one-on-one until Mister Freeze's transparent head dome is broken when Batman uses [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s thermos of [[chicken soup]], inducing [[thermal shock]] and rendering Mister Freeze unconscious.

Batman and Robin thwart this plan and Mister Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig. Wayne Enterprises then finances a surgery that saves Nora's life. Mister Freeze is last seen at the [[North Pole]], crying tears of joy as he learns of Nora's recovery. 
* Mister Freeze appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', again voiced by [[Michael Ansara]]. The character's design sports a new, sleeker look.<ref>{{cite video|date=2005|title=Batman: The Animated Series Volume Four|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Brother Home Video}}</ref> As his mutation slowly destroys his body, Victor Fries kidnapped scientists (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Lauren Tom]]) to try and stop the process, only succeeding in saving his head which is supported by four robotic legs built separate from his suit. When a cured Nora Fries married her own doctor and left Gotham permanently, the [[psychological trauma|trauma]] destroys whatever is left of Fries' humanity. In the episode "Cold Comfort", Mister Freeze vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered by taking away the things they value most, much to the confusion of Robin ([[Tim Drake]]) and Batgirl. When Mister Freeze is confronted at his hideout by [[Batman]] and Batgirl, he reveals his true condition to them as well as his goal of destroying [[Gotham City]] &mdash; all the Dark Knight holds dear &mdash; by dropping a 'reverse fusion bomb' that will freeze the city. Mister Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb. However, he is followed by Batman and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses a grappling gun to hook Mister Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Although Mister Freeze is presumed dead, his head is seen to be missing as the episode ends.<ref name="Cold Comfort">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/tnba/cc.html|title=Cold Comfort| accessdate= 2008-05-09| publisher=Toon Zone}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |episodelink= |series=The New Batman Adventures |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

* Mister Freeze never directly appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, however, his freeze gun is seen in the [[Batcave]].In the series finale "Starcrossed" (Part 3), the [[Thanagar]]ian officer Kragger (voiced by [[Hector Elizondo]]) uses the freeze gun on [[Superman]] but the [[Kryptonian]] blows the freeze charge back, encasing Kraggar in ice.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Starcrossed |episodelink= |series=Justice League |serieslink= |credits=Butch Lukic, Dan Riba, Rich Fogel, Dwayne McDuffie |network=Cartoon Network |station= |airdate=2004-05-29 |season=2 |number=50, 51, 52 |minutes= }}</ref> 
* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', several of Mister Freeze's guns have been procured by the elderly Bruce Wayne and is displayed in the Batcave. The new [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] (Terry McGinnis) uses one to freeze [[Inque]] in the episode "Black Out", however, Inque destroys this one in the episode "Disappearing Inque". Another one is seen in the Batcave's background during subsequent episodes. Mister Freeze personally appears in the episode "Meltdown" in which Michael Ansara reprises his role. The tragic villain's disembodied head is revealed to have [[Immortality|survived for decades]] thanks to cryogenic technology. Wayne-Powers' CEO [[Derek Powers]] and Dr. Stephanie Lake (voiced by [[Linda Hamilton]]) use him as a test subject for a process that could cure Powers' own mutation. Transferring his mind into a [[cloning|clone]] built from his own baseline [[DNA]], Victor Fries sees this as a second chance. He initially tries to right some of the wrongs he has committed by creating a charitable organization with all his legitimate earnings from before he was imprisoned, which impresses Terry. However, Victor's new body soon begins to revert to his original body's same subzero [[biology]]. Although Lake and Powers betray him when he returns to Wayne-Powers for help, Fries escapes. After recovering an advanced suit of sub-zero armor that fires ice blasts directly out of gauntlets equipped onto his hands, Mister Freeze seeks revenge by freezing Lake and Powers and attempting to blow up the Wayne-Powers complex to commit suicide. In the middle of his plan, Mister Freeze battles Batman and then fights with Blight. Mister Freeze redeems himself by saving the second Dark Knight from Blight. Batman attempts to rescue Mister Freeze from the collapsing building, however, Mister Freeze refuses help and presumably dies in the explosion.<ref name="Meltdown">{{cite web| url= http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/bb/meltdown.html| title= Meltdown| accessdate= 2008-05-09| publisher= Toon Zone}}</ref><ref name="BB - Meltdown">{{cite episode |title=Meltdown |episodelink= |series=Batman Beyond |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

===Film===
[[Image:Ourgovernor.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] portraying Mr. Freeze in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.]]
* Mister Freeze appears in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. In a variation of the most common origin story, Dr. Victor Fries was in an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the [[terminal illness]] MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit. Mister Freeze later crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's life support and convinces Mister Freeze that Batman was responsible for the deed; enraged, he vows to destroy Gotham City by freezing it solid. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, in which she brags about killing Nora. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham, where he exacts his revenge on Ivy, his new cellmate. The character's penchant for cold and ice-related puns was noted by critics.<ref>{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html |title=Batman and Robin |accessdate=2008-05-23 |date=1997-06-20 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970620/REVIEWS/706200301 |title=Batman & Robin |accessdate=2013-03-08 |date=1997-06-20 |work=Chicago Sun Times}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] of Reelviews commented that "Schwarzenegger, aside from looking like a cross between the [[Michelin Man]] and [[Robocop]], appears totally confused about what he's doing.

He also noted that Freeze's backstory and motivation were "too complex for Schwarzenegger to convey effectively or for [[Joel Schumacher|[director Joel] Schumacher]] to care about exploring. As a result, Mr. Freeze ends up being a frustratingly incomplete brute who's out to smother Gotham City under a blanket of ice."<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Berardinelli |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=770 |title=Batman and Robin |accessdate=2013-03-08 |date=1997-06-20 |work=ReelViews}}</ref> Robin Dougherty of [[Salon (website)|Salon]] lamented that "Schwarzenegger’s exuberance is pinned down.

* He is also one of the main villains in the PC game ''Toxic Chill'', in which Mr. Freeze pairs up with the Riddler in an attempt to change the very weather of Gotham. He is eventually betrayed and nearly killed by the Riddler who sets off a volcanic eruption. Both are sent to Arkham Asylum, and are made cellmates. It is suggested that Freeze tortures the Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Robert Kraft]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Freeze appears when the player, using a Villain character, is attempting to steal some diamonds from a Wayne Enterprises warehouse. Joker orders the player via communicator to give the diamonds to Freeze, only to later command him or her to go inside Freeze's base in Gotham Mercy Hospital and steal the diamonds back, right when Freeze is once again trying to bring back Nora and thus sabotaging the procedure. The villain player must then confront Mr. Freeze, who is enraged and willing to kill the player. Freeze also appears in the Arkham Asylum alert, where he has allied with Scarecrow and Poison Ivy to spread chaos in the Asylum, under doctor Jeremiah Arkham's orders. Freeze has taken over one of the wings in the asylum, covering the whole area with ice and snow. The team of 4 players (Heroes or Villains) must defeat Freeze one time in his area, and then face him again when he is fighting side by side with Scarecrow and Ivy.
* In ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Mr. Freeze has an interactable object in which the character can be frozen by.

====Lego series====
* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He appears as an enemy of Batman and a follower of the [[Riddler]].<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> In it his design is based mainly on the animated series, and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins.
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character found at the observatory.
* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] in the mannerism of his ''Batman & Robin'' portrayal. The ''Batman Beyond'' version is also playable via downloadable content.

====''Arkham'' series====
Mr. Freeze appears in the ''Batman Arkham'' series where he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].

* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Mr. Freeze's frost and icicles covered cell can be seen in the Penitentiary area which can be scanned to unlock his bio.

* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', He appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cryus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows [[Ra's al Ghul|someone]] who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure, and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries]] from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: "Get well soon!" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]] had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure, and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.

* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', His origins and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC Story "Cold, Cold Heart" which is based on the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "Heart of Ice". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the DLC featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to backstab Mr. Freeze into giving him what the cyrogenicist is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold, and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze, and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voice-over states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.

* Mr. Freeze is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze hasn't been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December "Season of Infamy" downloadable content (DLC) pack from the game's Season Pass in the story titled "In From The Cold." Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora because Scarecrow and Arkham Knight needed Mr. Freeze to help take down Batman. As he didn't trust them, he instead entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her chamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It's also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face at last and Fries removes the protection from his helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they have to which Victor replies merely days, Nora simply noting with morbid amusement that time has never been on their side. They then depart Gotham City for good.

===Web series===
In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She dons his freezing equipment in a quest to wipe out Gotham's supervillain, due to a misunderstanding that Mr. Freeze's actions killed her only sister. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.

===Merchandising===
Mr. Freeze is also the name of two [[Linear induction motor|LIM]] [[roller coaster]]s at two [[Six Flags]] parks ([[Six Flags St. Louis]] and [[Six Flags Over Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixflags.com/stLouis/rides/MrFreeze.aspx|title=Mr. Freeze: Six Flags, St. Louis|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Six Flags}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixflags.com/overTexas/rides/MrFreeze.aspx|title=Mr. Freeze: Six Flags Over Texas|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Six Flags}}</ref>
