The '''Punisher''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[vigilante]] and [[anti-hero]] in the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics Universe]]. Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[John Romita, Sr.]] and [[Ross Andru]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #129 (Feb 1974).

Although sometimes considered a [[hero]], the Punisher is a [[vigilante]] who uses killing, kidnapping, extortion, coercion, threats of violence and torture as acceptable crime-fighting tactics. Driven by the deaths of his wife and children, who were killed by the mob when they witnessed a Mafia gangland execution in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Central Park]], Frank Castle wages a one-man war on the mob by using all manner of weaponry. A war veteran, Castle is a master of martial arts, stealth tactics, hand-to-hand combat, strategic planning and a wide variety of weapons.

The Punisher's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him a novel character in mainstream [[American comic books]] in 1974. By the late 1980s, he was part of a wave of psychologically troubled anti-heroes and was featured in several monthly publications, including ''The Punisher War Journal'', ''The Punisher War Zone'' and ''The Punisher Armory''; he even starred in a highly daring, critically lauded [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] with [[Archie Comics]]' teen-humor star, [[Archie Andrews]]. Two movie adaptations have been released, one in [[The Punisher (1989 film)|1989]] and another in [[The Punisher (2004 film)|2004]].

==Publication history==
[[Image:1stpunisher.jpg|160px|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129 (Feb. 1974), the Punisher's debut. Cover art by [[Gil Kane]] & [[John Romita, Sr.]]|thumb<!--credit per http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=27163-->]]

===Introduction===
The Punisher was created by Gerry Conway and Ross Andru, who were the regular writer and artist, respectively, for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', with then-Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita, Sr.]] working on the formal design. The Punisher was initially an [[antagonist]] of [[Spider-Man]], although only due to being duped by the [[supervillain]] known as [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|The Jackal]]. The character of the Punisher immediately became popular, and made appearances in the various Spider-Man titles and other series throughout the 1970s.

Conway also helped design the character's distinctive costume, stating: "In the '70s, when I was writing comics at DC and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters &mdash; heroes and villains &mdash; which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind. I had done that with the Punisher at Marvel".<ref>{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Alter Ego articles to Gerry Conway  | work =   | publisher =   | date =   | url = http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/14conway.html  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate =  }}</ref>

===Initial series===
In the early 1980s, artist [[Mike Zeck]] and writer [[Steven Grant]] proposed creating a Punisher series. The company was initially uncomfortable with the idea of a [[protagonist]] who kills in cold blood. However, as crime increased nationally throughout the decade, Marvel responded by testing the market for such a character &mdash; publishing though not initially promoting a [[mini-series]] whose premiere (Jan. 1986) was bannered on the cover as the first of four. After this first issue immediately sold out, Marvel expanded the miniseries to five issues (as then bannered on the cover of #2) and began active promotion.

[[Image:PunisherWarZone1.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''The Punisher War Zone'' #1 (March 1992). Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]]
An ongoing series, also titled ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'', premiered the next year. Initially by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]]. It eventually ran 104 issues (July 1987 - July 1995) and spun off two additional ongoing series &mdash; ''[[The Punisher War Journal]] (vol.1)'' (80 issues, Nov. 1988 - July 1995) and ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' (41 issues, March 1992 - July 1995), as well as the black-and-white comics magazine, ''The Punisher Magazine'' (16 issues, Nov. 1989 - Sept. 1990), and ''The Punisher Armory'' (10 issues, no cover dates, starting 1990), a fictional diary detailing ''"His thoughts! His feelings! His weapons!"'' (as stated on the cover of #1). The Punisher also appeared in numerous [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, and made frequent guest appearances in other Marvel comics, ranging from superhero series to the [[Vietnam War]]-era comic ''[[The 'Nam]]''.

===Decline===
In 1995, Marvel cancelled all three ongoing Punisher series due to poor sales. The publisher attempted a relaunch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series title ''[[The Punisher (1995 series)|The Punisher]]'', by writer [[John Ostrander]], in which the Punisher appeared to willingly join and work for organized crime, and later confronted the [[X-Men]] and [[Nick Fury]]. Writer [[Christopher Golden]]'s four-issue miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Purgatory]]'' (Nov. 1998 - Feb. 1999) posited a deceased Punisher resurrected as a [[supernatural]] agent of various [[angels]] and [[demons]].

===Revivals===
A 12-issue mini-series characterized by [[black comedy]], again titled'' [[The Punisher (Marvel Knights 2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' (April 2000 - March 2001) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]], under the ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' imprint, revived the character's popularity. An ongoing series (37 issues, Aug. 2001 - Feb. 2004), primarily by Ennis and Dillon, followed, succeeded in 2004 by an ongoing Ennis series under Marvel's mature-readers imprint, ''[[MAX (comics)|MAX]]''.

In November 2006, the Punisher returned in a new ''The Punisher War Journal'' (vol.2) series, written by [[Matt Fraction]] and pencilled by [[Ariel Olivetti]]. The first three issues of the book are set during the Marvel ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event. It involves Castle taking on supervillains rather than his traditional non-superpowered criminal antagonists. He has also made an appearance in the main ''Civil War'' (issue 5) series, as one of the opponents of the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].

===Marvel MAX imprint===
The ''Marvel MAX'' version of the Punisher is set in the [[Marvel Universe]] world but with no superhero appearances (in fact, the only other Marvel Universe character to appear in the unlimited MAX series thus far has been [[Nick Fury]].) In the mini-series ''[[The Punisher: Born|Born]]'', by Garth Ennis and [[Darick Robertson]], Castle's roots are traced back to Vietnam, during his third tour of duty in Vietnam, where he undergoes a psychological and possibly supernatural transformation into the Punisher in order to survive a massive assault on his fortification by the combined forces of the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[North Vietnamese Army]]. The one-shot ''Punisher: The Tyger'', by Ennis and [[John Severin]], went even further and showed that Castle had lived with murders, deaths and criminals his entire life. The ''MAX version'' of the Punisher ages in real time, propelling him into his late 50s early 60s and making him older than most of the mainstream Marvel Universe. Despite his age, his physical condition and health are well-maintained. The imprint depicts that the Punisher has been an active vigilante for almost thirty years, and in issue #19 it was said he had killed around two thousand people.

Whereas the traditional Punisher stories remained within the United States and involved antagonists and settings of conventional domestic crime, storylines of the ''Marvel MAX'' Punisher often focus on antagonists and plotlines dealing with current events, ranging from [[Accounting scandal|corporate fraud]] to [[sex slavery]] and most commonly the [[War on Terror]]. Characters in these stories are all products of past or current environments, including operatives of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[KGB]], [[MI6]], [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and various militaries and militias from the [[Balkans]] and [[Middle East]] and terrorist cells like the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]], all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the [[Cold War]] or the [[Yugoslav wars]].

A spin-off miniseries based on Barracuda, a chief antagonist of the 'Barracuda'' storyline, will debut in 2007 (despite the character appearing to have been killed).

==Fictional character biography==
{{main|History of the Punisher}}
[[Image:ArchiePunisher.jpg|thumb|195px|The Punisher's popularity extended to this Aug. 1994 crossover with [[Archie Comics]]. Marvel's version, with identical content, different cover, was ''The Punisher Meets Archie''. Cover art by [[Stan Goldberg]] & [[Henry Scarpelli]].]]
This capsule introduction appeared in ''The Punisher'' titles from 1987 to 1994: "When mobsters slew his family, Frank Castle vowed to spend the rest of his life avenging them. Trained as a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and equipped with state-of-the-art weapons, he now wages a one-man war against crime as the Punisher".

===Early life and military career===
Born in New York to parents of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] ancestry, Francis Castiglione is a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Captain]]. Before Frank joined the Marines, he was studying to become a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] priest, but changed his mind because he was unable to forgive those who did evil. Also prior to his enlistment, he married his wife Maria, who was already pregnant with their first child. During his time in the United States Marine Corps (USMC), Castle graduated from Basic Training, then went on to Infantry School. Immediately after, he went through the USMC's Reconnaissance, Force Reconnaissance, and Sniper Schools. Attaining dockets, Castle was permitted to go through [[United States Army Airborne School|U.S. Army Airborne School]], and [[Underwater Demolition Team|U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team]] training, becoming qualified as a [[Navy Seal|Navy SEAL]] (Sea, Air and Land). He served in the Vietnam War in the [[United States Special Operations Forces|Special Forces Unit]] as a point man, and was the only survivor (from both sides) of a Vietcong assault on Valley Forge Firebase in 1971. For heroism in the line of duty, he was decorated with numerous medals, including the [[Purple Heart]].

===Death of family===
Shortly after a tour in Vietnam, Castle, his wife, Maria and their children were in New York's Central Park for an afternoon picnic when they witnessed a Mafia gangland execution; an informant had been hanged from a tree. Seeking to eliminate all witnesses, the Costa crime family murdered them on the spot; however, Castle survived. Even though Frank was able to identify all of the shooters, the police were unable to help Castle in his quest for justice. They were tied in too deeply to the powerful Costa family. Grieving over his family's death and outraged at the incompetence of the police, Castle decided that the only punishment criminals might receive is that of physical destruction. Shortly thereafter, he emblazoned his body armor with a symbol of a death's head, and exacted his revenge. Since then, he has waged a one-man war on crime, taking the name "The Punisher". 

Castle has since devoted his life to eradicating [[organized crime]], using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of the Punisher, using his combat experience (four years as a United States Marine Corps Captain in a special operations unit in the Vietnam War), [[guerilla]] warfare (combat assault attacks, assassinations, ambushes, hit and runs, bombings, using the enemies' own money, weapons and supplies against them), urban warfare (using the crowded city of New York to blend in and disappear), psychological warfare (putting fear into the hearts of criminals), using detective-like skills (talking to people, reading obtained files on the people he goes after, tracking and surveilling the enemy), always adapting to the enemy such as using the Mafia's own methods and tactics against them (interrogating and torturing criminals to death in order to get information from them) and whatever resources and means may be necessary to do so, ranging from light [[anti-tank]] weaponry, to enraged [[polar bears]], [[piranha]]s, and even a [[hydrogen bomb]].

===Vigilante crusade===
The Punisher has fought virtually about every known criminal organization, including the [[Italian Mafia]], the [[Russian Mafia]], the Japanese [[Yakuza]], the Colombian and Mexican  [[drug cartels]], the Chinese [[Triads]], Jamaican [[Yardie]]s, the [[Irish Mob]], [[biker gangs]], [[street gangs]], [[gunrunning]] [[militias]], muggers, killers, rapists, other [[psychopaths]], [[sadists]], [[pedophiles]] and corrupt cops. The Punisher also assaults such criminal business enterprises as drugs, weapons smuggling, [[money laundering]] and [[human trafficking]]. The Punisher has been fighting organized crime for long enough that he knows their [[modus operandi]] and can often predict their actions. Many of these organizations have tried to kill the Punisher, using both their own men and hired [[contract killers]].

In his vigilante crusade, Castle had crossed paths with several costumed crimefighters, most notably Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. These encounters have often resulted in his incarceration. While he is known to be significantly inferior to Daredevil in a hand-to-hand combat skills, the Punisher has been rated as one of the most dangerous criminals alive. When he was incarcerated in New York’s Ryker’s Island Prison, (a Marvel Universe version of real-life [[Rikers Island]]) though heavily outnumbered in gang fights, the Punisher had routinely killed armed, homicidal criminals with frightening ease, sustaining no injury. Due to his proficiency in fighting, he is rarely so accosted in prison environments. Adhering to his military philosophies, the Punisher constantly trains whenever he is not out on action. He exercises fanatically to maintain his impressive physical conditioning and sticks to a balanced diet whenever possible.

The Punisher is highly mobile. He has many bases of operations and does not limit himself to working only in New York city. He has been to many places in the U.S. and around the globe, fighting crime such as the [[British Isles]], [[Latin America]] (Central and South America), [[Europe]], [[Russia]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The Punisher has an extensive [[criminal record]] due to his activities. The law enforcement such as the police, the [[FBI]], the [[CIA]] and even [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] are aware of his existence and have made many attempts to capture him; however, many rank-and-file law-enforcement officials are reluctant to take action against him because they largely agree with his tactics.

===Relations with superhero community===
While the Punisher most often fights normal criminals, he has also had run-ins with some of Marvel's superhuman villains, including [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]], [[Reavers (comics)|The Reavers]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]. Circumstances have even led him to battle Spider-Man, Daredevil, [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], in addition to Marvel [[spy fiction|superspy]] Nick Fury. Due to the Punisher's homicidal nature, few of his foes became recurring antagonists, the most notable of these being the severely scarred enforcer [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]. The Punisher also acquired a nemesis in the form of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], the longtime Spider-Man and Daredevil foe, and developed enmity with Daredevil himself, who likewise abhorred and fought against the Punisher's brutal methods. Castle's sidekick for a time, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]], was a techno-geek who could seemingly hack anything. 

The Punisher disregards what police and the public think of him, and has been known to kill corrupt cops. Doing so stirred police into heightened action against him and as such, he is viewed as a dangerous criminal by the public and by most members of the superhero community. During the Marvel ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' limited series, many superheroes in the rebellion opposing the Superhuman Registration Act objected to the Punisher joining their ranks even after he rescued Spider-Man from the supervillains, [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] whom he killed (see ''Civil War'' #5).

===In 2000s stories===
The ''MAX'' imprint's issue #19 states in a news report that the Punisher has been linked to the deaths of over 2,000 people. This figure does not include the number of military people he has killed. The number does not include deaths in another story in which the Punisher causes a hydrogen bomb to be dropped onto a [[Pacific]] island called Grand Nixon, where a General Kriegkopf has gathered 2,000 of the world's most dangerous mercenaries, including [[Russian (comics)|The Russian]] assassin.

As of the mid-2000s, Castle's timeline remained untouched when Marvel adjusted the timeframes of other characters. His history has never been altered or moved up, creating an unaddressed chronological anomaly.

==Abilities and training==
The Punisher possesses the normal human strength of a man, who engages in rigorous regular physical exercise. Frank engages in a brutal regimen of [[calisthenics]], katas and firing range practice daily, maintaining his combat skills.

The Punisher is a seasoned combat veteran of exceptional skills. A former U.S. Marine Captain with a distinguished combat record, Castle underwent [[sniper]] (his second tour in Vietnam was served as a sniper, as implied in "[[In the Beginning]]") and [[reconnaissance]] training while in the Corps. He also received a U.S. Navy SEAL, UDT (Underwater Demolition Team), LRRP (Long Range Recon Patrol) training and airborne training with the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy Special Forces. It has also been revealed in both the ''Marvel Knights'' and ''MAX'' imprints of ''The Punisher'' that Castle did receive training, skills and expertise from the [[Australian Army|Australian Army's]] [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment|Special Air Service Regiment]] when he was on exchange with Australian military forces operating in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War (It is also noted that while Castle was on exchange with the Australian SAS in Vietnam, he met Yorkie Mitchell, a British SAS soldier who was on exchange with the Australians at the same time. Mitchell would later become an agent for the British intelligence agency, [[MI6]] and he would cross paths and work with Castle on a number of occasions during the ''Marvel Knights'' and ''MAX'' runs of ''The Punisher''). 

Castle is well-versed in the arts of warfare and hand-to-hand combat. His styles of choice being Nash Ryu [[Ju Jitsu]] (the four-style martial art founded by his Sensei [[Adam Nash]] and the [[Marine Corps LINE combat system]]). He is an exceptional knife fighter who carries up to 3 or 4 different types of edged weapons, preferring the knife he learned to fight with in the USMC: the [[Ka-bar]] (in the movie he killed [[Harry Heck]] with a [[ballistic knife]]). 

Armed solely with conventional weapons and motivated by a fanatical hatred for criminals like those who murdered his family, the Punisher has single-handedly incapacitated up to a dozen well-armed and experienced opponents in a single encounter and escaped almost uninjured. It is his military training and his attention to detail that allows him to achieve this. He is an exceptional marksman who is sometimes depicted as being ambidextrous in this respect. ''The Punisher Armory'' series illustrates some of his thinking and training.

===Weapons===
[[Image:PUNMAX1.jpg|frame|The Punisher's arsenal.]]
The Punisher employs an almost endless arsenal of conventional firearms including [[machine guns]], [[rifles]], [[shotguns]], [[Pistol|handguns]], [[Knife|knives]], [[explosives]] and other weapons culled from common and organized criminals and military sources during his operations. A vast majority of his weapons have roots in military forces around the world, and typically employ weapons and accessories limited to military operations. He maintains and stores all his weapons and supplies in various warehouses and safehouses throughout [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]] and various other states. He employs this exhaustive arsenal in his war on criminals on a regular basis and with devastating effect. 

The Punisher often customizes his weapons for greater effectiveness with both standard and custom items including magnified optics, reflex sights, night vision scopes, [[flashlights]], [[grenade launcher]]s, sound and flash suppressors, bipods, high-capacity magazines and drums and various ammunition including [[Hollow point bullet|hollow point]] or [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor piercing]] bullets.

Throughout the Punisher's crusade against criminals, he occasionally used a number of high-tech transportations. During his early series, he used "battle vans" specially built and customized by his then-partner, Microchip. These vans were heavily armored, loaded with high-powered [[ammunition]]s with advanced telecommunication capabilities. Castle used these vans for surveillance and weapons transportation. He has also used motorcycles, helicopters, speed boats, or whatever he can find and use. In the ''Marvel MAX'' Punisher series, Castle resorts to basic equipment to track down his targets, including various cars, [[SUVs]] and vans.

==Costume==
[[Image:Punisher 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Classic Punisher costume.]] 
The Punisher's first outfit was a form-fitting black [[Kevlar]] bodysuit with a large white skull on his chest. According to the character, this draws the attention and the aim of the criminals to his heavily armored body, instead of his more vulnerable head. Each tooth of the skull is actually spare ammunition for firearms. Castle has used this costume on occasion in mid-2000s stories outside of the ''Marvel MAX'' imprint.

The ''Marvel MAX'' Punisher chooses not to utilize any costume outside of a black shirt with a white skull splashed across the front. His other clothing, which has included combat boots, blazers, leather jackets, trench coats, bulletproof vests, body armor, battle dress uniforms and camoflauge cloaks has been for the sake of protection or camoflauge in urban and wilderness areas.

==Personality==
The Punisher differs from the majority of comic book protagonists. Whereas all are vigilantes in that they work outside the traditional system of law and order, the Punisher is a remorseless, cold-blooded killer. This often creates friction when he is forced to work alongside heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Daredevil, many of whom abide by a "no-killing" rule which they insist he follows during collaborative efforts.

The Punisher possesses no superhuman abilities and succeeds solely through ingenuity and the rigorous training of his military upbringing, a finely-honed killer instinct and an extensive arsenal of weapons culled from fallen foes and military allies.

Unlike most comic book heroes, Castle also has no dual identity, no "real world" job, no known hobbies and only has few friends. He avoids capture by the authorities not just because of his extensive use of false documents, but also their latent admiration of his work, by eliminating criminals that the police cannot touch for various reasons. He spends nearly all of his time planning his next hit, stopping only to recover from injuries or fatigue. Money taken from criminals is used to purchase food, weapons, ammunition, and pay the rent of one of his many safehouses.

No one can really say what goes on in the mind of the Punisher, but there are two constants to his behavior- 1) his first thoughts are always to the mission  2)the concept of stopping is never present. He is never captured unless it is part of his overall plan. If by some chance he is captured, he claimes to carry at least one gun with his "mission-standard Budd Dwyer back up"-bullet. This is stated in the recent "Punisher War Journal" series.
===Views on criminal-justice system===
Castle's years of vigilantism have made him increasingly cynical about the capabilities of the American [[justice system]], especially in regard to its failure to successfully prosecute his family's homicide, due to the witnessed killer's false alibi and the mob's influence in the [[New York City Police Department]]. Throughout both the ''Marvel Knights'' and ''MAX'' run of ''The Punisher'', the given reason Castle kills those he regards as criminals (which include both circumstantially alleged and incontrovertible individuals) is his desire not to see average people becoming victims of crime and enduring the same kind of pain and loss he experienced. 

The way writers have approached the Punisher's response to the criminal justice system has changed many times over the years, though not since his earliest days as a standalone character (when he would occasionally use "[[Rubber bullets|mercy bullets]]" to make his actions more palatable) has the Punisher been portrayed as a hero. When originally conceived, his approach was hard-edged, and frowned upon by more heroic characters, such as Spider-Man. While that much remains true, the 2000s have seen a more considered take on the character's behavior. There are repeated references to the Punisher's contradictory and paradoxical views on the criminal justice system, though in general Castle never addresses his morality in any depth; he justifies his actions through such generalizations as, "That's another monster gone". Minor characters who question his motivation sometimes reach violent ends, with Castle refusing discussion and turning violent if pressed. Even villains have sometimes pointed out the web of justifications and rationalisations within which the Punisher operates. 

The Punisher knows that no matter how many hundreds or thousands of criminals he kills it does not make a difference in the world. Frank knows that his actions don’t make the world a safer place. This is seen in the MAX Punisher storyline ''The Slavers'', where the slaving operation continues despite his extermination of one cell.

Castle has also stated he does not want others to follow his path, on the grounds that his personal war against criminals is his alone (which can explain his desire not to see average people becoming victims of crime), and harbors resentment toward other (usually short-lived) vigilantes, taking exception at what he sees as their lack of "professionalism". In the first ''[[The Punisher (1986 limited series)|The Punisher]]'' mini-series, he battles an organization known as The Trust, which equipped brainwashed criminals with Punisher''esque'' clothing and sent them out to kill mobsters. Castle resents the Trust's lack of discipline, as several innocents had been killed by Trust operatives. He shows the same resentment in the 2000 ''Marvel Knights'' 12-issue series, in which he encounters three vigilantes known as The Holy (a psychotic priest who uses vigilantism as an excuse for murder), Elite (a fascist suburbanite) and Payback (a man who targets greedy and corrupt corporations, but gets innocent people killed in the process) and kills all three of them.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[alternate reality]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, a version of the Punisher has appeared in the Spider-Man series ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' #6-8, followed by ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #61. This Castle is not a Vietnam War veteran but an ex-[[NYPD]] police officer. Upon finding corruption within the force reaching up to his captain, Artie Jillette, Castle gathers evidence that he turns over to the department's [[internal affairs]] division. Castle's partner, Bruce Greenwood, however, informs the captain, who sends a handful of officers to kill Castle. They ambush Castle and his family at Central Park, making the attack look like a gangland killing. Castle, surviving, eventually kills all his attackers except Jillette, stopped from doing so by Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (comics)#Ultimate Daredevil|Daredevil]]. Castle is then taken into police custody, and given the same cell as the also incarcerated Jillette. 

He reappears in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man Annual'' #2 in which he kills a corrupt cop named Jeanne De Wolff.

===Video games===
{{main|Punisher computer and video games|The Punisher (2005 video game)}}

The Punisher has also been the main character in several [[computer and video game]]s. ''[[The Punisher (arcade game)]]'' was a side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] in the vein of ''[[Double Dragon]]'' in which the Punisher and/or Nick Fury would engage various foes in hand-to-hand combat, occasionally drawing firearms in lieu of melee combat. ''The Punisher'' [[computer game]] for the [[Amiga]] and [[personal computer|PC]] <ref>{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Moby Games  | work =   | publisher =   | date =   | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,2/gameId,120/  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate =  }}</ref> featured three different modes of gameplay: driving the Punisher's battle van, gunplay on foot and [[scuba diving]].  

A ''Punisher'' game was also released for the [[Game Boy]] system. It featured a cameo appearance of Spider-Man. The Kingpin was the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] in all versions except for Game Boy, which used Jigsaw. The Punisher also appeared in ''The Punisher'' for the [[NES]], in a side-scrolling, light-gun shooter that was similar in style to the later ''T2: Arcade''.

[[Image:Punisher game cover.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Punisher PlayStation 2 game]]

The Punisher made a cameo appearance in the 2000 [[PlayStation]] [[Spider-Man (video game)|Spider-Man game]] (with [[Daran Norris]] providing his voice). He was looking for Spider-Man but Spider-Man found him instead, and the Punisher leads him to Warehouse 65, where Spider-Man must stop the symbiote cloning process. After Spider-Man foils [[Doctor Octopus]]' plans, the Punisher is last seen playing cards with Spider-Man, Daredevil and [[Captain America]]. 

He was mentioned by name at the beginning of the 2005 multiplatform - game ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]'' a torn piece of his shirt can be seen hanging in the [[cinematic]] opening.

On January 18, 2005, a new ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|The Punisher]]'' game was released for the [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[personal computer|PC]]. It was developed by [[Volition Inc.]] and published by [[THQ]].

The Punisher game is extremely violent, and directly draws upon the character's 2000s comic book outings. Some critics have given it positive reviews {{fact}}, praising the script and such innovations as brutal [[interrogation]]/[[torture]] sequences. Other reviewers {{fact}} have criticized the game's use of obscuring effects (such as removal of color to create a [[black-and-white]] image) during violent scenes to retain an [[ESRB]] rating of M for Mature. Dan Cermak, vice president of the game's producer, Volition, said, "The goal was to make you feel and be the Punisher, and because of that you end up with a lot of violence". {{fact}}

By one month after the game's release, it had sold over 2 million copies.{{fact}} Marvel and THQ have each said a new Punisher video game will be released in 2006.{{fact}}

*The Punisher was not in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' because the video game license for the character is with [[THQ]].
*[[Dave Mustaine]], frontman of the [[heavy-metal]] band [[Megadeth]], noted that the hit song "The Punishment Due" was inspired by the Punisher, which Mustaine afterward stopped reading, stating "it's been commercialized". <ref>{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Megadeth Rockmetal interview  | work =   | publisher =   | date =   | url = http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_guitarschool1993.html  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate =  }}</ref>
*The character [[Big Shot (The Tick)|Big Shot]], from the animated TV series ''[[The Tick]]'', is a parody of the Punisher.
<!--* A character inspired by Frank Castle appears in Marvel's "Star Wars" comic series.  A violent bounty hunter named Valance, whose hatred of droids leads him to hunt Luke Skywalker, has a similiar appearance to Frank Castle, and wears a skull-emblazoned uniform. 
*It's important to note that his name Frank Castle is similar to that of Mexican Revolutionary Doroteo Arango Arambula, better known as "Pancho Villa", which is a pet form of Francisco Villa, a legendary vigilante the better know revolutionary would take the name from. Both the real-life and fictional vigilantes are parallel, perhaphs coincidentally, in their actions. PLEASE PROVIDE A CITATION OF THE INFO, OTHERWISE ITS CONSIDER AN ORIGINAL RESEARCH-->
