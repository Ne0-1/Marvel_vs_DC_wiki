'''The Punisher''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[vigilante]] and [[anti-hero]] in the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics Universe]]. Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[John Romita, Sr.]] and [[Ross Andru]], he [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #129 (Feb. 1974).

The Punisher is a vigilante who considers [[murder]], [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[coercion]], [[assault (tort)|threats of violence]] and [[torture]] to be acceptable crime fighting tactics. Driven by the deaths of his wife and children, who were killed by the [[Mafia|mob]] when they witnessed a gangland execution in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Central Park]], Frank Castle wages a one-man war on the mob and all criminals in general by using all manner of weaponry. A war [[veteran]], Castle is a master of spatial planning, [[martial arts]], stealth tactics, [[hand to hand combat]],  and a wide variety of weapons.

The Punisher's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him a novel character in mainstream [[American comic book]]s in 1974. By the late 1980s, he was part of a wave of psychologically troubled anti-heroes and was featured in several monthly publications, including ''The Punisher War Journal'', ''The Punisher War Zone'', and ''The Punisher Armory''. Two movie adaptations have been released, one in [[The Punisher (1989 film)|1989]], which featured [[Dolph Lundgren]] as The Punisher, and another in [[The Punisher (2004 film)|2004]], with the character played by [[Thomas Jane]]. A third adaptation is post-production and planned for a September 2008 release.

==Publication history==
The Punisher was created by Gerry Conway and his first appearance was illustrated by Ross Andru, at that time the regular writer and artist, respectively, for ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. Conway states he also helped design the character's distinctive costume:

{{cquote|In the '70s, when I was writing comics at DC and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters &mdash; heroes and villains &mdash; which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind. I had done that with the Punisher at Marvel. <ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/14conway.html  ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3 #14 (April 2002): "All The Stars There Are in (Super-hero) Heaven!" (Gerry Conway interviewed by Roy Thomas)]</ref>}}

Conway had drawn a character with a small [[Totenkopf|death's head]] skull on one breast. Then-Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita, Sr.]] took the basic design, blew the skull up to huge size, taking up most of the character's chest, and added a cartridge bandolier that formed the skull's teeth.

The Punisher was initially an [[antagonist]] of [[Spider-Man]], although only due to being duped by the [[supervillain]] known as [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|The Jackal]]. The character of the Punisher immediately became popular{{Fact|date=October 2007}}, and made appearances in the various Spider-Man titles and other series throughout the 1970s.

===Initial series===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:amspman129.jpg|160px|left|thumb|''Amazing Spider-Man''#129: The Punisher debuts.]] -->In the early 1980s, artist [[Mike Zeck]] and writer [[Steven Grant (comics)|Steven Grant]] proposed creating a Punisher series. Marvel published a [[miniseries]] whose premiere (Jan. 1986) was bannered on the cover as the first of four. After this first issue immediately sold out, Marvel expanded the miniseries to five issues (as then bannered on the cover of #2) and began active promotion.

[[Image:PunisherWarZone1.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''The Punisher War Zone'' #1 (March 1992). Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]]
An ongoing series, also titled ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'', premiered the next year. Initially by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], it eventually ran 104 issues (July 1987 - July 1995) and spun off two additional ongoing series &mdash; ''[[The Punisher War Journal]] (vol.1)'' (80 issues, Nov. 1988 - July 1995) and ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' (41 issues, March 1992 - July 1995), as well as the black-and-white comics magazine, ''The Punisher Magazine'' (16 issues, Nov. 1989 - Sept. 1990), and ''The Punisher Armory'' (10 issues, no cover dates, starting 1990), a fictional diary detailing ''"His thoughts! His feelings! His weapons!"'' (as stated on the cover of #1). The Punisher also appeared in numerous [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, and made frequent guest appearances in other Marvel comics, ranging from superhero series to the [[Vietnam War]]-era comic ''[[The 'Nam]]''.

===Decline===
In 1995, Marvel cancelled all three ongoing Punisher series due to poor sales. The publisher attempted a relaunch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series title ''[[The Punisher (1995 series)|The Punisher]]'', by writer [[John Ostrander]], in which the Punisher appeared to willingly join and work for organized crime, and later confronted the [[X-Men]] and [[Nick Fury]]. Writer [[Christopher Golden]]'s four-issue miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Purgatory]]'' (Nov. 1998 - Feb. 1999) posited a deceased Punisher resurrected as a [[supernatural]] agent of various [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s.

===Revivals===
A 12-issue mini-series characterized by [[black comedy]], again titled'' [[The Punisher (Marvel Knights 2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' (April 2000 - March 2001) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]], under the ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' imprint, revived the character's popularity. An ongoing series (37 issues, Aug. 2001 - Feb. 2004), primarily by Ennis and Dillon, followed, succeeded in 2004 by an ongoing Ennis series under Marvel's mature-readers imprint, ''[[MAX (comics)|MAX]]''.

In November 2006, the Punisher returned in a new ''The Punisher War Journal'' (vol.2) series, written by [[Matt Fraction]] and pencilled by [[Ariel Olivetti]]. The first three issues of the book are set during the Marvel ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' event. It involves Castle taking on supervillains rather than his traditional non-superpowered criminal antagonists. He has also made appearances in the main ''Civil War'' series (issues 5, 6 and 7).

===Marvel MAX===
[[Image:PunMax44.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional art for ''The Punisher'' vol. 7, #44 (March 2007), by [[Tim Bradstreet]]. Castle's birth date (Feb. 16, 1950) was redacted on the published cover.]] 

In Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]], the Punisher is set in the main [[Marvel Universe]] but without superhero appearances <ref>[http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/690.asp ComicBookMovie.com]</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=119683 Newsarama.com]</ref>. Frank Castle's timeline remained untouched when Marvel adjusted those of its other characters, with his history never altered or moved up in time. Promotional art for the cover of voll 7, #44 )March 2007) gave his birth date as February 16, 1950, but that was removed for the published issues.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = thepunisher.com | coauthors = | title = thepunisher.com (January 2007) | work = | publisher =Adam Johnson | date= January 16, 2007 | url =http://www.thepunisher.com/past_news/january_2007/january_2007.html | format = | doi = | accessdate =April 11, 2007}}</ref> Castle has a well-maintained physical condition and health, in spite of his age.

The imprint also depicts the Punisher as having been an active vigilante for almost 30 years, with vol. 7, #19 (June 2005) specifying he had killed approximately 2,000 people, not including military personnel or the mass deaths in a story in which the Punisher causes a [[Teller-Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]] to be dropped onto the  [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] island Grand Nixon, where a General Kriegkopf has gathered 2,000 mercenaries, including the assassin known as [[Russian (comics)|The Russian]].

Whereas the traditional Punisher stories remained within the United States and involved antagonists and settings of conventional domestic crime, stories of the MAX Punisher often focus on current events, ranging from [[Accounting scandals|corporate fraud]] to [[sexual slavery]] and the [[war on terrorism]]. Characters in these stories are all products of past or current environments, including operatives of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[KGB]], [[Secret Intelligence Service]], [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and militaries and militias from the [[Balkans]] and [[Middle East]] and terrorist cells like the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]], all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the [[Cold War]] or the [[Yugoslav wars]].

In the miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Born|Born]]'', by Garth Ennis and [[Darick Robertson]], Castle's roots are traced back to Vietnam, during his third tour of duty in Vietnam, where he undergoes a psychological and possibly supernatural transformation into the Punisher in order to survive a massive assault on his fortification by the combined forces of the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] and the [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]]. The one-shot ''Punisher: The Tyger'', by Ennis and [[John Severin]], went even further and showed that Castle had lived with murders, deaths and criminals all his life.

==Fictional character biography==
This capsule introduction appeared in ''The Punisher'' titles from 1987 to 1994: "When mobsters slew his family, Frank Castle vowed to spend the rest of his life avenging them. Trained as a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry, he now wages a one-man war against crime as the Punisher".

===Early life and military career===
Born in [[Queens]], New York to parents of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] ancestry, the young Francis Castiglione originally studied to become a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] priest, but changed his mind because he was unable to forgive those who did evil. Eventually, Castle would enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps]] becoming a U.S. Marine Captain. He married his wife Maria, who was already pregnant with their first child prior to his enlistment.

During his time in the USMC, Castle graduated from boot camp and then went on to [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry]]. Immediately after, he went through the USMC's [[Reconnaissance]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]], and Sniper Schools. Attaining dockets, Castle was permitted to go through [[United States Army Airborne School|U.S. Army Airborne School]], and [[Underwater Demolition Team|U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team]] training, becoming qualified as a [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] (Sea, Air and Land). While still in training, Castle met Phan Bighawk, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] scout. He was assigned to be Castle's guide, and through Phan, he learned how to survive in the wilderness.

Following his training, Castle would serve in the Vietnam War in the [[United States Special Operations Forces|Special Forces Unit]] as a point man. He fought in numerous engagements and was the only survivor (from both sides) of a Viet Cong assault on [[Valley Forge]] Firebase in 1971. For heroism in the line of duty, he was decorated with the [[Congressional Medal of Honor]], the [[Navy Cross]], 3 times the [[Silver Star]] and [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Stars]], 4 times the [[Purple Heart]], and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

While still in his first tour, Castle met Lieutenant Burt Kenyon. Kenyon was a Marine serving in the same combat company as Castle in Vietnam. When the platoon came under fire, Castle was badly injured by a V.C. explosive and surrounded by the enemy. However, Kenyon calmly appeared, gunned down the Viet Cong and dragged Castle to safety. Kenyon said to Castle that he now owes him his life. Two months later, Kenyon was declared mentally unfit for service and was discharged. Years later, Kenyon became a hired assassin known as "The Hitman" and died in a battle against Castle.

After finishing his first [[tour of duty]] in Vietnam, he signed up for a second tour. Castle served a total of 4 years in the Vietnam War ([[1968]] to [[1971]]). Six years later ([[1976]]) after the American involvement in Vietnam ended, Castle ran Special [[Black op|Black Ops]] training missions for Marine Recon Commandos in the upper New York State area.

===Death of family===
In 1976, Castle, his wife, Maria and their children Lisa and Frank Jr. were in New York's Central Park for an afternoon picnic when they witnessed a Mafia gangland execution; an informant had been hanged from a tree. To eliminate all witnesses, the Costa crime family murdered them on the spot; however, Castle survived. Even though Frank was able to identify all of the shooters, the police were unable to help Castle in his quest for justice. They were tied in too deeply to the powerful Costa family. Grieving over his family's death and outraged at the incompetence of the police, Castle decided that the only punishment criminals might receive is that of physical destruction. Shortly thereafter, he emblazoned his body armor with a symbol of a skull, and began his mission of punishing the guilty. Since then, he has waged a one-man war on crime, taking the name "The Punisher". 

Castle has since devoted his life to eradicating [[organized crime]], using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of the Punisher, using his combat experience (four years as a United States Marine Corps Captain in a special operations unit in the Vietnam War), [[guerrilla]] warfare (combat assault attacks, assassinations, ambushes, hit and runs, bombings, using the enemies' own money, weapons and supplies against them), urban warfare (using the crowded city of New York to blend in and disappear), psychological warfare (putting fear into the hearts of criminals), using detective-like skills (talking to people, reading obtained files on the people he goes after, tracking and surveying the enemy), always adapting to the enemy such as using the Mafia's own methods and tactics against them (interrogating and torturing criminals to death in order to get information from them) and whatever resources and means may be necessary to do so, ranging from light [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] weaponry, to enraged [[Polar Bear|polar bears]], [[piranha]]s, and even a [[Teller-Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]].

===Vigilante crusade===
The Punisher has fought virtually every known criminal organization including the Italian [[Mafia]], the [[Russian Mafia]], the Japanese [[Yakuza]], the Colombian and Mexican [[Illegal drug trade|drug cartels]], the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], the Chinese [[Triad society|Triads]], Jamaican [[Yardie]]s, the [[Irish Mob]], biker gangs, [[Gang|street gangs]], [[gunrunning]] [[militia]]s, muggers, killers, rapists, [[Psychopathy|psychopaths]], [[Sadism and masochism|sadists]], [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]], thieves, and corrupt city officials. He also assaults criminal business enterprises such as drugs, weapons smuggling, [[money laundering]] and [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]]. The Punisher has been fighting organized crime for long enough that he knows their [[modus operandi]] and can often predict their actions. Many of these organizations have tried to kill the Punisher, using both their own men and hired [[Contract killing|contract killers]].

In his vigilante crusade, the Punisher has crossed paths with several costumed crimefighters, including [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. These encounters have sometimes resulted in his incarceration. The Punisher has been rated as one of the most dangerous criminals alive. When he was incarcerated in New York’s [[Ryker's Island]] prison (a Marvel Universe version of real-life [[Rikers Island]]), though heavily outnumbered in gang fights, the Punisher had routinely killed armed, homicidal criminals with frightening ease, sustaining almost no injury. Due to his proficiency in fighting, he is rarely accosted in prison environments. Adhering to his military philosophies, the Punisher constantly trains whenever he is not out on action. He exercises fanatically to maintain his impressive physical conditioning and sticks to a balanced diet whenever possible.

The Punisher is highly mobile. He has many bases of operations and does not limit himself to working only in New York City. He has been to many places in the U.S. and around the globe, fighting crime in such places as the [[British Isles]], [[Latin America]] (Central and South America), [[Europe]], [[Russia]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The Punisher has an extensive [[criminal record]] due to his activities. The law enforcement community such as the police, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and even [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] are aware of his existence and have made many attempts to capture him; however, many rank-and-file law enforcement officials are reluctant to take action against him because most of them support his war on violent crime.

===Relation with superhero community===
While the Punisher most often fights normal criminals, he has also had run-ins with some of Marvel's superhuman villains, including [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Reavers (comics)|The Reavers]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]. Circumstances have even led him to battle Spider-Man, Daredevil, [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], in addition to Marvel [[spy fiction|superspy]] Nick Fury, although on other occasions, several superheroes become allies and partners for brief times. Due to the Punisher's homicidal nature, few of his foes became recurring antagonists, the most notable of these being the severely scarred enforcer [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] and the over the top mercenary [[Barracuda (Marvel Comics)|Barracuda]]. The Punisher also acquired a nemesis in the form of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], a longtime Spider-Man and Daredevil foe, and developed enmity with Daredevil himself, who likewise abhorred and fought against the Punisher's brutal methods. Castle's sidekick for a time, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]], was a techno-geek who could seemingly hack anything, but was later killed in ''The Punisher'' #6 ([[MAX (comics)|MAX]]).

===Civil War & World War Hulk events===
During the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' limited series, many superheroes in the rebellion opposing the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]] object to the Punisher joining their ranks even after he rescues Spider-Man from the supervillains [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], whom he kills.<ref>''Civil War'' #5 and ''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #1</ref> But when the Punisher kills the supervillains [[Plunderer]] and [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]], who arrive peacefully to join the rebellion, [[Captain America]] immediately ejects the Punisher. During the final battle, Punisher kills [[Stilt-Man]]. After the surrender of Captain America, the Punisher picks up Cap's mask off the ground. Following the events of Civil War and the death of Captain America, the Punisher dons a hybrid Captain America costume while fighting a neo-nazi called Hate-Monger.<ref>Beginning in ''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #7, per [http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.889 "The New Captain America?" Marvel.com (March 13, 2007)]</ref>  After killing Hate-Monger and disassembling his organization, the Punisher confronts Captain America's ex-partner, the Winter Soldier, and gives him Captain America's mask.

During the events known as "[[World War Hulk]]", the Punisher killed the rampaging alien Mung the Inconceivable of the [[Warbound]] using a specially designed power-augmenting suit.

==Abilities and training==
The Punisher possesses the normal human strength of a man who engages in rigorous regular physical exercise. Frank Castle engages in a brutal regimen of [[calisthenics]], katas and firing range practice daily, maintaining his combat skills. Armed solely with conventional weapons and motivated by a fanatical hatred for criminals like those who murdered his family, the Punisher has single-handedly incapacitated up to a dozen well-armed and experienced opponents in a single encounter and escaped almost uninjured. It is his military training and his attention to detail that allows him to achieve this.

The Punisher is a seasoned combat veteran of exceptional skills. A former U.S. Marine Captain with a distinguished combat record, Castle underwent [[sniper]] (his second tour in Vietnam was served as a sniper) and [[reconnaissance]] training while in the Corps. He also received U.S. Navy SEAL, UDT (Underwater Demolition Team), LRRP (Long Range Recon Patrol) training and airborne training with the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy Special Forces. The ''Marvel Knights'' and ''MAX'' imprints of ''The Punisher'' revealed that Castle received training, skills and expertise from the [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] when he was on exchange with Australian military forces operating in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

Castle is well-versed in the arts of warfare and hand-to-hand combat, his styles of choice being Nash Ryu [[Jujutsu]] (the four-style martial art founded by his Sensei Adam Nash) and the [[Marine Corps LINE combat system]]. He is an exceptional knife fighter who carries up to 3 or 4 different types of edged weapons, preferring the knife he learned to fight with in the USMC: the [[KA-BAR]]. 

=== Weapons ===
[[Image:PUNMAX1.jpg|thumb|The Punisher's arsenal]]

The Punisher's ever-changing arsenal of weaponry includes [[automatic weapon|automatic]] and [[semiautomatic rifle]]s, and an array of [[handguns]], fragmentation and [[tear gas]] [[grenade]]s, other explosives, and combat [[knives]]. A personal favorite is his [[ballistic knife]], which can launch its blade with lethal force. He commonly uses [[M16 rifle|M16]] .223 caliber automatic rifles, Sterling Mark 6 9mm, semi-automatic rifles, 9mm [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] Llama automatic [[pistol]]s, .45 caliber automatic frame rechambered for 9mm. [[ammunition]], .223 caliber [[Derringer]]s, and Gerber Mark II combat knives. He maintains and stores all his weapons and supplies in warehouses and [[safehouse]]s throughout [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]] and other states.

The Punisher often customizes his weapons for greater effectiveness with both standard and custom items including magnified optics, reflex sights, night vision scopes, [[flashlight]]s, [[grenade launcher]]s, sound and flash suppressors, bipods, high-capacity magazines and drums and ammunition including [[Hollow-point bullet|hollow point]] and [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor piercing]] bullets.

Throughout the Punisher's crusade, he occasionally uses high-tech vehicles. His early series feature "battle vans" specially built and customized by his then-partner, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]]. These vans were heavily armored, loaded with high-powered ammunitions with advanced telecommunication capabilities. Castle used these vans for [[surveillance]] and weapons transportation. He has also used motorcycles, helicopters, speed boats, or whatever he can find and use. In the ''Marvel MAX'' series, Castle resorts to basic equipment to track down his targets such as [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] and [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle|Humvee]] vehicles.

At one point, the Punisher had a pet [[Rottweiler]], "Max", which he had saved from a [[dog fighting]] ring.

===Costume===
The Punisher's first outfit was a form-fitting black [[Kevlar]] bodysuit with a large white skull on his chest. According to the character, this draws the attention and the aim of the criminals to his heavily armored body, instead of his more vulnerable head. Each tooth of the skull is actually spare ammunition for firearms. Castle has used this costume on occasion in mid-2000s stories outside of the ''Marvel MAX'' imprint.

The ''Marvel MAX'' Punisher chooses not to utilize any costume outside of a black shirt with a white skull splashed across the front. His other clothing, which has included combat boots, blazers, leather jackets, trench coats, bulletproof vests, body armor, battle dress uniforms, hoodies, and camouflage cloaks has been for the sake of protection or camouflage in urban and wilderness areas.

==Personality==
The Punisher differs from the majority of comic book protagonists. Whereas all are vigilantes in that they work outside the traditional system of law and order, the Punisher is a remorseless, cold-blooded killer. This often creates friction when he is forced to work alongside heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Daredevil, many of whom abide by a "no-killing" rule which they insist he follow during collaborative efforts.

The Punisher possesses no superhuman abilities and succeeds solely through ingenuity and the rigorous training of his military upbringing, a finely honed killer instinct and an extensive arsenal of weapons culled from fallen foes and military allies.

Unlike most comic book heroes, Castle also has no dual identity, no "real world" job, no known hobbies, and few friends. He spends nearly all of his time planning his next hit, stopping only to recover from injuries or fatigue. Money taken from criminals is used to purchase food, weapons, ammunition, and pay the rent of his many safehouses.

The Punisher also disregards what the police and the public think of him, and has been known to kill corrupt cops. But in an event that he kills an innocent person, he will voluntarily turn himself in to justice.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #161</ref> He is viewed as a dangerous criminal by the public and by most members of the superhero community, but many law enforcement personnel move against him only very reluctantly, because many honest police officers and federal agents view his actions as beneficial since he goes after criminals and corrupt officials who feel they are beyond the law.

==Views on criminal-justice system==
Castle's years of vigilantism have made him increasingly cynical about the capabilities of the American [[Legal systems of the world|justice system]], especially in regard to its failure to successfully prosecute his family's homicide, due to the witnessed killer's false alibi and the [[political corruption|mob's influence]] in the [[New York City Police Department]]. During Don Daley's run on ''The Punisher'' title, his version of justice was classically based as "[[an eye for an eye]]". <ref>''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' #98 (Jan. 1995): letters page</ref> Throughout both the ''Marvel Knights'' and ''MAX'' run of ''The Punisher'', the given reason Castle kills those he regards as criminals (which include both circumstantially alleged and incontrovertible individuals) is his desire not to see average people becoming victims of crime and enduring the same kind of pain and loss he experienced.

The way writers have approached the Punisher's response to the criminal justice system has changed many times over the years, though not since his earliest days as a standalone character (when he would occasionally use "[[Rubber bullet|mercy bullets]]" to make his actions more palatable) has the Punisher been portrayed as a hero. When originally conceived, his approach was hard-edged, and frowned upon by more heroic characters, such as Spider-Man. While that much remains true, the 2000s have seen a more considered take on the character's behavior. There are repeated references to the Punisher's contradictory and paradoxical views on the criminal justice system, though in general Castle never addresses his morality in any depth; he justifies his actions through such generalizations as, "That's another monster gone." Minor characters who question his motivation sometimes reach violent ends, with Castle refusing discussion and turning violent if pressed. Even villains have sometimes pointed out the web of justifications and rationalisations within which the Punisher operates. 

Castle has also stated he does not want others to follow his path, on the grounds that his personal war against criminals is his alone, and he harbors resentment toward other (usually short-lived) vigilantes, taking exception at what he sees as their lack of "professionalism".<ref>See  the 1986 miniseries ''[[The Punisher (1986 limited series)|The Punisher]]'' and the 2000 ''Marvel Knights'' 12-issue miniseries.</ref>

A [[film]] adaptation was directed by [[Mark Goldblatt]] (later the [[film editing|film editor]] of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'') and written by [[Boaz Yakin]]. It starred [[Dolph Lundgren]] as the Punisher with [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] The film's most recognizable deviation from the comic books is the lack of the character's signature skull logo and the fact that the Punisher is a former cop.

A second film adaptation was directed by [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] (who wrote ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance|Die Hard: With a Vengeance]]'') and starred [[Thomas Jane]] for the lead role with [[John Travolta]] as the main villain [[The Punisher (2004 film)#Cast|Howard Saint]]. This movie adaption was more faithful to the comic book and was loosely based on the ''Welcome Back, Frank'' comic. It was released in the U.S. on April 16, 2004. It was met with mixed reviews by critics and performed weakly at the box office.
