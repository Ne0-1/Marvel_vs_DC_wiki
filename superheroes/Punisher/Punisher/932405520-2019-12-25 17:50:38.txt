The '''Punisher''' ('''Francis''' "'''Frank'''" '''Castle''', born '''Castiglione''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[John Romita Sr.]] and [[Ross Andru]]. The Punisher made his first appearance in [[The Amazing Spider-Man 129|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129]] ([[cover-date]]d February [[1974 in comics|1974]]).

The character is an [[Italian-American]]<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDvMRvvfIK4C&pg=PA6399&dq=%22frank+castle%22+italian&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwid0cTOxe3SAhWH_iwKHWnoBqoQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&q=frank%20castle&f=false |title=Library of Congress Subject Headings|page=6399|publisher=[[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name="Martone 334">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHJ1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA334&dq=Punisher+sicilian+saga&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjorNrewO3SAhVHQpoKHS6TCsgQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=Punisher%20sicilian&f=false |title= Italian Americans: The History and Culture of a People|first= Eric|last=Martone |isbn=978-1610699945 |date=December 12, 2016 |page=334 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[vigilante]] who employs [[murder]], [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[coercion]], [[Assault (tort)|threats of violence]], and [[torture]] in his campaign against crime.

The Punisher's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him an anomaly in mainstream [[American comic book]]s when he debuted in 1974. By the late 1980s, the Punisher was part of a wave of psychologically-troubled antiheroes. At the height of his popularity, the character was featured in four monthly publications: ''The Punisher'', ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'', ''[[The Punisher War Zone|The Punisher: War Zone]]'', and ''The Punisher Armory''.

Despite his violent actions and dark nature, the Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success on television, making guest appearances on series as ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', where the depiction of his violent behavior was toned down for family viewers. In feature films, [[Dolph Lundgren]] portrayed the Punisher in ''[[The Punisher (1989 film)|The Punisher]]'', as did [[Thomas Jane]] in ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and [[Ray Stevenson]] in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''. [[Jon Bernthal]] portrayed the character in the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' and the spin-off ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Publication history==
{{For|complete list of Punisher titles|List of The Punisher titles}}

===First appearance===
The Punisher was conceived of by [[Gerry Conway]], then-writer of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', inspired by ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'', a popular book series created by author [[Don Pendleton]], in which a [[Vietnam veteran]], [[Mack Bolan]], becomes a serial killer of criminals after the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]-related deaths of his family. Conway described the inspiration in an interview from 1987: "I was fascinated by the Don Pendleton Executioner character, which was fairly popular at the time, and I wanted to do something that was inspired by that, although not to my mind a copy of it. And while I was doing the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] storyline, the opportunity came for a character who would be used by the Jackal to make [[Spider-Man]]'s life miserable. The Punisher seemed to fit."<ref>Comics Interview #75 (1985)</ref>

Conway also helped design the character's distinctive costume. As Conway recalled in 2002, "In the '70s, when I was writing comics at [[DC Comics|DC]] and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters—heroes and villains—which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind. I had done that with the Punisher at Marvel."<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/14conway.html |title=All the Stars There Are in (Super-hero) Heaven!

Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita, Sr.]] took the basic design and blew the skull up to huge size, taking up most of the character's chest.<ref>John Romita Sr., in {{cite web |title=Spider-Man At 50 Part Four: A John Romita Sr. Interview From 2002 |first=Tom |last=Spurgeon |authorlink=Tom Spurgeon |url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_interview_re_run_john_romita_2002/ |publisher=TheComicsReporter.com |accessdate=2014-03-08 |archivedate=August 20, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820203336/http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_interview_re_run_john_romita_2002/ |url-status=live}}</ref> ''Amazing Spider-Man'' [[penciller]] [[Ross Andru]] was the first artist to draw the character for publication.

[[Stan Lee]], then Marvel's editor-in-chief, recalled in 2005 that he had suggested the character's name:

{{quote|Gerry Conway was writing a script and he wanted a character that would turn out to be a hero later on, and he came up with the name the Assassin. And I mentioned that I didn't think we could ever have a comic book where the hero would be called the Assassin, because there's just too much of a negative connotation to that word. And I remembered that, some time ago, I had had a relatively unimportant character ... [who] was one of [the cosmic antagonist] [[Galactus]]' robots, and I had called him the [[Punisher (Galactus)|Punisher]], and it seemed to me that that was a good name for the character Gerry wanted to write—so I said, 'Why not call him the Punisher?' And, since I was the editor [sic; Lee had been named publisher in 1972], Gerry said, 'Okay.'<ref>{{cite journal |title=Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview! |work=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] |volume=3 |issue=104 |page=32 |date=August 2011}} (transcript of 2005 interview)</ref>}}

Appearing for the first time in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129 (Feb. 1974), the Punisher was initially an [[antagonist]] of [[Spider-Man|the titular hero]]. He is portrayed as a bloodthirsty vigilante who has no qualms about killing gangsters, something that most superheroes of the time refrain from doing. [[J. Jonah Jameson]] describes him as "the most newsworthy thing to happen to [[New York City|New York]] since [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]]".

All he reveals about himself is that he is a former [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]].

He is engaged in extensive soul-searching as to what is the right thing to do: although he has few qualms about killing, he is outraged when his then-associate, the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]],<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 72|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Gerry Conway and artist Ross Andru introduced two major new characters to Spider-Man's world and the Marvel Universe in this self-contained issue.

===Initial series===
In the early 1980s, writer and college student [[Steven Grant]] was at a comics convention in New York City over the Christmas break. At the time he was living with Duffy Vohland, an employee in Marvel's production department. Vohland encouraged Grant to pitch story ideas to Marvel, and arranged an interview with then-editor-in-chief [[Marv Wolfman]], with whom Grant would become good friends. Grant sat at Vohland's typewriter for a day and wrote three ideas: One involved the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]] and one was the Punisher, since those were characters he liked that as far as Grant knew, no other Marvel writer was working with at the time. Unbeknownst to Grant, the Punisher, as it turned out, was the lead in a black and white magazine being written by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], making the character unavailable for Grant's use. A couple of years later Grant began writing for Marvel after another friend, [[Roger Stern]], became a Marvel editor there and asked Grant to write something for him. In 1979, Marvel began considering publishing miniseries, which Grant had been lobbying for some time. Grant began pushing for a ''Punisher'' miniseries, but this was met with disinterest from editorial, as the character was not thought of as one that readers would care about. The following year, Grant collaborated on ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #94 with artist [[Mike Zeck]]. In 1984, Zeck illustrated Marvel's first ''[[Secret Wars]]'' miniseries, which raised his profile in the Marvel offices, where editors were thinking in terms of talent "stables" that worked exclusively for each editor. A new editor, [[Carl Potts]], was looking for projects, so Grant and Zeck pitched a ''Punisher'' miniseries to him, and Potts accepted it, over much objection from Marvel management, who told him that he bore full responsibility for it.<ref name="CBR3.6.15">Cronin, Brian (March 6, 2015). [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2015/03/06/comic-book-legends-revealed-513/3/ "Comic Book Legends Revealed #513"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].</ref>

The miniseries premiered with a January 1986 cover date. It was bannered on the cover as the first of four; although the series had always been intended to be five issues long, and the banner was an error that recurred throughout the entire run.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cronin |first=Brian |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #196 |year=2008 |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/02/26/comic-book-legends-revealed-196/ |work=Comic Book Resources}}</ref> The plot changed from Grant's initial story, though the basic concept remained the same.<ref name="CBR3.6.15" /> An important element of the story was a [[retcon]] that explains that many of the Punisher's more extreme actions to this point were the result of being poisoned with mind-altering drugs.<ref>''The Punisher'' #1–5 (January–May 1986). Marvel Comics</ref>

[[File:PunisherWarZone1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''The Punisher War Zone'' #1 (March 1992); art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]]
An ongoing series, also titled ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'', premiered the next year. Initially by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], it eventually ran 104 issues (July 1987 – July 1995) and spun off two additional ongoing series—''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (80 issues, November 1988 – July 1995) and ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' (41 issues, March 1992 – July 1995), as well as the black-and-white comics magazine ''The Punisher Magazine'' (16 issues, November 1989 – September 1990) and ''The Punisher Armory'' (10 issues, no cover dates, starting 1990), a fictional diary detailing "His thoughts! His feelings! His weapons!" (as stated on the cover of issue #1). The Punisher also appeared in numerous [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, and made frequent guest appearances in other Marvel comics, ranging from superhero series to the [[Vietnam War]]-era comic ''[[The 'Nam]]''.

During this era, the Punisher was assisted by his then-partner, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]]. Serving as a [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] type figure, he would supply the Punisher with high-tech vehicles and equipment such as armored combat "battle vans" specially built and customized.

Over the next decade, the Punisher would be shown fighting virtually every known, criminal organization, including the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian Mafia]], the [[Russian Mafia|Russian Bratva]], the [[Yakuza|Japanese Yakuza]], the [[Colombia|Columbian]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Illegal drug trade|drug cartels]], the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], the [[Triad (underground societies)|Chinese Triads]], [[Yardie|Jamaican Yardie]]s, the [[Irish Mob]], [[outlaw motorcycle club|biker gangs]], [[Gang|street gangs]], [[arms trafficking|gunrunning]] [[militia]]s, [[Robbery|muggers]], [[Murder|killer]]s, [[rape|rapists]], [[Psychopathy|psychopaths]], violent [[racism|racists]], [[Sadomasochism|sadists]], [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]], and [[Political corruption|corrupt city officials]] . He also assaults criminal business enterprises such as [[drug trafficking]], [[Gun running|weapons smuggling]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]].

Due to the Punisher's homicidal nature, few of his foes became recurring antagonists, the most notable of these being the severely-scarred enforcer [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]. The Punisher also acquired a nemesis in the form of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]],<ref>''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' vol. 2, #15–19 (January–May 1989)</ref> a longtime Spider-Man and Daredevil foe, and developed enmity with Daredevil himself, who likewise abhorred and fought against the Punisher's brutal methods. Villains such as the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]], [[Doctor Doom]],<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #28–29 (Mid December 1989 – January 1990)</ref> The [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] would be used to provide more of a challenge for the character. In addition, heroes such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Daredevil, [[Ghost Rider]],<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3, #5–6 (September–October 1990)</ref> the [[Hulk]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #6–7 (June–July 1989)</ref> [[Nick Fury]], and [[Moon Knight]]<ref name=":0">''The Punisher Annual'' vol. 2 #2 (1989)</ref> – and, on at least two occasions, the preadolescent team [[Power Pack]]<ref>''Strange Tales'' #14, ''Power Pack'' vol. 1 #46</ref> – would appear. Often the stories would use the appearance of those heroes to provide commentary on the difference between the Punisher and those more colourful characters. During Don Daley's run on ''The Punisher'' title, his version of justice was described by the editor as "an [[eye for an eye]]".<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #98 (January 1995): Letters page</ref>

===Decline===
In 1995, Marvel canceled all three ongoing Punisher series due to poor sales. The publisher attempted a re-launch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series ''[[Punisher (1995 series)|Punisher]]'', under the new [[Marvel Edge]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], by writer [[John Ostrander]], in which the Punisher willingly joined and became the boss of an organized crime family, and later confronted the [[X-Men]] and [[Nick Fury]]. The series ran for 18 issues, from November 1995 to April 1997. Writer [[Christopher Golden]]'s four-issue Marvel Knights miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Purgatory]]'' (November 1998 – February 1999) posited a deceased Punisher resurrected as a [[supernatural]] agent of various [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s. This version of the character also appeared in a 4-issue mini-series co-starring Wolverine.

===Revivals===
A 12-issue miniseries by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]], again titled ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' (April 2000 – March 2001), under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint, revived the character's popularity. An ongoing series (37 issues, August 2001 – February 2004), primarily by Ennis and Dillon, followed, succeeded in 2004 by an ongoing Ennis series under Marvel's mature-readers imprint, [[MAX (comics)|MAX]]. Returning the character to his lone vigilante roots, those series combined crime-focused stories with black humor. The look of the Punisher was modified further removing the white gloves and pairing his traditional skull imprinted shirt with combat trousers, black combat boots and a black trench coat. Castle has used this costume on occasion in mid-2000s stories before ''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2.

===MAX imprint===

Continuing his run on the character, [[Garth Ennis]] used the freedom of the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] to write more realistic and hard-edged stories than had previously been seen.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=120373 | title=Max'ing Out the Future: Axel Alonso Talks Marvel Max | work=[[Newsarama]] | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519203358/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=120373 | archivedate=May 19, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comixtreme.com/forums/showthread.php?t=33068 | title=''Punisher War Journal'' #4 Review | work=ComiXtreme}}</ref> Ennis has stated that he would "like to see less superheroes";<ref>{{Cite book | last=Ennis | first=Garth | chapter=Frankly, I'd Like to See Less Superheroes | title=Inside the World of Comic Books | editor-first=Jeffery | editor-last=Klaehn | location=Montreal | publisher=Black Rose Books | year=2007 | pages=206–210}}</ref> this desire is reflected in the gritty, realistic tone and the anti-heroic portrayals of both the title character and [[Nick Fury]], who made two guest appearances in the series. ''Punisher'' also made it explicit that Castle's timeline was fixed, while Marvel adjusted those of its other characters, with his history never altered or moved up in time. Promotional art for the cover of ''Punisher'' vol. 6, #44 (March 2007), gave his birth date as February 16, 1950, but that was removed for the published issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} After the departure of Ennis as writer, the series was renamed ''Punisher: Frank Castle'' with issue #66.

The imprint depicts the Punisher being active for almost 30 years, with ''Punisher'' vol. 6, #19 (June 2005) specifying he had killed approximately 2,000 people. Whereas the traditional Punisher stories remained within the [[United States]] and involved antagonists and settings of conventional domestic crime, stories of the MAX Punisher often focus on current events, ranging from [[Accounting scandals|corporate fraud]] to [[sexual slavery]] and the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]. Many characters are past or current intelligence and military operatives from governmental agencies like the [[United States|American]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[Soviet]] [[KGB]], and the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and [[Special Air Service|SAS]], as well as various militaries and militias from the [[Balkans]] and [[Middle East]], including the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the [[Cold War]] or the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav Wars]].

The miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Born|Born]]'' by Garth Ennis and [[Darick Robertson]] further examines Castle's roots, tracing them back to his third tour of the Vietnam War, where he undergoes a psychological and possibly supernatural transformation into the Punisher to survive a massive assault on his fortification by the combined forces of the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]]. The one-shot ''Punisher: The Tyger'', by Ennis and [[John Severin]], went even further and showed that Castle had lived with murders, deaths and criminals from his childhood.

The ''MAX'' version of the Punisher ends with the character's death. After killing the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Castle dies from his own wounds in issue #21 of ''[[PunisherMAX]]''. He is buried in issue #22 as his death sparks a public uprising and killing of the city's criminals.

===''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2)===
In November 2006, a new ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' series, written by [[Matt Fraction]] and penciled by [[Ariel Olivetti]], was released. The first three issues of the book are set during Marvel's "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" event. It involves Castle taking on supervillains rather than his traditional non-super-powered criminal antagonists. He has also made appearances in the main ''Civil War'' series (issues #5–7). Wearing both his traditional costume and his Marvel Knights/MAX attire, and a new costume designed to look like his costume and Captain America's combined, the series pitted the character against a series of super-powered foes while also being involved in crossover events such as "[[World War Hulk]]" and "[[Secret Invasion]]".

Marvel relaunched ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' in 2009 as simply ''[[Punisher (2009 series)|Punisher]]'', with a thematic link tied to the events of the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline and, following the departure of writer [[Garth Ennis]], retitled the Marvel MAX series (formerly ''Punisher MAX'') as ''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX'' and, more recently, as ''Punisher: Frank Castle''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13057 | title=''Punisher: Frank Castle'' #75 (December 2009) | work=Marvel.com}}</ref> or ''Frank Castle: The Punisher''<ref>''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX'' #74 (November 2009): Page 44</ref> (depending on the source); launching a new series called ''PunisherMAX'' by [[Jason Aaron]] and [[Steve Dillon]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13374 | title=''PunisherMAX'' #1 (January 2010) | work=Marvel.com}}</ref> As part of his work on the character, [[Rick Remender]] wrote the one-shot title ''Dark Reign: The List – Punisher'', which, as part of the "Dark Reign" storyline, shows the character dismembered and decapitated by [[Daken]].<ref>''Dark Reign: The List – The Punisher'' #1 (December 2009)</ref>

Following this, the main ''Punisher'' series was renamed ''FrankenCastle'' and featured a Castle who is resurrected by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] and the Legion of Monsters as a patchwork, [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein]]-like creature.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7, #11 (January 2010)</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091118-Punisher-Remender.html | title=Putting the Punisher Back Together With Rick Remender | work=Newsarama | date=November 18, 2009}}</ref> He joins up with the Legion of Monsters to help protect the monsters of Monster Metropolis from the Hunter of Monster Special Force.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7, #12 (February 2010)</ref> At the conclusion of the series, the character was transformed back into a normal human when he acquired the mystical Bloodstone, with its healing abilities restoring his humanity, although he subsequently chose to discard it despite its healing powers because he recognized that reliance on the stone would result in its side-effects eventually affecting his judgment so that he would lose the ability to recognize innocents.{{issue|date=November 2018}}

A violent gang war resulted in the murders of nearly 30 people at a wedding reception, including the groom, leaving the bride, U.S. Marine Sergeant [[Rachel Cole-Alves]], a widow just hours after getting married. Frank had connections with one of the detectives on the case and used the information he gave him to kill members of the Exchange, the group responsible, before the police had a chance to question them.

Later, the Punisher loses an eye while fighting a new version of the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''The Punisher'' #2 (2011)</ref> The Punisher later confronts a recuperated Rachel Cole-Alves in a Hotel where members of the Exchange were meeting. Together they kill the members. It is later revealed to be part of a plan to lure the Punisher to 727 Varick level 19 suite A. Both Rachel Cole-Alves and the Punisher go to the location only to find it to be a trap. They later find out that [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] has the Omega Drive.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #6</ref> Later Rachel Cole-Alves and the Punisher find Daredevil and [[Spider-Man]]. They then work together to destroy the drive.<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 8) #10</ref><ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 3) #11</ref>

The Punisher and Cole-Alves later succeed in killing the heads of the Exchange, but in the process, Cole-Alves accidentally kills NYPD Homicide Detective Walter Bolt.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Greg Rucka|penciller = Marco Checchetto|inker = Marco Checchetto|colorist = Matt Hollingsworth|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Stephen Wacker|title = The Punisher|volume = 9|issue = #15|date = 5 September 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> On the run from the NYPD, Cole-Alves eventually tries to commit suicide by police, only to be captured and sent to prison. Castle eludes capture.<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 8) #16</ref>

Cole-Alves is sentenced to death for her crimes. Meanwhile, Spider-Man confronts Castle, but he manages to escape. Spider-Man then talks to the Avengers, stating that Castle is a problem and needs to be taken care of. Wolverine, believing that lethal methods are sometimes justified, refuses to assist.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Greg Rucka|penciller = Carmine Di Giandomenico|inker = Carmine Di Giandomenico|colorist = Matt Hollingsworth|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Stephen Wacker|title = Punisher War Zone|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 24 October 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Black Widow tracks Castle to South America, where they fight to a standstill before Widow gets distracted by a group of mercenaries guarding a town full of sick villagers, abandoning the fight to help them.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Greg Rucka|penciller = Carmine Di Giandomenico|inker = Carmine Di Giandomenico|colorist = Matt Hollingsworth|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Stephen Wacker|title = Punisher War Zone|volume = 3|issue = #2|date = 5 December 2012|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Thor pursues Castle next, although all he wants is to talk Castle into turning himself in.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Greg Rucka|penciller = Carmine Di Giandomenico|inker = Carmine Di Giandomenico|colorist = Matt Hollingsworth|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Stephen Wacker|title = Punisher War Zone|volume = 3|issue = #3|date = 9 January 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Castle sneaks back into the US to try and break Cole-Alves out of prison. The Avengers set a trap, figuring Castle would target a transport unit. Castle sees through the deception, and rescues the real Cole-Alves by disguising himself as Iron Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Greg Rucka|penciller = Carmine Di Giandomenico|inker = Carmine Di Giandomenico|colorist = Matt Hollingsworth|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Stephen Wacker|title = Punisher War Zone|volume = 3|issue = #4|date = 30 January 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Wolverine was later revealed to be the source of his information, and Logan helps Cole-Alves escape while Castle stays behind to battle the Avengers and buy time.

Punisher and Black Widow continue to battle until Black Widow stabs Punisher in the shins. Punisher explains Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers's overall plan to use the Cosmic Cube is to put everything back to the way it was. Not just the Axis victory in World War II, but bringing back all of the dead as a result of Hydra like Rick Jones, Jack Flag, and Frank Castle's family. Black Widow rejects this idea and sees Miles approaching Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers causing Black Widow to stop Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]].<ref>''Secret Empire'' #7</ref> After the real Captain America defeated his Hydra Supreme counterpart, Punisher expresses regret for his actions in an inner monologue, calling his involvement with Hydra Supreme Rogers as probably the worst mistake of his life.

==Characterization==
The character has been described as being obsessed with vengeance;<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.popthought.com/display_column.asp?DAID=466 | title=Mike Baron Interview | last=Ness | first=Alex | work=Pop Thought | accessdate=November 14, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209021855/http://www.popthought.com/display_column.asp?DAID=466 | archivedate=February 9, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Garth Ennis]] noted that the character of the Punisher "sees the world in very black and white terms, he solves his problems with utter finality" and that "his response to any problem: when in doubt, hit back hard."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10746 | title=The Long, Cold Dark: Garth Ennis Talks ''Punisher'' #50 | last=Richards | first=David | date=July 11, 2007 | work=Comic Book Resources | accessdate=November 14, 2008}}</ref> The writer Steven Grant noted that:

{{quote|[[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], who took [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy further, comes even closer to describing the Punisher: 'Since we can never hope to understand why we're here, if there's even anything to understand, the individual should choose a goal and pursue it wholeheartedly, despite the certainty of death and the meaninglessness of action.' That's sure the Punisher as I conceived him: a man who knows he's going to die and who knows in the big picture his actions will count for nothing, but who pursues his course because this is what he has chosen to do.<ref>{{cite web|author=Grant, Steven|title=Master Of The Obvious: Issue #104| url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=13852|website=Comic Book Resources|date=July 26, 2001}}</ref>}}

Punisher co-creator [[Gerry Conway]] stated that "He's a great [[Rorschach test]]. What's given him some sustainability is, you can put into him whatever you want, as opposed to Spider-Man, who truly is who he is and shouldn't be changed. The Punisher is a thin character on his own merits, but that allows for a lot of interpretations and different angles of approach."<ref name="back44"/>

Punisher's backstory initially introduced him as a [[veteran]] of the [[Vietnam War]]. In this capacity, he appeared in the comic book ''[[The 'Nam]]'', about the conflict.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/the-abandoned-an-forsaked-did-the-punisher-fight-in-the-vietnam-war/|title= The Abandoned An’ Forsaked - Did the Punisher Fight in the Vietnam War?|last= Cronin|first= Brian|date= March 6, 2016|website= CBR|publisher= |access-date= October 3, 2019}}</ref> However, this dated the character as the years passed and the war was increasingly in the past. [[Greg Rucka]] retconned it to the [[War on Terror]] instead in 2011. He explained that "Steve and I went round and round on this, but ultimately, he wanted to make Frank younger because if he fought in Vietnam, he's in his 70s, and I get more mileage out of him being in his early 40s. I don't think that takes anything away from his origin. In the Marvel Universe, the conflict matters only because he was asked to go and serve his country, and he did. When he returned, the society he was essentially defending betrayed him and murdered his wife and children in front of him. The conflict matters less than the fact that he gave his service, and this was the reward. In that broad brush vague Marvel Universe sense there's always 'the war' whatever it was. If that put him in the Middle East rather than South East Asia I think that matters less for the purposes of the Marvel Universe."<ref name="Siacong">{{cite web |url= https://www.cbr.com/marvel-universe-vietnam-war-retcon-sin-cong-conflict-world-war-ii-punisher-fantastic-four/|title= Which Heroes Does Marvel's New Vietnam War Retcon Affect?|last= Cronin|first= Brian|date= August 24, 2019|website= CBR|publisher= |access-date= October 3, 2019}}</ref> He also clarified that the retcon was only for the character in the main Marvel universe and not for the version in the MAX Comics, that retained the first origin.<ref name="Siacong"/> The conflict was retconned again in 2019, in ''History of the Marvel Universe'' #2, to the fictional Siancong War.<ref name="Siacong"/>

==Skills, weapons, and abilities==
The Punisher is the recipient of multi-disciplinary military training from the [[United States Marine Corps]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]]. While a Marine, he also received training from the [[United States Army Airborne School|Airborne School]] and [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]] as well as cross-training with the [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, since beginning his work as the Punisher, Castle has used his military discipline and training techniques to update and expand his skills in areas that aid in his mission (disguise, acting, use of non-military weapons, etc.). From this training, the Punisher is proficient in not only basic infantry skills, but in special operations, which includes the use and maintenance of specialized firearms and explosive ordnance. He is highly trained in infiltration into heavily guarded enemy territories and structures for the purpose of assassination, capture, and military intelligence. Also, he is trained in various forms of camouflage and stealth. He is also highly adept at [[hand-to-hand combat]], and has been trained in multiple forms of [[martial arts]] such as [[Chin Na]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Hwa Rang Do]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Krav Maga]],<ref name=":1">''Deadpool vs The Punisher'' #3 (July 2017)</ref> [[Muay Thai]],<ref name=":1" /> Nash [[Ryū (school)|Ryu]] [[Jujutsu]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Ninjutsu]], [[Shōrin-ryū|Shorin-ryu Karate]]<ref name=":0" /> and [[Systema]].<ref name=":1" /> Both [[Nick Fury]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] have commented on how extraordinarily high his pain tolerance is.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He does not take painkillers, as he feels that their benefit of dulling pain is not worth the side effects of drowsiness and slowed reflexes.

He maintains multiple safehouses and vehicles around the greater [[New York City]] area as well as multiple forged identities and bank accounts (most of the funds and equipment aiding him in his work being taken from the criminals he hunts). The Punisher has a [[Kevlar]] uniform which protects him from most gunfire, though he can still suffer concussive injury or penetration from sufficient or repeated impacts. The white skull emblem on his chest is used both to intimidate his enemies and to lure their fire to the more heavily protected area of his armor. The design was supposedly taken from either a [[Vietcong]] [[sniper]],<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Roger Salick|penciller = Mike Harris|inker = James Palmiotti|colorist = Ed Lazellari|letterer = Jade Moede|editor = Don Daley|story = The Long Sticks: Part Two|title = The 'Nam|volume = 1|issue = #53|date = February 1991|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> or the demon [[Olivier (comics)|Olivier]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Tom Sniegoski and Christopher Golden|penciller = Bernie Wrightson|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Elizabeth Lewis|letterer = Richard Starkings|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Purgatory, Part 4: The Hour of Judgment|title = The Punisher|volume = 4|issue = #4|date = February 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> The Punisher uses a large variety of firearms in his war on crime; including fully automatic rifles, shotguns, flame throwers, or whatever he can get his hands on. Though he has a preference for guns, the Punisher has been using technology derived from super-villains and other costumed characters, such as the [[Green Goblin]]'s pumpkin bombs,<ref>''Deadpool: Suicide Kings'' #5 (October 2009)</ref> a modified [[Goblin Glider]],<ref>''Anti-Venom: New Ways to Live'' #3 (February 2010)</ref> and a [[Doctor Octopus]] tentacle that he can shrink down for easy storage via [[Henry Pym#Powers and abilities|Pym Particles]].

Aside from his physical prowess, the Punisher also has complete control of his mind and consciousness, providing a strong resistance against psychic and telepathic powers that are used against him. When [[Letha (comics)|Letha]] and [[Lascivious (comics)|Lascivious]] try to control Punisher's mind, Punisher scoffs at their attempt, saying "It doesn't feel different from any other day".<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Punisher Vol. 2: Dead End (Punisher Annual #1)|author=Rick Remender|publisher=Marvel Comics|isbn=0785142789}}</ref>

==Reception==
The Punisher was named the 19th Greatest Comic Book Character of All Time by [[movie]] magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', saying that he is the "grimmest and most compelling of characters" and praising the ''[[The Punisher: Frank Castle|Punisher MAX]]'' series.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=19 | title=The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters | work=Empire Online}}</ref> [[IGN]] ranked Punisher at #27 in Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, describing him as "no superhero".

<blockquote>Frank Castle has spent years exacting vengeance for the deaths of his family by punishing criminals everywhere. His skull insignia inspires fear throughout the underworld. But Punisher's appeal rests on more than his ability to do what the rest of Marvel's heroes won't. He's a tragic figure – even a profoundly selfish one in some ways. The sad truth is that Frank Castle can't survive without killing, and his new job fulfills him in ways his family never could.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/27|title=Punisher|work=IGN}}</ref></blockquote>

He is ranked #39 in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]'''s Top 200 Comic Book Characters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[IGN]] later listed the ''Punisher'' series #15 in their 25 Best Comic Runs of the Decade, praising [[Garth Ennis]]'s ten-year timeline of the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/19/25-best-comic-runs-of-the-decade?page=3|title=25 Best Comic Runs of the Decade|work=IGN}}</ref> Writer and director [[Joss Whedon]] has been critical of the character, referring to the Punisher as "a coward" in an issue of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author = Joss Whedon|title = On Heroes Killing:|magazine = Wizard|location = United States|publisher = Wizard Entertainment|date = March 2006|language = English|issue = 173|page = 54|quote = They really shouldn't kill. Now, that doesn't mean that they never will, but heroes should not kill and, in particular, they should not use f—ing guns. I think that the glorification of killing and of shooting guns is not the job of a comic book. They can shoot plenty of cool things without having to put bullets in people. That is lazy and amoral and useless. Batman doesn't kill. It makes his job harder. They're been times where I was like, 'Just kill the Joker. Just kill him. Kill him.' But the fact that he won't is part of what makes him who he is. The Punisher? Coward. He's a coward.}}</ref>

==Supporting characters==
{{Main|List of Punisher supporting characters}}
Despite wanting to work alone, the Punisher has a few supporting characters to help fight crime. [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] assisted Castle by building and supplying weapons and technology and providing friendship. During the "Civil War", he was aided by [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]] for a short time. Various police officers and detectives have assisted the Punisher, most notably [[Lynn Michaels]] and [[Martin Soap|Lt. Martin Soap]]. Lynn Michaels was a police officer who teamed up with Castle to take down a serial rapist and later quit the force to become a vigilante. Martin Soap was secretly allied with the Punisher and gave him information on his targets from the police database.

==In politics and popular culture==
[[Image:Charlottesville Punisher emblem.jpg|thumb|A variation of the Punisher's skull emblem that was used by protesters at the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]].<ref name="Deconstructing"/>]]
The Punisher's skull emblem has become popular within the [[Blue Lives Matter]] movement, with many companies producing [[decal]]s, stickers, and T-shirts featuring the Punisher emblem colored with the [[thin blue line]], or atop an American flag. In 2017, the Catlettsburg Police department in Kentucky faced a public backlash after installing large decals with the Punisher's skull and "Blue Lives Matter" on the hoods of police cars, and removed the decals in response to public pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article134722264.html |title=Chief removes Punisher emblem, ‘Blue Lives Matter’ from police cars after public reacts|work=Lexington Herald-Ledger}}</ref> Citizens and police interpreted its meaning differently; the police chief said, "We're getting so many calls, and they're saying that the Punisher logo (means) we're out to kill people, and that's not the meaning behind that. That didn't cross my mind."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/kentucky-police-remove-pro-police-punisher-logo-cars-article-1.2981586|title=Kentucky police remove Blue Lives Matter ‘Punisher’ logo from cars after people point out he’s a killer|work=New York Daily News}}</ref> Punisher co-creator [[Gerry Conway]] has decried the use of the Punisher symbol by law enforcement, saying, "To me, it's disturbing whenever I see authority figures embracing Punisher iconography because the Punisher represents a failure of the Justice system. ... The vigilante anti-hero is fundamentally a critique of the justice system, an example of social failure, so when cops put the Punisher's skulls on their cars or members of the military wear Punisher's skull patches, they're basically sides with an enemy of the system." Conway compares it to "putting a [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] on a government building."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/punisher-creator-gerry-conway-cops-using-the-skull-logo-are-like-people-using-the|title=Punisher creator Gerry Conway: Cops using the skull logo are like people using the Confederate flag|last=Forsythe|first=Dana|work=[[SyFy Wire]]|date=January 8, 2019|accessdate=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

This controversy was addressed in ''Punisher Vol. 12'' #13 written by Matthew Rosenberg. In the issue, Frank comes across two police officers who are fans of his. They take a selfie with him and show they have a sticker of his logo on their car before comparing their work to his. He tears up the sticker and tells them, "I'll say this once, we're not the same. You took an oath to uphold the law. You help people. I gave that up a long time ago. You don't do what I do. Nobody does. You boys need a role model? His name's Captain America, and he'd be happy to have you.... If I find out you are trying to do what I do, I'll come for you next."<ref>''Punisher Vol. 12'' #3 (2016)</ref>

In addition to being used by the United States military and police, the Punisher's skull emblem is used by anti-government militia groups, such as the [[3 Percenters]], and the symbol was seen at the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]].<ref name="Deconstructing">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer, no byline--> |title=Deconstructing the symbols and slogans spotted in Charlottesville |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/local/charlottesville-videos/ |work=The Washington Post |date=18 August 2017}}</ref>
