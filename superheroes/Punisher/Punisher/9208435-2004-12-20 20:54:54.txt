'''The Punisher''' (Frank Castle) is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[anti-hero]]. Created by [[Gerry Conway]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #129 ([[1974]]).

Although usually considered a [[superhero]], The Punisher is a savage vigilante, who slaughters criminals at will. Tormented by the massacre of his family in a gangland crossfire, Castle wages a one-man war on [[organized crime]], using all manner of conventional and state of the art weaponry. The Punisher is a master of unarmed and armed combat, and marksmanship. Recognized by the white skull icon on his chest, The Punisher is feared by criminals, while most other superheroes oppose his extreme methods. 

The Punisher's brutish nature and willingness to kill made him a novel character in mainstream [[comic  books]] in 1974. By the late [[1980s]], he was part of a wave of psychologically troubled anti-heroes and was featured in several monthly series. His popularity has since cooled but he remains a popular Marvel property and was adapted into two films, in [[1989]] and [[2004]] respectively.

==Origin story==
Frank Castle was a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] who served in the [[Vietnam War]] in a [[special forces]] unit. After his tour of duty was over he came back to the [[United States]] and started a family. His family was killed in a gangland crossfire. Since then, Frank has devoted his life to destroying [[organized crime]], using the ''nom de guerre'' The Punisher with the distinctive costume of a black and white [[body armour]] with a large white skull as a chest symbol, and using whatever resources and means necessary to do so. The Punisher has a [[criminal record]] due to his activities, and [[law enforcement]] is aware of his existence.

==Publication history==
The Punisher was inspired by, and is very similar to, [[Mack Bolan]], "The Executioner", a character created by [[Don Pendleton]] for a series of novels published since [[1969]].

The Punisher first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129 (1974). The story was written by Gerry Conway, who originally conceived the character as a one-issue antagonist for Spider-Man (the story involved the Punisher stalking Spider-Man, whom Castle mistakenly believed to be a murderer). The character was immediately popular, and made appearances in other series - usually clashing with the hero of the piece over his methods.

After a successful [[1985]] [[mini-series]], Marvel launched an unlimited ''The Punisher'' series in [[1987]]. It was very popular and Marvel added a spin-off ''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' in [[1988]] and another ''[[Punisher War Zone]]'' in [[1992]]. 

In [[1995]], Marvel cancelled all three due to low sales. Several unsuccessful revivals were attempted, until a [[2000]]/[[2001]] mini-series by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]] made the character popular once again. A new ongoing series has since been launched.

==Television, movies and video games==

A [[film]] adaptation, ''[[The Punisher (movie)|The Punisher]]'', starring [[Dolph Lundgren]], was released in [[1989]]. A second film adaptation, starring [[Thomas Jane]] as the Punisher and [[John Travolta]] as the main villain, was released in the [[United States]] on [[April 16]], [[2004]]. Neither were exceptionally well-liked by critics or fans of the comic book series.

''The Punisher'' have also been the main character in both an [[arcade game]] [http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?letter=P&game_id=9156] and a computer game for the [[Amiga]] [http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,2/gameId,120/].

A new ''The Punisher'' game is to be released January 18th for [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]], and [[personal computer|PC]].  It is being developed by Volition and published by THQ.  The game, scripted by [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Garth Ennis]], will reportedly be extremely violent.
