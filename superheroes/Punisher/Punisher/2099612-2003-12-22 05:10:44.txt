The '''Punisher''' (real name '''Frank Castle''') is a [[fictional character]] of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]]s. As a lead character, he is unusual in that he has no [[superpowers]] and actually uses [[lethal force]]. He is generally considered an [[anti-hero]].

Frank Castle was a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] who served in the [[Vietnam War]] in a [[special forces]] unit. After his tour of duty was over he came back to the [[United States]] and started a family. His family was killed in a gangland cross-fire and ever since that time Frank Castle has devoted his life to destroying [[organized crime]], and using whatever resources and means necessary to do so. The Punisher has a [[criminal record]] due to his activities and [[law enforcement]] is aware of his existence.

The first appearance of the Punisher was in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #129 (1974). The story was written by [[Gerry Conway]], who originally conceived the character as a one-issue antagonist (the story involved the Punisher stalking [[Spider-Man]], who he mistakenly believed to be a murderer). The character was immediately popular, and made appearances in other series (usually clashing with the hero of the piece over his methods) and eventually gaining a series of his own, ''The Punisher'', in the mid-1980s.

A film adaptation starring [[Dolph Lundgren]] was released in 1989.
Another film adaptation, starring [[Thomas Jane]] as the Punisher and [[John Travolta]] as the main villain, is due for release in April [[as of 2004|2004]].
