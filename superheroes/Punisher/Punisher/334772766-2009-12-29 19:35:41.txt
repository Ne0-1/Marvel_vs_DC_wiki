The '''Punisher''' ('''Frank Castle''') is an [[antihero]] within [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe]], created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artists [[John Romita, Sr.]] and [[Ross Andru]]. The character made its first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #129 (February 1974).

The Punisher is a [[vigilante]] who considers [[killing]], [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[coercion]], [[Assault (tort)|threats of violence]], and [[torture]] to be acceptable crime-fighting tactics. Driven by the deaths of his family, who were killed by the [[Mafia|mob]] when they witnessed a gangland execution in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Central Park]], the Punisher wages a one-man war on the mob and all criminals in general by using all manner of weaponry.<ref>origin first recounted in ''Marvel Preview'' #2</ref> His family's killers were the first to be slain.<ref>recounted in ''Marvel Super Action'' #1</ref> A war [[veteran]], Castle is a master of [[martial arts]], stealth tactics, [[guerrilla warfare]] and a wide variety of weapons.

The Punisher's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him a novel character in mainstream [[American comic book]]s in 1974. By the late 1980s, he was part of a wave of psychologically troubled antiheroes and was featured in several monthly publications, including ''The Punisher War Journal'', ''The Punisher War Zone'', and ''The Punisher Armory''. Despite his violent actions and dark nature, The Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success (although toned down) on [[television]] making guest appearances on ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. In [[feature film]]s, [[Dolph Lundgren]] portrayed the Punisher in [[The Punisher (1989 film)|1989]], [[Thomas Jane]] in [[The Punisher (2004 film)|2004]], and [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] in [[Punisher: War Zone|2008]].

[[Image:Firstappearance.png|thumb|left|The first appearance of The Punisher in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129.]]

===First appearance===
The Punisher was conceived of by Gerry Conway, writer of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', who helped design the character's distinctive costume:

{{cquote|In the '70s, when I was writing comics at DC and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters — heroes and villains — which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind. I had done that with the Punisher at Marvel.<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/14conway.html  ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3 #14 (April 2002): "All The Stars There Are in (Super-hero) Heaven!" (Gerry Conway interviewed by Roy Thomas)]</ref>}}

Conway had drawn a character with a small [[Totenkopf|death's head]] skull on one breast. Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita, Sr.]] took the basic design, blew the skull up to huge size, taking up most of the character's chest, and added a cartridge bandolier that formed the skull's teeth. ''Amazing Spider-Man'' [[penciller]] Ross Andru was the first artist to draw the character for publication.

Appearing for the first time in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129 (February 1974), the Punisher was initially an [[antagonist]] of [[Spider-Man|the titular hero]]. He was a bloodthirsty vigilante who had no qualms about killing gangsters, something that most superheroes of the time refrained from doing. [[J. Jonah Jameson]] described him as "the most newsworthy thing to happen to [[New York]] since [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]]". In this appearance the Punisher was determined to kill Spider-Man, who was wanted for the apparent murder of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129</ref> This version of the Punisher was shown as an athletic fighter, a master marksman and an able strategist. All he would reveal about himself was that he was a former [[U.S. Marine]]. He had a fierce temper but also showed signs of considerable frustration over his self-appointed role of killer vigilante. In particular he was engaged in extensive soul-searching as to what was the right thing to do: although he had few qualms about killing he was outraged when his then-associate, the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], apparently killed Spider-Man by treacherous means rather than in honorable combat. Spider-Man, who was himself no stranger to such torment, concluded that the Punisher's problems made his own seem like a "birthday party".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129, February 1974</ref>

The character was a hit with readers and started to appear on a regular basis, teaming up with both Spider-Man and other heroes such as [[Captain America]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #135</ref><ref>''Giant-Size Spider-Man'' #4</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #161-162</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #174-175</ref><ref>''Captain America'' #241</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #201-202</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #15</ref> During his acclaimed run on ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]],'' writer and artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] made use of the character, contrasting his attitudes and version of vigilante action to that of the more liberal Man Without Fear.<ref>''Daredevil'' #181</ref><ref>''Daredevil'' #182</ref><ref>''Daredevil'' #183-184</ref>

===Initial series===
In the early 1980s, artist [[Mike Zeck]] and writer [[Steven Grant]] proposed creating a Punisher series. Marvel published a [[miniseries]] whose premiere (January 1986) was bannered on the cover as the first of four - however the series had always been intended to be five issues long, and the banner was an error that recurred throughout the entire run.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Cronin| first = Brian| title = Comic Book Legends Revealed #196  | year = 2008 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/02/26/comic-book-legends-revealed-196/}}</ref> An important element of the story was a [[retcon]] that explains that many of the Punisher's more extreme actions to this point were the result of being poisoned with mind-altering drugs.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 1 #1-5</ref> 

[[Image:PunisherWarZone1.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''The Punisher War Zone'' #1 (March 1992). Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]]
An ongoing series, also titled ''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'', premiered the next year. Initially by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Klaus Janson]], it eventually ran 104 issues (July 1987 - July 1995) and spun off two additional ongoing series — ''[[The Punisher War Journal]] (vol.1)'' (80 issues, November 1988 - July 1995) and ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' (41 issues, March 1992 - July 1995), as well as the black-and-white comics magazine, ''The Punisher Magazine'' (16 issues, November 1989 - September 1990), and ''The Punisher Armory'' (10 issues, no cover dates, starting 1990), a fictional diary detailing ''"His thoughts! His feelings! His weapons!"'' (as stated on the cover of #1). The Punisher also appeared in numerous [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and miniseries, and made frequent guest appearances in other Marvel comics, ranging from superhero series to the [[Vietnam War]]-era comic ''[[The 'Nam]]''. 

During this era, the Punisher was assisted by his then-partner, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]]. Serving as a [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] type figure, he would supply the Punisher with high-tech vehicles and equipment such as armored combat "battle vans" specially built and customized.  

Over the next decade the Punisher would be shown fighting virtually every known criminal organization including the Italian [[Mafia]], the [[Russian Mafia]], the Japanese [[Yakuza]], the Colombian and Mexican [[Illegal drug trade|drug cartels]], the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], the Chinese [[Triad (underground societies)|Triads]], Jamaican [[Yardie]]s, the [[Irish Mob]], [[biker gang]]s, [[Gang|street gangs]], [[gunrunning]] [[militia]]s, [[Robbery|muggers]], [[Murder|killer]]s, [[rapist]]s, [[Psychopathy|psychopaths]], violent [[racism|racists]], [[Sadomasochism|sadists]], [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]], and [[Political corruption|corrupt]] city officials. He also assaults criminal business enterprises such as drugs, weapons smuggling, [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]]. 

Due to the Punisher's homicidal nature, few of his foes became recurring antagonists, the most notable of these being the severely scarred enforcer [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]. The Punisher also acquired a nemesis in the form of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]],<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 2 #15-19</ref> a longtime Spider-Man and Daredevil foe, and developed enmity with Daredevil himself, who likewise abhorred and fought against the Punisher's brutal methods. Villains such as the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]], [[Doctor Doom]],<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 2 #28-29</ref> [[Reavers (comics)|The Reavers]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] would be used to provide more of a challenge for the character. In addition, heroes such as  Spider-Man, Captain America, Daredevil, [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]],<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #5-6</ref> the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #6-7</ref> [[Nick Fury]], and [[Moon Knight]]<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #9</ref> would appear. Often the stories would use the appearance of those heroes to provide commentary on the difference between the Punisher and those more colourful characters. During Don Daley's run on ''The Punisher'' title, his version of justice was described by the editor as "an [[eye for an eye]]".<ref>''[[The Punisher (1987 series)|The Punisher]]'' #98 (January 1995): letters page</ref>

===Decline===
In 1995, Marvel canceled all three ongoing Punisher series due to poor sales. The publisher attempted a re-launch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series ''The Punisher'', under the new [[Marvel Edge]] [[imprint]], by writer [[John Ostrander]], in which the Punisher willingly joined and became the boss of an organized crime family, and later confronted the [[X-Men]] and [[Nick Fury]]. The series ran for 18 issues, from November 1995 to April 1997. Writer [[Christopher Golden]]'s four-issue miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Purgatory]]'' (November 1998 - February 1999) posited a deceased Punisher resurrected as a [[supernatural]] agent of various [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s.

===Revivals===
A 12-issue miniseries by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]], again titled '' [[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' (April 2000 - March 2001), under the ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' imprint, revived the character's popularity. An ongoing series (37 issues, August 2001 - February 2004), primarily by Ennis and Dillon, followed, succeeded in 2004 by an ongoing Ennis series under Marvel's mature-readers imprint, ''[[MAX (comics)|MAX]]''. Returning the character to his lone vigilante roots, those series combined crime focused stories with black humor. The look of the Punisher was modified further removing the white gloves and pairing his traditional skull imprinted shirt with combat trousers, black combat boots and a black trench coat. Castle has used this costume on occasion in mid-2000s stories before ''The Punisher War Journal'' (vol.2).

===Max imprint===
{{Main|The Punisher: Frank Castle}}
[[Image:PunMax44.jpg|thumb|Promotional art for ''The Punisher'' vol. 7, #44 (March 2007), by [[Tim Bradstreet]]. Castle's birth date (February 16, 1950) was redacted on the published cover.]] 

Continuing his run on the character, [[Garth Ennis]] used the freedom of the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]] (MAX being an alternate continuity) to write more realistic and hard-edged stories than had previously been seen.<ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/690.asp ComicBookMovie.com</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=120373 Max'Ing Out The Future: Axel Alonso Talks Marvel Max - Newsarama<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.comixtreme.com/forums/showthread.php?t=33068 PUNISHER WAR JOURNAL #4 REVIEW - comiXtreme<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ''The Punisher'' also made it explicit that Castle's timeline was fixed while Marvel adjusted those of its other characters, with his history never altered or moved up in time. Promotional art for the cover of vol. 7, #44 (March 2007) gave his birth date as February 16, 1950, but that was removed for the published issues.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = thepunisher.com | coauthors = | title = thepunisher.com (January 2007) | work = | publisher =Adam Johnson | date= January 16, 2007 | url =http://www.thepunisher.com/past_news/january_2007/january_2007.html | doi = | accessdate =2007-04-11}}</ref> After the departure of Ennis as writer, the series was renamed ''Punisher: Frank Castle'' with issue #66.

The imprint depicts the Punisher being active for almost 30 years, with vol. 7, #19 (June 2005) specifying he had killed approximately 2,000 people. Whereas the traditional Punisher stories remained within the United States and involved antagonists and settings of conventional domestic crime, stories of the MAX Punisher often focus on current events, ranging from [[Accounting scandals|corporate fraud]] to [[sexual slavery]] and [[The War on Terror]]. Many characters are past or current intelligence and military operatives from governmental agencies like the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[KGB]], [[Secret Intelligence Service]], [[Special Air Service|SAS]], militaries and militias from the [[Balkans]] and [[Middle East]], also including the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]], all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the [[Cold War]] or the [[Yugoslav wars]].

The miniseries ''[[The Punisher: Born|Born]]'' by Garth Ennis and [[Darick Robertson]] further examines Castle's roots, tracing them back to his third tour of the Vietnam War, where he undergoes a psychological and possibly supernatural transformation into the Punisher to survive a massive assault on his fortification by the combined forces of the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]]. The one-shot ''Punisher: The Tyger'', by Ennis and [[John Severin]], went even further and showed that Castle had lived with murders, deaths and criminals from his childhood.

=== Punisher War Journal (vol. 2) ===
In November 2006, a new ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' series, written by [[Matt Fraction]] and penciled by [[Ariel Olivetti]] was released. The first three issues of the book are set during the Marvel ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event. It involves Castle taking on supervillains rather than his traditional non-super-powered criminal antagonists. He has also made appearances in the main ''Civil War'' series (issues 5, 6, and 7). Wearing both his traditional costume and his Marvel Knights/MAX attire, the series pitted the character against a series of super-powered foes while also being involved in crossover events such as ''[[World War Hulk]]'' and ''[[Secret Invasion]]''.

===The Punisher and Punisher: Frank Castle===
Marvel relaunched ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' in 2009 as ''[[Punisher (2009 series)|Punisher]],'' with a thematic link tied to the events of the [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] storyline and, following the departure of writer [[Garth Ennis]], retitled the Marvel Max series (formerly Punisher Max) as ''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX''; and more recently as "Punisher: Frank Castle" <ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13057 ''Punisher Frank Castle'' #75, Marvel.com catalogue]</ref> or Frank Castle: The Punisher <ref>[''Punisher: Frank Castle MAX'' #74 (September 2009), page 44</ref> (depending on the source), launching a new series, ''PunisherMax'' by [[Jason Aaron]] and [[Steve Dillon]].<ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13374 ''PunisherMax'' #1, Marvel.com catalogue]</ref> As part of his work on the character, [[Rick Remender]] wrote the one-shot title ''Dark Reign: The List - Punisher'' which as part of the Dark Reign storyline shows the character dismembered and decapitated by [[Daken]].<ref>''Dark Reign - The List - The Punisher'' #1</ref>

===Death and Return===
After his death at the hands of Daken, Castle is resurrected by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] and the League of Monsters as a patchwork Frankenstein like creature to help them against an unknown enemy.<ref>''Punisher'' #11</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091118-Punisher-Remender.html Putting the PUNISHER Back Together With Rick Remender], [[Newsarama]], November 18, 2009</ref>

==Characterization==
The character has been described as being obsessed with vengeance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popthought.com/display_column.asp?DAID=466|title=Mike Baron Interview|last=Ness|first=Alex|publisher=Pop Thought |accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> [[Garth Ennis]] noted that the character of the Punisher 'sees the world in very black and white terms, he solves his problems with utter finality' and that 'His response to any problem: when in doubt, hit back hard.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10746|title= CBR News THE LONG, COLD DARK: Garth Ennis Talks "Punisher" #50|last=Richards|first=David|date=2007-07-11|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> The writer Steven Grant notes that  {{cquote|[[Heidegger]], who took [[Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy further, comes even closer to describing The Punisher: since we can never hope to understand why we're here, if there's even anything to understand, the individual should choose a goal and pursue it wholeheartedly, despite the certainty of death and the meaninglessness of action. That's sure the Punisher as I conceived him: a man who knows he's going to die and who knows in the big picture his actions will count for nothing, but who pursues his course because this is what he has chosen to do.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepunishercomics.com/artists/steven_grant/steven_grant.htm|title=Interview with Steven Grant|publisher=http://www.thepunishercomics.com|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref>}}

==Abilities==

Punisher is the recipient of multi-disciplinary military training from the U.S. Marine Corps. While a Marine, he also received training from the U.S. Army and Navy. From this training, Punisher is proficient in not only basic infantry skills, but in special operations, which includes the use and maintenance of specialized firearms and explosive ordnance. He is highly trained in infiltration into heavily-guarded enemy territories and structures for the purpose of assassination, capture, and military intelligence. Also, he is trained in various forms of camouflage and stealth. From his airborne training, Punisher is able to pack and maintain his own parachute rigs, as well as professionally control his landings, in daylight and at night. From his Navy UDT training, Punisher is well-skilled in extended underwater operations, including demolitions. He is skilled with a great many types of explosives, ranging from simple dynamite to plastique to improvised explosives. His [[hand to hand combat]] skills are more than sufficient to allow him to incapacitate and kill men much stronger than he is, as well as to deal with groups of armed and unarmed enemies, killing them all without weapons if he deems it necessary. He is also extremely deadly in knife training, preferring the knife he learned to fight with in the USMC: the [[KA-BAR]]. Additionally, he is a preternaturally-precise marksman. He is thoroughly trained and experienced in unconventional ("guerilla") warfare. He is an armorer, a gunsmith, and an expert in field medicine.

The Punisher's ever-changing arsenal of weaponry includes various automatic and semi-automatic rifles, and an array of handguns, fragmentation and tear gas grenades, other explosives, and combat knives. A personal favorite is his ballistic knife, which can launch its blade with lethal force. He commonly uses U.S. military weapons such as [[M16 assault rifle]]s, [[M203 grenade launcher]]s, [[M1911 pistol]]s, [[M249 light machine gun]]s, and Gerber Mark II combat knives.

The Punisher has a Kevlar uniform which protects him from most gunfire, though he can still suffer concussive injury or penetration from sufficient or repeated impacts. 

The Punisher has been using technology derived from super-villains and other costumed characters, such as:
*The [[Green Goblin]]'s pumpkin bombs <ref>''Deadpool - Suicide Kings'' #5</ref> and a modified [[Goblin Glider]]
*<ref>''Anti-Venom: New Ways to Live'' #3</ref> a [[Doctor Octopus]] tentacle that he can shrink down for easy storage via [[Pym Particles]]
*<ref>''Deadpool - Suicide Kings'' #2</ref> and a copy of [[Captain America's shield]].<ref>''Anti-Venom: New Ways to Live'' #2</ref>
*[[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl's Talons]]
*[[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost's]] Gauntlets

Since his resurrection the Punisher has now developed some level of superhuman abilities as described by writer Rick Remender, "When Frank Castle shows up from here on out, he's on an even playing field with the other A-list characters in the Marvel Universe."<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/105/1051215p2.html The Man Who Killed Punisher]</ref>

==Reception==
The Punisher was named 19th greatest comic book character of all time by [[movie]] magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' saying that he is the "grimmest and most compelling of characters" and praising the [[The Punisher: Frank Castle|Punisher MAX series]].<ref>http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=19</ref>

==Supporting characters==
Despite wanting to work alone, the Punisher has a few supporting characters to help fight crime. [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]]  assisted Castle by building and supplying weapons and technology and providing friendship. During the Civil War he was aided by [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]] for a short time. Various police officers and detectives have assisted the Punisher, most notably [[Lynn Michaels]] and [[Martin Soap|Lt. Martin Soap]]. Lynn Michaels was a [[police officer]] who teamed up with Castle to take down a [[rape|serial rapist]] and later quits the force to became a [[vigilante]]. Martin Soap was secretly allied with the Punisher and gave him information on his targets from the police database. 
===Enemies===
Because of his brutal nature, the Punisher's enemies are usually killed in the stories they are in. The Punisher faces a variety of villains that include the common criminal, [[Crime boss|mob bosses]], corrupt leaders and [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] [[murder]]ers. One of the Punisher's recurring [[supervillain|villains]] is the hideously disfigured criminal known as [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]. Other villains include [[Ma Gnucci]], a crime boss and [[Russian (comics)|The Russian]], a powerful assassin. Supervillains include [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]].
