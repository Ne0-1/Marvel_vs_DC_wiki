'''Calypso''' is a character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  Her main enemy is [[Spider-Man]].  Her real name is unknown.  The character was created by [[Denny O'Neil]] and [[Alan Weiss]].

She is a voodoo priestess, possibly of Haitian descent, who first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #209. Calypso was a psychopathic woman who was associated with Sergei Kravinoff, aka Kraven the Hunter.

Calypso seemed to enjoy driving Kraven into fits of rage and furthering his hatred of Spider-Man.

When Todd McFarlane started writing the new ''Spider-Man'' comic in 1990, he wrote the ''Torment'' storyline that ran through ''Spider-Man'' #1-5. In the storyline, McFarlane made Calypso into a real dangerous threat for Spider-Man. In the storyline, Calypso sacrificed her sister to gain supernatural powers. The storyline also killed her off, but being a voodoo priestess, it was easy for writers to restore her life.

In ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #251-253, Calypso, commanding a squad of savages, attacked Spider-Man and Aloysha Kravinoff, the son of the original Kraven the Hunter. Desiring revenge for losing Sergei, she used her powers to drive Spidey and Aloysha into fighting each other. It ends with Spidey and Aloysha fighting off her spell, and sharing a handshake. Aloysha kept Calypso at his mansion so she could tell him about his father, whom he never knew. However, instead, Aloysha kills Calypso.

Calypso returned to life later, and went to retreive [[The Lizard]] from [[The Vault]] so she could control him again as she did in Torment. While she did manage to rescue him, an enraged Lizard slashed her throat open and escaped.

==Powers and abilities==
Calypso was well-versed in the religion and practice of voodoo. She often used voodoo drums, potions, and charms.

==Appearances in other media==
Calypso appears as a bonus boss at the end of the [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)]]. She also appeared in the 1990s [[Spider-Man animated series]], although unlike the comic, Calypso was a sane scientist named Dr. Mariah Crawford, but Kraven referred to her lovingly as Calypso. In the cartoon, she was a friend of Spider-Man.
