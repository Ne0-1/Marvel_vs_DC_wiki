==Fictional character biography==
Calypso is a nameless [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] priestess of [[Haiti]]an nationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/calypso.html|title=Spiderfan.org}}</ref> She was a [[psychopath]]ic woman who was associated with [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Calypso seemed to enjoy driving Kraven into fits of rage and furthering his hatred of [[Spider-Man]] which ultimately led to Kraven's [[suicide]] in the "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" storyline.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Denny O'Neil|penciller = Alan Weiss|inker = Janson, McLeod, Rubinstein, Wiacek and Milgrom|colorist = Bob Sharen|letterer = Mark Rogan|editor = Allen Milgrom|story = To Salvage My Honor!|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #209|date = October 1980|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Bill Mantlo|penciller = Bob Hall|inker = Jim Mooney|colorist = Sharen|letterer = Novak|editor = Tom DeFalco|story = The Heart is a Lonely Hunter|title = Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #65|date = April 1982|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

When artist [[Todd McFarlane]] started writing the new ''Spider-Man'' comic in 1990, his opening five-issue story arc "[[Torment (comics)|Torment]]" featured Calypso as the main antagonist, whom McFarlane transformed into a dangerous threat for Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=115}}</ref> The explanation for Calypso's supernatural powers was the sacrifice of her younger sister. She used her abilities to hold [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] in her grasp and the two nearly succeeded in murdering Spider-Man. However, the webslinger managed to beat them both and Calypso is apparently killed.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Todd McFarlane|penciller = Todd McFarlane|inker = Todd McFarlane|colorist = Bob Sharen, Todd McFarlane and Gregory Wright|letterer = Rick Parker|editor = Jim Salicrup|story = Torment|title = Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #1-5|date = August 1990 - December 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

Calypso resurfaces abducting Haitian refugees, turning some into zombie slaves and selling the rest back to her homeland's government. Her actions bring her into conflict with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and his ''[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]'' doppelganger, Hellspawn.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Alan Herdling|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Bud Larosa|colorist = Max Scheele|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Devil Ge Rouge|title = Daredevil|volume = 1|issue = #310|date = November 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref> Calypso briefly enthralls Daredevil, but he is able to break free of her control, and she seemingly dies yet again when the spirits of those she turned into zombies overwhelm her.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Alan Herdling|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Bud La Rosa|colorist = Max Scheele|letterer = Bill Oakley|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Soul Search|title = Daredevil|volume = 1|issue = #311|date = December 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref> Cheating death once more, Calypso flees to New Orleans, where her obsession with [[necromancy]] leads her to the resting place of [[Zombie (comics)|Simon Garth]], a self-aware zombie. Reviving Garth, Calypso tests his abilities and pits him against Hellspawn, though he eventually breaks free of her control and wanders off, leaving one of his Amulets of Damballah with Calypso.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Herdling|penciller = Scott McDaniel|inker = Bud LaRosa|colorist = Max Scheele|letterer = Steve Dutro|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Resurrections|title = Daredevil Annual|volume = 1|issue = #9|date = July 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

Calypso subsequently breaks into the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] and attempts to make the incarcerated Lizard her servant again, but he resists and mauls her.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Terry Kavanagh|penciller = Alex Saviuk|inker = Stephen Baskerville|colorist = Bob Sharen|letterer = Steve Dutro|editor = Eric Fein|story = The Savaging Prelude - Death Becomes Her!|title = Web of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #109|date = February 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Terry Kavanagh|penciller = Alex Saviuk|inker = Stephen Baskerville|colorist = Bob Sharen|letterer = Steve Dutro|editor = Eric Fein|story = The Savaging Part 1 - Final Sanction|title = Web of Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #110|date = March 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref> The Amulet of Damballah, which Calypso transferred her soul into while dying, ends up in the possession of [[Glory Grant]], who Calypso possesses. Despite interference from Spider-Man, Garth, and [[Shotgun (comics)|Shotgun]], Calypso is successfully able to exhume her own corpse and revive herself with the Amulet of Damballah.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Glenn Herdling|penciller = Shawn McMannus|inker = Shawn McMannus|colorist = John Kalisz|letterer = RS/Comicraft/KS|editor = Ralph Macchio|story = Dead Men Walking|title = Spider-Man '97|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = March 1997|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

Commanding a squad of savages, she later attacks Spider-Man and [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of the original Kraven the Hunter. Desiring revenge for losing Sergei, she uses her powers to drive Spider-Man and Alyosha into fighting each other. Spider-Man and Alyosha fight off her spell, and shared a handshake. Alyosha says that he will hold Calypso at his mansion, so the villainess can tell him about his long-lost father. However, Alyosha kills Calypso instead.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = J.M.

==Powers and abilities==
Calypso was well-versed in the religion and practice of voodoo. She often used voodoo drums, potions, and charms. Calypso used mind control, resurrection, and poisons.

==Other versions==
An issue of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' which asked the question "What If Spider-Man Killed the Lizard?" had Calypso in it. When Spider-Man is forced to kill the Lizard in an alternate version of the "[[Torment (comics)|Torment]]" story-arc, Calypso approaches the Lizard's distraught son [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy Connors]] and offers him the chance to get revenge on Spider-Man via a potion that will make him "just like daddy".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Simon Furman|penciller = Dane McCart|inker = Dane McCart|colorist = Mark Bernardo|letterer = Janice Chiang|editor = Rob Tokar|story = What If Spider-Man Killed the Lizard?|title = What If?|volume = 2|issue = #53|date = 10 September 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
*In the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Calypso was initially introduced as a research scientist named '''Dr. Mariah Crawford''' (voiced by Susan Beaubian) who was engaged to Sergei Kravinoff before his mystic serum transformed him into Kraven the Hunter, who affectionately calls her "Calypso". She assisted Spider-Man in several episodes, most notably helping him develop a cure for the [[The Six Arms Saga#Television|Man-Spider mutation]]. During a confrontation with Man-Spider, Dr. Crawford was shown to be familiar with the [[Punisher]]'s backstory and persuaded him to help Kraven subdue the Man-Spider, allowing her to restore him back to normal. In the episode "The Return of Kraven", Mariah contacted an African plague and, in an effort to save her, Kraven injected her with the same serum that she used on him some time ago. However, upon their return to New York, this caused Mariah to mutate into a feral monster, with claws, green eyes, and lion-like ears, prompting Kraven to use the serum on himself to track her down. While Spider-Man initially mistakes Kraven for the one attacking people in [[Central Park]], he learns the truth after subduing him, and Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] ultimately help Kraven capture Calypso and administer a cure made by [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], which restores Mariah back to normal. Afterwards, Mariah and Kraven leave New York to be alone.
*Calypso appears in the [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''Spectacular Spider-Man'']] episode "Destructive Testing", voiced by [[Angela Bryant]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/21/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Monday, January 21, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She is Kraven's lover, and may or may not be a voodoo priestess. After receiving pictures of Spider-Man from a mysterious American friend, Calypso presents them to Kraven and encourages him to go to New York and hunt him. After Kraven's first defeat at Spider-Man's hands, she suddenly appears in a robe and offers to help him, but he refuses. After Kraven's second defeat, Calypso rescues him before he can be arrested, and they are contacted by Calypso's friend, revealed to be the [[Doctor Octopus|Master Planner]], who asks Kraven if he would like to "hunt in a [[Sinister Six|pack]]".

===Video games===
*Calypso appears as a secret boss in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game, voiced by [[Angela V. Shelton]].
*Calypso appears in the [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'', voiced again by Shelton. She assists Kraven the Hunter by providing him with various potions and mutating the Lizard into an even larger, more monstrous form.
*A [[Marvel Noir]] version of Calypso appears as an exclusive boss in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. Calypso uses her fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos to raise an army of zombies. She also hopes to use it to revive Kraven in a ritual. Calypso is eventually defeated by [[Spider-Man Noir]].
