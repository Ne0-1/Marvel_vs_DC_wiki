'''Calypso''' is a fictional villain in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, who first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #209. She was created by [[Denny O'Neil]] and [[Alan Weiss]].

==Fictional character biography==
Calypso was a nameless [[voodoo]] priestess. She was a [[psychopath|psychopathic]] woman who was associated with Sergei Kravinoff, aka [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Calypso seemed to enjoy driving Kraven into fits of rage and furthering his hatred of [[Spider-Man]], which ultimately led to Kraven's [[suicide]].

When artist [[Todd McFarlane]] started writing the new ''Spider-Man'' comic in 1990, he began with the ''[[Torment (comics)|Torment]]'' storyline that ran through the first five issues. McFarlane transformed Calypso into a dangerous threat for Spider-Man. The explanation for Calypso's supernatural powers was the sacrifice of her younger sister. She used her abilities to hold Curt Connors, [[Lizard (comics)|The Lizard]], in her grasp, and the two nearly succeeded in murdering Spider-Man. However, the webslinger managed to best them both, and Calypso was apparently killed.

Calypso soon returned, and retrieved the Lizard from [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]] so she could control him again. However, the enraged Lizard slashed her throat open and escaped.

Her voodoo preventing her from truly dying, Calypso returned again in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #250-253. Commanding a squad of savages, she attacked Spider-Man and [[Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of the original Kraven the Hunter. Desiring revenge for losing Sergei, she used her powers to drive Spidey and Aloysha into fighting each other. Spidey and Aloysha fought off her spell, and shared a handshake. Aloysha said that he would hold Calypso at his mansion, so the villainess could tell him about his long-lost father. However, Aloysha slew Calypso instead.

Calypso would use her voodoo to survive yet again, her spirit hopping into a series of host bodies.  She has come into conflict with Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], most notably in a  series of campaigns involving her enthralled servant Simon Garth, [[Zombie (Marvel Comics)|Zombie]].

==Powers and abilities==
Calypso was well-versed in the religion and practice of voodoo. She often used voodoo drums, potions, and charms. Calypso used mind control, resurrection, and poisons.

==In other media==
Calypso appears as a bonus boss at the end of the [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]''. She also appears as a villain that assists [[Kraven the Hunter]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'', providing him with various potions and mutating the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] into an even larger, more monstrous form. She was voiced by [[Angela V. Shelton]]. 

In the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' Calypso was initially introduced as a research scientist named Dr. Mariah Crawford, who was engaged to Sergei Kravinoff before his mystic serum transformed him into Kraven the Hunter who affectionately calls her "Calypso". She assisted Spider-Man in several episodes, before taking the serum herself and transforming into a feral woman who greatly resembled the comic version of Calypso.
