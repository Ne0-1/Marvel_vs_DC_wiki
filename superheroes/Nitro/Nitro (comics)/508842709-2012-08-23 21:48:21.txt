'''Nitro''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]''  #34 (September 1974) and was created by [[Jim Starlin]].

Nitro is best known for being part of the tragedy that started off Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]]. He is also known by comic fans for playing a part in the death of the [[Kree]] superhero [[Mar-Vell]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Robert Hunter''' was born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].  He was an electrical engineer. Due to genetic alteration carried out on him by the [[Kree]] [[Lunatic Legion]], Robert gained the ability to explode and reform himself at will and became a professional criminal. Some time later, he exposed [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]] to a carcinogenic [[nerve gas]];<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #34</ref> this encounter ultimately caused Marvel's fatal cancer.  Since then he has clashed with Earth's superhumans, who have found creative ways to defeat him, including using the "fractioning (separation) of his exploded mass" against him (essentially, if he can't reform himself after an explosion, he can't explode again).

Nitro later battled and was defeated by [[Omega the Unknown]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #8</ref> He later escaped from [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]], and then battled and was defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #55</ref> He was later freed from his containment canister by the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] in Albany, New York. He battled [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] of the [[New Mutants]], and was unable to re-form his body within Skids' force field.<ref>''New Mutants'' #86</ref>

One such appearance where a foe took advantage of his limitations was in ''[[Iron Man]]'' vol. 3 #15, where he was hired to kill Tony Stark. A fight occurred between Nitro and Iron Man. Iron Man, whose sensors and telecommunications gear had been recently upgraded, noticed that every time he exploded, a high-frequency pulse was emitted by his body. Experimenting, Iron Man duplicated the pulse, causing Nitro to explode. After he exploded several times in a minute, he passed out from exhaustion (presumably, it takes energy to explode, and he could only spare so much before he passed out). Iron Man handed him over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], along with a recommendation on constructing a null-harness. He was sent to prison.

On another occasion, when Nitro's lawyer had him released from captivity, the villain immediately escaped, attempting to rob a bank for money to travel to [[San Francisco]] to kill Captain Marvel. He was opposed by [[Spider-Man]], who defeated Nitro by webbing a barrel of [[tear gas]] to his body right before he exploded. As Nitro reformed, the suddenly evaporated tear gas mixed with his own molecules, leaving him violently ill and unable to fight back. Again, Nitro was arrested and sent to jail.

Later, Nitro is hired as a [[hit-man]] to kill Matt Murdock. He almost succeeds, killing several innocent people. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the police work together to capture him.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #26</ref>

===Civil War and beyond===
The [[New Warriors]] performed a videotaped raid of a house containing the [[Cobalt Man]], [[Speedfreek]], [[Coldheart]] and Nitro, who had recently escaped from prison during the [[Ryker's Island]] Incident. The New Warriors attacked each member, with [[Namorita]] (the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'s cousin) going after Nitro. Slamming him into a school bus, Namorita taunted Nitro until he caused a massive explosion. This explosion killed Namorita, [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]], [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]], and the supervillains he was with during the raid, along with sixty children at the nearby elementary school and some 600 people in the surrounding neighborhood in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], where the fight took place.<ref>''Civil War'' #1</ref>

Nitro escaped in the back of a pickup truck, and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] soon began hunting him.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #42</ref> Eventually Wolverine and a group of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents caught up with Nitro. The agents perished in the battle.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #43</ref> Atlantean agents show up and capture Nitro for Namor and Wolverine follows them to New Pangea in an [[Iron Man|Iron Man armor]] to find Nitro has killed his interrogators in an attempt to escape.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #44</ref> Wolverine captures Nitro and slices off his arm, leaving Nitro a prisoner of Atlantis.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #45</ref>

Namor used Nitro in the destruction of New Pangea after moving his civilization to [[Latveria]], a nation ruled by [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' #6</ref> Nitro was held prisoner in Latveria<ref>''[[Robbie Baldwin|Penance - Relentless]]'' #2</ref> until [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] brought him back to America after forcing him to suffer for the Stamford explosion; leaving him in critical condition and close to death.<ref>''Penance: Relentless'' #5</ref>

Nitro later popped up as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of genetic re-engineering by the Kree, Nitro can transform his body into a gaseous state and explode with a maximum force equivalent to {{convert|350|lbs|abbr=on}} of TNT - which can however be multiplied under influence of MGH - and reconstitute himself. He can also explode discrete portions of his body; for instance, he can channel his explosive power to his hands in the act of punching, thereby delivering a great impact force equal to {{convert|10|lbs|abbr=on}} of TNT. He can use his superhuman power to explode in a particular direction, reassembling himself when his particles lose forward momentum, and repeating the process as necessary. While in his gaseous state, he cannot reform if any fraction of his body is separated from the rest, and he must completely reform his body from a gaseous state before he can detonate a second time. He does not possess any enhanced self-healing capabilities outside of reassembling after an explosion, as shown when Wolverine cut off his hand.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

==Other versions==
===House of M: Masters of Evil===
Nitro appears as a member of Hood's [[Masters of Evil]] in the [[House of M]] reality.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1</ref> He is killed in battle by [[Soviet Super-Soldiers|the Red Guard]].<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #4</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Nitro appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Time Bomb", voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]]. In this series, he is depicted as a mutant who willingly accepts confinement in a government mutant prison due to his lack of control over his incredibly destructive abilities. When they try to lock him in a cell, he resists, saying he cannot be around other people. He then flees the building until he is far enough away to avoid harming anyone with the massive energy blast that follows. However, this entire spectacle is observed by the mutant [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], who informs [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] about Nitro's destructive abilities. He is then forcibly removed by the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], who want to use his destructive powers to their benefit. They first use him to destroy the Mutant Response Division's archives, then prepare to bring him to [[Genosha]] as an offering to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. They use [[Psylocke]] (who can barely telepathically block his powers) to keep him in control. He establishes an understanding with the sympathetic [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] due to her own uncontrolled powers and her disagreement with the Brotherhood's ways of handling him. His powers almost cause him to destroy both the Brotherhood and the X-Men, though [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] is able to suspend him in the air while he detonates. The Brotherhood realizes that he is too dangerous to have around and Nitro willingly returns to confinement.<ref>''Wolverine e os X-Men (Wolverine and the X-Men)'' Ep. 8</ref>
