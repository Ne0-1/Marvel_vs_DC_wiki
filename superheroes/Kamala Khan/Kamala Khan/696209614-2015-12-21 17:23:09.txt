'''Kamala Khan''' is a fictional [[superheroine]] appearing in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by editors [[Sana Amanat]] and Stephen Wacker, writer [[G. Willow Wilson]] and artist [[Adrian Alphona]], Khan is Marvel's first [[Muslim]] character to headline her own comic book. Khan made her first appearance in ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #14 (August 2013) before headlining the ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' comic book series in February 2014.

Within the [[Marvel Universe]], Khan is a teenage [[Pakistani American]] from [[New Jersey]] with [[shapeshifting]] abilities, who discovers that she has [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] genes in the aftermath of the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline and assumes the codename '''Ms. Marvel''' from her [[Teen idol|idol]] [[Carol Danvers]]. Marvel's announcement that a Muslim character would headline a comic book was met with widespread reaction and the first volume of ''Ms. Marvel'' won the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|best graphic story]] in 2015.

== Publication history ==
In  November 2013, [[Marvel Comics]] announced that Kamala Khan, a teenage [[Islam in the United States|Muslim American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], would take over the comic book series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' beginning in February 2014. The series, written by [[G. Willow Wilson]] and drawn by [[Adrian Alphona]], marks the first time a Muslim character has headlined a book at Marvel Comics.<ref name="Marvel">{{cite web |last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |date=November 6, 2013|title=All-New Marvel NOW!

Amanat said, "I was telling him [Wacker] some crazy anecdote about my childhood, growing up as a Muslim-American. He found it hilarious." The pair then told Wilson about the concept and Wilson became eager to jump aboard the project.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |last=Gustines |first=George |date=November 5, 2013|title=Marvel Comics Introducing a Muslim Girl Superhero |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/books/marvel-comics-introducing-a-muslim-girl-superhero.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Amanat said that the series came from a "desire to explore the Muslim-American diaspora from an authentic perspective."<ref name="AP">{{cite news |last=More |first=Matt |date=November 5, 2013 |title=In Marvel Comics, Ms Marvel returns as Muslim teen |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/marvel-comics-ms-marvel-returns-muslim-teen |work=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Amanat stated that Khan's costume was influenced by the [[shalwar kameez]]. They wanted the costume to represent her cultural identity, but did not want her to wear a [[hijab]]. Amanat also stated that they wanted the character to look "less like a sex siren" to appeal to a more vocal female readership.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dev |first=Arun |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/American-Muslims-were-proud-of-Kamala-Khan/articleshow/42473218.cms |title='American Muslims were proud of Kamala Khan' |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6cJle48Mr |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=September 15, 2014 |accessdate=October 16, 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Marvel knew that they wanted a young Muslim girl, but stated that she could be from any place of origin and have any background. Wilson initially considered making her an [[Arabs|Arab]] girl from [[Dearborn, Michigan]] but ultimately chose to create a [[Desi]] girl from Jersey City,<ref>{{cite web| last=Ali |first=Dilshad D. |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2013/11/interview-g-willow-wilson-on-the-creation-of-the-newest-muslim-american-comic-superhero/ |title=Interview: G.

Because most of Marvel Comics' stories are set in Manhattan, Wilson explains, "A huge aspect of Ms. Marvel is being a 'second string hero' in the 'second string city' and having to struggle out of the pathos and emotion that can give a person."<ref name="Newsarama"/>

The series not only explores Khan's conflicts with supervillains but also explores conflicts with Khan's home and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said "This is not evangelism. It was really important for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." Wilson continued, "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor."<ref name="NYTimes" /> Amanat added, <blockquote>As much as Islam is a part of Kamala’s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.<ref name="Marvel" /></blockquote>

[[File:First appearance of Kamala Khan.jpg|thumb|left|First appearance of Kamala Khan from ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #14 (August 2013) by [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and Scott Hepburn.]]
In the series, Khan takes the name Ms. Marvel from [[Carol Danvers]], who now goes by the alias [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. ''Captain Marvel'' writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] revealed that Khan actually made a brief appearance in ''Captain Marvel'' #14 (August 2013) saying, "Kamala is in the background of a scene in ''Captain Marvel'' 14... She is very deliberately placed in a position where she sees Carol protecting civilians from [[Yon-Rogg]]."<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Thompson |first=Kelly |date=2013-11-18 |title=3 Chicks Review Comics – Episode 064 | medium=[[Podcast]] |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/11/18/3-chicks-review-comics-episode-064/ |accessdate=2013-12-06 |format=[[MP3]] |time =1:37:40 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> According to Wilson, Khan idolizes Carol so when Khan acquires superhuman abilities, she emulates Danvers.<ref name="Newsarama">{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=November 6, 2013 |title=G.

She's strong, beautiful and doesn't have any of the baggage of being Pakistani and 'different,'"<ref name="NYTimes" /> Wilson explained. "Khan is a big comic book fan and after she discovers her superhuman power – being a polymorph and able to lengthen her arms and legs and change her shape – she takes on the name of Ms. Marvel," Amanat elaborated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Pow!

In the series' first story arc, Khan faces off against a new villain, Mr. Edison / the Inventor. Wilson created the Inventor to be Khan's first arch rival in order to mirror Khan's own complexity. Wilson characterizes The Inventor, and the overall visual look of the opening story arc as "kooky and almost [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]-esque at times", owing to the art style of illustrator [[Adrian Alphona]], which balances the drama of the threats which Khan faces with the humor of Alphona's "tongue in cheek sight gags." During the storyline, Khan also [[team-up|teams-up]] with the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] against the Inventor. Because Wolverine is dealing with the [[Death of Wolverine|loss of his healing factor]] during this time, Khan is placed in the position of having to shoulder much of the responsibilities, as Wilson felt this was a role reversal that would subvert reader expectations that Wolverine would take the lead in such a team-up.<ref>{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=July 16, 2014 |title=Heroic Identity of Wilson's "Ms. Marvel" Continues To Take Shape |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54112 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

At 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], writer [[Dan Slott]] announced that Khan would team-up with [[Spider-Man]] beginning in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #7 (October 2014) during the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline. Slott characterized Khan "the closest character to classic Peter Parker,"<ref>{{cite web |last=Manning |first=Shaun |date=July 25, 2014 |title=SDCC: Across the Spider-Verse |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54330 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> explaining, "She's a teenage superhero, juggling her life, making mistakes, trying to do everything right."<ref>{{cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=October 12, 2014 |title=NYCC: Marvel's "Spider-Verse" Panel, "Spider-Gwen" and "Silk" Ongoings Announced |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=56244 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref>

Beginning in June 2015, ''Ms. Marvel'' tied into the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover event]] with the "Last Days" storyline, which details Khan's account of the end of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Wilson explained, "In the 'Last Days' story arc, Kamala has to grapple with the end of everything she knows, and discover what it means to be a hero when your whole world is on the line."<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 19, 2015 |title="Ms. Marvel," "Silver Surfer" and More Face Their Last Days |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=59452 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> In the storyline, Khan rushes to deal with the threat in Manhattan. However, Wilson revealed, "She will face a very personal enemy as the chaos in Manhattan spills over into Jersey City, and she will be forced to make some very difficult choices. There will also be a very special guest appearance by a superhero Kamala—and the fans—have been waiting to meet for a long time."<ref>{{cite web |last=Lovett |first=Jaime |date=February 19, 2015 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Ms Marvel Enters Her Last Days |url=http://comicbook.com/2015/02/18/exclusive-ms-marvel-enters-her-last-days/ |publisher=comicbook.com |accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>

In March 2015, Marvel announced that Khan will join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''All-New All-Different Avengers'' [[Free Comic Book Day|FCBD]] (May 2015) by writer [[Mark Waid]] and artists [[Adam Kubert]] and [[Mahmud Asrar]], which takes place in the aftermath of "Secret Wars".<ref>{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=March 24, 2015 |title=MARVEL Begins To Unveil ALL-NEW ALL-DIFFERENT AVENGERS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/23888-marvel-begins-to-unveil-all-new-all-different-avengers-title-for-fcbd.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref> A second volume of ''Ms. Marvel'' starring Khan by Wilson, Alphona and [[Takeshi Miyazawa]] is also scheduled to debut following "Secret Wars" as part of Marvel's [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/marvel-just-revealed-its-entire-all-new-all-different-1714899675|title=Marvel Just Revealed Its Entire "All-New, All-Different" Comic Universe|publisher=[[Io9]]|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Amanat said, <blockquote>By the time this new launch comes around, it will have been almost two years since the premiere of ''Ms. Marvel''—and boy, has Kamala Khan been through a lot since then. She's been slowly coming into her own, dealing with the challenges of navigating adulthood and being a super hero. But her training is over now and it's time for the big leagues; the question is can she handle it?... As much as Kamala has a right to be there—it's still a bit of a culture shock.  Dreaming of being an Avenger and then suddenly being one is a lot to take on for someone of her age. So, she'll be a little awestruck, a little overly ambitious.<ref>{{cite web |last=Helvie |first=Forrest C. |date=July 10, 2015 |title=Ms. Marvel Hits the Big Time |url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/24858/ms_marvel_hits_the_big_time |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

== Reception ==

=== Initial reaction ===
Marvel's announcement was met with widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of ''Muslimah Media Watch'', a diversity [[advocacy group]], told [[Al Jazeera America]] that "She is going to be a window into the American Muslim experience" and that she "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim."<ref>{{cite news |last=De Bode |first=Lisa |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Ms. Marvel returns as Muslim teen |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/5/ms-marvel-returnsasmuslimteen.html |work=[[Al Jazeera America]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Brett White of [[Comic Book Resources]] said, "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes."<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Brett |date=November 6, 2013 |title=In Your Face Jam: Ms. Marvel Is Important |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48963 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Hussein Rashid writing for [[CNN]] said, "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims.

=== Critical reaction ===
Meagan Damore of ''Comic Book Resources'' said, "There is nothing not to love about ''Ms. Marvel'' #1: every character is well formed and distinct; the story, lovingly crafted; the art, meticulously planned and — at times — downright funny."<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=6953 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> Jen Aprahamian of ''[[Comic Vine]]'' said "''Ms. Marvel'' makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart even before she puts on a mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction.

==Other versions==
* An older version of Khan appears in ''[[Inhumans|Inhumans: Attilan Rising]]'' by [[Charles Soule]] and John Timms as part of the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, which details [[Black Bolt]]'s rebellion against [[Medusa (comics)|Queen Medusa]] of [[Attilan|New Attilan]]. In her review of ''Inhumans: Attilan Rising'' #2, Emma Houxbois of The Rainbow Hub said, "While [Khan has] had a few chances to shine in the core ''Inhuman'' book, her reintroduction (complete with character redesign by Dave Johnson and strong line work by John Timms) packs a real punch. Soule's evolution of her powers and costume will hopefully also coincide with further opportunities later in the story to learn more about her views on the resistance and reasons for supporting Attilan – solidifying this version of Kamala as a comparatively matured hero forced to make difficult moral choices."<ref>{{cite web |last=Houxbois |first=Emma |date=June 13, 2015 |title=Attilan Rising #2: Review |url=http://www.therainbowhub.com/attilan-rising-2-review/ |publisher=The Rainbow Hub |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref>
