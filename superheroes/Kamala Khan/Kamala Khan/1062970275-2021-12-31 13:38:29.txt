Willow Wilson]], and artists [[Adrian Alphona]] and [[Jamie McKelvie]], Khan is Marvel's first [[Muslims|Muslim]] character to headline her own comic book. Khan made her first appearance in ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #14 (August [[2013 in comics|2013]]) before going on to star in the solo series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'', which debuted in February 2014.

Within the [[Marvel Universe]], Khan is a teenage [[Pakistani Americans|Pakistani American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with [[shapeshifting]] abilities who discovers that she has [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] genes in the aftermath of the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline and assumes the mantle of [[Ms. Marvel]] from her [[Teen idol|idol]] [[Carol Danvers]] after Danvers becomes Captain Marvel. Marvel's announcement that a Muslim character would headline a comic book drew widespread attention, and the first volume of ''Ms. Marvel'' won the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|best graphic story]] in 2015.

[[Iman Vellani]] is set to portray Khan in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] [[Disney+]] series ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'' (2022) and the film ''[[The Marvels (film)|The Marvels]]'' (2023). The character was voiced by Sandra Saad in the 2020 action-adventure video game ''[[Marvel's Avengers (video game)|Marvel's Avengers]]''.

==Publication history==
In November 2013, [[Marvel Comics]] announced that Kamala Khan, a teenage [[Islam in the United States|American Muslim]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], would take over the comic book series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' beginning in February 2014. The series, written by [[G. Willow Wilson]] and drawn by [[Adrian Alphona]], marked the first time a Muslim character headlined a book at Marvel Comics.<ref name="Marvel">{{cite web |last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |date=November 6, 2013|title=All-New Marvel NOW!

Marvel knew that they wanted a young Muslim girl, but stated that she could be from any place of origin and have any background. Wilson initially considered making her an [[Arabs|Arab]] girl from [[Dearborn, Michigan]] but ultimately chose to create a [[Desi]] girl from Jersey City.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ali |first=Dilshad D. |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2013/11/interview-g-willow-wilson-on-the-creation-of-the-newest-muslim-american-comic-superhero/ |title=Interview: G.

Wilson explains, "A huge aspect of Ms. Marvel is being a 'second string hero' in the 'second string city' and having to struggle out of the pathos and emotion that can give a person."<ref name="Newsarama"/>

The series not only explores Khan's conflicts with supervillains but also explores conflicts with Khan's home and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said "This is not evangelism. It was really important for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." Wilson continued, "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor."<ref name="NYTimes" /> Amanat added, <blockquote>As much as Islam is a part of Kamala's identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.<ref name="Marvel" /></blockquote>

In the series, Khan takes the name Ms. Marvel from Carol Danvers, who now goes by the alias Captain Marvel. ''Captain Marvel'' writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] revealed that Khan actually made a brief appearance in ''Captain Marvel'' #14 (August 2013) saying, "Kamala is in the background of a scene in ''Captain Marvel'' 14 ...

In the series' first story arc, Khan faces off against Mr. Edison / the Inventor, an amalgam of man and bird. Wilson created the Inventor to be Khan's first arch rival in order to mirror Khan's own complexity. Wilson characterizes the Inventor, and the overall visual look of the opening story arc as "kooky and almost [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]-esque at times", owing to the art style of illustrator [[Adrian Alphona]], which balances the drama of the threats which Khan faces with the humor of Alphona's "tongue in cheek sight gags." During the storyline, Khan also [[team-up|teams-up]] with the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] against the Inventor. Because Wolverine is dealing with the [[Death of Wolverine|loss of his healing factor]] during this time, Khan is placed in the position of having to shoulder much of the responsibilities, as Wilson felt this was a role reversal that would subvert reader expectations that Wolverine would take the lead in such a team-up.<ref>{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=July 16, 2014 |title=Heroic Identity of Wilson's "Ms. Marvel" Continues To Take Shape |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54112 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

At the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], writer [[Dan Slott]] announced that Khan would team-up with [[Spider-Man]] beginning in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #7 (October 2014) during the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline.

Beginning in June 2015, ''Ms. Marvel'' tied into the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover event]] with the "Last Days" storyline, which details Khan's account of the end of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Wilson explained, "In the 'Last Days' story arc, Kamala has to grapple with the end of everything she knows, and discover what it means to be a hero when your whole world is on the line."<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 19, 2015 |title="Ms. Marvel," "Silver Surfer" and More Face Their Last Days |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=59452 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> In the storyline, Khan rushes to deal with the threat in Manhattan. However, Wilson revealed, "She will face a very personal enemy as the chaos in Manhattan spills over into Jersey City, and she will be forced to make some very difficult choices.

In March 2015, Marvel announced that Khan will join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''All-New All-Different Avengers'' [[Free Comic Book Day|FCBD]] (May 2015) by writer [[Mark Waid]] and artists [[Adam Kubert]] and [[Mahmud Asrar]], which takes place in the aftermath of "Secret Wars".<ref>{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=March 24, 2015 |title=MARVEL Begins To Unveil ALL-NEW ALL-DIFFERENT AVENGERS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/23888-marvel-begins-to-unveil-all-new-all-different-avengers-title-for-fcbd.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |access-date=March 24, 2015}}</ref> A second volume of ''Ms. Marvel'' starring Khan by Wilson, Alphona and [[Takeshi Miyazawa]] is also debuted following "Secret Wars" as part of Marvel's [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/marvel-just-revealed-its-entire-all-new-all-different-1714899675|title=Marvel Just Revealed Its Entire "All-New, All-Different" Comic Universe|publisher=[[Io9]]|date=June 30, 2015|access-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Amanat said, <blockquote>By the time this new launch comes around, it will have been almost two years since the premiere of ''Ms. Marvel''—and boy, has Kamala Khan been through a lot since then.

But her training is over now and it's time for the big leagues; the question is can she handle it? ... As much as Kamala has a right to be there—it's still a bit of a culture shock.

In March 2016, Marvel announced that ''Ms. Marvel'' would tie into the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline by releasing a promotional image illustrating a rift between Khan and Danvers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dickens |first=Donna |date=March 10, 2016 |title=Exclusive: Kamala Khan must choose a side in Marvel's CIVIL WAR II |url=http://www.hitfix.com/harpy/exclusive-kamala-khan-must-choose-a-side-in-marvels-civil-war-ii |publisher=HitFix |access-date=May 25, 2016}}</ref> "While "Civil War II" may have initiated this rift, we've known for some time that Kamala would eventually need to separate herself from her idols. Her journey centers around self-discovery and identity, and a part of that exploration includes separating yourself from those you put on pedestals.

It has to do with growing up and realizing that you perceive the world differently from even the ones you love," Amanat elaborated.<ref name="Marvel_NOW!">{{cite web |last=Cooke |first=Sarah |date=September 12, 2016 |title=Marvel NOW!

In July, Marvel announced that Khan will join the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]], a team of teenage superheroes who split off from the Avengers following the conclusion of "Civil War II". The team, featured in a series by writer [[Mark Waid]] and artist [[Humberto Ramos]], consists of Khan, [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)]], [[Nova (Sam Alexander)]], [[Amadeus Cho|Hulk (Amadeus Cho)]], [[Viv Vision]], and a teenage version of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Time-displaced Cyclops|Cyclops]]. Waid said, "The first three are the kids who quit the Avengers proper. That was an easy get. Those three, in and of themselves, form a nice little subteam. Their dynamic is great. They all show up in each other's books, and even though they have their arguments and stress points, clearly they're good together."<ref>{{cite web |last=Holub |first=Christian |date=July 5, 2016 |title=Marvel's young superheroes channel their activist sides in new series Champions |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/05/marvel-champions |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=July 5, 2016}}</ref>

In August, Khan made an appearance in ''[[Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur]]'' #10 by writers [[Amy Reeder]] and Brandon Montclare. In the issue, Khan acts as a mentor to Moon Girl (Lunella Lafayette) who is also a young Inhuman that suddenly came into her powers. Amanat stated that Khan sees much of herself in Lafayette and by teaching her, Khan learns much about herself.<ref name="Marvel_NOW!" />

In November, Marvel announced that Khan will join a new incarnation of the [[Secret Warriors (2017 series)|Secret Warriors]] in a series by writer Matthew Rosenberg and artist Javier Garron that debuted in May 2017. The team, formed in the wake of the "[[Inhumans vs X-Men]]" storyline, also includes [[Daisy Johnson|Quake]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], Moon Girl, and Devil Dinosaur. Rosenberg stated that there is some conflict and friction amongst the team members explaining, "Ms. Marvel and Quake are really fighting for the soul of the team in a lot of ways, while Moon Girl will continue to really do her own thing.

Wilson stated that the issue would explore Danvers' and Khan's mentor–student relationship, but "at its heart, [it] is about growing up, and a big part of growing up is discovering that your idols have [[feet of clay]] – and forgiving them for their flaws as you gain an adult understanding of your own."<ref name="ABCNews">{{cite web |date=March 24, 2017 |last=Rothman |first=Michael |title=Marvel's 'Generations': Original Wolverine, Hulk, Iron Man and more to return  |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/marvels-generations-original-wolverine-hulk-iron-man-return/story?id=46331912 |work=[[ABC News]] |access-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref>

In December, ''Ms. Marvel'' began the "Teenage Wasteland" story arc, as part of the [[Marvel Legacy]] relaunch. Wilson said, "Since the events of 'Civil War II', there's been friction between Kamala and her mentor, Captain Marvel. In this arc, we're exploring how complicated legacies can be when they're passed from generation to generation ... She's questioning a lot about herself and her mission. Her friends end up stepping into some very important—and unexpected—roles.

Beginning in March 2019, Khan headlined a new series titled, ''The Magnificent Ms. Marvel'', written by Ahmed and illustrated by Minkyu Jung. Wilson stated that she had been planning her departure from the series for over a year, stating that she originally anticipated that the series would only last for ten issues and was excited by the fact that she had written 60 issues.

==Reception==

===Initial reaction===
Marvel's announcement was met with widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of ''Muslimah Media Watch'', a diversity [[advocacy group]], told [[Al Jazeera America]] that "She is going to be a window into the American Muslim experience" and that she "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim."<ref>{{cite news |last=De Bode |first=Lisa |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Ms. Marvel returns as Muslim teen |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/5/ms-marvel-returnsasmuslimteen.html |work=[[Al Jazeera America]] |access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Brett White of [[Comic Book Resources]] said, "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes."<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Brett |date=November 6, 2013 |title=In Your Face Jam: Ms. Marvel Is Important |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48963 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Hussein Rashid writing for [[CNN]] said, "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims. She is born in the United States, appears to be part of the post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] generation and is a teenager."<ref>{{cite news |last=Rashid |first=Hussein |date=November 6, 2013|title=Meet the new Marvel superhero: A rebellious Muslim teen from New Jersey |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/06/meet-the-new-ms-marvel-a-rebellious-muslim-teen-from-new-jersey/comment-page-1/ |work=[[CNN]] |access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Muaaz Khan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared Kamala Khan to [[Malala Yousafzai]] and indicated that the rest of entertainment industry should follow Marvel's example.<ref>{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Muaaz |date=November 13, 2013 |title= Marvel's newest hero is a Muslim girl.

However, Dr. Leon Moosavi of the [[University of Liverpool]] felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents and that her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes, especially [[taqiyya]]:<ref>{{cite news |last=Moosavi |first=Leon |date=November 27, 2013 |title=Why can't Spider-Man convert to Islam? |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/why-can-spiderman-convert-islam-20131122115933370663.html |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref> a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution.<ref name=StewartNYUEssay>{{cite web |title=Islam in Spain after the Reconquista |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/program/neareast/test/andalusia/2_p8_text.html |first=Devin |last=Stewart |work=Teaching Materials |publisher=The Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at [[New York University]] |access-date=6 August 2012}}</ref>

Political satirist [[Stephen Colbert]], whilst parodying right-wing commentators on his show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', remarked, "A Muslim cannot be a superhero — for Pete's sake they're on the no-fly list."<ref>{{cite news |last=Maglio |first=Tony |date=November 7, 2013 |title=Stephen Colbert on New Ms. Marvel: 'Muslim Cannot Be a Superhero ...

===Critical reaction===
Meagan Damore of ''Comic Book Resources'' said, "There is nothing not to love about ''Ms. Marvel'' #1: every character is well formed and distinct; the story, lovingly crafted; the art, meticulously planned and—at times—downright funny."<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=6953 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=February 6, 2014}}</ref> Jen Aprahamian of ''[[Comic Vine]]'' said "''Ms. Marvel'' makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart even before she puts on a mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor in a way that doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a world—a universe, even—of story possibilities."<ref>{{cite web |last=Aprahamian |first=Jen |date=February 4, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 Review |url=http://www.comicvine.com/reviews/ms-marvel-1/1900-2673/ |publisher=[[Comic Vine]] |access-date=February 5, 2014}}</ref> Joshua Yehl of ''[[IGN]]'' said, "''Ms. Marvel'' introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love."<ref>{{cite web |last=Yehl |first=Joshua |date=February 5, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/05/ms-marvel-1-review-2 |publisher=IGN |access-date=February 6, 2014}}</ref> George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' said, "''Ms. Marvel'' is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself ... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time."<ref>{{cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=February 3, 2014 |title=Best Shots Advance Reviews: MS.

According to Sarah Gibbons (2017), Khan's powers of body morphing are paralleled by the flexibility required of the in-world characters who live in her home city of Jersey City, and that her unusual superpowered body shape carries a non-conforming message in terms of current neo-liberal ideologies.<ref>{{citation| last = Gibbons | first =  Sarah | title = 'I Don't Exactly Have Quiet, Pretty Powers': Flexibility and Alterity in Ms. Marvel. | journal =  Journal of Graphic Novels & Comics |volume = 8 | number =  5 | date =  Oct 2017 | pages =  450–463 | doi = 10.1080/21504857.2017.1355834| s2cid = 193822282 }}</ref>

* In January 2015, images of Khan began appearing over anti-Islamic advertisements on San Francisco city buses. The advertisements, purchased by the [[Stop Islamization of America|American Freedom Defense Initiative]], equated Islam with [[Nazism]]. In response, street artists covered the ads with images of Khan alongside messages such as "Calling all Bigotry Busters," "Stamp out racism," "Free speech isn't a license to spread hate," "Islamophobia hurts us all," and "Racist." About the response, Wilson tweeted, "Some amazing person has been painting over the anti-Muslim bus ads in SF with Ms. Marvel graffiti ...

==Other versions==
* An older version of Khan appears in ''[[Inhumans|Inhumans: Attilan Rising]]'' by [[Charles Soule]] and John Timms as part of the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, which details [[Black Bolt]]'s rebellion against [[Medusa (comics)|Queen Medusa]] of [[Attilan|New Attilan]]. In her review of ''Inhumans: Attilan Rising'' #2, Emma Houxbois of The Rainbow Hub said, "While [Khan has] had a few chances to shine in the core ''Inhuman'' book, her reintroduction (complete with character redesign by Dave Johnson and strong line work by John Timms) packs a real punch. Soule's evolution of her powers and costume will hopefully also coincide with further opportunities later in the story to learn more about her views on the resistance and reasons for supporting Attilan – solidifying this version of Kamala as a comparatively matured hero forced to make difficult moral choices."<ref>{{cite web |last=Houxbois |first=Emma |date=June 13, 2015 |title=Attilan Rising #2: Review |url=http://www.therainbowhub.com/attilan-rising-2-review/ |publisher=The Rainbow Hub |access-date=July 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716075307/http://www.therainbowhub.com/attilan-rising-2-review/ |archive-date=July 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
