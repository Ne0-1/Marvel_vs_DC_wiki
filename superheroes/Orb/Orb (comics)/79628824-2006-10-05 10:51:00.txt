'''The Orb''' (Drake Shannon) is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], primarily an adversary of [[Ghost Rider]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]], penciller [[Ross Andru]], and inker [[Don Perlin]], he first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #15 ([[1973#November|November 1973]]).

==Character biography==
An accomplished [[motorcycle]] [[stunt|stunt rider]], Drake Shannon owned one-half of the travelling motorcycle stunt show which would later feature Johnny Blaze (who would later become Ghost Rider).  The other half of the show was owned by Blaze's mentor, Crash Simpson.

While the partnership was initially amiable, the two men grew apart and eventually an intense rivalry developed.  Neither wanted to work with the other, but neither wanted to sell their half of the show.  To settle the dispute, the two men agreed to a lengthy [[racing|race]], with the winner receiving full ownership of the travelling show.

After many miles of neck-and-neck competition, Shannon deliberately swerved towards Simpson in an effort to force Simpson to [[car accident|crash]].  However, the maneuver caused Shannon to lose control of his motorcycle.  While Simpson managed to remain upright and continue on with the race, Shannon slid 25 yards on his unprotected [[face]].  The accident left him hideously [[disfigurement|disfigured]].

After his recovery, for reasons never adequately explained, Shannon was given a powerful [[motorcycle helmet]] by [[They Who Wield Power]].  The helmet, which was modeled to look like a giant eyeball, could hypnotise people.  A later version could also shoot powerful laser beams from its "[[pupil]]". 

Calling himself "The Orb", Shannon attempted to take over the travelling motorcycle stunt show which he had once half-owned.  He put the lives of dozens of innocent people at risk, but informed Johnny Blaze (now the sole owner of the stunt show) that he would let them go unharmed in exchange for the sole ownership of the stunt show.  Although Blaze capitulated, Shannon instructed his [[henchman|minions]] to kill the [[hostage]]s anyways, so that no one would know how the ownership changed hands.  At this point, [[Ghost Rider]] and [[Spider-Man]] teamed up to defeat him.

He returned several times during the tenure of the original Ghost Rider series, always plotting to get revenge on the Ghost Rider.  At one point he also crossed paths with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].
