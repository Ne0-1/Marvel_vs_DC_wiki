==Fictional character biography==

[[image:Synch3.jpg|left|thumb|150px|X-Men #36. Art by Andy Kubert.]]Everett Thomas was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  He was first introduced in [[X-Men]] #36, when the mechanical collective race known as the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] had assimilated the X-Men and attempted to wipe out what was to be the next generation of mutant heroes ([[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[M (comics)|Monet]], and [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], all except Blink future members of Generation X).  Synch had accidentally synched to [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], who was in the area, and had shattered all the windows in his area with Banshee's "borrowed" scream.  He didn't know how he did it, but the next thing he knew there were several police officers with guns pointed at him. Unfortunately for them, the menace wasn't Everett, but the Phalanx, who attacked the officers.

Luckily, he was saved thanks to the help of the [[White Queen]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], Banshee, and Jubilee. This misfit band of heroes ended up saving the other kids who were attacked by the Phalanx, and from the sacrifice of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], they escaped the menace. Following this, the kids were all relocated to the Massachusetts Academy, where they would train to use their powers, receive a formal education, and act as Generation X, the next generation of X-Men, on the side. Everett, along with [[M (comics)|M]], was one of the foremost students.

When [[Emma Frost]]'s sister, Adrienne, came to America, she forced Emma to re-admit her back into the school. If not, Adrienne would release information to the parents of the normal kids that the Xavier School For Gifted Youngsters was a secret training ground for mutants. Later, Adrienne created mutant hatred amongst the human students in the school. When the parents of the non-mutant students heard that their children were going to school with mutants, they all arrived together to take their children away from the academy. However, [[Adrienne Frost]] had planted bombs all around the school. Banshee and Synch set out to turn off and deactivate all the bombs, while Emma and Adrienne brutally fought. Eventually, Emma pulled out a gun and shot Adrienne. 

Meanwhile, Banshee and Synch separated. Synch found a bomb and there were human students nearby. So, he "synched" with the nearest mutant, who was Monet. However, Monet was too far away, so he only received a portion of her powers, which happened to be her super strength. Using all his might, he threw the human kids out of the room, saving them from the explosion. Sadly, he wasn't able to save himself, dying to save his human peers. <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Genx70.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Synch died in Generation X #70.]] -->

==Powers and abilities==
Synch's mutant power equips him with an bio-energetic aura that allows him to duplicate the effect of the powers of any superpowered being in his vicinity and sometimes the power itself, essentially becoming in "synch" with that person (or more specifically, his or her bio-energetic aura). When Synch uses his powers, a multi-colored aura appears around his body. The aura is caused by the energies he is absorbing splitting the ambient light around him, which causes the described effect. Synch seemingly had greater mastery of his mutant abilities than his Generation X peers, often displaying more control over whatever powers he copied than that person. For example, he was also able to utilize [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber's]] powers to fly, something Chamber was never able to do. It had been theorized that in time, with practice, Synch would have been able to permanently retain any powers and abilities he acquired. However he is not always able to "synch" with purely physical abilities or abilities that exceed his physical makeup. In [[House of M]], he was able to retain powers permanently as a junior member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D]]. Potentially, if Synch had not died he would have become one of the most powerful mutants in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Synch was one of the many mutants killed in the war with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].  Before he joined [[Gambit]]'s band of mutant thieves the [[X-Ternals]], Jubilee had befriended him and has since mourned his death.

===Days of Future Past===
In the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline, Everett became Jubilee's lover and aided her along with the X-Men of that time to rebel against their oppressors.

===House of M===
In the [[House of M]] timeline Synch was alive and a member of the junior S.H.I.E.L.D. division, the Hellions, but was later killed during a battle with an alternate version
of the Hellions, the New Mutants and a Japan-based human resistance group which was
caused by an alternate version of Laurie Garrison (Wallflower).
