Freakshow is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Juan Bobillo]] for [[Marvel comics]]' second installment of the series ''Excalibur''. He is one of the few survivors of the island of [[Genosha]] which was decimated by the wild [[Sentinel]] attacks commissioned by [[Cassandra Nova]].

==History==

Very little is known about Freakshow, not even his name. However he is one of the few survivors of the island of Genosha after the Sentinel attacks on the capital of [[Hammer Bay]]. Somehow he finds himself to be the travelling companion of [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]] and becomes an unofficial pupil of [[Professor X]]. He soon proved his usefulness in disbatching a [[skirmish]] between the Professor and the local bully [[Unus the Untouchable]]. Knowing that he couldn't do anything to harm Unus, Xavier had Freakshow swallow the man whole. Because of Unus' natural [[force field (science fiction)|force field]] he was unharmed albeit shaken when Freakshow vomited him up later. 

During their efforts to rebuild Genosha, Freakshow took on a [[worm]]-like form and digested the [[debris]] of the shattered buildings to turn it into [[arable land]].

Since the events of the [[House of M]] and the conclusion in [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] it is unknown what has become of the mutants on Genosha. Since Magneto is now powerless and Xavier is missing there would be no one to lead the children but Callisto, and it is unknown how many of them are depowered.

==Powers==

Freakshow is a megamorph with the ability to transform his body into a variety of monstrous forms with unique abilities (such as a [[dragon]] form cabable of flight and fire breathing). While in these forms he has enhanced strength, speed, stamina, and resistance to injury along with the special characteristics of each form. He was also shown to take on [[humanoid]] forms, specifically an armored form akin to [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and a [[mythology| mythological]] [[Norse| Nordic]] [[Troll]]. In all of these forms Freakshow was still capable of human speech.
