'''Freakshow''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Chris Claremont]] for [[Marvel comics]]' second installment of the series ''Excalibur''. He is one of the few survivors of the island of [[Genosha]] which was destroyed by the wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks commissioned by [[Cassandra Nova]].

==Fictional character biography==
Very little is known about Freakshow, except that he is one of the few survivors of the island of Genosha after the Sentinel attacks on the capital of '''Hammer Bay'''. Somehow he finds himself to be the travelling companion of [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]] and becomes an unofficial pupil of [[Professor X]]. He soon proved his usefulness in dispatching a [[skirmish]] between the Professor and the local bully [[Unus the Untouchable]]. Knowing that he couldn't do anything to harm Unus, Xavier had Freakshow swallow the man whole. Because of Unus' natural [[force field (science fiction)|force field]] he was unharmed albeit shaken when Freakshow vomited him up later. 

He helps his friend Wicked survive an attack by Magistrates, military forces who were once the murderous law-enforcement arm of the Genoshan government.

During their efforts to rebuild Genosha, Freakshow takes on a [[worm]]-like form and digests the [[debris]] of many shattered buildings to turn it into [[arable land]].

After the events of the [[House of M]] Freakshow is revealed to be one of the many mutants to lose his abilities has a result of the Scarlet Witch's decimation. He has been seen with a number of Genoshan mutants including [[Unus the Untouchable]] and [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]]. In ''Son of M'' #5, (June 2006) the traveling mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] convinces them to try the mutagenic compound called the ''Terrigen Mists'', which had been stolen from the [[Inhumans]]. Freakshow regains his powers, but like the other mutants who have used the mist, it came with a price. For some time, he is unable to change out of his large, monstrous form. While trapped like this, he and the other Genosha mutants are drawn into battle with the [[Inhumans]], who are tracking down Quicksilver. Some time after, the effects of the mist wear off.

==Powers and abilities==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:freakshow action.jpg|thumbnail|left|185px|One example of Freakshow's forms]] -->
Freakshow is a megamorph with the ability to transform his body into a variety of monstrous forms with unique abilities (such as a [[dragon]] form capable of flight and fire breathing). While in these forms he has enhanced strength, speed, stamina, and resistance to injury along with the special characteristics of each form. He was also shown to take on [[humanoid]] forms, specifically an armored form akin to [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and a [[mythology|mythological]] [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Troll]]. In all of these forms Freakshow was still capable of human speech.

==Another Freakshow==
In ''X-Force'' vol. 1 #101, a young mutant known as Kevin, nicknamed ''Freakshow'', nearly fell to his death when he attempts to impress others his age by proving that he could fly. This occurs when the [[High Evolutionary]] temporarily eliminates all mutant abilities.
