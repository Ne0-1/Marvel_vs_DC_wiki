'''Freakshow''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Chris Claremont]] for [[Marvel comics]]' second installment of the series ''Excalibur''. He is one of the few survivors of the island of [[Genosha]] which was decimated by the wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks commissioned by [[Cassandra Nova]].

==Fictional character biography==
Very little is known about Freakshow, not even his name. However he is one of the few survivors of the island of Genosha after the Sentinel attacks on the capital of '''Hammer Bay'''. Somehow he finds himself to be the travelling companion of [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]] and becomes an unofficial pupil of [[Professor X]]. He soon proved his usefulness in dispatching a [[skirmish]] between the Professor and the local bully [[Unus the Untouchable]]. Knowing that he couldn't do anything to harm Unus, Xavier had Freakshow swallow the man whole. Because of Unus' natural [[force field (science fiction)|force field]] he was unharmed albeit shaken when Freakshow vomited him up later. 

During their efforts to rebuild Genosha, Freakshow took on a [[worm]]-like form and digested the [[debris]] of the shattered buildings to turn it into [[arable land]].

Since the events of the [[House of M]] and the conclusion in [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], Freakshow was seen with a number of Genoshan mutants including [[Unus the Untouchable]] and [[Wicked (comics)|Wicked]] where they were exposed to the Terrigen Mists which [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] stole from the [[Inhumans]] to try to redeem himself and grant the world's mutants their powers back. The Mists advanced his powers, however he remained trapped in one of his beast-forms until the effects wore off.

==Powers==

Freakshow is a megamorph with the ability to transform his body into a variety of monstrous forms with unique abilities (such as a [[dragon]] form capable of flight and fire breathing). While in these forms he has enhanced strength, speed, stamina, and resistance to injury along with the special characteristics of each form. He was also shown to take on [[humanoid]] forms, specifically an armored form akin to [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and a [[mythology|mythological]] [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Troll]]. In all of these forms Freakshow was still capable of human speech.
