The '''Cheetah''' is a fictional character, created by [[William Moulton Marston]], and appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media, commonly as a major adversary of the superhero [[Wonder Woman]].

There have been four different incarnations of the Cheetah since the character's debut: '''Priscilla Rich''' (the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Cheetah), '''Deborah Domaine''' (the [[Bronze Age of Comics|Bronze Age]] Cheetah), '''Barbara Ann Minerva''' (the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] and current Cheetah), and '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' (a male usurper who briefly assumed the role in 2001). In 2009, The Cheetah was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 69th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/69.html Cheetah is number 69] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083651/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/69.html |date=May 10, 2009 }}, [[IGN]].</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Golden Age, Silver Age, and Post-Crisis comics history ===
Prior to the 12-issue DC Comics series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985 (which is regarded as the starting point for DC's continuity prior to the 2011 [[New 52]] reboot), there were two women who donned spotted cat costumes to fight Wonder Woman as the Cheetah: socialite Priscilla Rich and her niece Deborah Domaine. While modern incarnations of the Cheetah possess superhuman powers, Rich and Domaine do not.

There are two post-''Crisis'' Cheetahs: Barbara Ann Minerva and Sebastian Ballesteros, Minerva being the more prominent of the two. While the pre-''Crisis'' Cheetahs are simply women in costumes, the post-''Crisis'' Cheetahs have taken on a more mystical note, being champions of a god much as Wonder Woman is to her patrons; actually morphing into powerfully ferocious humanoid were-cheetahs with great strength, agility, and deadly claws and fangs which make them challenging opponents to Wonder Woman and other powerful heroes in battle.

===Priscilla Rich===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[File:Cover of Wonder Woman vol. 1, 6.png|165px|Cover to ''Wonder Woman''#6, the Cheetah's first appearance. Art by Harry G. Peter.|left|thumb]]
The first woman to become the Cheetah, in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 (October 1943), is Priscilla Rich, a 1940s-era blonde [[Washington, D.C.]] debutante of aristocratic upbringing who also has an overwhelming inferiority complex and suffers from a [[split personality]] and self-importance. After being eclipsed by Wonder Woman at a charity event and failing to kill her during an escapology act, Priscilla retreats to her room and collapses before her makeup mirror. There she sees an image of a woman dressed like a cheetah. "Horrors!" she cries, as she gazes at her evil inner-self for the first time. "Don't you know me?" replies the reflection. "I am the REAL you—the Cheetah—a treacherous, relentless huntress!" The image commands her to fashion a Cheetah costume from a cheetah-skin rug. "From now on," intones the reflection, "when I command you, you shall go forth dressed like your TRUE self and do as I command you..." The Cheetah frames Wonder Woman for a robbery by hiding the money in her apartment and tipping off the police, then sets fire to a warehouse Wonder Woman is in, although Wonder Woman escapes. She is presumed dead, but survives thanks to her fireproof costume.

She later kidnaps a young [[extrasensory perception|ESPer]] named Gail and uses the girl's powers to learn U.S. military secrets, which she gives to the Japanese. Wonder Woman manages to thwart the plot and rescue Gail, with Cheetah warning Wonder Woman to stay out of her affairs. She soon returns when an American military official organizes an athletic competition between female athletes from America and a group of women trained on [[Paradise Island (comics)|Paradise Island]]. Priscilla ties up and gags an Olympic [[high hurdles|high hurdler]] named Kay Carlton, and impersonates her by donning her clothes. Disguised as Kay, Priscilla infiltrates the contest and manages to kidnap Queen [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and steal her magical girdle. With Hippolyta as her hostage and her own abilities boosted by the girdle, Cheetah battles Wonder Woman for control of Paradise Island. She is defeated when the Amazon manages to pull the girdle off her. Temporarily freed from the Cheetah's influence, Priscilla asks to remain on Paradise Island until she can learn to control her split personality.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #6</ref>

Priscilla's attempt at reformation apparently failed, as she is later seen as a member of [[Villainy Inc.]], a criminal association between several of Wonder Woman's female foes.

Priscilla has several run-ins with Wonder Woman before retiring to her North Shore [[Maryland]] mansion. In ''Wonder Woman'' #274 (Dec. 1980), the villain [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]] attempts to recruit the villainess for his organization. His operative finds the reclusive Priscilla an invalid. Priscilla's niece Deborah Domaine had come at her bidding, and the operative stays to observe. Before Priscilla can unburden her alter ego as the Cheetah, she dies.

DC later relaunched its continuity with the 1985 series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', introducing a new Cheetah for the Modern Age, Barbara Minerva (see below). The original Cheetah, Priscilla Rich, is established as still existing post-''Crisis'' when [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] becomes the Golden Age Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War'' #1 (September 2001)</ref> In the present, she is seen as an elderly woman when she is murdered by Minerva. It is also established that she never became an invalid post-''Crisis'', as Minerva mentions how Priscilla had written books condemning her when she became the Cheetah. Rich is murdered in her home by Minerva, under the urging of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]].<ref>''The Flash'' #219 (April 2005)</ref> Zoom theorizes that if Minerva kills Rich, she would solidify herself as the one true Cheetah and thus be a better villain.

Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]], Rich is retconned from continuity. Priscilla Rich is one of the many aliases Barbara Minerva uses to commit crimes as Cheetah.

===Deborah Domaine===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[File:DeborahDomaine.PNG|Deborah Domaine as the second Cheetah, with Kobra. Art by [[José Delbo]].|thumb|left]]
Deborah 'Debbie' Domaine was introduced as the niece of Priscilla Rich. A beautiful young debutante, Debbie feels remorse for her wealthy upbringing and decides to become an ecology activist, meeting Wonder Woman and striking up a friendship with her. Later that same day, Debbie is summoned to her Aunt Priscilla's mansion and finds her there, succumbing to illness. After Priscilla Rich dies, Kobra's operatives capture Deborah and bring her and the Cheetah costume to Kobra's headquarters, where he questions her: "''You didn't know about your aunt's secret life, did you? Well, you'll learn—Since we couldn't have the original, we decided to make do with a recreation. You shall be that recreation, Ms. Domaine.''"

Kobra tortures and brainwashes Debbie and provides her with an updated version of the Cheetah costume. The original suit included a cat-eared cowl and clawed, flat-soled boots. Debbie's version has a V-neck, slit to the sternum, a headband with cat-ears (concealed for the most part beneath her long, auburn hair), and heeled boots. Both costumes include razor-sharp chrome steel nails, painted bright red. "''You are my servant, and I, your master. You are the Cheetah!''" he cries, "''And you will fill the world with terror!''" Debbie has several conflicts with Wonder Woman and also serves as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in a conflict with both the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Justice Society of America]], before her role as the Cheetah is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence due to the history-altering aftereffects of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985–1986). Debbie still exists post-''Crisis'', as referenced by a photo in Priscilla Rich's mansion inscribed to "Aunt Priscilla, Love Debbie."

Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]], Deborah Domaine is [[retcon]]ned from continuity, and her name is merely one of the many aliases Barbara Minerva uses to commit crimes as Cheetah.

===Barbara Ann Minerva===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[File:Cheetahperez.png|thumb|Barbara Ann Minerva as the Cheetah. Art by George Pérez.]]

The third Cheetah is British archaeologist Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva, born as the heiress of a vast fortune in the ancient family site in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Ambitious, selfish, and severely neurotic, Barbara develops a passion for archaeology that eventually led her to search out a tribe in Africa who utilizes a female guardian with the powers of a [[cheetah]]. A band of marauders kill the guardian and most of what remained of her original expedition party. Barbara, with the aid of the priest, Chuma, the caretaker of the ancient plant god Urzkartaga, takes her place after being told that she would gain immortality. Her powers are conferred to her by ingesting a combination of human blood and the berries or leaves of Urzkartaga. Unfortunately for Minerva, the host of the Cheetah persona is intended to be a virgin. Minerva is not, however, so her [[shapeshifting|transformations]] were part curse and part blessing, as she experiences severe pain and physical disability while in her human form and bloodthirsty euphoria while in her cat form.<ref name="dc-chee2">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Cheetah II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 80  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

This Cheetah was active before Wonder Woman's post-Crisis appearance, and confronts Catwoman in Rome during the events of ''Batman: Dark Victory'' and ''Catwoman: When in Rome.''

This version of the Cheetah comes into Wonder Woman's world when Barbara discovers that Diana possesses the [[Lasso of Truth]]. As an archaeologist, Barbara covets the lasso hoping to add it to her collection of historical items. She first attempts to do so through trickery, claiming that there is a matching ancient [[Golden Girdle of Gaea]] of the same kind from which the lasso was fashioned. Unfortunately, although the scheme proceeds far enough for Minerva to hold the lasso, its magical power to make people tell the truth forces her to confess her true intentions. Diana, profoundly distraught that she would be so treacherous, takes back the lasso and returns home in tears. With the subtle approach having failed, Minerva resorts to attacking the Amazon as the Cheetah in order to rob her of the lasso. Their initial battle ends with inconclusive results, as Diana's friend, [[Julia Kapatelis]], shoots the Cheetah and forces her to retreat.

Over the years, Barbara's interest in the lasso wanes and she becomes more interested in besting Diana in battle due to her bruised ego. The rivalry between the Cheetah and Wonder Woman fluctuates, though. Wonder Woman saves the Cheetah's life during an adventure in the Balkan country of Pan Balgravia.<ref>''Wonder Woman Special'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1992)</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #63 (June 1992)</ref> The country's dictator Baron Von Nastraed, for unknown reasons, chooses to aid a demon named Drax by capturing a powerful [[metahuman]] woman. The captive woman's body would be used to house Drax's alternate dimension bride Barremargux. When the Baron captures the Cheetah for this purpose, Wonder Woman travels to the country to save her. At the last moment, when Barremargux is about to enter [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-One]], Barbara closes the gateway before the crossing could be completed by jumping into the gateway instead. Barbara is trapped in this demonic dimension until the Boston mob boss Julianna Sazia has scientists open the dimensional gateway to retrieve Barbara to serve her own ends. Barbara double-crosses Julianna, choosing to aid Wonder Woman when she is caught in the mob war between Paulie Longo and Julianna Sazia in Boston. Seeing her debt to Wonder Woman paid for attempting to rescue her in Pan Balgravia, the Cheetah continues her quest to defeat Wonder Woman when it is convenient to her.

For a brief period of time, Minerva loses her powers to the businessman Sebastian Ballesteros (see below), who convinces Urzkartaga that he could be a more effective Cheetah than she was. Minerva later kills Ballesteros and regains her powers.

The relationship Minerva has with Urzkartaga is strained at times for all of Minerva's intense devotion and loyalty. At one point, the god punishes her by leaving one of Minerva's hands human looking and untransformed even while she is in her Cheetah form, though it appears to still be fully empowered as the rest of her body and equally as deadly. With help from [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], Minerva attains a level of super-speed even greater than she previously possessed. She accomplishes this by murdering Priscilla Rich, who previously went by the codename Cheetah.  They later join the latest [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and seem to be engaged in a sexual relationship, though Zoom considers himself to still be married to his former wife.

In the "[[One Year Later]]" storyline, the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] places a spell on Minerva that allows her to change her appearance from human to Cheetah at will, even though she still remains in her Cheetah form in either guise. She controls three actual cheetahs and still possesses her super-speed, which is demonstrated by her ability to steal the golden lasso away from [[Donna Troy]] several times in battle. She is later seen in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', forming a new [[Injustice League]] alongside [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. She also appears in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. Later still, in ''[[Final Crisis]]: Resist'', she joins forces with [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] to rebel against [[Darkseid]], and enjoys a brief relationship with [[Snapper Carr]]. In the pages of ''Wonder Woman'', she is revealed as the power behind the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains|Secret Society]], responsible for the creation of [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]]. She arranges to have her ally [[Doctor Psycho]] take the place of [[Sarge Steel]] as director of the Department of Metahuman Affairs which, in the middle of Genocide's onslaught, she targets for destruction.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #26-28 (January–March 2009)</ref>

==== The New 52 ====
In 2011, DC relaunched its comic books, and rebooted its continuity in an initiative called [[The New 52]]. The character was re-made to be a corrupt image and antecedent to Wonder Woman. Barbara Ann Minerva (having used several aliases that happen to be the names of the various incarnations of the character) is reintroduced as Cheetah.  As part of her new backstory, Minerva is referred to as an accomplice to Wonder Woman and an expert in dangerous relics, and having previously grown up in an all-woman commune called "Amazonia". In the possession of a dagger once belonging to a lost tribe of Amazons, she cut herself on it. She was possessed by the Goddess of the Hunt, transforming her into a human/cheetah hybrid. Her claws can also turn Superman into a cheetah-like being.  The origin of the Cheetah is dated back to the San Tribe, who for centuries had hunted alongside the cheetahs and every generation one of their members is chosen to become the host of the Goddess of the Hunt until one day a hunter killed the current host; the knife used to kill her was cursed until it fell in the hands of Minerva. Cheetah is subdued by the Justice League and placed in Belle Reve. However, once there, she makes contact with someone telling him she is where he requested, implying her capture was staged as a part of a bigger plan.<ref name=jl13>[[Johns, Geoff]] (w), [[Lee, Jim]] (p), [[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]] (i). ''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #13 (December 2012). DC Comics.</ref>

During the [[Forever Evil]] storyline, Cheetah is among the supervillains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] to join the Secret Society of Super-Villains.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #14</ref> A vision that [[Psi (comics)|Psi]] shows to Steve Trevor is that Cheetah is in possession of Wonder Woman's lasso and is hiding out in Central Park.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #4</ref> When Steve Trevor and [[Killer Frost]] arrived in Central Park to look for Cheetah, they end up ambushed by Cheetah and her Menagerie (consisting of [[Elephant Man (comics)|Elephant Man]], [[Hellhound (comics)|Hellhound]], [[Lion-Mane]], Mäuschen, Primeape, and [[Zebra-Man]]). Cheetah manhandles Trevor using Wonder Woman’s lasso. Steve Trevor manages to overcome the lasso and explains that only Diana could use it as she was herself truthful and pure. As Cheetah is not that, Trevor manages to get the lasso off and onto Cheetah. While Killer Frost escapes and freezes Cheetah’s Menagerie, Steve Trevor knocks Cheetah out.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #5</ref>

==== DC Rebirth ====
After the events of [[DC Rebirth]], Cheetah's origin is altered. As a young girl, Barbara Ann Cavendish enjoyed mythology and showed an affinity for language. Her father disparaged her interest in myth, deriding it as childish. In defiance of her father, her passion for myth and legend remained and as an adult she took her late mother's maiden name of Minerva. By age 26, she had mastered 7 languages and earned 2 PhD's in archaeology. On a dig in the Ukraine, she discovered proof of the existence of the Amazons, but the dig site collapsed. Minerva was able to take photos before the collapse and followed her findings to the Black Sea, only to find what she believed was an empty island. <ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #8 (Oct 2016)</ref> After Princess Diana of the Amazons returned US Navy SEAL Steve Trevor to the United States, the Navy called Dr Minerva to translate Diana's language. Minerva became close friends with Diana and Lt. Etta Candy and taught Diana English as well as other languages.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #6 (Sept 2016)</ref> After Ares attacks the naval base and several of the Olympian Gods(in the forms of animals) assist Diana in Ares' defeat<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #14 (Mar 2017)</ref>, Minerva became even more obsessed with the divine.  Seeking out proof of other deities, Barbara Ann learns of Urzkartaga and obtains funding for an expedition to the fictional African nation of Bwunda from [[Veronica Cale]]. Unbeknownst to Minerva, Cale was acting on behalf of the sons of Ares, [[Children of Ares|Deimos and Phobos]], who believed that by turning Minerva into a demigod, she would be able to locate Themyscira for them. In case of emergency, Diana provided Barbara Ann with a [[Wayne Enterprises]] GPS signaling device, which [[Doctor Cyber|Dr Cyber]] remotely disabled. As a result, Wonder Woman was unable to prevent Barbara Ann from being wed to Urzkartaga and becoming the Cheetah.<ref>Wonder Woman vol 5, #18 (May 2017)</ref> Blaming Diana for her forced transformation and the cannibalistic urges that came with it, Cheetah joined Cale's Godwatch group.

Years later, Wonder Woman travels to Bwunda in search of Cheetah. She is met with aggression from the Cult of Urzkartaga, a pack of were-hyenas, and ultimately Cheetah herself. The battle continues until Wonder Woman reveals to Cheetah that she is unable to locate Themyscira and needs her enemy's help.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #1 (Aug 2016)</ref> In exchange for Minerva's help in finding Themyscira, Wonder Woman agrees to kill the god Urzkartaga and end Minerva's curse. The pair battle their way through Urzkartaga's Bouda (werehyena) minions, the Bouda, and defeat Andres Cadulo, a worshiper of Urzkartaga that planned to sacrifice Steve Trevor to the plant god.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #5 (Sept 2016)</ref> .Barbara was revealed to have been turned into the Cheetah not because she was not a virgin, and that Urzkartaga lied to her – Cheetah and the women before her were actually his wardens, charged with keeping the evil plant god imprisoned. Cheetah used the Lasso of Truth to bind the plant god back into a harmless plant form. Once reverted to her human form, Minerva agreed to help Wonder Woman find her way back to Paradise Island. 

Shortly thereafter, Barbara Ann and Etta Candy were attacked by Godwatch. After reuniting with Steve Trevor, Godwatch attacked again and Barbara Ann surrendered to them, hoping to reason with Cale. Cale, having taken possession of the Urzkartaga plant, threatened to have Etta and Steve killed unless Minerva agreed to become the Cheetah again<ref>Wonder Woman vol 5 #17 (Apr 2017)</ref>.  Cale then flew them and her daughter Isadore (whose soul the sons of Ares had stolen to force Cale to do their bidding) to the island in the Black Sea that Barbara Ann had mistaken for Themyscira. Wonder Woman and Trevor arrived and fought Cheetah and Cale until Diana's blood opened a gateway to Ares' prison. Diana, Cale and Isadore went through the gateway leaving Cheetah and Trevor behind.<ref>Wonder Woman vol 5 #21 (Jun 2017)</ref>  By the time they returned, Cheetah had gone into hiding, only coming out when everyone had left. Approaching the gate to Ares' prison, she begged to be let in but was rebuffed. Enraged by the gods rejection, Cheetah swore revenge against them and the Amazons. She then went to Cale's home and stating she now embraces being the Cheetah, attacks Cale. Diana intervenes and subdues her, but Cheetah escapes custody shortly thereafter. <ref>Wonder Woman vol. 5, #24 (Aug 2017)</ref>

===Sebastian Ballesteros===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[File:TheMaleCheetah.png|thumb|Sebastian Ballesteros by [[Phil Jimenez]] from ''Wonder Woman'' #171 (August 2001)]]
[[Argentina|Argentine]] business tycoon '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' becomes the fourth Cheetah, as well as the only male Cheetah. He is an agent of the Amazon's enemy, [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], as well as her lover. He seeks the plant god '''Urzkartaga''' to become a new version of the Cheetah, a supernatural cat-creature like Barbara Ann Minerva. Appealing to the plant god's ego, Sebastian makes the case that the previous Cheetahs have failed in their actions and that a male Cheetah could be superior. Once Urzkartaga is convinced, Barbara Minerva's access to the Cheetah is cut off and Sebastian is given the power in her place. Later, Sebastian proves responsible for turning Wonder Woman's old friend, Vanessa Kapatelis, into the third [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]]. Angered at the loss of her powers, Barbara Minerva eventually battles Bellesteros for control of the power of the Cheetah by becoming the temporary host of [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Erinyes|Eumenides]] or Furies. Minerva accesses this new power by stealing it from the Furies former host, Helena Kosmatos, the Golden Age [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]]. This does not assist her in regaining the right to become the Cheetah. Ultimately (off-panel) Minerva finally kills Sebastian in his human form, regaining her Cheetah form as a result. She is later seen giving his blood to the Urzkartaga plant as a sacrifice.<ref name="dc-chee3">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Cheetah III | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 80  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Like Rich and Domaine, DC appeared to remove Ballesteros from continuity in the wake of its [[The New 52|2011 reboot]]. In ''Justice League'' comics, the name ''Sabrina'' Ballesteros is shown to be one of many aliases Barbara Minerva uses to commit crimes as Cheetah.

== Powers and abilities ==
Minerva, Ballesteros:
Powers and appearance of a cheetah, granted by the plant-god Urzkartaga.

Minerva:
Cheetah possesses superhuman speed, reaction time, strength  and durability to an unknown degree. Her sense of smell has also been enhanced and she is able to see in the dark. Her claws and fangs are preternaturally sharp.

== Other versions ==
=== DC: The New Frontier ===
An alternate version of Cheetah (Priscilla Rich) briefly appears in the final issue of ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]''.

=== Wonder Woman: The Blue Amazon ===
Another alternate version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Wonder Woman: The Blue Amazon]]''.

=== JLA/Avengers ===
Cheetah appears briefly as a villain under the control of [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] fighting [[Tigra]].

=== Wednesday Comics ===
A modernized version of Priscilla Rich appears as one of the primary antagonists of the Wonder Woman feature in ''[[Wednesday Comics]]''. Here, she is portrayed as a young archeologist from a wealthy Baltimore family, who relies on enchanted artifacts to grant her superhuman abilities. She initially befriends a young Diana, (before she has become Wonder Woman), after meeting her, but soon reveals her treacherous nature when she kidnaps Diana's friend [[Etta Candy|Etta]] and uses her as bait for a trap set by [[Doctor Poison]]. In the end, both Priscilla and Poison are defeated by Wonder Woman.

=== Justice ===
The Priscilla Rich version of the Cheetah appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in [[Alex Ross (comic illustrator)|Alex Ross]]' ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series. Here, she is shown to have fashioned her costume from the fur of her pet cheetahs, which she violently killed and skinned in an ancient ritual (likely reminiscent of the Barbara Ann Minerva version). This version also appears to have retired at some point before the events of the series, as Wonder Woman mentions that Priscilla returned to the side of the "Dark Gods" and having been friends with her at some point. She is first seen at the opening of the series as one of the many villains suffering from nightmares about the end of the world, and the Justice League's inability to stop it. Priscilla reappears in the fourth issue, attending a peace conference held by Wonder Woman with her cheetahs, but kills them once in her hotel room before performing an ancient ritual and donning a costume made from their pelts. When Wonder Woman leaves the conference, Cheetah attacks her in the hall, slashing her several times before she escapes. It is later revealed over the course of the series that Cheetah's claws were infected with Centaur's Blood, and was turning Diana back into clay. Priscilla's attack is apparently the most successful, as Wonder Woman was slowly crumbling to the point that her face had become black and cracked by the time the Justice League attacked the Hall of Doom, relying on the powers of her lasso to keep her from crumbling apart. It is mentioned by a citizen that Cheetah ruled over a city filled with those deemed "ugly" by society. After the League attacks the Legion of Doom, Priscilla is one of the few villains to escape the initial attack, retreating to her city in wait for Wonder Woman. When Diana follows Cheetah with several other JLA members, they quickly realize Cheetah is stalking them and Wonder Woman tells them to leave so she can face Priscilla herself. Almost immediately after they leave Cheetah ambushes Wonder Woman, who removes her protective mask to expose that Cheetah's Centaur blood had almost killed her. Diana tells Cheetah that she has lost all patience for her before violently slamming her head into Priscilla's, breaking her Cheetah mask in half and knocking Priscilla out.

=== Wonder Woman: Odyssey ===
A version of the Cheetah appears in the "Odyssey" storyline, which involves the Gods altering Diana's history so that Themyscira was destroyed when she was a child. The new Cheetah is created from the corpse of a murdered Amazon after it is lowered into a mystical restoration pit and infused with the spirit of Magaera by the Morrigan (the villains who are hunting Wonder Woman). Alongside new versions of [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] and [[Giganta]] (both of whom are also created from dead Amazons), the new Cheetah is tasked with hunting down and killing Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #606 (February 2011). DC Comics.</ref> After tracking down the safehouse where Diana lives with the last surviving residents of Themyscira, Cheetah brutally ambushes and slays a young Amazon as she steps outside. Cheetah is then shown carrying the woman's body away from the scene, muttering about how she too will be reborn soon.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #607 (March 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

=== Flashpoint ===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Cheetah joined with [[Wonder Woman]]'s [[Female Furies|Furies]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> After the Furies attack [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] and the Resistance, Cheetah is eaten by [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

=== Injustice: Gods Among Us ===
The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic, she was in the villains bar World's End in Keystone City, watching another villain play darts when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Wonder Woman]] suddenly burst in. Cheetah is in disbelief, her claws ready, though Wonder Woman says they are only here for [[Mirror Master]] and they don't want trouble.

* The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by actress [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]. This version was once a scientist who was involved in valuable genetic research. However, her funding was running out and she was unable to perform proper experiments. In a last-ditch effort to prove her research's value, she [[self-experimentation|tested her theories on herself]], resulting in a mutation into a half-human-half-cat hybrid. Shunned by the scientific community for her recklessness and ostracized by humanity as a freak, she turned to crime to fund further research to undo the change with no alternatives. First appearing in the episode "Injustice for All", she is a member of the [[Injustice Gang]]. She joins [[Lex Luthor]]'s group for the same reason she became a criminal in the first place: money – but she has little criminal intent unlike the others and merely wants to be normal again. When the Injustice Gang succeeds in capturing [[Batman]], Batman realizes that Cheetah is not like the others and offers her a way out, in exchange for helping the Dark Knight topple Luthor. However, Cheetah hesitates to take up Batman's offer although [[Ultra-Humanite|another disgruntled member]] betrays the teammates. When Luthor realizes they have a traitor in the midst, Lex points the blame toward Cheetah thanks to a clip from a security camera showing her and Batman kissing. She is knocked out by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] then taken away by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and is supposedly killed by being petted to death; an animation error causes Cheetah's existence to remain intact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/cheetah/cheetah.htm |title=Cheetah |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref>[[File:Kids' Stuff.jpg|thumb|Cheetah (left) battling [[Wonder Woman]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]] Cheetah reappears in the episode "Kids Stuff" where she fights Wonder Woman during a bank robbery.

* Cheetah appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Morena Baccarin]]. Though this version is said to be Barbara Ann Minerva and was empowered by the god Urzkartaga, this version is visually based on Priscilla Rich from the Golden/Silver Age Wonder Woman comics in appearance. In "Triumvirate of Terror", she collaborates with Lex Luthor and the Joker in order to come up with a plan to defeat Batman, [[Superman]] and Wonder Woman. She easily beats Superman with martial arts, Kryptonite and the magic amulet of Urzkartaga which channels the full power of her namesake. She is later defeated when Superman freezes her with super breath leaving her vulnerable to Wonder Woman and Batman's finishing blows. Cheetah makes a cameo appearance in the series finale "Mitefall!" getting hit on by [[Booster Gold]].

=== Film ===
* The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah briefly appears in the animated movie ''[[Wonder Woman (2009 film)|Wonder Woman]]''. She is seen near the end where she steals an artifact from a museum and attacks the police.

She fights Wonder Woman on a boat and manages to cut Diana's arm, infecting the Amazon with a poison. The poison's power is revealed when Cheetah jumps onto the docks and attempts to escape, but when Diana follows her everyone seen was Cheetah, including civilians, cops, and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. Wonder Woman began fighting every Cheetah seen, knocking out police, civilians, and ripping off Cyborg's arm (although Cyborg was able to reattach it soon after). Cyborg deduced that Wonder Woman, due to an upbringing as a warrior, would keep fighting to the end, overstraining herself, and causing heartbeat, blood pressure and breathing go off the scale, thus Cheetah's intent was either make Wonder Woman's heart give out, suffer an aneurysm or have Diana get shot by police, and managed to cure Diana before either of those eventualities came to pass. She joins Savage's plan for genocide, seeing no other options, and slits Savage's throat and does kill him, but the immortal quickly gets up and hits her in the head. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she takes on Wonder Woman herself, but she is eventually defeated by Diana. Of special note, she is the only character from the ''original'' group that appears in the film.
