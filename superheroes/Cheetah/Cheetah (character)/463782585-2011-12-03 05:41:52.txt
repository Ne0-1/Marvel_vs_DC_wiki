The '''Cheetah''' is a fictional character, a super-villainess appearing in DC Comics publications and related media. Popularly regarded as the archenemy of [[Wonder Woman]], the Cheetah first appeared in 1943 in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 (volume 1), written by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]]. Since then, the character has undergone several updates as comic book continuities have evolved and shifted. Indeed, there have been four different Cheetahs since the character's debut, including '''Priscilla Rich''' (the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] Cheetah), '''Deborah Domaine''' (the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Cheetah), '''Barbara Ann Minerva''' (the modern age and current Cheetah), and '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' (a male usurper who briefly assumed the role in 2001). In 2009, Cheetah was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 69th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/69.html Cheetah is number 69], [[IGN]].</ref>

==Golden Age and Silver Age comics history==
Prior to the 12-issue DC Comics series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985 (which is regarded as the starting point for DC's modern continuity), there were two women who donned spotted cat costumes to fight Wonder Woman as the Cheetah: socialite Priscilla Rich and her niece Deborah Domaine. While modern incarnations of the Cheetah possess superhuman powers, Rich and Domaine do not.  

===Priscilla Rich===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->

[[Image:Ww6.png|165px|Cover to ''Wonder Woman'' #6, the Cheetah's first appearance. Art by Harry G. Peter.|left|thumb]]

The first woman to become the Cheetah, in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 (October 1943), is Priscilla Rich, a 1940s-era blonde [[Washington, D.C.]] debutante of aristocratic upbringing who also has an overwhelming inferiority complex and suffers from a [[split personality]]. After being eclipsed by Wonder Woman at a charity event, Priscilla retreats to her room and collapses before her makeup mirror. There she sees an image of a woman dressed like a cheetah. "''Horrors!''" she cries, as she gazes at her evil inner-self for the first time. "Don't you know me?" replies the reflection. "''I am the REAL you—the Cheetah—a treacherous, relentless huntress!''" The image commands her to fashion a Cheetah costume. "From now on," intones the reflection, "''when I command you, you shall go forth dressed like your TRUE self and do as I command you...''"

Priscilla was a member of [[Villainy Inc.]], a criminal association between several of Wonder Woman's female foes. 

Priscilla has several run-ins with Wonder Woman before retiring to her North Shore [[Maryland]] mansion. In ''Wonder Woman'' #274 (Dec. 1980), the villain [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] attempts to recruit the villainess for his organization. His operative finds the reclusive Priscilla an invalid. Priscilla's niece Deborah Domaine had come at her bidding, and the operative stays to observe. Before Priscilla can unburden her alter ego as the Cheetah, she dies.

====Modern Age Comics History====
The original Cheetah, Priscilla Rich, is established as still existing post-''Crisis'' when [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] becomes the Golden Age Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War'' #1 (September 2001)</ref> In the present, she is seen as an elderly woman when she is murdered by Barbara Minerva (the Modern Age Cheetah; see below). It is also established that she never became an invalid post-''Crisis'', as Minerva mentions how Priscilla had written books condemning her when she became the Cheetah. Rich is murdered in her home by Minerva, under the urging of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]].<ref>''The Flash'' #219 (April 2005)</ref> Zoom theorizes that if Minerva kills Rich, she would solidify herself as the one true Cheetah and thus be a better villain.

===Deborah Domaine===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[Image:DeborahDomaine.PNG|Deborah Domaine as the second Cheetah, with Kobra. Art by Jose Delbo.|thumb|left]]
Deborah 'Debbie' Domaine was introduced as the niece of Priscilla Rich. A beautiful young debutante, Debbie feels remorse for her wealthy upbringing and decides to become an ecology activist, meeting Wonder Woman and striking up a friendship with her. Later that same day, Debbie is summoned to her Aunt Priscilla's mansion and finds her there, succumbing to illness. After Priscilla Rich dies, Kobra's operatives capture Deborah and bring her and the Cheetah costume to Kobra's headquarters, where he questions her: "''You didn't know about your aunt's secret life, did you? Well, you'll learn—Since we couldn't have the original, we decided to make do with a recreation. You shall be that recreation, Ms. Domaine.''"

Kobra tortures and brainwashes Debbie and provides her with an updated version of the Cheetah costume. The original suit included a cat-eared cowl and clawed, flat-soled boots. Debbi's version has a V-neck, slit to the sternum, a headband with cat-ears (concealed for the most part beneath her long, auburn hair), and heeled boots. Both costumes include razor-sharp chrome steel nails, painted bright red. "''You are my servant, and I, your master. You are the Cheetah!''" he cries, "''And you will fill the world with terror!''" Debbi has several conflicts with Wonder Woman and also serves as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains in a conflict with both the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America, before her role as the Cheetah is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence due to the history-altering after-effects of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985–1986). Debbie still exists post-''Crisis'', as referenced by a photo in Priscilla Rich's mansion inscribed to "''Aunt Priscilla, Love Debbie.''"

==Post-Crisis==
There are two post-''Crisis'' Cheetahs: Barbara Minerva and Sebastian Ballesteros, Minerva being the more prominent of the two. While the pre-''Crisis'' Cheetahs are simply women in costumes, the post-''Crisis'' Cheetahs have taken on a more mystical note, being champions of a god much as Wonder Woman is to her patrons; actually morphing into powerfully ferocious humanoid were-cheetahs with great strength, agility, and deadly claws and fangs which make them challenging opponents to Wonder Woman and other powerful heroes in battle. 

===Barbara Ann Minerva===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->

[[Image:Cheetahperez.png|thumb|Barbara Minerva as the Cheetah. Art by George Perez.]]

The third Cheetah is British archaeologist Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva. Born as the heiress of a vast fortune in the ancient family site in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Ambitious, selfish, and severely neurotic, Barbara develops a passion for archaeology that eventually led her to search out a tribe in Africa who utilizes a female guardian with the powers of a [[cheetah]]. A band of marauders kill the guardian and most of what remained of her original expedition party. Barbara, with the aid of the priest, Chuma, the caretaker of the ancient plant god Urtzkartaga, takes her place after being told that she would gain immortality. Her powers are conferred to her by ingesting a combination of human blood and the berries or leaves of Urtzkartaga. Unfortunately for Minerva, the host of the Cheetah persona is intended to be a virgin. Minerva is not, so her [[shapeshifting|transformations]] were part curse and part blessing, as she experiences severe pain and physical disability while in her human form and blood-thirsty euphoria while in her cat form.<ref name="dc-chee2">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Cheetah II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 80  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

This version of the Cheetah comes into Wonder Woman's world when Barbara discovers that Diana possesses the [[Lasso of Truth]]. As an anthropologist, Barbara covets the lasso hoping to add it to her collection of historical items. She first attempts to do so through trickery, claiming that there is a matching ancient [[Golden Girdle of Gaea]] of the same kind from which the lasso was fashioned. Unfortunately, although the scheme proceeds far enough for Minerva to hold the lasso, its magical power to make people tell the truth forces her to confess her true intentions. Diana, profoundly distraught that a woman would be so treacherous, takes back the lasso and returns home in tears. With the subtle approach having failed, Minerva resorts to attacking the Amazon as the Cheetah in order to rob her of the lasso. Their initial battle ends with inconclusive results, as Diana's friend, [[Julia Kapatelis]], shoots the Cheetah and forces her to retreat. 

Over the years, Barbara's interest in the lasso wanes and she becomes more interested in besting Diana in battle due to her bruised ego. The rivalry between the Cheetah and Wonder Woman fluctuates, though. Wonder Woman saves the Cheetah's life during an adventure in the Balkan country of Pan Balgravia.<ref>''Wonder Woman Special'' #1, and ''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 2 #63</ref> The country's dictator Baron Von Nastraed, for unknown reasons, chooses to aid a demon named Drax by capturing a powerful [[metahuman]] woman. The captive woman's body would be used to house Drax's alternate dimension bride Barremargux. When the Baron captures the Cheetah for this purpose, Wonder Woman travels to the country to save her. At the last moment, when Barremargux is about to enter [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-One]], Barbara closes the gateway before the crossing could be completed by jumping into the gateway instead. Barbara is trapped in this demonic dimension until the Boston mob boss Julianna Sazia has scientists open the dimensional gateway to retrieve Barbara to serve her own ends. Barbara double-crosses Julianna, choosing to aid Wonder Woman when she is caught in the mob war between Paulie Longo and Julianna Sazia in Boston. Seeing her debt to Wonder Woman paid for attempting to rescue her in Pan Balgravia, the Cheetah continues her quest to defeat Wonder Woman when it is convenient to her.

For a brief period of time, Minerva loses her powers to the businessman Sebastian Ballesteros (see below), who convinces Urtzkartaga that he could be a more effective Cheetah than she was. Minerva later kills Ballesteros and regains her powers.

With help from [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], Minerva attains a level of super speed even greater than she previously possessed. She accomplishes this by murdering Priscilla Rich, who previously went by the codename Cheetah.  They later join the latest [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and seem to be engaged in a sexual relationship, though Zoom considers himself to still be married to his former wife.

[[One Year Later]], the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] places a spell on Minerva that allows her to change her appearance from human to Cheetah at will, even though she still remains in her Cheetah form in either guise. She controls three actual [[cheetah]]s and still possesses her super speed, which is shown demonstrated by her ability to steal the golden lasso away from [[Donna Troy]] several times in battle.

She is later seen in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', forming a new [[Injustice League]] alongside [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. She also appears in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.

In ''[[Final Crisis]]: Resist'', she joins forces with [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] to rebel against [[Darkseid]], and enjoys a brief relationship with [[Snapper Carr]].

In the pages of ''Wonder Woman'', she is revealed as the power behind the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], responsible for the creation of [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]]. She arranges to have her ally [[Doctor Psycho]] take the place of [[Sarge Steel]] as director of the Department of Metahuman Affairs which, in the middle of Genocide's onslaught, she targets for destruction.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' v.3 #26-28</ref>

===Sebastian Ballesteros===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[Image:TheMaleCheetah.png|thumb|Sebastian Ballesteros by [[Phil Jimenez]] from ''Wonder Woman'' #171 (August 2001)]]
[[Argentina|Argentine]] business tycoon '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' becomes the fourth Cheetah, as well as the only male Cheetah. He is an agent of the Amazon's enemy, [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], as well as her lover. He seeks the plant god '''Urtzkartaga''' to become a new version of the Cheetah, a supernatural cat-creature like Barbara Ann Minerva. Appealing to the plant god's ego, Sebastian makes the case that the previous Cheetahs have failed in their actions and that a male Cheetah could be superior. Once Urtzkartaga is convinced, Barbara Minerva's access to the Cheetah is cut off and Sebastian is given the power in her place. Later, Sebastian proves responsible for turning Wonder Woman's old friend, Vanessa Kapatelis, into the third [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]]. Angered at the loss of her powers, Barbara Minerva eventually battles Bellesteros for control of the power of the Cheetah by becoming the temporary host of [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Erinyes|Eumenides]] or Furies. Minerva accesses this new power by stealing it from the Furies former host, Helena Kosmatos, the Golden Age [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]]. This does not assist her in regaining the right to become the Cheetah, however, though Minerva kills Sebastian in his human form, regaining her Cheetah form as a result. She is later seen giving his blood to the Urtzkartaga plant as a sacrifice.<ref name="dc-chee3">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Cheetah III | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 80  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

===Amazon Cheetah===
A new version of the Cheetah appears in the "Odyssey" storyline, which involves the Gods altering Diana's history so that Themyscyra was destroyed when she was a child. The new Cheetah is created from the corpse of a murdered Amazon after it is lowered into a mystical restoration pit and infused with the spirit of Magaera by the Morrigan (the villains who are hunting Wonder Woman). Alongside new versions of [[Artemis (DC Comics)|Artemis]] and [[Giganta]] (both of whom are also created from dead Amazons), the new Cheetah is tasked with hunting down and killing Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #606</ref> After tracking down the safehouse where Diana lives with the last surviving residents of Themyscyra, Cheetah brutally ambushes and slays a young Amazon as she steps outside. Cheetah is then shown carrying the woman's body away from the scene, muttering about how she too will be reborn soon.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #607</ref>

==Other versions==
===Wednesday Comics===
A modernized version of Priscilla Rich appears as one of the primary antagonists of the Wonder Woman feature in ''[[Wednesday Comics]]''. Here, she is portrayed as a young archeologist from a wealthy Baltimore family, who relies on enchanted artifacts to grant her superhuman abilities. She initially befriends a young Diana, (before she has become Wonder Woman), after meeting her, but soon reveals her treacherous nature when she kidnaps Diana's friend [[Etta Candy|Etta]] and uses her as bait for a trap set by [[Doctor Poison]]. In the end, both Priscilla and Poison are defeated by Wonder Woman.

===''Justice''===
The Priscilla Rich version of the Cheetah appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]] in [[Alex Ross (comic illustrator)|Alex Ross]]' ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series. Here, she is shown to have fashioned her costume from the fur of her pet cheetahs, which she violently killed and skinned in an ancient ritual (likely reminiscent of the Barbara Ann Minerva version).

===''DC: The New Frontier''===
An alternate version of Cheetah briefly appears in the final issue of ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]''. She's likely the Priscilla Rich version.

===''Wonder Woman: The Blue Amazon''===
Another alternate version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Wonder Woman: The Blue Amazon]]''.

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Cheetah joined with [[Wonder Woman]]'s [[Female Furies|Furies]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> After the Furies attack [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] and the Resistance, Cheetah is eaten by [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Priscilla Rich version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' and was voiced by [[Marlene Aragon]]. In one of the Cheetah's most memeorable episodes, "The Secret Origins of the Super Friends", the Legion of Doom travel into the past to eliminate Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman before they can become heroes. The villains arrive at Paradise Island, moments before Princess Diana will compete in the Tournament she will win to become Wonder Woman. The Cheetah disguises herself as an amazon to compete in the games and stop Diana. As the tournament ends, only Diana and the Cheetah remain in contention and meet each other in a battle of stun rays to crown a winner. To assist her, the Cheetah uses "radar controlled" bracelets to deflect Diana's laser rays back at her, stunning the Amazon Princess. The Cheetah is hailed as the winner and is presented with the uniform and weapons of Wonder Woman. The blonde villainess, now wearing the uniform of the amazon champion, gloats in her victory, "I've done it!  Now I am Wonder Woman!" The Cheetah's victory causes Diana to be removed from the future timeline, thus eliminating Wonder Woman. However the Legion of Doom's triumph is short lived. The remaining Super Friends uncover the scheme and travel back in time to undo the damage. The Flash arrives at Paradise Island and uses his super-speed to deflect the rays meant to hit Diana and back at the Cheetah, stunning her. Diana is named the winner and goes onto become Wonder Woman.

[[Image:Cheetahdctas.png|85px|left|Cheetah, as she appeares in the Justice League's animated series.|thumb]]
* In the [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]],'' there is a new Cheetah, voiced by actress [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]. This version of Cheetah was once a scientist who was involved in valuable genetic research. However, she explains that her funding was running out, and she was unable to perform proper experiments. In a last ditch effort to prove the value of her research, she [[self-experimentation|tested her theories on herself]]. The result was a mutation into a half-human-half-cat hybrid. She was shunned by the scientific community for her recklessness and ostracized by humanity as a freak. With no alternatives, she turned to crime to fund further research to undo the change. Her first appearance is in the episode "''Injustice for All''" as a member of the [[Injustice Gang]]. She joins [[Lex Luthor]]'s Injustice Gang for the same reason she became a criminal in the first place: money - but unlike the others, she has little criminal intent, and merely wants to be normal again. When the Injustice Gang succeeds in capturing [[Batman]], he realizes that Cheetah is not like the others and offers her a way out, in exchange for helping him topple Lex Luthor. However, Cheetah hesitates to take up Batman's offer, and instead, [[Ultra-Humanite|another disgruntled member]] betrays them. When Luthor realizes they have a traitor in their midst, he points the blame toward Cheetah, thanks to a clip from a security camera showing her and Batman kissing. She is defeated by [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], and then taken away by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], where he supposedly kills her by petting her to death — a reference to Lennie in ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/cheetah/cheetah.htm |title=Cheetah |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> Cheetah's first appearance was also supposed to be her last. Producer [[Bruce Timm]] intended for Cheetah to die, while James Tucker wanted to bring the sympathetic character back.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Cheetah was saved by the most unusual of saviors....an animation error. At the end of the episode, she appears alive and well in the back of the [[paddy wagon]] with the other members of the Injustice Gang. Once the producers saw the error, they decided it was easier to say she was not killed, though they still have not stated how she gets away from Grundy.

[[Image:Kids' Stuff.jpg|thumb|The Cheetah grapples with [[Wonder Woman]] in a shot from WB Animation's series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']] 
* [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] reprises her role as Cheetah in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. She makes minor appearances in the series after this, and is only heard speaking again in "''Kid Stuff''". Cheetah joins [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] in the 2005–06 season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', though she remains a minor character. Despite the original intent of the producers to have her killed in her first appearance,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Cheetah actually ends up as one of the few Legion members to survive the resurrection of [[Darkseid]] in the series finale.
{{-}}

* The Priscilla Rich version of Cheetah appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Triumvirate of Terror" voiced by [[Morena Baccarin]]. She collaborates with Lex Luthor and Joker in order to come up with a plan to defeat Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. She easily beats Superman with martial arts, Kryptonite and the magic amulet of Orzchartaga which channels the full power of her namesake. She is later defeated by Superman who freezes her with his super breath leaving her vulnerable to Wonder Woman and Batman's finishing blows.

===Film===
* Cheetah appears in ''[[Wonder Woman (film)|Wonder Woman]]''. She is seen near the end where she steals an artifact from a museum and attacks the police.
