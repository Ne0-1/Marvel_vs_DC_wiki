'''The Cheetah''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Wonder Woman]] stories published by [[DC Comics]].

===Priscilla Rich===
In the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of the character, the Cheetah was a human woman who wore a [[cheetah]] pelt-patterned [[catsuit]].  The first woman to wear the costume, in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 (October 1943), was '''Priscilla Rich''', a [[1940s]]-era [[Washington, D.C.]] blonde debutante who suffered from a split personality.  After being eclipsed by Wonder Woman at a charity event, Priscilla retreated to her room and collapsed before her makeup mirror.  There she saw an image of a woman dressed like a cheetah.  ''"Horrors!"'' she cried, as she gazed at her evil inner self for the first time.  ''"Don't you know me?"'' replied the reflection.  ''"I am the REAL you &mdash; the Cheetah &mdash; a treacherous, relentless huntress!"''  The image commanded her to fashion a Cheetah costume.  ''"From now on'', intoned the reflection, ''"when I command you, you shall go forth dressed like your TRUE self and do as I command you..."''

Priscilla had several run-ins with Wonder Woman before retiring to her North Shore [[Maryland]] mansion.  In ''Wonder Woman'' # 274 (Dec. 1980), the villain [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] attempted to recruit the villainess for his organization.  His operative found the reclusive Priscilla an invalid.

However, Priscilla's niece '''Deborah Domaine''' had come at her bidding and the operative stayed to observe.  Before Priscilla could unburden her alter ego as the Cheetah, she died.  The operative returned Deborah and the Cheetah costume to Kobra's headquarters, where he questioned her ''"You didn't know about your aunt's secret life, did you?  Well, you'll learn &mdash; Since we couldn't have the original, we decided to make do with a recreation.  You shall be that recreation, Ms. Domaine."''

Kobra brainwashed Debbie and provided her with an updated version of the Cheetah costume.  The original suit included a cat-eared cowl and clawed, flat-soled boots.  Debbie's version had an V-neck, slit to the sternum, a headband with cat-ears (concealed for the most part beneath her long, brown hair), and four-inch heeled boots.  Both costumes included razor-sharp chrome steel nails, painted bright red.  ''"You are my servant, and I, your master.  You are the Cheetah!"'' he cried, ''"And you will fill the world with terror!" '' Debbie also had several conflicts with Wonder Woman, before being retconned out of existence due to the history-altering after effects of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985-1986).

==Post-Crisis==

===Barbara Ann Minerva===
The third Cheetah is anthropologist '''Barbara Ann Minerva'''.  She had searched out a tribe in Africa who utilized a female guardian with the powers of a cheetah. Her powers were confered to her by injesting a combination of human blood (her own in most cases) and the berries or leaves of the ancient plant god, Urzkartaga.  A band of marauders killed the guardian and most of what remained of her original expedition party, then Barbara, with the aid of the priest, Chuma, the caretaker of Urtzkartaga, took her place.  Instead of a costumed woman, this Cheetah is a cat-human hybrid with her own pelt, tail, pointed ears, and fang-like canines.

===Sebastian Ballesteros===
Afterwards, Argentinian business tycoon, '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' became the fourth Cheetah, as well as the first male Cheetah. He was an agent of the amazon's enemy, Circe, and sought Urzkartaga to become Cheetah, a supernatural cat-creature like Barbara. He was also responsible of turning Wonder Woman's old friend, Vanessa Kapatelis into the second [[Silver Swan]]. Barbara eventually battled Bellesteros for control of the power of the Cheetah by becoming the temporary host of [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Eumenides]] or Furies, who had recently been expelled from her former host, Helena Kosmatos, the Golden Age [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]]. This did not assist her in regaining the right to be the Cheetah, however, though Minerva was later able to kill Sebastian in his human form, regaining her Cheetah form as a result. She was later seen giving his blood to the Urzkartaga plant as a sacrifice.

==Other Media==
The Priscilla Rich version of Cheetah Debbie appears in ''[[Super Friends]],'' and was voiced by [[Marlene Aragon]].

In the [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]],'' there is a new Cheetah voiced by [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]; the producers say she is Dr. Minerva, but she has a different form and origin. Dr. Minerva used to be a biologist, who was doing valuable genetics research; but her funding was running out, and was unable to perform proper experiments. In a last ditch effort to prove the value of her research, she [[self-experimentation|tested her theories on herself]]; the result was a mutation into a half-human-half-cat hybrid. She was shunned by the scientific community for her recklessness, and ostracized by humanity as a freak; with no alternatives, she turned to crime to fund further research to undo the change.

Her first appearance was in the episode ''Injustice for All'' as a member of the ''[[Injustice Gang]]'', and it was supposed to be her last; as producer [[Bruce Timm]] intended for Cheetah to die a tragic death. She joins [[Lex Luthor]]'s Injustice Gang for the same reason she became a criminal in the first place: money; but unlike the others, she has the least criminal intent, and just wants to be normal again. When the Injustice Gang succeeds in capturing Batman, he realizes that Cheetah isn't like the others, and offers her a way out, in exchange for helping him topple Lex Luthor. However, Cheetah hesitates to take up Batman's offer; instead, another disgruntled member sells them out. When Luthor realizes they have a traitor in their midst, he fingers Cheetah, thanks to an embarrassing clip from a security camera. When she is subdued by [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] takes her away, where he supposedly kills her by petting her to death—a reference to Lennie in ''[[Of Mice and Men]].''

Because she was killed in a typical [[comic book death]]—namely being dragged off screen to be executed—some assumed that Cheetah wasn't dead and might come back, and the producers of the show argued the point; [[James Tucker]] wanted to bring the sympathetic character back, while Bruce Timm insisted that she was an "ex-Cheetah". Cheetah was saved by the most unusual of saviors: an animation error. At the end of the episode, she appears alive and well in the back of the [[paddy wagon]] with the other members; once the producers saw the error, they decided it was easier to say she wasn't killed, but still haven't said how she got away from Grundy. Despite being alive and well, Cheetah has made only minor appearances in the series after this; she is also a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in the 2005-06 season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]],'' though her exact position in the legion is unknown.

The third comic book version of Cheetah (Barbara Ann Minerva) also appears in the [[Justice League Task Force]] video game as a playable character for the [[SNES]].
