'''The Cheetah''' is a [[fictional character]], a super-villainess appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media. Commonly regarded as the archenemy of [[Wonder Woman]], the Cheetah first appeared in 1943 in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 (volume 1), written by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]].  Since then the character has undergone several updates as comic book continuities have evolved and shifted.  Indeed, there have been four different Cheetahs since the character's premiere, including Priscilla Rich (the Golden Age Cheetah), Deborah Domaine (the Silver Age Cheetah), Barbara Ann Minerva (the modern age and current Cheetah), and Sebastian Ballesteros (a male usurper who briefly assumed the role in 2001).  

==Golden Age & Silver Age Comics History==

Prior to the 12-issue DC Comics series [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] in 1985 (which is regarded as the starting point for DC's modern continuity), there were two women who donned spotted cat costumes to fight Wonder Woman as the Cheetah: socialite Priscilla Rich and later, her niece Deborah Domaine.  While modern encarnations of the Cheetah would possess superhuman powers, Rich and Domaine did not.

The first woman to become the Cheetah, in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 (October 1943), was '''Priscilla Rich''', a [[1940s]]-era [[Washington, D.C.]] blonde debutante who suffered from a split personality. After being eclipsed by Wonder Woman at a charity event, Priscilla retreated to her room and collapsed before her makeup mirror. There she saw an image of a woman dressed like a cheetah. ''"Horrors!"'' she cried, as she gazed at her evil inner self for the first time. ''"Don't you know me?"'' replied the reflection. ''"I am the REAL you &mdash; the Cheetah &mdash; a treacherous, relentless huntress!"'' The image commanded her to fashion a Cheetah costume. ''"From now on'', intoned the reflection, ''"when I command you, you shall go forth dressed like your TRUE self and do as I command you..."''

Priscilla was a member of [[Villainy Inc.]], a criminal association between several of Wonder Woman's female foes. 

Priscilla had several run-ins with Wonder Woman before retiring to her North Shore [[Maryland]] mansion. In ''Wonder Woman'' #274 (Dec. 1980), the villain [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] attempted to recruit the villainess for his organization. His operative found the reclusive Priscilla an invalid. Priscilla's niece '''Deborah Domaine''' had come at her bidding and the operative stayed to observe. Before Priscilla could unburden her alter ego as the Cheetah, she died.

====Modern Age Comics History====
The original Cheetah, Priscilla Rich, was established as still existing post-Crisis when [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] became the Golden Age Wonder Woman. In the present, she was seen as an elderly woman when she was murdered by Barbara Minerva (the Modern Age Cheetah; see below). It was also established that she had never become an invalid Post-Crisis, as Minerva mentioned how Priscilla had written books condemning her when she became the Cheetah. 

In the first two issues of the non-continuity ''[[Super Friends]]'' comic book series, Priscilla teamed with a group of other villains ([[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Toyman]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Human Flying Fish]]) to mentor junior criminals. Priscilla's partner was a teenage girl going by the name Kitten. 

Recently in the pages of DC Comics' ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' series, Priscilla Rich once again battles Wonder Woman in her guise as The Cheetah.  This series, however, doesn't reflect what is happening in modern DC continuity.  The conflict between the Cheetah and Wonder Woman, though updated, harkens back to the Golden Age in its presentation.

===Deborah Domaine===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->

After Priscilla Rich died, Kobra's operative returned Deborah and the Cheetah costume to Kobra's headquarters, where he questioned her ''"You didn't know about your aunt's secret life, did you? Well, you'll learn &mdash; Since we couldn't have the original, we decided to make do with a recreation. You shall be that recreation, Ms. Domaine."''

Kobra brainwashed Debbi and provided her with an updated version of the Cheetah costume. The original suit included a cat-eared cowl and clawed, flat-soled boots. Debbi's version had an V-neck, slit to the sternum, a headband with cat-ears (concealed for the most part beneath her long, brown hair), and four-inch heeled boots. Both costumes included razor-sharp chrome steel nails, painted bright red. ''"You are my servant, and I, your master. You are the Cheetah!"'' he cried, ''"And you will fill the world with terror!" '' Debbi also had several conflicts with Wonder Woman and also served as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains in a conflict with both the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America, before her role as the Cheetah was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence due to the history-altering after effects of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985â€“1986).  Debbie herself still exists post-Crisis, as referenced by a photo in Priscilla Rich's mansion inscribed to "Aunt Priscilla, Love Debbie."

==Post-Crisis==
There have been two post-Crisis Cheetahs; '''Barbara Minerva''' and '''Sebastian Ballesteros''', Minerva being the more prominent of the two. While the Pre-Crisis Cheetahs were simply women in costumes, the Post-Crisis Cheetahs have taken on a more mystical note; actually morphing into powerfully ferocious cat-human hybrids with their own pelts, tail, pointed ears, and fang-like canines which have made them challenging opponents to Wonder Woman in battle. 

===Barbara Ann Minerva===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[Image:Cheetah.PNG|thumb|Barbara Minerva by Justiniano]]

The third Cheetah is British anthropologist '''Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva'''.  She had searched out a tribe in Africa who utilized a female guardian with the powers of a [[cheetah]]. A band of marauders killed the guardian and most of what remained of her original expedition party. Then Barbara, with the aid of the priest, Chuma, the caretaker of the ancient plant god Urtzkartaga, took her place after being told that she would gain immortality.  Her powers were conferred to her by ingesting a combination of human blood and the berries or leaves of Urzkartaga.  Unfortunately for Minerva, the host of the Cheetah persona was supposed to be a virgin. Minerva was not, so her [[shapeshifting|transformations]] were part curse and part blessing as she experienced severe pain while in her human form and blood-thirsty euphoria while in her cat form.

This version of The Cheetah came into Wonder Woman's world when Barbara discovered that Diana possessed the [[Lasso of Truth]]. As an anthropologist Barbara came to covet the lasso in the hopes to add it to her collection of historical items. She first attempted to do so through trickery claiming that there was a matching ancient [[Golden Girdle of Gaea]] of the same kind from which the lasso was fashioned.  Unfortunately, although the scheme proceeded far enough for Minerva to hold the lasso, its magical power to make people to tell the truth forced her to confess her true intentions.  Diana, profoundly distraught that a fellow woman would be so treacherous, took back the lasso and returned home in tears.  With the subtle approach having failed, Minerva later resorted to attacking the Amazon as the Cheetah to rob her of the lasso and their initial battle ensued. 

Over the years Barbara's interest in the lasso waned and she became more interested in besting Diana in battle due to her bruised ego. The two's rivalry has fluctuated at times, though. Wonder Woman saved the Cheetah's life during an adventure in the country of Muldavia, and Barbara aided Wonder Woman when she became caught in the mob war between Paulie Longo and Julianna Sazia in Boston. Seeing her debt paid, The Cheetah has continued in her quest to defeat Wonder Woman at all costs which included selling her soul to the demon [[Neron]] as explained during the [[John Byrne]] era of the comic.

For a brief period of time, Minerva lost her powers to the businessman Sebastian Ballesteros (see below), who had convinced Urtzkartaga that he could be a more effective Cheetah than she was.  Minerva later killed Ballesteros and regained her powers.

With help from [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], Minerva attained a level of super-speed that she previously had not possessed. She accomplished this by murdering Priscilla Rich, who previously went by the codename Cheetah.  They later joined the latest [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and they seemed to be engaged in a sexual relationship, even though Zoom considers himself to still be married to his former wife.

[[One Year Later]], the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] placed a spell on Minerva that allows her to change her appearance from human to Cheetah at will, even though she still remains in her Cheetah form through either guise. She possessed control of three actual [[Cheetah]]s and still possessed her super-speed, which was shown by her being able to steal the golden lasso away from [[Donna Troy]] several times in battle.

She is later seen in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', forming a new [[Injustice League]] alongside [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]].

===Sebastian Ballesteros===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
[[Image:TheMaleCheetah.png|thumb|Sebastian Ballesteros by [[Phil Jimenez]]]]
[[Argentina|Argentine]] business tycoon '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' became the fourth Cheetah, as well as the first male Cheetah. He was an agent of the Amazon's enemy, [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], as well as her lover. He sought the plant god [[Urzkartaga]] to become a new version of The Cheetah, a supernatural cat-creature like Barbara Ann Minerva. Appealing to the plant god's ego, Sebastian made the case that the previous Cheetahs had failed in their actions and that a male Cheetah could be superior. Once Urzkartaga was convinced, Barbara Minerva's access to The Cheetah was cut off and Sebastian was given the power in her place. Later, Sebastian also proved responsible for turning Wonder Woman's old friend Vanessa Kapatelis into the second [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]]. Angered at the loss of her powers, Barbara Minerva eventually battled Bellesteros for control of the power of The Cheetah by becoming the temporary host of [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Eumenides]] or Furies. Much like herself, Minerva accessed this new power by stealing it from the Furies former host, Helena Kosmatos, the Golden Age [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]]. This did not assist her in regaining the right to be The Cheetah, however, though Minerva was later able to kill Sebastian in his human form, regaining her Cheetah form as a result. She was later seen giving his blood to the Urzkartaga plant as a sacrifice.

===''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''===
[[Image:Cheetahdctas.jpg|85px|left|Cheetah, as she appeared in the Justice League's animated series.|thumb]]
In the [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]],'' there is a new Cheetah voiced by [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]. The producers have said she is Dr. Minerva, but she has a different form and origin. This Dr. Minerva was once a biologist who was doing valuable genetics research, but her funding was running out, and was unable to perform proper experiments. In a last ditch effort to prove the value of her research, she [[self-experimentation|tested her theories on herself]]. The result was a mutation into a half-human-half-cat hybrid. She was shunned by the scientific community for her recklessness and ostracized by humanity as a freak. With no alternatives, she turned to crime to fund further research to undo the change.

Her first appearance was in the episode "Injustice for All" as a member of the [[Injustice Gang]], and it was supposed to be her last; producer [[Bruce Timm]] intended for Cheetah to die a tragic death. She joins [[Lex Luthor]]'s Injustice Gang for the same reason she became a criminal in the first place: money - but unlike the others, she has little criminal intent, and merely wants to be normal again. When the Injustice Gang succeeds in capturing [[Batman]], he realizes that Cheetah isn't like the others, and offers her a way out, in exchange for helping him topple Lex Luthor. However, Cheetah hesitates to take up Batman's offer. Instead, another disgruntled member betrays them. When Luthor realizes they have a traitor in their midst, he fingers Cheetah, thanks to an embarrassing clip from a security camera showing her and Batman kissing. She is subdued by [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and then [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] takes her away, where he supposedly kills her by petting her to death â€” a reference to Lennie in ''[[Of Mice and Men]].'' [http://jl.toonzone.net/cheetah/cheetah.htm]

[[Image:Ww vs c.jpg|thumb|The Cheetah grapples with [[Wonder Woman]] in a shot from WB Animation's series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]Because she was killed in a typical [[comic book death]] â€” namely being dragged off screen to be executed â€” some assumed that Cheetah was not really dead and might come back. The series producers argued the point; James Tucker wanted to bring the sympathetic character back, while Bruce Timm insisted that she was an "ex-Cheetah." Cheetah was saved by the most unusual of saviors: an animation error. At the end of the episode, she appears alive and well in the back of the [[paddy wagon]] with the other members; once the producers saw the error, they decided it was easier to say she wasn't killed, but still haven't said how she got away from Grundy. Cheetah has made only minor appearances in the series after this, and spoke in only one other episode.

Cheetah joins [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] in the 2005â€“06 season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', though she remains a minor character. Despite the original intent of the producers to have her killed in her first appearance, Cheetah is one of the few Legion members to survive the resurrection of [[Darkseid]] in the series finale.
