'''B'wana Beast''' is the name of a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Universe]].  

In his most well-known incarnation, his given name is Mike Maxwell.  Maxwell possesses a helmet and elixir which confer on him his powers.  These powers are mind control and the ability to fuse together two living animals to make one powerful entity under B'wana Beast's control.

In ''[[Animal Man]]'' #14, written by [[Grant Morrison]], Maxwell performs a ceremony to find a successor, and passes the helmet and elixir on to a South African named Dominic, who assumes the name [[Freedom Beast]].

===Other Media===
B'wana beast was recently seen in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' cartoon (voiced by [[Peter Onorati]]) with the Justice League in search of [[Wonder Woman]] who had been turned into a pig by Circe.
