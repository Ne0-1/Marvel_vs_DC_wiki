'''B'wana Beast''' is the name of a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #66 (January 1967), and was created by [[Bob Haney]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]]. 

==Character history==
In his most well-known incarnation, his given name is '''Mike Maxwell'''. Maxwell possesses a helmet and elixir which confer on him his powers. These powers are mind control and the ability to fuse together two living animals to make one powerful entity under B'wana Beast's control.

With the help of his gorilla companion, '''Djuba''', in a secret hideout at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, ranger '''Mike Maxwell''' drinks the aforementioned elixir and dons the helmet to become B'wana Beast. In the origin issue, he fights '''Hamid Ali''', "He Who Never Dies."

In ''[[Animal Man]]'' #13 (July 1989), written by [[Grant Morrison]], Maxwell performs a ceremony to find a successor, and passes the helmet and elixir on to a South African named Dominic Mndawe, who assumes the more politically correct name [[Freedom Beast]].

Mike Maxwell returns in ''Animal Man'' #47 (May 1992), corrupted and possessed by the destructive force called ''the Antagon'' and transformed into the evil ''Shining Man''. In the ensuing battle, Maxwell is killed.

B'wana Beast was featured in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "This Little Piggy" (voiced by [[Peter Onorati]]). He was recruited by [[Batman]] for his superior tracking skills in the search for [[Wonder Woman]], who had been mystically transformed into a pig by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]]. In this incarnation, B'wana Beast was given a thick New York accent and blue collar personality to match.
