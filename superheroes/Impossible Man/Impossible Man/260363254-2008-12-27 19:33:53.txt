'''The Impossible Man''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a mischievous [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] that has appeared in various [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Usually an [[Antagonist (literature)‎ |antagonist]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], the character exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #11 (Feb, 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. He is described as a Poppupian, an alien race with a name analogous to popping up.

==Fictional character biography==
The Impossible Man belongs to the alien race of [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#P|Poppupians]], all of whom share a [[collective consciousness]] and the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]], assuming some of the useful attributes of the new form when they do ('The People of Poppup have no names. We '''Know''' who we are!'). He was born in Poppupoopu on the planet Poppup. The Impossible Man has green skin, an elongated egg-shaped oblong head, and wears a strange purple outfit.  He is a highly mischievous and meddlesome character with staggering powers.  The Impossible Man is a prankster and hedonist.

The Poppupians are connected into a large group mind. The Impossible Man has a small mental variation that allows him to think for himself. He becomes disenchanted with his world and forms himself into a spacecraft and leaves. He soon arrives on Earth. There he amuses himself by causing trouble among the normal humans with his ability to transform. The Fantastic Four eventually use the tactic of ignoring him and getting others to do the same, which convinces him that Earth is boring and causes him to return to his home planet.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #11</ref>

When the world-eating [[Galactus]] threatens to consume other worlds, the Poppupians have the Impossible Man lead Galactus to their own world and devour it, in an effort to relieve them of their boredom.  The Impossible Man himself survives, and the Poppupians' collective consciousness lives on through him.  After his own world is destroyed, he returns to Earth with the Fantastic Four. He visits the Marvel Comics offices, and becomes a fan and student of Earth's popular culture. He also becomes peripherally involved in battles between the Fantastic Four and various foes.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #179, 181-188</ref>

He later aides the Fantastic Four by impersonating President Jimmy Carter.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #27</ref> He also visits Hollywood with the [[Invisible Woman]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #193-195</ref> He then helps the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] defeat the [[Terrible Trio (Marvel Comics)|Terrible Trio]].  However, after now having spent some time on Earth, loneliness due to a lack of his own kind impells him to reproduce, a process done asexually by splitting in two.  The result is the Impossible Woman, his mate. <ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #60</ref> Later, in an attempt to recreate the Poppupian race, the Impossible Man and Impossible Woman create their cloned Impossible Kids, and the whole "family" visits the Thing. <ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #86</ref> The Impossible Woman later go missing, and he hires [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]] to locate her.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #45</ref>

The Impossible Man eventually returns to earth alone to cause trouble again.  He says that he has left his family behind because they have developed minds unlike his own, and to determine leadership a scavenger hunt is devised, involving taking many powerful artifacts from earth's heroes. Foiled by the [[X-Men]] and other heroes, he leaves earth, after failing the test.<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #7</ref> He returns several times over the years, encountering the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], the [[New Mutants]], the [[Silver Surfer]], and even [[Stan Lee]]. During his time with the New Mutants, his rivalry with the shape-shifting Warlock threatens the entire world. He eventually gives up their 'one-upmanship' game when Warlock proves he can do what the Impossible Man can not, namely change color.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #3</ref>

He appears during the [[Cross-Time Caper]] which features the dimensionally lost [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. There the Impossible Man populates a mixed-up alternative Earth for his own amusement.  He confronts Galactus, who wishes to consume this silly version of the Marvel Universe. After Galactus destroys the planet, he admonishes the Impossible Man to behave. He does not, recreating the silliness as soon as Galactus had left.<ref>''Excalibur'' #14</ref>

The Impossible Man then encounters the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #33</ref> He then resolves to help the Silver Surfer achieve a sense of humor.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #36</ref>

Later, the Impossible Man returns to Earth with his family on vacation.  While there, he encounters [[Spider-Man]], [[Doctor Strange]], and the [[Punisher]]. He ultimately departs Earth to visit the [[Skrull]] Empress [[S'Byll]].<ref>''Impossible Man Summer Vacation Spectacular'' #1</ref> He later returns to Earth in search of his missing offspring. <ref>''Impossible Man Summer Vacation'' #2</ref>

He even harasses [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] at his [[bachelor party]] with the men of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #417-418</ref> He is also responsible for sending fake wedding invites to many entities that Rick Jones knows, most of whom he does not actually want at his wedding. Fortunately, diplomacy (mostly) wins the day at that incident.

In Marvel's humorous out-of-continuity series ''Wha... Huh?'', Marvel creates a satire of DC Comics' '[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]', in which the Impossible Man murders the Thing's Aunt Petunia. 

In the ''Cable X-Force'' one-shot, three of his children have become 'slackers', poorly dressed, obnoxious teenage types, with no interests but their own self-fulfillment. The Impossible Man interrupts [[X-Force]]'s vacation, in order to get their help in changing his children's attitudes. The menace of a separate monster, coincidentally purple and green, finally spurs the children into an attitude change.

Impossible Man returns in the ''[[Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four]]'' limited series, wherein he arrives on Earth disguised as the Silver Surfer. After some mischief-making at [[Spider-Man]]'s expense, Impy reveals that he had come to warn the Fantastic Four of an impending invasion of Earth by the H'mojen alien force. The unlikely duo make their way to [[Central Park]] to stop the invasion force, but the villainous Imperator blasts them with repulsor rays, increasing their magnitude until the Impossible Man is a cloud of vapor. Later on, it is revealed that when his body is destroyed, he implants his essence into Spider-Man's body until he can regain his strength. The end of the third issue of the series has Spider-Man vomiting up a purple puddle, a cloud of steam rising from it bearing the Impossible Man's face. The collective consciousness of the Poppupian race, stored inside Impy when their planet is destroyed, reconstitute themselves from this puddle, as a gigantic blob with many mouths. They attempt to destroy the H'mojen and populate the earth, but the Fantastic Four relocate both to an inhabited planet, where the two species merge into one, becoming docile. The final panel of the mini-series shows a cat coughing up a green glob, which then turns into Impossible Man, who proclaims "Never the End!"

==Powers and abilities==
The Impossible Man's alien physiology gives him the ability to take on virtually any form by rearranging his molecules, or to shapeshift (giving a "pop" sound while doing so). Changing into specific forms sometimes grants him their inherent abillities. He can even shape-shift into mechanical and electronic devices with moving internal parts. This allows him to assume a form with superhuman strength, or other forms, such as space ships, to travel through space at [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]] speed. The Impossible Man is potentially very powerful, as implied in the aforementioned inter-company crossover. His benevolent (though mischievous) personality precludes deliberate violence on his part, although he seems to keep forgetting that other non-Poppupian beings can be harmed by things like physical impact or fire.

The powers of his alien race are defined as "instant evolution," being able to adapt to whatever suits their needs for a particular situation. In his regular form, he can levitate and survive the vacuum of space. He is superhumanly durable. He can go without food or water or oxygen for months by entering a state of hibernation.

Much like DC's [[Plastic Man]], his only limitation is that he keeps his original color motif (purple and green) at all times. That weakness plays a role in resolving a childish rivalry with the shapeshifting being [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]]. The [[New Mutants]] suggests that their teammate simply demonstrate he can change his colors.  Having been shown up, the Impossible Man is reduced to tears and irritates the team for the rest of the day.

The Impossible Man has an encyclopedic knowledge of Earth's popular culture.
