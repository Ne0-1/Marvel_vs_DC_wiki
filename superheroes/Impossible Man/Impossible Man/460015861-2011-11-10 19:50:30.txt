==Fictional character biography==
=== 1960s ===
When the Impossible Man first appeared,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #11 (Feb. 1963)</ref> the character differed from previous guest stars in that he was not a villain. The team first meet him at the Flamingo restaurant when they are summoned there to investigate a disturbance.  Written by Lee to be a [[prank]]ster and [[hedonist]], the Impossible Man claimed to belong to the alien race of [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#P|Poppupians]] from planet Poppup in the 'Tenth Galaxy', who all share a [[collective consciousness]] and the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]], as their planet is so dangerous they have the ability to evolve very quickly. Seeking amusement, the character visits Earth for a vacation by turning himself into a spaceship, talking of a Poppup Tourist Bureau. After finding the [[superhero]] team the Fantastic Four and realizing nobody else on Earth has his power (therefore concluding he is the most powerful being on Earth), he constantly harasses them until they decide to ignore him and tell other people to do the same, forcing the Impossible Man to leave as he finds Earth so boring, and saying Earth will never get their tourist business. He gets his name after the Thing claims he is "impossible".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #11 (Feb. 1963), page 18</ref>

=== 1970s ===

Impossible Man returns to Earth where he witnesses a battle between [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], and [[Xemnu]]. Impossible Man uses his magic to combine Hulk and Red Hulk into the Compound Hulk. Impossible Man watches as the Compound Hulk fights Xemnu's minion Kluh (a smart version of the Gray Hulk).<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 2 #30</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Impossible Man's alien physiology gives the character the ability to take on virtually any form via molecular rearrangement. Almost every appearance has featured the Impossible Man mimicking another Marvel character's appearance and their abilities, such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref name="Fantastic Four' 1977"/> Klaw,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #187 (Oct. 1976)</ref> and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Apr. 1990)</ref> He also has the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] across vast interstellar distances and even dimensions, an effect commonly accompanied by a "Pop!" [[sound effect]].

The Impossible Man once battled the [[New Mutants]]' [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] to determine whose shape-shifting ability was superior, a contest Warlock won when he showed he was able to change his colors to match those the forms he mimics, while the Impossible Man could not.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #3</ref>  This was not the case when he first appeared, however; for instance, when impersonating the Invisible Girl in order to trick Galactus into consuming Poppup, he was fully capable of changing color to make his disguise perfect.<ref name=FF175/>

The Impossible Man has an encyclopedic knowledge of Earth's popular culture.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In this dark reality, the most well known Poppupian is the Ambassador from the Planet Poppup who arrived on Earth and made the mistake a lot of aliens do. He asked to be taken to their leader instead of getting back on his ship and turning around. Things didn't go too well for him as he became a favored pet project of the [[Dark Beast|Beast]] after he discovered that every DNA strand of this race was identical to every other. He belonged to a species where the genetic potential of the entire race was linked to every member. Like an amoeba, he planned to split the Poppupian tens of thousands of times to reproduce an army of these Impossible Men over and over again. The poor, tortured soul was discovered by [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] who took pity on the Poppupian who begged to have his life ended. She teleported him blindly into nothingness assured that no matter where he went, it was some place better than where he was.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}
