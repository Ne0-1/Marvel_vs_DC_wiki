==Fictional character biography==

=== 1960s ===
When the Impossible Man first appeared,<ref>{{cite comic|title=Fantastic Four |issue=11 |date=February 1963}}</ref> he was different from previous guest stars in that he was not a villain. The team first meet him at the Flamingo restaurant when they are summoned there to investigate a disturbance.  Written by Lee to be a [[prank]]ster and [[hedonist]], the Impossible Man claimed to belong to the alien race of [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#P|Poppupians]] from planet Poppup in the "Tenth Galaxy", who all share a [[collective consciousness]] and the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]], as their planet is so dangerous they have the ability to evolve very quickly. Seeking amusement, the character visits Earth for a vacation by turning himself into a spaceship, talking of a Poppup Tourist Bureau. After finding the [[superhero]] team the Fantastic Four and realizing nobody else on Earth has his power (therefore concluding he is the most powerful being on Earth), he constantly harasses them until they decide to ignore him and tell other people to do the same, forcing the Impossible Man to leave as he finds Earth so boring, and saying Earth will never get their tourist business. He gets his name after the Thing claims he is "impossible".<ref>{{cite comic|title=Fantastic Four |issue=11 |date=February 1963 |page=18}}</ref>

=== 1970s ===
The character does not appear again until 1976. Acting as a ''[[deus ex machina]]'' in a storyline involving the cosmic entity and world-devourer [[Galactus]], the Impossible Man convinces the character to consume his homeworld Poppup instead of Earth, causing Galactus to seemingly perish from 'cosmic indigestion'. Since the Poppupians were a shared consciousness they were happy to sacrifice their planet to stop Galactus, knowing that their culture would live on in the embodiment of its most adventurous member.<ref name=FF175>''Fantastic Four'' #175 (Oct. 1976)</ref> The Impossible Man then makes a humorous appearance at the offices of Marvel Comics, where he causes havoc until Stan Lee promises to give him his own title.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #176 (Nov. 1976)</ref>

The character then decides to [[reproduction|reproduce]] - here an [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] process - by splitting in two.  This creates fellow Poppupian the '''Impossible Woman'''.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #60 (Feb. 1980)</ref> The pair later attempt to recreate their race and create the ''Impossible Kids'', with the entire "family" visiting the Thing.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #86</ref> When the Impossible Woman is missing, the character hires [[private investigator]] [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]] to locate her,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #45 (Aug. 1982)</ref> and has an encounter with the mutant [[X-Men]] after stealing artifacts from Earth to settle a supposed ''family dispute'' with the other members of his race.<ref>''X-Men'' Annual #7 (Dec. 1983)</ref>

More comedic adventures followed, with the Impossible Man engaging in a shapeshifting competition with [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]],<ref>''New Mutants'' Annual #3 (Jan. 1987)</ref> causing havoc on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Earth,<ref>''Excalibur'' #14 (Nov. 1989)</ref> and trying to obtain the movie rights to the [[autobiography]] of professional sidekick [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #25 (Nov. 1989)</ref>

=== 1990s ===
The Impossible Man finds and teases the cosmic being the [[Silver Surfer]] on two occasions, pleading for him to develop a sense of humor before battling the titan [[Thanos]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #33 (Jan. 1990) & #36 (Apr. 1990)</ref> The character returns to Earth and causes more mischief,<ref>''Impossible Man Summer Vacation Spectacular'' #1 & 2 (Aug. 1990 & 1991)</ref> encounters the hero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] while looking for a lost child,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #91 (Dec. 1991)</ref> starts a bar fight,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #97 (June 1992)</ref> watches the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] win a galactic [[marathon]],<ref>''Quasar'' #58 (May 1994)</ref> and invited various otherwise un-contacted heroes and supervillains to the wedding of Rick Jones.<ref>''Hulk'' #417 (June 1994)</ref>

After a brief encounter with the young superhero team the [[New Warriors]],<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #162 (Sep. 1994)</ref> the character enlists the aid of mutant team [[X-Force]] to instill some pride in his children,<ref>''X-Force & Cable'' Annual (Dec. 1995)</ref> and enters into a wager with the alternate universe [[imp]] [[Mister Mxyzptlk]].<ref>''Silver Surfer/Superman'' (Nov. 1996)</ref>

=== 2000s ===
The Impossible Man and the Poppupians make a cameo appearance in [[Noh-Varr]]'s origin story.<ref>''Marvel Boy'' #5 (Dec. 2000)</ref>

The Impossible Man returns to Earth disguised as the Silver Surfer, and after teasing the hero [[Spider-Man]] warns of an alien invasion. The Impossible Man's race are also revealed to have survived, with their consciousness stored inside the character. With the aid of the Fantastic Four, the aliens and the newly-reborn Poppupians are transported off world, merging into one race on Spider-Man's suggestion.<ref>''[[Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four]]'' #1 - 4 (May - Aug. 2007)</ref>

=== 2010s ===
Later during the [[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]], the Impossible Man confronts Mikaboshi, trying to humor and reason with him while shapeshifting in various forms to divert him, but the Chaos King tires of him and brutally dispatches him. Impossible Man's last words were "I thought we were just playing around..."<ref>''Chaos War: Chaos King'' #1</ref>

Impossible Man returns to Earth where he witnesses a battle between [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], and [[Xemnu]]. Impossible Man uses his magic to combine Hulk and Red Hulk into the Compound Hulk. Impossible Man watches as the Compound Hulk fights Xemnu's minion Kluh (a smart version of the Gray Hulk).<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 2 #30</ref>

Impossible Man is later shown to have a son named Adolf Impossible who has many of his father's fantastic powers and has a much more introverted personality. This caused Impossible Man to label Adolf as "entirely too possible" and plead with the [[Future Foundation]] to accept him and allow him to grow as a person.<ref>''FF'' Vol. 2 #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Impossible Man's alien physiology gives the character the ability to take on virtually any form via molecular rearrangement. Almost every appearance has featured the Impossible Man mimicking another Marvel character's appearance and their abilities, such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref name="Fantastic Four' 1977"/> [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #187 (Oct. 1976)</ref> and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Apr. 1990)</ref> He also has the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] across vast interstellar distances and even dimensions, an effect commonly accompanied by a "Pop!" [[sound effect]].

The Impossible Man once battled the [[New Mutants]]' [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] to determine whose shape-shifting ability was superior, a contest Warlock won when he showed he was able to change his colors to match those of the forms he mimics, while the Impossible Man could not.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #3</ref>  This was not the case when he first appeared, however; for instance, when impersonating the Invisible Girl in order to trick Galactus into consuming Poppup, he was fully capable of changing color to make his disguise perfect.<ref name=FF175/>

The Impossible Man has an encyclopedic knowledge of Earth's popular culture.

==Other versions==

===The Cross-Time Caper===
The Impossible Man appears in ''Excalibur'' (Vol 1) #14, during the Cross-Time Caper.  He has populated an analogue of the Earth with multiple twisted versions of the superheroes of the Marvel Universe (such as Daredevil, the 'Man without Common Sense').

Once Galactus leaves, the Impossible Man repopulates the planet effortlessly, allowing the mayhem to begin again.  His powers in this reality generate a 'Pip' rather than a 'Pop'.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}
