The '''Impossible Man''' is a mischievious alien from [[Marvel Comics]] who is, on his rare appearances, usually an [[literary antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. He first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' volume 1 #11, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Character biography==

The impossible man belongs to the [[Extraterrestrial life | alien]] race of Poppupians, all of whom shared a [[collective consciousness]] and the ability to [[shapeshift]], assuming some of the useful attributes of the new form when they do. The Impossible Man has green skin, an elongated egg-shaped head, and wears a strange purple outfit.  He is a highly mischievous and meddlesome character with staggering powers.

The Impossible Man wandered away from his society's collective consciousness, eventually making his way to earth by transforming into a [[space ship]].  There he amused himself by causing trouble among the normal humans with his ability to transform.  The Fantastic Four eventually used the tactic of ignoring him and getting others to do the same, which convinced him that earth was boring and caused him to return to his home planet. 

When the world-eating [[Galactus]] threatened to consume other worlds, the Poppupians had the Impossible Man lead Galactus to their own world and devour it, in an effort to relieve them of their boredom.  The Impossible Man himself survived, and the Poppupians' collective consciousness lived on through him.  After his own world was destroyed, he returned to earth, where loneliness due to a lack of his own kind impelled him to reproduce, a process done asexually by splitting in two.  The result was the Impossible Woman, and later, in an attempt to recreate the Poppupian race, their cloned impossible kids.

The Impossible Man eventually returned to earth alone to cause trouble again.  He said that he had left his family behind because they had developed minds unlike his own, and to determine leadership a scavenger hunt had been devised which involved taking many powerful artifacts from earth's heroes.  Foiled by the [[X-Men]] and other heroes, he left earth having failed the test.  He returned several times over the years, encountering the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[New Mutants]], the [[Silver Surfer]], and even [[Stan Lee]].

He is also known to have killed The Thing's Aunt Petunia in Marvel's own 'Identity Crisis', which appeared in Wha... Huh? 

In many aspects, the Impossible Man seems to have been modelled after the [[DC comics]] character [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. This has been implied by DC comics themselves; for instance, in ''Superman vol. 2'' #50, Mxyzptlk mentions that he's been "having fun with my new ''fantastic'' friends" and later "back to my ''four'' new friends", referring to the Fantastic Four; he uses the expression "it's blubbering time" (a play on [[Thing (comics)|the Thing]]'s standard battle-cry "it's clobbering time"), and says that he's been having "a backlog of mayhem in another dimension", probably referring to the [[Marvel universe]]. Mxyzptlk keeps altering his form constantly in this issue, and also changes into a form that reminds very much of the Impossible Man and says "Sometimes it's just ''impossible'' to remember what I look like from world to world", with the emphasis on "impossible", like with the other keywords "fantastic" and "four", all written in [[Italic type|italic type]]. Later on, in 1996, the Impossible Man and Mxyzptlk teamed up in the DC/Marvel [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] story ''Silver Surfer vs. Superman'', in which the two imps combined their powers to swap universes for the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Superman]]. Here the power of the Impossible Man was more like Mxyzptlk's own [[Reality warper|reality warping]] powers rather than just shapeshifting. In this comic, Mxyzptlk and the Impossible Man have a fight where they keep changing into various characters from their respective universe, for instance [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]] and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].

==Powers and abilities==

The Impossible Man has the ability to [[shapeshift]], and in so doing he can actually assume some of the useful attributes of the new form when he does this. He can even shapeshift into mechanical and electronic devices with moving internal parts. This allows him to be able to assume a form with superhuman strength, or other forms, such as space ships, to travel through space at faster than light speed. The Impossible Man is potentially very powerful, as implied in the aforementioned intercompany crossover, but his benevolent (though mischievous) personality precludes violence on his part. He can also withstand the vacuum of space innately.
