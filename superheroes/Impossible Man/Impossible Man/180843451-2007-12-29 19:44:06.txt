The '''Impossible Man''' is a [[fictional character]], a mischievous alien appearing in the  [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is, on his rare appearances, usually an [[literary antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. He first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #11 (Feb, 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].  He is described as a Poppupian, an alien race with a name analogous to popping up.

==Fictional character biography==

The Impossible Man belongs to the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race of [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#P|Poppupians]], all of whom shared a [[collective consciousness]] and the ability to [[shapeshift]], assuming some of the useful attributes of the new form when they do ('The People of Poppup have no names. We '''Know''' who we are!'). The Impossible Man has green skin, an elongated egg-shaped head, and wears a strange purple outfit.  He is a highly mischievous and meddlesome character with staggering powers.

The Poppupians had become connected into a large group mind. The Impossible Man had a small mental variation that allowed him to think for himself. He became disenchanted with his world and formed himself into a spacecraft and left. He soon arrived on Earth. There he amused himself by causing trouble among the normal humans with his ability to transform. The Fantastic Four eventually used the tactic of ignoring him and getting others to do the same, which convinced him that Earth was boring and caused him to return to his home planet. 

When the world-eating [[Galactus]] threatened to consume other worlds, the Poppupians had the Impossible Man lead Galactus to their own world and devour it, in an effort to relieve them of their boredom.  The Impossible Man himself survived, and the Poppupians' collective consciousness lived on through him.  After his own world was destroyed, he returned to Earth, where loneliness due to a lack of his own kind impelled him to reproduce, a process done asexually by splitting in two.  The result was the Impossible Woman, and later, in an attempt to recreate the Poppupian race, their cloned impossible kids.

The Impossible Man eventually returned to earth alone to cause trouble again.  He said that he had left his family behind because they had developed minds unlike his own, and to determine leadership a scavenger hunt had been devised which involved taking many powerful artifacts from earth's heroes. Foiled by the [[X-Men]] and other heroes, he left earth having failed the test. He returned several times over the years, encountering the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], the [[New Mutants]], the [[Silver Surfer]], and even [[Stan Lee]]. During his time with the New Mutants, his rivalry with the shape-shifting Warlock threatened the entire world. He eventually gave up their 'one-upmanship' game when Warlock proved he could do what the Impossible Man could not, namely change color. 

He appeared during the [[Cross-Time Caper]] which featured the dimensionally lost [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. There he confronted Galactus, who wished to consume a silly version of the Marvel Universe. After Galactus destroys the planet, he admonished the Impossible Man to behave. He did not, recreating the silliness as soon as Galactus had left.

He even harasses [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] at his [[bachelor party]] with the men of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] (in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #417-418). He was also responsible for sending fake wedding invites to so many entities Rick Jones knew, most of whom he did not actually want at his wedding. Fortunately, diplomacy (mostly) won the day at that incident.

In Marvel's humorous out-of-continuity series ''Wha... Huh?'', Marvel made a spoof of DC Comics' '[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]', in which the Impossible Man murdered the Thing's Aunt Petunia. 

In the ''Cable X-Force'' one-shot, three of his children had become 'slackers', poorly dressed, obnoxious teenage types, with no interests but their own self-fulfillment. The Impossible Man interrupts [[X-Force]]'s vacation, in order to get their help in changing his children's attitudes. The menace of a separate monster, coincidentally purple and green, finally spurs the children into an attitude change.

Impossible Man returns in the recent ''[[Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four]]'' limited series. wherein he arrived on Earth disguised as the Silver Surfer. After some mischief-making at [[Spider-Man]]'s expense, Impy revealed that he had come to warn the Fantastic Four of an impending invasion of Earth by the H'mojen alien force. The unlikely duo made their way to [[Central Park]] to stop the invasion force, but the villainous Imperator blasted them with repulsor rays, increasing their magnitude until the Impossible Man was a cloud of vapor. Later on, it was revealed that when his body was destroyed, he implanted his essence into Spider-Man's body until he could regain his strength. The end of the third issue of the series had Spider-Man vomiting up a purple puddle, a cloud of steam rising from it bearing the Impossible Man's face. The collective consciousness of the Poppupian race, stored inside Impy when their planet was destroyed, reconstituted themselves from this puddle, as a gigantic blob with many mouths. They attempted to destroy the H'mojen and populate the earth, but the Fantastic Four relocated both to an inhabited planet, where the two species merged into one, becoming docile. The final panel of the mini-series shows a cat coughing up a green glob, which then turns into Impossible Man, who proclaims "Never the End!"

== A ''[[Mr. Mxyzptlk|Mxy]]''-Up Between Universes? ==

In many aspects, the Impossible Man seems to have been modeled after the [[DC Comics]] character [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. This has been implied by DC comics themselves; for instance, in ''Superman Vol. 2'' #50, Mxyzptlk mentions that he's been "having fun with my new ''fantastic'' friends" and later "back to my ''four'' new friends", referring to the Fantastic Four; he uses the expression "it's blubbering time" (a play on [[Thing (comics)|the Thing]]'s standard battle-cry "it's clobbering time"), and says that he's been having "a backlog of mayhem in another dimension", probably referring to the [[Marvel universe]]. Mxyzptlk keeps altering his form constantly in this issue, and also changes into a form very similar to that of Impossible Man and says "Sometimes it's just ''impossible'' to remember what I look like from world to world"; as with the other keywords, "fantastic' and "four", the word "impossible" appeared in the comic in [[italic type]]. The "four fantastic new friends" are only seen from the legs down, but wear Fantastic Four outfits, and convince Mxy to return to the DCU by ignoring him, just as the FF did in the Impossible Man's first appearance.

In 1996, the Impossible Man and Mxyzptlk teamed up in the DC/Marvel [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] story ''Silver Surfer vs. Superman'', in which the two imps, having met in a small dimension that each entered during teleports, combined their powers to swap universes for the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Superman]]. Here, the power of the Impossible Man was more like Mxyzptlk's own [[reality warping]] powers rather than just shapeshifting. In this comic, Mxyzptlk and the Impossible Man have a fight where they keep changing into various characters from their respective universe, for instance [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]] and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. The differences were profoundly displayed between the two characters - chiefly, in that Impossible Man's motive is pure fun and abhorred true violence, while Mxyzptlk was darker and more interested in destructive chaos, and to Impossible Man's astonishment and anger, is prone to lying. After returning the two to their respective Universes, he gave Mxy a respectful handshake...only to reveal an electric buzzer underneath. The two immediately 'Popped' away, hurling mutual insults.

==Powers and abilities==

The Impossible Man's power typically presents itself as the ability to [[shapeshift]] (giving a "pop" sound while doing so), and in so doing he can actually assume some of the useful attributes of the new form when he does this. He can even shapeshift into mechanical and electronic devices with moving internal parts. This allows him to assume a form with superhuman strength, or other forms, such as space ships, to travel through space at [[faster than light]] speed. The Impossible Man is potentially very powerful, as implied in the aforementioned intercompany crossover, but his benevolent (though mischievous) personality precludes deliberate violence on his part, although he seems to keep forgetting that other non-Poppupian beings can be harmed by things like physical impact or fire. He can also withstand the vacuum of space innately.

An interesting point on his strength is that in an issue of Generation X, [[Strong Guy]] is bragging about his powers, claiming the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] to be lightweights, but admitting that he would need help against 'that green alien pesty guy' the Impossible Man.

The powers of his alien race are defined as "instant evolution," being able to adapt to whatever suits their needs for a particular situation. This bears remarkable similarity to the [[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Haggunenons|Haggunenons]], a species created by [[Douglas Adams]] for the [[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] Radio series, who were a race that continually evolve for every situation ever, having 'impatient chromsomes'; they may at one point be an armchair, the next be a Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, at another a talking shoebox filled with size-9 chucker boots.

Much like DC's [[Plastic Man]], his only limitation is that he keeps his original green and purple color motif at all times. That weakness played a role in resolving a childish rivalry with the shapeshifting being [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] when the [[New Mutants]] suggested that their companion simply demonstrate he could change his colors.  Having been shown up, the Impossible Man was reduced to tears and irritated the team for the rest of the day.

Impossible Man seems to be the most powerful being in the Marvel Universe.
