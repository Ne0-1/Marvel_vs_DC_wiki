The '''Impossible Man''' was an alien [[supervillain]] from [[Marvel Comics]] who was, on his rare appearances, usually a problem for the [[Fantastic Four]].

The Impossible Man has green skin, an elongated egg-shaped head, and wears a strange purple outfit.  He belongs to the [[alien]] race of Poppupians, all of whom share a [[collective consciousness]] and the ability to [[shapeshift]], assuming some of the useful attributes of the new form when they do.  The Impossible Man wandered away from his society's collective conciousness, eventually making his way to earth by transforming into a [[space ship]].  There he amused himself by causing trouble among the normal humans with his ability to transform.  The Fantastic Four eventually used the tactic of ignoring him and getting others to do the same, which convinced him that earth was boring and caused him to return to his home planet. 

When the world-eating [[Galactus]] threatened to consume other worlds, the Poppupians had the Impossible Man lead Galactus to their own world and devour it, in an effort to relieve them of their boredom.  The Impossible Man himself survived, and the Poppupian's collective consciousness lived on through him.  After his own world was destroyed, he returned to earth, where loneliness due to a lack of his own kind impelled him to reproduce, a process done asexually by splitting in two.  The result was the Impossible Woman, and later, in an attempt to recreate the Poppupian race, their cloned impossible kids.

The Impossible Man eventually returned to earth alone to cause trouble again.  He said that he had left his family behind because they had developed minds unlike his own, and to determine leadership a scavenger hunt had been devised which involved taking many powerful artifacts from earth's heros.  Foiled by the heros, he left earth having failed the test, though it is possible that he will return some day.
