'''Firestorm''' ('''Ronald "Ronnie" Raymond''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Al Milgrom]], he first appeared in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 1) #1 (March [[1978 in comics|1978]]).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Firestorm | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 123  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The original Firestorm was distinguished by his integrated dual identity. [[High school]] student '''Ronald Raymond''' and [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physics|physicist]] '''Martin Stein''' were caught in a nuclear accident that allowed them to fuse into the "nuclear man" Firestorm. Due to Stein's being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Firestorm possesses great powers, including flight, superhuman strength, and control over matter itself. He also stands out visually, with (literally) flaming hair and a distinctive red and yellow costume. 

The first ''Firestorm'' series was short-lived. However, ''The Fury of Firestorm'', later called ''Firestorm: the Nuclear Man,'' lasted from [[1982 in comics|1982]] until [[1990 in comics|1990]]. The series began with the teenaged Raymond adjusting to his newfound role and later delved into the issue of the [[nuclear arms race]] and Firestorm’s role as an "[[elemental]]." A new ''Firestorm'' series began in [[2004 in comics|2004]] with a new character, '''[[Firestorm (Jason Rusch)|Jason Rusch]]''', in the role. Like his predecessors before him, Jason had a sense of humor which he often used to hide his insecurities.

Firestorm has been a member of the "all-star" team the [[Justice League]] and, for two seasons, its 1970s/80s [[List of animated television series|cartoon]] adaptation ''[[Super Friends]].''

==Fictional character biography==
{{Tone|date=October 2008}}
===Ronald Raymond / Martin Stein===
After the accident that created him, Firestorm took to defending [[New York]] from such threats as [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] (created in the same nuclear accident that produced Firestorm) and [[Killer Frost]]. The 1978 series was cancelled abruptly in a company-wide cutback (the "[[DC Implosion]]") with #5 (the first part of a multiple-issue story) the last to be distributed, and #6 included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]''. Writer Conway added Firestorm to the roster of ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]''. This led to a series of 8-page stories in the back of ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' (with art by [[George Pérez]]), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982.

The monthly series, written initially by Conway and drawn mainly by Pat Broderick and Rafael Kayanan, slowly developed the lives of Raymond and Stein, as the teenager struggled with high school and moved towards graduation and the scientist found a life outside the lab. A second nuclear hero, [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]], was added as a love interest for Firestorm in 1984. The series also tried to create a sense of fun, something that Conway felt was missing during his years writing [[Spider-Man]]{{Fact|date=April 2008}}; the banter between Ronald Raymond and Martin Stein contributed to this. Upon graduation from high school, Raymond entered college in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], where Stein had been hired as a professor.

Firestorm's list of enemies included such generally forgotten foes as the [[Hyena (comics)|Hyena]], [[Zuggernaut]], [[Typhoon (comics)|Typhoon]], and [[Black Bison]]. One Firestorm enemy, [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]], would later play a major role in DC's [[Captain Atom]]; she later reformed and married Atom. He also fought Killer Frost, who was forced by the [[Psycho-Pirate]] to fall in love with him during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''

===Ronald Raymond / Martin Stein / Mikhail Arkadin===
In 1986, Conway abruptly left the series, and [[John Ostrander]] (with artist Joe Brozowski) took over the reins.  Ostrander, a more politically aware writer{{Fact|date=April 2008}}, sought to make Firestorm more relevant to the world and a good deal grittier. His first major story arc pitted Firestorm against the world, as the hero (acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Prof. Stein) demanded the [[United States|U.S.]] and the [[Soviet Union]] destroy all of their nuclear weapons. After tussles with the Justice League and most of his enemies, Firestorm faced off against a Russian nuclear man named [[Pozhar]] in the [[Nevada]] desert, where they had an [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] dropped on them.

When the smoke cleared, a new Firestorm was created who was made up of Raymond and the Russian, Mikhail Arkadin (the Russian superhero Pozhar), but controlled by the disembodied amnesiac mind of Prof. Stein. The stories featuring this version of the hero were highly political, with a good deal of action taking place in [[Moscow]]. Perhaps coincidentally, the first names of the characters comprising Firestorm were the same as the leaders of their nations: [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

===Fire Elemental===

[[Image:Firestormv285.jpg|185px|thumb|left|The elemental Firestorm.  Cover to ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #85.  Art by [[Tom Grindberg]].]]
The Raymond/Arkadin Firestom proved to be a transitional phase, as in 1989, writer [[John Ostrander]] fundamentally changed the character of Firestorm by revealing that Firestorm was a "Fire Elemental".  Taking his cue from [[Alan Moore]]'s [[Swamp Thing]] (an earth elemental), Firestorm now became something of an environmental crusader, formed from Raymond, Arkadin, and a Soviet clone of the previous Firestorm, but with a new mind.  Prof. Stein, no longer part of the composite at all, continued to play a role, but the focus was on this radically different character.<ref name="dc-ency"/> New artist [[Tom Mandrake]] would create a new look to match. It was during this phase that Firestorm met and befriended [[Shango (DC Comics)|Shango]] and the [[Orishas (DC Comics)|Orishas]], the elemental gods of Africa. He also met their chief deity and Shango's older brother [[Obatala]], Lord of the White Cloth. This was also the situation in which the [[Shadowstorm]] entity first appeared.

By the series' hundredth issue, Stein learned that he was destined to be the true fire elemental and would have been were it not for Ron Raymond also being there by circumstance.  Raymond and Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein, now Firestorm, was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. He thereafter spent many years traveling through space as a wanderer, returning to earth on only two occasions: the ''War of the Gods'' crossover event, and again in ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #5, where Stein cured Raymond of his [[leukemia]] and allowed Raymond to retain the original Firestorm persona on his own.

After the transition to the elemental Firestorm, all of the main characters from the series vanished from the comics for some time after the cancellation of the ''Firestorm'' comic in 1990 (except for a brief cameo in the ''War of the Gods'' crossover event). Raymond eventually returned in the pages of the JLA [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[Extreme Justice]]''.<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 117  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Raymond, who at the time was undergoing treatment for leukemia, regained his original powers after a chemotherapy session. It took the combined might of the Justice League, led by [[Captain Atom]], and the returned elemental Firestorm to restore Ronald's health. Firestorm began to appear regularly in a number of DC titles, though lacking the guidance and knowledge necessary to use his skills wisely. He would play a role in several company-wide crossovers and, in 2002, returned to active duty with the Justice League and also appeared briefly in [[Kurt Busiek]]'s heroes-for-hire comic ''The [[Power Company]]'', as well as later being an active member of the League in the monthly Justice League comic.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Death===
[[Image:Firestorm06.jpg|thumb|Cover art for ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #6.  Art by [[Chris Batista]].]]
Subsequently, Raymond was killed during the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' mini-series. It was revealed in ''Identity Crisis'' #5 and ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #6 that during a battle with a villain called the [[Shadow Thief]], Raymond was impaled by the [[Shining Knight]]'s sword, which the Shadow Thief had stolen. The magical sword ruptured the nuclear man's containment field, resulting in Firestorm's body exploding and his residual essence funneling into the body of Jason Rusch, the new host of the Firestorm Matrix.<ref name="dc-ency"/> His name was featured posthumosly on Rip Hunter's chalkboard in ''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #1 in the statement "Ronnie Raymond + X = Firestorm".

===Jason Rusch===
{{main|Firestorm (Jason Rusch)}}
In [[2004 in comics|2004]], DC revived the ''Firestorm'' comic for a third time; instead of Ronald Raymond, there was a new protagonist, '''Jason Rusch''', an [[African American]] teenager. The [[Martian Manhunter]] explained in the latter issue that he examined the new Firestorm's mind telepathically for any trace of Ronald Raymond, but could not find any, which would have seemed to indicate that Raymond was indeed gone. Raymond returned within the Firestorm matrix in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #9, and remained with Jason as part of Firestorm until he appeared to dissipate in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #13.

== Powers and abilities ==
Firestorm has the ability to rearrange the atomic and subatomic structure of matter, rearranging subatomic particles to create objects of different atomic characteristics of equal mass. He can not only change the atomic composition of an object (e.g., transmuting lead into gold of equal mass) but he can also change its shape. He cannot, however, affect organic matter. If he does there may be painful, even lethal, feedback. This organic limitation does not extend to his person as he can change himself at will, allowing him to regenerate tissue, to shapeshift, and to survive indefinitely without food, water and air. Much like a Green Lantern's limitations, Firestorm can only create items the "driver" of the Firestorm matrix is able to understand the workings of. Unlike a Green Lantern's creations, Firestorm's alterations are permanent unless he reverses them.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==In other media==
*Firestorm appeared in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (the last two ''Super Friends'' series). [[Mark L. Taylor]] provided Ronald Raymond's voice while [[Olan Soule]] provided Martin Stein's voice. The crew responsible for the first series depicted the flames on Firestorm's head as a static, fire-shaped ornament. The second series' authors made another change, transforming the hair into a waved haircut.

*Firestorm was among the myriad planned guest stars in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]]. JLU writer/producer [[Dwayne McDuffie]] said the producers had permission from DC Comics to use Firestorm, but the show's creators could not come up with a story using him that they liked.<ref>http://dcboards.warnerbros.com/web/thread.jspa?threadID=2000119643</ref> In ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #197, McDuffie revelaed that the producers intended to use the Raymond and Stein version of Firestorm for the series. Firestorm has appeared in issues #3 and 16 of the JLU tie-in comic. He was to have been the focus character for the episode "The Greatest Story Never Told", but was replaced by Booster Gold.<ref>[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode33/episode33.htm The Justice League Watchtower: The Greatest Story Never Told]</ref>

*Through recently taken photos, it has been revealed that the [[Firestorm (Jason Rusch)|Jason Rusch]] version of Firestorm will appear in the new series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. Former Firestorm writer [[Jamal Igle]] later confirmed this.<ref>[http://dcboards.warnerbros.com/web/thread.jspa?threadID=2000161442&tstart=0<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A voice artist is yet to be confirmed.<ref>[http://www.actionfigurecollectors.com/afc_gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=16388&g2_serialNumber=2]</ref>

==Other versions==
*Firestorm (Ronald Raymond) has appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book. His appearances are in issues #3, 8, and 16
*On [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#The 52|Earth-37]], Ronnie Raymond and [[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]] were fused to become "Quantum-Storm," a Firestorm/Captain Atom hybrid.
*The [[Worlds of the 52 multiverse#Earth-12|Earth-12]] version of Firestorm is a [[Batman Beyond|futuristic]] descendent of the original.
*[[Worlds of the 52 multiverse#Earth-11|Earth-11]]'s Firestorm is a female version of Jason Rusch.
*On Earth-9 the secret society Nightwing, uses armed agents called Firestorm Troopers.
* In issue 26 of the latest Justice League of America run, Vixen was trapped in an alternate universe created by the Trickster-God [[Anansi]]. In it, there is a version of Firestorm that refers to itself as "We Are Firestorm". It is comprised of four unique identities, one of which is implied to be Jason Rusch.
