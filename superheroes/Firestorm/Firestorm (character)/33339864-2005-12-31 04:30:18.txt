'''Firestorm''' the Nuclear Man is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], created in 1978 by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Allen Milgrom]].  As of 2005, Firestorm has starred in three series, ''Firestorm'' running for five months in 1978, followed by ''The Fury of Firestorm'', running 100 issues and running from 1982 to 1990.  A new ''Firestorm'' began in 2004.

What distinguished Firestorm most of his career was his integrated dual identity.  The hero was actually two men, high school student Ronnie Raymond and [[Nobel Prize]] winning physicist Martin Stein.  Caught in a nuclear accident, the two were fused together, with Raymond (awake at the time of the accident) in command of the Firestorm form and with Stein as a voice of advice inside Firestorm's mind.  As befits a "nuclear man," Firestorm possessed great powers, including flight, strength, the ability to adjust his molecular density, and the ability to alter matter itself.  He also stood out visually, with flaming hair and a distinctive red and yellow costume.

Using these powers, Firestorm took to defending [[New York]] from such threats as [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] (created in the same nuclear accident that produced Firestorm) and [[Killer Frost]].  The 1978 series was cancelled abruptly in a company-wide cutback (the "DC Implosion") with #5 (the first part of a multiple-issue story) the last to be distributed, and #6 included in ''[[Cancelled Comics Cavalcade]]''.  Writer Conway added Firestorm to the roster of ''[[Justice League of America]]''.  This led to a series of 8-page stories in the back of ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' (with art by [[George Perez]]), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982.

The monthly series, written initially by Conway and drawn mainly by Pat Broderick and Rafael Kayanan, slowly developed the lives of Raymond and Stein, as the teenager struggled with high school and moved towards graduation and the scientist found a life outside the lab. A second nuclear hero, [[Firehawk]], was added as a love interest for Firestorm in 1984. The series also tried to create a sense of fun, something that Conway felt was missing during his years writing [[Spider-Man]]; the banter between Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein contributed to this. Upon graduation from high school, Raymond entered college in [[Pittsburgh]], where Stein had been hired as a professor.

Firestorm's list of enemies included such generally forgotten foes as the [[Hyena (comics)|Hyena]], [[Zuggernaut]], [[Typhoon (comics)|Typhoon]], and [[Black Bison]]. One Firestorm enemy, [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]], would later play a major role in DC's [[Captain Atom]]; she later reformed and married him. He also fought Killer Frost, who was forced by the [[Psycho Pirate]] to fall in love with him during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''

In 1986, Conway abruptly left the series, and [[John Ostrander]] (with artist [[Joe Brozowski]]) took over the reins.  Ostrander, a more politically aware writer, sought to make Firestorm more relevant to the world and a good deal grittier.  His first major story arc pitted Firestorm against the world, as the hero (acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Prof. Stein) demanded the [[United States of America|US]] and the [[Soviet Union]] destroy all of their nuclear weapons.  After tussles with the Justice League and most of his enemies, Firestorm faced off against a Russian nuclear man in the [[Nevada]] desert, where both had an [[atomic bomb]] dropped on them.

When the smoke cleared, a new Firestorm was created who was made up of Raymond and the Russian, Mikhail Arkadin (alias the Russian superhero, Pozhar), but controlled by the disembodied amnesiac mind of Prof. Stein.  The stories featuring this version of the hero were highly political, with a good deal of action taking place in [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Moscow]].  This, however, was a transitional phase, as Ostrander revealed the true nature of Firestorm: he was a fire elemental.

Taking his cue from [[Alan Moore]]'s [[Swamp Thing]] (a plant elemental), Firestorm now became something of an environmental crusader, formed from Raymond, Arkadin, and a Soviet clone of the previous Firestorm, but with a new mind.  Prof. Stein, no long part of the composite at all, continued to play a role, but the focus was on this radically different character.  New artist [[Tom Mandrake]] would create a new look to match.

The series ran out of steam at its one hundredth issue, and at this point the Firestorm "matrix" changed again, as Stein learned that ''he'' was destined to be the true fire elemental.  Raymond and Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein, now Firestorm, was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth.

Firestorm vanished from the comics for some time after the cancellation (except for a brief cameo in the War of the Gods crossover event), but Ronnie Raymond returned in the pages of the JLA [[spin-off]], ''[[Extreme Justice]]''.  Raymond, who at the time was undergoing treatment for Leukemia,  regained his original powers (rather abruptly) after a kemo session.  It took the combined might of the Captain Atom's Justice League & the returned Elemental Firestorm to restore his powers & Ronald's health. Firestorm began to appear regularly in a number of DC titles, though lacking the guidance and knowledge necessary to use his skills wisely.  He would play a role in several company-wide crossovers, and in 2002 returned to active duty with the Justice League and also appeared briefly in [[Kurt Busiek]]'s heroes-for-hire comic, ''[[The Power Company]]''.

In 2004, DC revived the ''Firestorm'' comic for a third time, but writer [[Dan Jolley]] and artist Chris Cross abandoned Ronnie Raymond entirely for a new protagonist, [[Jason Rusch (comics)|Jason Rusch]], an [[African-American]] teenager. To explain this, DC killed off Raymond during the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' mini-series. It was revealed in ''Identity Crisis'' #5 and ''Firestorm'' #6 that during a battle with a villain called the [[Shadow-Thief]], the original Firestorm was impaled by the [[Shining Knight]]'s sword, which the Shadow Thief had stolen. The magical sword ruptured the nuclear man's containment field, resulting in Firestorm's body exploding, and his residual essence funneling into Jason Rusch's body, perhaps activating a dormant meta-gene. [[Martian Manhunter]] explained in the latter issue that he examined the new Firestorm's mind telepathically for any trace of Ronnie Raymond, but could not find any, which would have seemed to indicate that Raymond is indeed gone.  However, death often tends not to be permanent within comic book universes, and Ronnie Raymond returned within the Firestorm matrix in ''Firestorm'' #9, and remained with Jason as part of Firestorm until he appeared to dissipate in ''Firestorm'' #13.  It is unknown whether Raymond truly gone (although he hinted otherwise before vanishing), or how the Martin Stein "Elemental Firestorm" (recently making a reappearance in Infinite Crisis #3) will react to the apparent death of Raymond or the young man who has taken his place as the Nuclear Man. 

Recently, in issue #19, [[Donna Troy]] recruited Firestorm for her outer space team to fight the oncoming instability from ''[[Infinite Crisis]].'' Other recent developments include Jason being significantly depowered after a battle with the new [[Secret_Society_of_Super-Villains#3rd_Formation|Secret Society of Super-Villains]]. Now, in order to access his powers, he must merge with another individual. He's also acquired a telepathic link to a mysterious young girl with powers similar to his own, named [[Gehenna (comics)|Gehenna]].

The series appears to have been renamed Firestorm: The Nuclear Man as of issue #23 and in upcoming post-Infinite Crisis issues, the Jason Rusch Firestorm appears to have undergone additional changes to his appearance in the follow-up "One Year Later" event.

[[Jason Rusch (comics)|Jason Rusch]], while possessing similar abilities to the original Firestorm, also possesses the ability to transmute inorganic and organic matter on a molecular level. He also possesses the ability to manipulate energy in various forms. Other powers include flight at high speeds, increased strength, durability and "Quark Vision": the ability to see molecular structures.

While never particularly popular, Firestorm has had a vocal and loyal following among those who grew up reading the second series. The decision to replace the original character in 2004 generated something of an uproar among these fans.  Whether a new Firestorm will be embraced by contemporary comic book readers is yet to be determined, and although initial sales have been less than promising, current writer Stuart Moore and artist [[Jamal_igle|Jamal Igle]] have assured readers that the current series is expected to have a long and exciting future.

==Television appearances==
Firestorm appeared in the last two seasons of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[SuperFriends]]'' series. Firestorm was among the myriad planned guest stars in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[animated series]], but has yet to show. It is speculated that due to the relaunch of Firestorm with [[Jason Rusch (comics)|Jason Rusch]], DC did not want to confuse potential new readers with two different, almost simultaneous new versions of Firestorm.
