'''Firestorm''' is the name of several comic book [[superhero]]es published by [[DC Comics]]. Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein, the first Firestorm, debuted in ''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' No. 1 (March 1978) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Firestorm | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 123 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 177 |quote = If inventiveness is the fusion of ideas, then Firestorm was one of the most original characters to emerge from a comic book in years.

==Publication history==
The first ''Firestorm'' series was short-lived, canceled abruptly in a company-wide cutback (the "[[DC Implosion]]")<ref name="Hot-headed Hero">Conway, Gerry. "Nuclear Reactions: Just Your Average Hot-Headed Hero," ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #1 #1 (June 1982).</ref> with #5 (the first part of a multiple-issue story) the last to be distributed, and #6 included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]''. Writer Conway added Firestorm to the roster of ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]''. This led to a series of 8-page stories in the back of ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' (with art by [[George Pérez]]), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982. ''The Fury of Firestorm'' (later called ''Firestorm: the Nuclear Man'') lasted from [[1982 in comics|1982]] until [[1990 in comics|1990]].

Another ''Firestorm'' series began in [[2004 in comics|2004]] with a new character, [[Jason Rusch]], in the role. Like his predecessors, Jason had a sense of humor which he often used to hide his insecurities.

Yet another Firestorm title was launched in 2011. Starring both Ronnie and his successor, Jason Rusch, it was one of the new titles launched in the wake of DC's ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crossover event. The series, ''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men'', was initially written by [[Gail Simone]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]] and drawn by [[Yildiray Cinar]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Thu, 06/02/2011 - 10:00am |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/02/the-new-justice/ |title=The New Justice &#124; DC Comics |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref> [[Joe Harris (filmmaker)|Joe Harris]] replaced Simone starting in Issue 7, while co-writer Van Sciver also provided the art for Issues 7 and 8 before Yildiray returned.<ref>{{cite news|title=Joe Harris Replaces Gail Simone as "Firestorm" Co-Writer| url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=35773|accessdate=19 January 2012|publisher=CBR.com|date=6 December 2011}}</ref> Veteran writer/artist [[Dan Jurgens]] took over the series with issue #13 in 2012, until the series' end with issue #20 in 2013.

==Fictional character biography==

===Ronnie Raymond / Martin Stein===
The original Firestorm was distinguished by his integrated dual identity. [[High school]] student Ronnie Raymond and [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physics|physicist]] Martin Stein were caught in a nuclear accident that allowed them to fuse into the "nuclear man" Firestorm. Due to Stein's being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind, able to offer Raymond advice on how to use their powers without actually having any control over their dual form. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Initially Stein was completely ignorant of their dual identity, leaving him concerned about his unusual disappearances and blackouts, but Ronnie was eventually able to convince him of the truth, allowing them to bond as separate individuals rather than as parts of a whole.

After the accident that created him, Firestorm took to defending [[New York]] from such threats as [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] and [[Killer Frost]]. The 1982 series began with the teenaged Raymond adjusting to his newfound role and later delved into the issue of the [[nuclear arms race]] and Firestorm’s role as an "[[elemental]]." ''The Fury of Firestorm'' slowly developed the lives of Raymond and Stein, as the teenager struggled with high school and moved towards graduation and the scientist found a life outside the lab after learning about his bond with Raymond. A second nuclear hero, [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]], was added as a love interest for Firestorm in 1984. The series also tried to create a sense of fun, something that Conway felt was missing during his years writing [[Spider-Man]];<ref name="Hot-headed Hero"/> the banter between Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein contributed to this. Upon graduation from high school, Raymond entered college in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], where Stein had been hired as a professor.

===Ronnie Raymond / Martin Stein / Mikhail Arkadin===
In 1986, Conway abruptly left the series, and [[John Ostrander]] (with artist Joe Brozowski) took over the reins. Ostrander sought to make Firestorm more relevant to the world and a good deal grittier. His first major story arc pitted Firestorm against the world, as the hero, acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Prof. Stein, demanded the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] destroy all of their [[nuclear weapons]]. After tussles with the [[Justice League]] and most of his enemies, Firestorm faced off against a Russian nuclear superhero named [[Pozhar]] in the [[Nevada]] desert, where they had an [[atomic bomb]] dropped on them. A new Firestorm resulted, a fusion of the two heroes: this new Firestorm was composed of Raymond and the Russian [[Pozhar|Mikhail Arkadin]] but controlled by the disembodied [[amnesia]]c mind of Stein. The stories featuring this version of the hero were highly political, with a good deal of action taking place in Brooklyn.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Fire Elemental===
The Raymond/Arkadin Firestorm proved to be a transitional phase, as in 1989, writer [[John Ostrander]] fundamentally changed the character of Firestorm by revealing that Firestorm was a "Fire Elemental". Firestorm now became something of an environmental crusader, formed from Raymond, Arkadin, and a Soviet clone of the previous Firestorm, but with a new mind. Prof. Stein, no longer part of the composite at all, continued to play a role, but the focus was on this radically different character.<ref name="dc-ency"/> New artist [[Tom Mandrake]] would create a new look to match. It was during this phase that Firestorm met and befriended [[Shango (DC Comics)|Shango]] and the [[Orishas (DC Comics)|Orishas]], the elemental gods of [[Africa]]. He also met their chief deity and Shango's older brother [[Obatala]], Lord of the White Cloth.

By the series' 100th issue, Stein learned that he was destined to be the true Fire Elemental and would have been were it not for Ron Raymond also being there by circumstance. Raymond and Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein as Firestorm was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. He thereafter spent many years traveling through space as a wanderer, returning to Earth on only two occasions: the ''War of the Gods'' crossover event, and again in the JLA [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #5, where Stein cured Raymond of his [[leukemia]] and allowed Raymond to retain the original Firestorm persona on his own.

After the transition to the elemental Firestorm, all of the main characters from the series vanished from the comics for some time after the cancellation of the ''Firestorm'' comic in 1990. Raymond eventually returned in the pages of ''Extreme Justice''.<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 117 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = [[New York City|New York]] | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Raymond, who at the time was undergoing treatment for leukemia, regained his original powers after a [[chemotherapy]] session. It took the combined might of the Justice League, led by [[Captain Atom]], and the returned elemental Firestorm to restore Ronnie's health. Firestorm began to appear regularly in a number of DC titles, though lacking the guidance and knowledge necessary to use his skills wisely. In 2002, he returned to active duty with the Justice League and also appeared briefly in [[Kurt Busiek]]'s heroes-for-hire comic ''The [[Power Company]]''.

===Death===
Raymond was killed during the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' mini-series. During a battle with a villain called the [[Shadow Thief]], Raymond was impaled by the [[Shining Knight]]'s sword, which the Shadow Thief had stolen. The magical sword ruptured the nuclear man's containment field, resulting in Firestorm's body exploding and his residual essence funneling into the body of Jason Rusch, the new host of the Firestorm Matrix.<ref name="dc-ency"/> His name was featured posthumously on Rip Hunter's chalkboard in ''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #1 in the statement "Ronnie Raymond + X = Firestorm".

===Jason Rusch===
In 2004, DC revived the ''Firestorm'' comic for the second time, with writer [[Dan Jolley]] and artist Chris Cross, but instead of the original Firestorm, Ronnie Raymond, there was a new protagonist; '''Jason Rusch''', a teenager.

Jason was a seventeen-year-old living in Detroit, who wanted nothing more than to escape his home city. He lived with his father, who had turned abusive after he lost his hand in an industrial accident. His mother left his father sometime after the accident, leaving the young Jason with his father. With the loss of a job he needed to fund college, Jason turned to a local thug for money, accepting a job as a courier. It was on that job that he encountered the Firestorm matrix, searching for a new host after Raymond's death. In the aftermath, Jason struggled to cope with his new identity and powers - a struggle that led to the death of the man who'd hired him.

Eventually, Jason managed to develop a degree of control over his powers. Ronnie Raymond eventually returned within the Firestorm matrix in ''Firestorm'' #9, remaining with Jason as part of Firestorm until he appeared to dissipate in ''Firestorm'' #13.

Shortly after Jason's eighteenth birthday, a few weeks after Raymond's dissipation, Jason was kidnapped by the new [[Secret Society of Super Villains#3rd Formation|Secret Society of Super Villains]] for use as a power source in a hidden complex. Freed when the new [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] launched a raid on the complex, Jason discovered two important things: he had a fellow prisoner (a mysterious girl named [[Gehenna (comics)|Gehenna]]), and his imprisonment by the Society had significantly depowered him (''Firestorm'' #17).

Together, Jason and Gehenna escaped the complex. Gehenna disappeared in the aftermath, but telepathically promised Firestorm that she'd see him again. In ''Firestorm'' #19, [[Donna Troy]] recruited Firestorm - this time comprising Jason and his best friend Mick Wong - for her outer space team to fight the oncoming instability from ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

===''Infinite Crisis''===
In the 2006 miniseries ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' it was revealed that Martin Stein, alive in space as the "Elemental Firestorm", had sensed the presence of Jason within the Firestorm Matrix, but was unaware of the final demise of Ronnie Raymond. When Jason, as Firestorm, was gravely wounded in the line of duty, Stein linked with him in a variation of the merge, promising Jason a new Firestorm body to let him return into battle (although Martin had been unable to save Mick) and asking him about the fate of Ronnie.

Accepting Martin's proposal, Jason asked Stein to become the permanent second member of the Firestorm matrix. Sensing his "errors", including Mick's death, were the result of his youth and lack of experience, he sought the experience and maturity of Stein. Martin refused at first, but finally accepted Jason's request, thus ensuring both a new Firestorm body and the reconstruction of human bodies for both Rusch and Martin.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

It was revealed in ''Infinite Crisis'' that if the Multiverse had survived up to the present, Jason would have been a native of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Eight|Earth-Eight]].<ref>[[Johns, Geoff]]. ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 (April 2006)</ref>

===''52''===
In the 2006-2007 weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', it is revealed that Firestorm was fused with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] due to malfunctioning [[Rann#Rann Technology|Zeta Beam technology]]. Unmerged after several weeks, Jason, as Firestorm, tried to reform and lead a new Justice League, along with [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]], [[Ambush Bug]], [[Super-Chief]], and the [[Bulleteer]]. After a failure in handling a time-displacement crisis staged by [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]], the new League was disbanded in disgrace, adding strain to the already shaky friendship with Lorraine, as Jason still holds her and the rest of Donna's Space Team as responsible for Mick's demise. Finally, during the ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]'' event versus [[Black Adam]], Jason settled all differences with Lorraine, rekindling their friendship and asking for her powers, necessary to activate Firestorm after the mysterious disappearance of Martin Stein.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}

==="One Year Later"===
As the storyline [[One Year Later|jumped ahead a year]] (and the series itself was now retitled as ''Firestorm: The Nuclear Man'' issue #23 on), Professor Stein has mysteriously vanished, and Jason has been merging with [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]] to become Firestorm, allowing him to use her powers as well. The two decided to look for Stein together. Stein had been kidnapped and tortured by the Pupil, a former teaching assistant of Martin's. Flanked by the D.O.L.L.I.'s, a group of cyborg soldiers of limited cognitive ability, the Pupil (formerly known as Adrian Burroughs) questioned the nearly dead Stein about the secrets of the universe. Jason and Lorraine, along with the mysterious teleporter Gehenna, freed the captured Stein and restored him to full health. Jason is a college freshman at New York City's Columbus University and seems to have ties with Dani Sharpe, a member of the senior staff at [[LexCorp]].

The Firestorm team of Jason and Firehawk made several appearances across the DCU before the search for Martin Stein ended. This included dealing with the latest [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] and teaming up with [[Superman]] in the "Back in Action" arc in [[Action Comics]]. Firehawk later introduced Jason to [[Pozhar]], a Russian superhero who was once a part of the Firestorm matrix; together, the trio take on a newly reborn [[Tokamak (comics)|Tokamak]]. This series ended with ''Firestorm: The Nuclear Man'' issue #35 in April 2007.

=== Anti-Life Equation ===
{{main|Anti-Life Equation}}
Jason Rusch and Martin Stein meet [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], and are attacked in succession by [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] of the [[New Gods]] and the [[Female Furies]] of [[Apokolips]]. Shilo informs Stein and Rusch that one quarter of the Life Equation is hidden within the '''Firestorm Matrix'''. The others are held by Earth's other three [[Elemental]]s, (possibly the [[Red Tornado]], [[Naiad (comics)|Naiad]], and [[Swamp Thing]]). Darkseid fears that the Life Equation might challenge him and his Anti-Life Equation. Orion wished to keep Professor Stein safe, and the Furies wished to secure the Matrix for [[Darkseid]].<ref>As seen in ''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' #33</ref> With Gehenna as a "hidden partner" in the Matrix, Jason began his search for Stein.

=== Justice League ===
While apprehending [[Killer Frost]] in the commission of a heist, Jason is severely wounded by [[Lex Luthor]], the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]. While still recovering, he goes to aid the captive members of the Justice League. Upon freeing the members of the League, he joins the battle against the [[Injustice League]]. After this victory, Firestorm is drafted into the League by [[Batman]].

During the team's encounter with the planet destroying villain [[Starbreaker (comics)|Starbreaker]] and the black-ops team the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]], Jason eventually faces Carl Sands, AKA [[Shadow Thief]], the villain who killed Ronnie Raymond and inadvertently caused Jason's transformation into Firestorm. Sands mocks Jason for being an unworthy successor and nearly kills him like he did his predecessor, but Jason rejects the villain's insinuation that he is inferior, and emerges victorious.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #32 (April 2009)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #33 (May 2009)</ref> Jason instead uses his abilities to seal Sands' mouth shut with duct tape, preventing him from utilizing the shadows within his body, thus rendering him powerless. He later assists [[Icon (comics)|Icon]] and the rest of the Justice League in the final battle with Starbreaker.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #34 (June 2009)</ref>

After this, Jason plays a minor role in the mini-series ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]''. A short time later, Firestorm is seen helping search for survivors alongside Animal Man and Starfire after [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] is destroyed by Prometheus.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #7 (March 2010)</ref>

===''Blackest Night''===
In the 2009 - 2010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' miniseries, Ronnie Raymond is called by a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] to join the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. In the following issue, his reanimated corpse is shown confronting [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] alongside [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], [[Kendra Saunders|Hawkgirl]], [[Elongated Man]], [[Sue Dibny]], and [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]].<ref name="bn2">''Blackest Night'' #2 (August 2009)</ref> He then attacks [[Jason Rusch]] (the current Firestorm), and absorbs him into his own version of the Firestorm matrix. Then, using Jason's unique abilities, turns [[Gehenna (comics)|Gehenna]] into table salt, simultaneously ripping her heart out with a smile. He uses the Firestorm Matrix to absorb Jason's anger over Gehenna's death, providing the Black Lanterns with even more emotional energies<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He goes on to attack Barry Allen and co. at the Justice League satellite. Jason then briefly asserts himself, allowing the heroes to escape. Regaining control, Ronnie proceeds to absorb Jason's willpower. Like other Black Lanterns, the undead Firestorm mimics the personality of Ronnie Raymond, often wisecracking and exhibiting other stereotypical teenage behavior.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4 (October 2009)</ref> In the final battle against Nekron, Ronnie is restored to life alongside Jason, the two separating from Firestorm. Ronnie is confused, asking Atom where Professor Stein is while Jason is upset with Ronnie killing Gehenna. Ronnie, however, apparently has no memory of doing so.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>

===''Brightest Day''===
{{Main|Brightest Day}}

In the 2010 - 2011 ''[[Brightest Day]]'' miniseries, Ronnie, still clad in casual clothing from a wild party the night before, arrives at Jason's apartment with Professor Stein and [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] to attend Gehenna's funeral. Stein and Palmer discuss Ron's return and how he no longer remembers anything since his death at the hands of Shadow Thief. While the two talk about the paperwork needed to have Ronnie's legal status as "dead" reversed, Ron approaches Jason and offers an apology about Gehenna's murder. Jason refuses to accept it, telling Ronnie that he forced him into being an accomplice to the death of his girlfriend, and that he probably doesn't even remember her name. When Ronnie is actually unable to remember Gehenna's name, Jason angrily lashes out and punches him in the face. This causes the two young men to merge into Firestorm, and they begin arguing inside the Matrix while Palmer transforms into his [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] persona in order to help them separate.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref><ref>''Brightest Day'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>

Palmer manages to separate Jason and Ronnie, but not before the Firestorm matrix causes a huge explosion, transmutating everything in the Professor's laboratory into table salt.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> While recovering in the hospital, Stein explains to Ronnie that it seems to be very dangerous to fuse into Firestorm again. Also, it is revealed that Ronnie, after quickly leaving the hospital and being threatened by Jason's father to stay away from Jason, lied to everyone, as he seems to perfectly remember murdering Gehenna as a Black Lantern.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #3 (June 2010)</ref>

Some time after the forceful separation, he lies sleeping in preparation of a party, when a previously heard voice prods him awake - a monstrous construct of Gehenna, made totally of salt, which proceeds to throttle and choke him, taunting him to remember her name; while she is interrupted before killing him, Ronnie is left covered in salt.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #4 (June 2010)</ref> Not too long after, he is lying, recovering from a massive binge, when Jason again forces the merge to help several construction workers endangered when the girders at the site are transmuted without warning to bubble gum. This time, they again hear the mysterious voice taunting them, and Ronnie accepts he remembers killing Gehenna, and they realize something else is lurking from within the Firestorm Matrix.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #6 (July 2010)</ref>

As Firestorm, Ronnie and Jason visit Stein in an attempt to find out what is happening to them. Stein reveals to them that the Black Lantern Firestorm still exists in the Firestorm Matrix. Firestorm is then told by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] that they must learn from each other and defeat the Black Lantern Firestorm, before he destroys the Entity. Somehow, Jason and Ronnie trade places.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref>

After running a test, Professor Stein reveals the origin of the Firestorm Matrix. Stein believes that during the initial experiment he was able to capture the spark that preceded the Big Bang that created our universe. Thereby making the matrix a trigger for a new big bang, if the boys continue to experience emotional imbalance, they increase the likelihood of triggering a new big bang. After explaining this to the boys, the voice inside them speaks again. Declaring that it is not the matrix, a pair of black hands reaches out from inside Firestorm. Forcibly separating Jason and Ronnie, Black Lantern Firestorm stands between them, separate from both Ronnie and Jason and apparently calling itself "Deathstorm".<ref>''Brightest Day'' #10 (September 2010)</ref>

Deathstorm reveals its plan to Stein, stating that it intends to create enough emotional instability between Ronnie and Jason that the Matrix will trigger another Big Bang thereby destroying of all life in the universe. In order to help accomplish this goal, Deathstorm absorbs Stein's mind in order to use his knowledge of Ronnie against him; then, to torture Jason, Deathstorm brings his father, Alvin Rusch, to the lab and absorbs him as well. Taking flight Deathstorm beckons Ronnie and Jason (who by now have merged into Firestorm) to follow it. Deathstorm leads them to Silver City, New Mexico and the resting place of the Central Power White Lantern Battery. Deathstorm tries to lift the battery but is unable to until he infects it with black energy, after which he is able to lift it with ease. After he threatens to destroy the White Lantern Battery and therefore prevent Ronnie and Jason to truly live, a voice beckons him not to. The voice, commands him to bring the Central Power White Lantern Battery to the voice as well as an army, at which point Deathstorm brings back the Black Lantern versions of Professor Zoom, Maxwell Lord, Hawk, Jade, Captain Boomerang, Martian Manhunter, Aquaman, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Deadman and Osiris.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #11 (October 2010)</ref>

Deathstorm and the Black Lanterns teleport to an unknown location, Firestorm, Jason and Ronnie ultimately seek the help from the Justice League.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #12 (October 2010)</ref> Firestorm arrive at the Hall of Justice asking for help.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #15 (December 2010)</ref> Firestorm is placed in a containment chamber while the League search for a way to stabilize the energy. However, an internal argument between Ronnie and Jason ignites the spark, apparently resulting in the destruction of the universe.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #16 (December 2010)</ref> Ronnie and Jason quickly notice, after defeating an hive of Shadow Demons, that the universe was not destroyed as they thought but they were actually transported to the Anti-Matter Universe. There they are contacted by the Entity who reveals to them that since [[Deadman|Boston Brand]] has not yet found the one who will take the Entity's place, it is Firestorm mission to protect the Entity.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #17 (January 2011)</ref> Meanwhile, Deathstorm and the Black Lanterns are shown on [[Qward]] delivering the White Battery to someone.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)</ref> That someone is revealed to be the [[Anti-Monitor]], who seeks to harvest the life energy within the Lantern to grow stronger. Firestorm takes the White Lantern and attempts to fight the Anti-Monitor, but is defeated. Deathstorm then brings Professor Stein out of his Matrix to taunt the two with. Deathstorm then attempts to turn Ronnie to salt, but the Professor takes the brunt of the attack. Angered, Ronnie decides to truly work together with Jason to avenge the Professor. The Entity then declares that Ronnie has accomplished his mission, returning life to him in a burst of white energy that obliterates the Black Lanterns, returns Jason's father to his home, and deposits Firestorm in the [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] forest. Ronnie angrily attempts to make the Entity resurrect the Professor, but is refused. Deadman then arrives, demanding that he be given the White Lantern.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #22 (March 2011)</ref>

When the "Dark Avatar", made his presence known, Firestorm is part of the Elementals. Ronnie Raymond was then transformed by the Entity to become the element of fire and protect the Star City Forest from the "Dark Avatar" which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the [[Swamp Thing]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing brought back Firestorm to normal. Afterward, Ronnie and Jason must find a way to contain their Firestorm matrix from the explosion less than ninety days.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

===The New 52===
After the events of the 2011 "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, as part of [[The New 52]], reality is altered so that Firestorm's personal history is completely restarted. Ronnie is now introduced as a high school senior and the captain of the football team. During a terrorist attack on their school, Ronnie's classmate Jason Rusch produces a vial given to him by Professor Stein, which contains the "God Particle", one of Stein's creations. The God Particle transform both Jason and Ronnie into Firestorm, and the two teens briefly battle each other before accidentally merging into a hulking creature known as the Fury.<ref>''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men'' #1 (September 2011)</ref>

They are both considered for recruitment into the Justice League (sharing the identity of Firestorm with Ronnie being the brawn and Jason being the brains) along with several other heroes. They play a large part in the events leading up to the Trinity War, the three-way battle between the Justice League (the original headed by Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman), the Justice League of America (the A.R.G.U.S. sponsored team lead by Steve Trevor, Green Arrow and Amanda Waller), and Justice League Dark (the paranormal team consisting of John Constantine, Zatana and the Phantom Stranger). When Superman is framed for the death of Dr. Light and the League is taken into custody, Amanda Waller has Firestorm experiment on their ability to create certain elements: specifically, the mass production of kryptonite. It turns out that the two are indeed capable of using their powers to create it, but with some difficulty. However, this ultimately becomes moot once the Trinity War leads to the invasion of the Crime Syndicate, who supposedly kill off the Justice League. In fact, the League is trapped inside Firestorm by his Earth-3 counterpart, Deathstorm (a combination of Martin Stein and a corpse he experimented on), with only Batman and Catwoman escaping the initial fracas. The Leagues are presumed dead for a time, but are eventually freed from captivity after the Syndicate is defeated by Batman and Lex Luthor's Injustice League.

==Powers and abilities==
Firestorm has the ability to rearrange the atomic and subatomic structure of inorganic matter, rearranging subatomic particles to create objects of different atomic characteristics of equal mass. He can not only change and transmute the atomic composition of an object (e.g., transmuting lead into gold of equal mass) but he can also change its shape. He cannot, however, affect organic matter without painful, even lethal, feedback. This organic limitation does not extend to his person as he can change himself at will, allowing him to regenerate lost and damaged tissue, boost his immune system, shapeshift, and survive indefinitely without food, water and air. Much like a Green Lantern's limitations, Firestorm can only create items whose workings are understood by the "driver" of the Firestorm matrix. Unlike a Green Lantern's creations, Firestorm's alterations are permanent unless he reverses them.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Following Raymond's resurrection during ''Brightest Day'', Firestorm gained the ability to switch "drivers" between Ronnie and Jason at will. Firestorm has also demonstrated the ability to fly at fantastic (but unmeasured) speeds, to render himself intangible and thereby pass through solid objects harmlessly, to generate destructive and concussive blasts of fusion energy from his hands, to absorb radiation harmlessly, and superhuman levels of strength and resistance to injury.

==Other versions==
Firestorm has appeared in various alternate realities within the [[DC Multiverse]]: a gender-reversed version appears in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown: The Search for Ray Palmer]]'' as an inhabitant of [[Earth-11]];<ref>''Countdown: The Search for Ray Palmer'' #1</ref> a version of the Ronnie Reymond Firestorm appeared in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', as a captive of [[Cadmus Labs]];<ref>''JLA: The Nail'' #2-3</ref> a '''Firestork''' in ''[[Just'a Lotta Animals]]'';<ref>''Captain Carrot and his Amazing Crew'' #1</ref> a Firestorm of a Justice League 100 years in the future, where [[Maxwell Lord]] has plunged humanity into a massive [[Metahuman]] war appeared in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'';<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14</ref> and a merger of Ronnie Raymond and [[Nathaniel Adam]] of [[Earth-37]] called '''Quantum-Storm''' was summoned by [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] in the mini-series ''[[Countdown: Arena]]''.<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #1-4</ref>

===Earth-3===
During the "[[Trinity War]]" event, Firestorm's [[Crime Syndicate of America#The New 52|Crime Syndicate]] counterpart is introduced as Deathstorm from [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]].<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #23</ref> It is revealed that on Earth-3, Professor Martin Stein would experiment on humans to unlock the secret of life through death. He was recruited by one of the Crime Syndicate's enemy's to determine what the Syndicate's individual weaknesses were. However, he used the new lab he was in to continue his human experimentation, eventually experimenting on himself, fusing with a corpse, becoming Deathstorm.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=Reis, Ivan|inker=Prado, Joe, Eber Ferreira, Rob Hunter, Andy Lanning|colorist=Reis, Rod, Tomeu Morey, Tony Avina|letterer=Napolitano, Nick J.|story=Forever Numb|title=Justice League|volume=2|issue=26|date=February 2013|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> He is killed by Mazahs who then steals his powers.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref>

==In other media==

===Animation===
* Firestorm appeared in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (the last two ''Super Friends'' series). Ronnie Raymond was voiced by [[Mark L. Taylor]] while Martin Stein was voiced by [[Olan Soule]] in the first series and by [[Ken Sansom]] in the second series.

* Firestorm was among the myriad planned guest stars in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]]. ''JLU'' writer/producer [[Dwayne McDuffie]] said the producers had permission from DC Comics to use Firestorm, but the show's creators could not come up with a story using him that they liked.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine #197, McDuffie revealed that the producers intended to use the Raymond and Stein version of Firestorm for the series. Firestorm has appeared in issues #3 and 16 of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited|JLU]]'' tie-in comic. He was to have been the focus character for the episode "The Greatest Story Never Told", but was replaced by [[Booster Gold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode33/episode33.htm |title=The Justice League Watchtower: The Greatest Story Never Told |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>

* On the [[animated]] TV series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', a combination of both versions of Firestorm appeared in the episode "A Bat Divided!" with Jason Rusch voiced by [[Tyler James Williams]] and Ronnie Raymond voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]. This version consisted of the body and mind of Jason, an intelligent youngster and the muscle of ex-jock Ronnie Raymond (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]), who were caught in the middle of the nuclear accident that created Firestorm. Producer James Tucker observed that because in this version "the smart kid has the body and he's got this dumb guy in his head telling him stuff... it's kind of a total flip of the original Firestorm."<ref>Sands, Rich. "Winter Sci-fi Preview" ''[[TV Guide]]''; November 23, 2009; Page 31</ref> In the actual episode, Jason and his coach Ronnie are fused together by supercharged nuclear energy during an accident at a nuclear plant they are attending for a class trip. After being given a containment suit by Batman, Jason and Ronnie use their abilities to stop [[Doctor Double X]]. Jason decides on the name Firestorm in the episode's final scene, despite Ronnie's protests that he likes the name "Flame Dude." In "The Siege of Starro! Part One", Firestorm, Booster Gold, B'wana Beast and Captain Marvel help Batman fight Starro, and when Billy Batson is possessed by a Starro clone, Firestorm realises that he can free him by overloading the Starro clone with energy. When Billy cries "Shazam!" and the lightning hits Starro, Firestorm hits upon the idea to use the lightning against Starro to defeat him. Firestorm returns in the teaser for "Darkseid Descending!" where Ronnie's ex-girlfriend [[Killer Frost]] attacked his class until she was stopped by Firestorm and Batman.

===Live action===
* Firestorm appeared on the [[CW Television Network|CW]] series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', with Ronnie Raymond portrayed by [[Robbie Amell]],<ref name="Amell1">{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/the-flash-robbie-amell-firestorm-ronnie-raymond-1201259682/|title=‘The Flash’: Robbie Amell Cast as Firestorm|work=[[Variety Magazine]]|date=July 9, 2014|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref> Dr. Martin Stein portrayed by [[Victor Garber]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/the-flash-casting-victor-garber-dr-martin-stein-848514/|title=‘The Flash’ Casting: Victor Garber To Recur As Dr. Martin Stein|publisher=[[Deadline.com]]|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> and Jason Rusch portrayed by Luc Roderique.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=57012</ref> Ronnie is first seen in the episode "Things You Can't Outrun". Nine months prior to the main story, he and his fiancée [[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] are attending the celebratory launch of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]' particle accelerator on which Ronnie worked as a structural engineer. When it starts to malfunction and is compromised, Ronnie enters the accelerator's main chamber in order to manually redirect the explosion and prevent it from destroying the building and hitting the city apparently sacrificing himself in the process. Ronnie appears in the eighth episode of the series "Flash vs. Arrow" when he's shown to have survived the accident and gained metahuman fire abilities including Firestorm's flaming appearance and the ability to spontaneously create fire. Ronnie is seen in the midseason finale "The Man in the Yellow Suit" after Caitlin and Cisco Ramon locate him at which point he denies being Ronnie Raymond identifying himself only as Firestorm. Before [[Reverse-Flash]] can kill the Flash at the end of the episode, Firestorm interferes and strikes Reverse-Flash with a fireball causing Reverse-Flash to change course and escape. Firestorm then tells Caitlin to stop looking for him and flies away.

===Film===
* The Jason Rusch version of Firestorm appears in ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' voiced by [[Cedric Yarbrough]]. He has a brief appearance, but it is not clear if he is merged with Stein or Raymond or operating on his own. Batman, realizing that he is outnumbered by several super-villains from a parallel earth, teleports Firestorm along with several other super-heroes to defend the base. Firestorm engages in battle with one of the "Made Men" from the alternate Earth, and is seen to use molecular manipulation powers to imprison his foe in the floor plating of the Justice League's incomplete space station. When the supervillain easily shatters the plating, Firestorm realizes that he is outmatched, and switches tactics, trying to overwhelm his opponent with energy blasts. Although he is knocked down and nearly finished by the enemy, Black Canary steps in with a well-timed scream to save him. Aside from briefly appearing in the dust of a demolished command center, we do not see him again until the end of the movie, when it is implied that Batman has invited him and the rest of the emergency help to join the Justice League. Additionally, an alternate version of Firestorm, from a parallel universe, appears briefly onscreen among the Made Men.

===Video games===
* The Ronnie Raymond version of Firestorm appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]].

===Parodies===
* The Ronnie Raymond version of Firestorm appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' [[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special|DC Comics Special]] voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]. He was featured in the second part of a segment called "Real Characters From the DC Universe" where the narrator (voiced by [[Kevin Shinick]]) of that segment doesn't take him seriously. In the third part of "Real Characters From the DC Universe," Firestorm enters where he is not happy with being lumped in with Mister Banjo (who Firestorm refers to as [[Fatty Arbuckle]]) and states that he can fly, shoot nuclear blasts, and can literally turn lead into gold. Mister Banjo states to Firestorm that his banjo costs him almost $60.00 so they both "bring a lot to the table." Firestorm ends up transmuting Mister Banjo's banjo into steel and knocks out Mister Banjo with it. Firestorm then demands from the narrator where B'Dg is and the narrator tells Firestorm that B'Dg is "down the hall, first dressing room on the right." Firestorm heads there and hits B'Dg with the banjo.
