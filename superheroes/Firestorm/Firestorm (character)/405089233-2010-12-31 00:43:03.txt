'''Firestorm''' is the name of several [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es published by [[DC Comics]]. Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein, the first Firestorm, debuted in ''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' vol. 1 #1 (March [[1978 in comics|1978]]), and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Firestorm | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 123 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Martin Stein, by himself as Firestorm, debuted in ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' vol. 2 #100 (August [[1990 in comics|1990]]), and was created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Tom Mandrake]]. Jason Rusch, the third Firestorm, debuted in ''Firestorm'' vol. 3 #1, (July 2004), and was created by [[Dan Jolley]] and [[ChrisCross]].

==Publication history==
The first ''Firestorm'' series was short-lived, cancelled abruptly in a company-wide cutback (the "[[DC Implosion]]") with #5 (the first part of a multiple-issue story) the last to be published, and #6 included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]''. Writer Conway added Firestorm to the roster of ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]''. This led to a series of 8-page stories in the back of ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' (with art by [[George Pérez]]), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982. ''The Fury of Firestorm'' (later called ''Firestorm: the Nuclear Man'') lasted from [[1982 in comics|1982]] until [[1990 in comics|1990]].

A new ''Firestorm'' series began in [[2004 in comics|2004]] with a new character, Jason Rusch, in the role. Like his predecessors, Jason had a sense of humor which he often used to hide his insecurities.

==Fictional character biography==
===Ronnie Raymond===
{{main|Firestorm (Ronald Raymond)}}
The original Firestorm was distinguished by his integrated dual identity. [[High school]] student '''Ronnie Raymond''' and [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physics|physicist]] '''Martin Stein''' were caught in a nuclear accident that allowed them to fuse into the "nuclear man" Firestorm. Due to Stein's being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures.<ref name="dc-ency"/>
After the accident that created him, Firestorm took to defending [[New York]] from such threats as [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] (created in the same nuclear accident that produced Firestorm) and [[Killer Frost]].  The 1982 series began with the teenaged Raymond adjusting to his newfound role and later delved into the issue of the [[nuclear arms race]] and Firestorm’s role as an "[[elemental]]." Subsequently, Raymond was killed during the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' mini-series. He was later reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the [[Blackest Night]] event, and was also resurrected at the end of the event.

===Martin Stein===
By ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' vol. 2 #100, Martin Stein learned that he was destined to be the true fire elemental and would have been were it not for Ronnie Raymond also being there by circumstance. Raymond and Mikhail Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein, now Firestorm, was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. He thereafter spent many years traveling through space as a wanderer, returning to earth on only two occasions: the ''War of the Gods'' crossover event, and again in ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #5, where Stein cured Raymond of his [[leukemia]] and allowed Raymond to retain the original Firestorm persona on his own.<ref>As seen in ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' vol. 2 #100 (August 1990)</ref>

===Jason Rusch===
{{main|Firestorm (Jason Rusch)}}
In [[2004 in comics|2004]], DC revived the ''Firestorm'' comic for a third time; instead of Ronnie Raymond, there was a new protagonist, '''Jason Rusch''', a black teenager. The [[Martian Manhunter]] explained in the latter issue that he examined the new Firestorm's mind telepathically for any trace of Raymond, but could not find any, which would have seemed to indicate that Raymond was indeed gone. Raymond returned within the Firestorm matrix in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #9, and remained with Jason as part of Firestorm until he appeared to dissipate in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #13.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Firestorm appeared in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (the last two ''Super Friends'' series). [[Mark L. Taylor]] provided Ronnie Raymond's voice while [[Olan Soule]] portrayed Martin Stein. The crew responsible for the first series depicted the flames on Firestorm's head as a static, fire-shaped ornament. The second series' authors made another change, transforming the hair into a waved haircut.
* Firestorm was among the myriad planned guest stars in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]]. ''JLU'' writer/producer [[Dwayne McDuffie]] said the producers had permission from DC Comics to use Firestorm, but the show's creators could not come up with a story using him that they liked.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine #197, McDuffie revealed that the producers intended to use the Raymond and Stein version of Firestorm for the series. Firestorm has appeared in issues #3 and 16 of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited|JLU]]'' tie-in comic. He was to have been the focus character for the episode "The Greatest Story Never Told", but was replaced by Booster Gold.<ref>[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode33/episode33.htm The Justice League Watchtower: The Greatest Story Never Told]</ref>
* On the [[animated]] TV series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', a combination of both versions Firestorm appeared in the episode "A Bat Divided!". This version consisted of the body of Jason, an intelligent youngster (voiced by [[Tyler James Williams]]), and the mind of ex-jock [[Ronnie Raymond]] (voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]]), who were caught in the middle of the nuclear accident that created Firestorm. Producer James Tucker observed that because in this version "the smart kid has the body and he's got this dumb guy in his head telling him, stuff...it's kind of a total flip of the original Firestorm."<ref>Sands, Rich. "Winter Sci-fi Preview" ''[[TV Guide]]''; November 23, 2009; Page 31</ref> In the actual episode, Jason and his coach Ronnie are fused together by supercharged nuclear energy during an accident at a nuclear plant they are attending for a class trip. After being given a containment suit by Batman, Jason and Ronnie use their abilities to stop [[Doctor Double X]]. Jason decides on the name Firestorm in the episode's final scene, despite Ronnie's protests that he likes the name "Flame Dude." In "The Siege of Starro! Part One", Firestorm, Booster Gold, B'wana Beast and Captain Marvel help Batman fight Starro, and when Billy Batson is possessed by a Starro clone, Firestorm realises that he can free him by overloading the Starro clone with energy. When Billy cries "Shazam!" and the lightning hits Starro, Firestorm hits upon the idea to use the lightning against Starro to defeat him. Firestorm returns in the teaser for "Darkseid Descending!".
