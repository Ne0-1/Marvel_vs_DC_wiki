'''Firestorm''' is the name of three [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es published by [[DC Comics]]. Ronnie Raymond, the first Firestorm, debuted in ''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' vol. 1 #1 (March [[1978 in comics|1978]]), and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Firestorm | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 123 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Martin Stein, the second Firestorm, debuted in ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' vol. 2 #100 (August [[1990 in comics|1990]]), and was created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Tom Mandrake]]. Jason Rusch, the third Firestorm, debuted in ''Firestorm'' vol. 3 #1, (July 2004), and was created by [[Dan Jolley]] and [[ChrisCross]].

==Publication history==
The first ''Firestorm'' series was short-lived, cancelled abruptly in a company-wide cutback (the "[[DC Implosion]]") with #5 (the first part of a multiple-issue story) the last to be distributed, and #6 included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]''. Writer Conway added Firestorm to the roster of ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]''. This led to a series of 8-page stories in the back of ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' (with art by [[George Pérez]]), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982. ''The Fury of Firestorm'' (later called ''Firestorm: the Nuclear Man'') lasted from [[1982 in comics|1982]] until [[1990 in comics|1990]].

A new ''Firestorm'' series began in [[2004 in comics|2004]] with a new character, Jason Rusch, in the role. Like his predecessors, Jason had a sense of humor which he often used to hide his insecurities.

==Fictional character biography==
===Ronnie Raymond===
{{main|Firestorm (Ronald Raymond)}}
The original Firestorm was distinguished by his integrated dual identity. [[High school]] student '''Ronnie Raymond''' and [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physics|physicist]] '''Martin Stein''' were caught in a nuclear accident that allowed them to fuse into the "nuclear man" Firestorm. Due to Stein's being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures.<ref name="dc-ency"/>
After the accident that created him, Firestorm took to defending [[New York]] from such threats as [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] (created in the same nuclear accident that produced Firestorm) and [[Killer Frost]].  The 1982 series began with the teenaged Raymond adjusting to his newfound role and later delved into the issue of the [[nuclear arms race]] and Firestorm’s role as an "[[elemental]]." Subsequently, Raymond was killed during the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' mini-series. He was later reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the [[Blackest Night]] event.

===Martin Stein===
By ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' vol. 2 #100, Martin Stein learned that he was destined to be the true fire elemental and would have been were it not for Ronnie Raymond also being there by circumstance. Raymond and Mikhail Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein, now Firestorm, was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. He thereafter spent many years traveling through space as a wanderer, returning to earth on only two occasions: the ''War of the Gods'' crossover event, and again in ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #5, where Stein cured Raymond of his [[leukemia]] and allowed Raymond to retain the original Firestorm persona on his own.<ref>As seen in ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' vol. 2 #100 (August 1990)</ref>

===Jason Rusch===
{{main|Firestorm (Jason Rusch)}}
In [[2004 in comics|2004]], DC revived the ''Firestorm'' comic for a third time; instead of Ronnie Raymond, there was a new protagonist, '''Jason Rusch''', a [[African American|black]] teenager. The [[Martian Manhunter]] explained in the latter issue that he examined the new Firestorm's mind telepathically for any trace of Raymond, but could not find any, which would have seemed to indicate that Raymond was indeed gone. Raymond returned within the Firestorm matrix in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #9, and remained with Jason as part of Firestorm until he appeared to dissipate in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #13.
