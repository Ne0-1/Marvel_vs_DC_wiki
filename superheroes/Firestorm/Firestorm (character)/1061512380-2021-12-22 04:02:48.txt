==Publication history==
The first ''Firestorm'' series was short-lived, canceled after issue 5, a victim of the company-wide "[[DC Implosion]]".<ref name="Hot-headed Hero">Conway, Gerry. "Nuclear Reactions: Just Your Average Hot-Headed Hero," ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #1 (June 1982).</ref> The sixth issue was included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]''. 

Writer Gerry Conway added Firestorm to the roster of ''[[Justice League]] of America''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020 |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/firestor.htm |title=Firestorm, the Nuclear Man}}</ref> This led to a series of eight-page stories in the back of ''[[Flash (DC Comics character)|The Flash]]'' (issues 289–304; with art by [[George Pérez]], [[Jim Starlin]] and others), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982. ''The Fury of Firestorm'' (later called ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'') lasted from [[1982 in comics|1982]] until [[1990 in comics|1990]].

Another ''Firestorm'' series began in [[2004 in comics|2004]] with a new character in the role of Firestorm, Jason Rusch after Ronnie Raymond was killed off in the pages of ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''. Rusch was poorly received and his book was canceled after 30 issues and the Ronnie Raymond Firestorm was resurrected in the pages of ''Blackest Night''.

Yet another Firestorm title was launched in 2011. Starring both Ronnie and his successor Jason, it was one of ''[[The New 52]]'' titles launched in the wake of DC's ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crossover event. The series, ''The Fury of Firestorm the Nuclear Men'', was initially written by [[Gail Simone]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]] and drawn by [[Yıldıray Çınar]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Thu, 06/02/2011 – 10:00am |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/02/the-new-justice/ |title=The New Justice &#124; DC Comics |website=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2011-05-31 |access-date=2013-11-25}}</ref> [[Joe Harris (filmmaker)|Joe Harris]] replaced Simone starting in issue #7, while co-writer Van Sciver also provided the art for issues #7 and 8 before Çınar returned.<ref>{{cite news|title=Joe Harris Replaces Gail Simone as "Firestorm" Co-Writer| url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=35773|access-date=19 January 2012|website=CBR.com|date=6 December 2011}}</ref> Veteran writer/artist [[Dan Jurgens]] took over the series with issue #13 in 2012, until the series' end with issue #20 in 2013.

In 2016, Firestorm was one of the features in the ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' TV series, which united Martin Stein and Jefferson Jackson as Firestorm.

==Aliases==
===Ronnie Raymond/Martin Stein===
{{main|Ronnie Raymond (character)|Martin Stein}}
The original Firestorm was distinguished by his integrated dual identity. [[High school]] student '''Ronnie Raymond''' and [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physicist]] '''Martin Stein''' were caught in an accident that allowed them to fuse into Firestorm the "Nuclear Man". Due to Stein's being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind, able to offer Raymond advice on how to use their powers without actually having any control over their dual form. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Stein was initially completely unaware of their dual identity, leaving him concerned about his unusual disappearances and blackouts, but Ronnie was eventually able to convince him of the truth, allowing them to bond as separate individuals rather than as parts of a whole.

===Ronnie Raymond/Martin Stein/Mikhail Arkadin===
When Conway left the series in 1986, [[John Ostrander]] (with artist Joe Brozowski) began writing the Firestorm stories. His first major story arc pitted Firestorm against the world as the hero, acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Professor Stein, demanded that the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] destroy all of their [[nuclear weapon]]s.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #64</ref> After confrontations with the [[Justice League]] and most of his enemies, Firestorm faced the Russian nuclear superhero [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Pozhar|Pozhar]] in the [[Nevada]] desert, where an [[atomic bomb]] was dropped on them. A new Firestorm resulted, a fusion of the two heroes: this new Firestorm was composed of Ronnie Raymond and the Russian '''Mikhail Arkadin''' but controlled by the disembodied [[amnesia]]c mind of Martin Stein.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #67</ref><ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #68</ref><ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #69</ref>

===Fire Elemental===
The Firestorm with Arkadin proved to be a transitional phase, as in 1989 Ostrander fundamentally changed the character of Firestorm by revealing that Firestorm was a "Fire Elemental". Firestorm now became something of an environmental crusader, formed from Ronnie Raymond, Mikhail Arkadin, and '''Svarozhich''', a Soviet clone of the previous Firestorm, but with a new mind. Professor Stein, no longer part of the composite at all, continued to play a role, but the focus was on this radically different character.<ref name="dc-ency"/> New artist [[Tom Mandrake]] would create a new look to match. It was during this phase that Firestorm met and befriended [[Shango (DC Comics)|Sango]] and the [[Orishas (DC Comics)|Orishas]], the elemental gods of [[Nigeria]]. He also met their chief deity and Sango's older brother [[Obatala]], Lord of the White Cloth.

By the series' 100th issue, Stein learned that he was destined to be the true Fire Elemental and would have been being it not for Raymond also being there by circumstance. Raymond and Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein as Firestorm was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. He thereafter spent many years traveling through space as a wanderer, returning to Earth only rarely.

After the transition to the elemental Firestorm, all of the main characters from the series vanished from the comics for some time after the cancellation of the ''Firestorm'' comic in 1990. Raymond eventually returned in the pages of ''Extreme Justice''.<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 117 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = [[New York City|New York]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Raymond, at the time undergoing treatment for leukemia, regained his original powers after a [[chemotherapy]] session. It took the combined might of the Justice League led by [[Captain Atom]], and the returned elemental Firestorm, to restore Ronnie's health. Firestorm began to appear regularly in a number of DC titles, though lacking the guidance and knowledge necessary to use his skills wisely. Firestorm was drafted by Batman into a "replacement" Justice League that was commissioned in case something befell the original team (in this case, being stranded in the distant past in "''The Obsidian Age''" storyline). After the original team returned, Firestorm stayed on as a reserve member and participated in events such as a team-up with the [[Justice Society of America]] (in ''JLA/JSA: Virtue and Vice'') and the [[intercompany crossover]] ''[[JLA/Avengers]]''. He was also briefly a member of the [[Power Company]].

===Jason Rusch===
{{Main|Jason Rusch}}
In 2004, DC revived the ''Firestorm'' comic for the second time, with writer [[Dan Jolley]] and artist Chris Cross, but instead of the original Firestorm, Ronnie Raymond, there was a new protagonist; the teenager '''Jason Rusch'''.

Jason was a 17-year-old living in Detroit who wanted nothing more than to escape his home city. He lived with his father, who had turned abusive after he lost his hand in an industrial accident. His mother left the family sometime after the accident. With the loss of a job he needed for college tuition, Jason turned to a local thug for money, accepting a job as a courier. It was on that job that he encountered the Firestorm Matrix, searching for a new host after Ronnie Raymond's death. In the aftermath, Jason struggled to cope with his new identity and powers—a struggle that led to the death of the man who had hired him.

===Jason Rusch / Martin Stein ===
In the 2006 miniseries ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', it was revealed that Martin Stein, alive in space as the "Elemental Firestorm", had sensed the presence of Jason Rusch within the Firestorm Matrix, but was unaware of Ronnie Raymond's death. When Jason, as Firestorm, was gravely wounded in the line of duty, Stein linked with him in a variation of the merge, promising Jason a new Firestorm body to let him return into battle (although Martin had been unable to save Mick) and asking him about Ronnie's fate.

Accepting Martin's proposal, Jason asked Stein to become the permanent second member of the Firestorm Matrix. Sensing his "errors" (including Mick's death) were the result of his youth and lack of experience, he sought the experience and maturity of Stein. Stein refused at first, but later accepted Jason's request, thus ensuring both a new Firestorm body and the reconstruction of human bodies for both Rusch and Stein.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

It was revealed in ''Infinite Crisis'' that if the Multiverse had survived up to the present, Jason would have been a native of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Eight]].<ref>[[Johns, Geoff]]. ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 (April 2006)</ref>

===Jason Rusch / Firehawk ===
As the storyline [[One Year Later|jumped ahead one year]] (and the series itself was now re-titled as ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' from issue #23 on), Professor Stein has mysteriously vanished, and Jason Rusch has been merging with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Firehawk|Firehawk]] to become Firestorm, allowing him to use her powers as well. The two decided to look for Stein together. Stein had been kidnapped and tortured by the Pupil, a former teaching assistant of Stein's. Flanked by the D.O.L.L.I.s, a group of cyborg soldiers of limited cognitive ability, the Pupil (formerly known as Adrian Burroughs) questioned the nearly dead Stein about the secrets of the universe. Jason and Lorraine, along with the mysterious teleporter Gehenna, freed the captured Stein and restored him to full health. Jason is a college freshman at New York City's Columbus University and seems to have ties with Dani Sharpe, a member of the senior staff at [[LexCorp]].

The Firestorm team of Jason and Firehawk made several appearances across the DCU{{expand acronym|date=September 2018}} before the search for Martin Stein ended. This included dealing with the latest [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] and teaming up with [[Superman]] in the "Back in Action" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''. Firehawk later introduced Jason to [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Pozhar|Pozhar]], a Russian superhero who was once a part of the Firestorm Matrix; together, the trio takes on a newly reborn [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Tokamak|Tokamak]]. This series ended with ''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' #35 (April 2007).

===Jason Rusch / Ronnie Raymond ===
{{plot|date=September 2021}}
In the 2009–2010 ''[[Blackest Night]]'' miniseries, Ronnie Raymond is called by a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] to join the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. In the following issue, his reanimated corpse is shown confronting [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] alongside [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], [[Kendra Saunders|Hawkgirl]], the [[Elongated Man]], [[Sue Dibny]], and [[J'onn J'onzz]].<ref name="bn2">''Blackest Night'' #2 (August 2009)</ref> He then attacks Jason Rusch (the current Firestorm), and absorbs him into his own version of the Firestorm Matrix. Then, using Jason's unique abilities, he turns [[Gehenna (comics)|Gehenna]] into table salt, simultaneously ripping her heart out with a smile. He uses the Firestorm Matrix to absorb Jason's anger over Gehenna's death, providing the Black Lanterns with even more emotional energies.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He goes on to attack Barry and co. at the Justice League satellite. Jason then briefly asserts himself, allowing the heroes to escape. Regaining control, Ronnie proceeds to absorb Jason's willpower. Like other Black Lanterns, the undead Firestorm mimics the personality of Ronnie Raymond, often wisecracking and exhibiting other stereotypical teenage behavior.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4 (October 2009)</ref> In the final battle against Nekron, Ronnie is restored to life alongside Jason, the two separating from Firestorm. Ronnie is confused, asking the Atom where Professor Stein is while Jason is upset with Ronnie killing Gehenna. Ronnie, however, apparently has no memory of doing so.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>

In the 2010–2011 ''[[Brightest Day]]'' miniseries, Ronnie Raymond, still clad in casual clothing from a wild party the night before, arrives at Jason Rusch's apartment with Professor Stein and [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] to attend Gehenna's funeral. Stein and Palmer discuss Ron's return and how he no longer remembers anything since his death at the hands of Shadow Thief. While the two talk about the paperwork needed to have Ronnie's legal status as "dead" reversed, Ron approaches Jason and offers an apology for Gehenna's murder. Jason refuses to accept it, telling Ronnie that he forced him into being an accomplice to his own girlfriend's death and that he probably doesn't even remember her name. When Ronnie is actually unable to remember Gehenna's name, Jason angrily lashes out and punches him in the face. This causes the two young men to merge into Firestorm, and they begin arguing inside the Matrix while Palmer transforms into the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] in order to help them separate.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref><ref>''Brightest Day'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>

Palmer manages to separate Jason and Ronnie, but not before the Firestorm matrix causes a huge explosion, transmuting everything in the Professor's laboratory into table salt.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> While recovering in the hospital, Stein explains to Ronnie that it seems to be very dangerous to fuse into Firestorm again. Also, it is revealed that Ronnie, after quickly leaving the hospital and being threatened by Jason's father to stay away from Jason, lied to everyone, as he seems to perfectly remember murdering Gehenna as a Black Lantern.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #3 (June 2010)</ref>

Sometime after the forceful separation, he lies sleeping in preparation for a party, when a previously heard voice prods him awake—a monstrous construct of Gehenna, made totally of table salt, which proceeds to throttle and choke him, taunting him to remember her name; while she is interrupted before killing him, Ronnie is left covered in table salt.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #4 (June 2010)</ref> Not too long after, he is lying, recovering from a massive binge, when Jason again forces the merger to help several construction workers endangered when the girders at the site are transmuted without warning into bubble gum. This time, they again hear the mysterious voice taunting them, and Ronnie accepts he remembers killing Gehenna, and they realize something else is lurking from within the Firestorm Matrix.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #6 (July 2010)</ref>

As Firestorm, Ronnie and Jason visit Stein in an attempt to find out what is happening to them. Stein reveals to them that the Black Lantern Firestorm still exists in the Firestorm Matrix. Firestorm is then told by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] that they must learn from each other and defeat the Black Lantern Firestorm before he destroys the Entity. Somehow, Jason and Ronnie trade places.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref>

After running a test, Professor Stein reveals the origin of the Firestorm Matrix. Stein believes that during the initial experiment he was able to capture the spark that preceded the Big Bang that created our universe, thereby making the matrix a trigger for a new Big Bang. If the boys continue to experience emotional imbalance, they increase the likelihood of triggering a new Big Bang. After explaining this to the boys, the voice inside them speaks again. Declaring that it is not the Matrix, a pair of black hands reach out from inside Firestorm. Forcibly separating Jason and Ronnie, the Black Lantern Firestorm stands between them, separate from both Ronnie and Jason and apparently calling itself "Deathstorm".<ref>''Brightest Day'' #10 (September 2010)</ref>

Deathstorm reveals its plan to Stein, stating that it intends to create enough emotional instability between Ronnie and Jason that the Matrix will trigger another Big Bang, thereby destroying all life in the universe. In order to help accomplish this goal, Deathstorm absorbs Stein's mind in order to use his knowledge of Ronnie against him; then, to torture Jason, Deathstorm brings his father, Alvin Rusch, to the lab and absorbs him as well. Taking flight, Deathstorm beckons Ronnie and Jason (now merged into Firestorm) to follow it. Deathstorm leads them to Silver City, New Mexico, and the resting place of the Central Power White Lantern Battery. Deathstorm tries to lift the battery but is unable to until he infects it with black energy, after which he is able to lift it with ease. After he threatens to destroy the White Lantern Battery and therefore prevent Ronnie and Jason to truly live, a voice beckons him not to. The voice, commands him to bring the Central Power White Lantern Battery to the voice as well as an army, at which point Deathstorm brings back the Black Lantern versions of [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash]], [[Maxwell Lord]], the [[Hank Hall|Hawk]], [[Jade (DC Comics)|Jade]], [[Captain Boomerang]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Aquaman]], Hawkman, Hawkgirl, [[Deadman (comics)|Deadman]] and [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #11 (October 2010)</ref>

Deathstorm and the Black Lanterns teleport to an unknown location, while Firestorm (Jason and Ronnie) ultimately seek help from the Justice League.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #12 (October 2010)</ref> Firestorm arrives at the Hall of Justice asking for help.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #15 (December 2010)</ref> Firestorm is placed in a containment chamber while the League search for a way to stabilize the energy. However, an internal argument between Ronnie and Jason ignites the spark, apparently resulting in the destruction of the universe.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #16 (December 2010)</ref> Ronnie and Jason quickly notice, after defeating a hive of Shadow Demons, that the universe was not destroyed as they thought, but they were actually transported to the Anti-Matter Universe. There, they are contacted by the Entity, who reveals to them that, since [[Boston Brand]] has not yet found the one who will take the Entity's place, it is Firestorm's mission to protect the Entity.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #17 (January 2011)</ref> Meanwhile, Deathstorm and the Black Lanterns are shown on [[Qward]] delivering the White Battery to someone.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)</ref> That someone is revealed to be the [[Anti-Monitor]], seeking to harvest the life energy within the Lantern to grow stronger. Firestorm takes the White Lantern and attempts to fight the Anti-Monitor, but is defeated. Deathstorm then brings Professor Stein out of his Matrix to taunt the two with. Deathstorm then attempts to turn Ronnie into table salt, but the Professor takes the brunt of the attack. Angered, Ronnie decides to truly work together with Jason to avenge the Professor. The Entity then declares that Ronnie has accomplished his mission, returning life to him in a burst of white energy that obliterates the Black Lanterns, returns Jason's father to his home, and deposits Firestorm in the [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] forest. Ronnie angrily attempts to make the Entity resurrect the Professor, but is refused. Deadman then arrives, demanding that he be given the White Lantern.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #22 (March 2011)</ref>

When the "Dark Avatar" made his presence known, Firestorm is part of the Elementals. Ronnie was then transformed by the Entity to become the element of fire and protect the Star City Forest from the "Dark Avatar" which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the [[Swamp Thing]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, the Swamp Thing brought Firestorm back to normal. Afterward, Ronnie and Jason must find a way to contain their Firestorm matrix from the explosion in less than 90 days.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

After the events of the 2011 ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' storyline, ''[[The New 52]]'' reality altered Firestorm's personal history to the point of it being completely restarted.

Sharing the identity of Firestorm, with Ronnie being the brawn and Jason being the brains, Firestorm is considered for recruitment into the Justice League along with several other heroes. They play a large part in the events leading up to the Trinity War, the three-way battle among the Justice League (the original team headed by [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]), the Justice League of America (the A.R.G.U.S.-sponsored team led by [[Steve Trevor]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Amanda Waller]]), and Justice League Dark (the paranormal team consisting of John Constantine, Zatanna, and the Phantom Stranger). When Superman is framed for the death of Dr. Light and the League is taken into custody, Amanda Waller has Firestorm experiment on their ability to create certain elements: specifically, the mass production of kryptonite. It turns out that the two are indeed capable of using their powers to create it, but with some difficulty. However, this ultimately becomes moot once the Trinity War leads to the invasion of the Crime Syndicate, who supposedly kills the Justice League. In fact, the League is trapped inside Firestorm by his Earth-3 counterpart Deathstorm (a combination of Martin Stein and a corpse he experimented upon), with only Batman and Catwoman escaping the initial fracas. The Leagues are presumed dead for a time but are eventually freed from captivity after the Syndicate is defeated by Batman and Lex Luthor's Injustice League, Batman using Wonder Woman's [[Lasso of Truth]] to draw her and the others out of Firestorm.

===''DC Rebirth''===
In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Firestorm becomes a subject of controversy after claims arise stating that he was created by the American government. Firestorm profanely denounces the "Superman Theory" and insults his Russian counterpart Pozhar, much to the dismay of Martin Stein.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Firestorm subsequently becomes embroiled in a fight with several Russian superheroes before appearing to inadvertently turn a crowd of civilian protesters into a glass (a feat previously deemed beyond his capabilities). Firestorm flees with the body of an affected child and is found in hiding at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Ukraine]] by Superman. With Superman's encouragement, Firestorm returns the child to normal. Firestorm and Superman return to the affected crowd and are engaged by the Russian military. The area then becomes engulfed in an explosion of blue light.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #8 (December 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Subsequent discoveries reveal that the 'Superman Theory' is actually partially correct, as Stein deliberately engineered the creation of Firestorm to make himself a superhuman, even if Raymond genuinely had no idea of this until recently.

==Powers and abilities==
Firestorm has the ability to rearrange molecular or particle structures of any substance into most anything else, creating different atomic structures of equal mass. He can transmute the basic composition of an object (e.g., transmuting lead into gold) and can also change its shape or form at will. Much like Green Lantern's limitations, Firestorm can only create items whose workings are understood by the "driver" of the Firestorm Matrix, through he can make more complex sentient constructs out of the Matrix's energies. Unlike Green Lantern's creations, Firestorm's alterations are permanent unless he reverses them.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Initially, he could not affect organic matter without painful, even lethal, feedback (i.e., fatal biophysical disruption or even localized particle motion phenomena like extreme changes in the weather). It was later revealed that Firestorm could always change organic matter, but opted not to. As Jason Rusch became Firestorm, however, this weakness appeared to have dissipated. With old and new variations, the organic limitation does not extend to his own person, as its users can molecularly change their driver self at will, allowing them to regenerate lost or damaged bodily tissue, boost immune systems, shape-shift, increase physical capabilities and survive indefinitely without food, sleep, water or air.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #35</ref> Capacities as such produce superhuman levels of strength, durability, stamina and resistance to injury great enough to challenge the New Gods—the likes of Orion, [[Lashina]], or an empowered Kalibak—or surviving the rigors of outer space and sitting near the inner corona above the sun's photosphere without discomfort.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #25</ref> Firestorm's power has been stated by Prof. Stein to be theoretically infinite, harnessing the spark of creation, the [[Big Bang]] itself. However, infinite power runs the risk of burning out its host.

While the Firestorm Matrix can be utilized by a singular host driver—as was the case with Ronnie, Stein, and Rusch—it is not recommended.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #14–17</ref> The Matrix functions best with two people, a pilot and secondary, to comprehend and master it. Martin instructed Rusch on how to study current and potential powers available to them within the Matrix and to manually adjust them on the fly at a later date. Its main source of energy stemmed from the ambient stellar energies of native stars and suns but could also use its co-pilot as a power source, though they will burn out over time and genetically disintegrate if not properly adjusted to its power.<ref name="Firestorm vol. 3 #22">''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #22</ref>

The merging aspect of the Matrix can enable outside fusions which assimilate any inherent abilities these others might possess. However, this can diminish its effectiveness and stability.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #17</ref> Rusch has shown he can spontaneously warp himself and others he had previously merged with to his specific location, triggering the neural pathway connection and allowing the gestalt to access each other's knowledge and memories to better utilize Firestorm's capabilities. Users of the Firestorm Matrix can access a type of ancestral memory from the continuum of past Matrix users, allowing them to access the latest knowledge of the atoms comprising it. This also translates into a form of time-space sight in which the Matrix user can glimpse the past, present, future, and alternate lives of every other Firestorm throughout reality using a collective of subatomic wormholes which exist as a part of the Matrix. This power is too complex to properly control; thus, it has been highly unreliable as an ability.

The driver can fly at supersonic speeds in an atmosphere and reach escape velocities. The driver can also adjust the driver's body's size or pull and enlarge others from the subatomic universe at will, Rusch having once dragged [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] from his microscopic size to the natural world while on Apokolips.<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #8</ref> Manipulation of the self at the subatomic level allows the driver to become intangible and pass through solid objects. This allowed Rusch to communicate with John Stewart and sift through his mind telepathically after he had been taken over by the void beast.<ref>''Trinity'' #21</ref> Firestorm is also adept at absorbing and redistributing radiation or energy both harmlessly and productively (such as in ''Green Lantern: Circle of Fire'' #7, having both absorbed Zeta Radiation from [[Adam Strange]]'s body and repurposed it to turn a universe-destroying quasar back onto itself and absorb the fallout from a massive nuclear detonation).<ref>''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' (vol. 3) #23</ref>) He can generate destructive or concussive blasts of nuclear energy, through which he can also channel his transmogrification powers.<ref>''Firestorm the Nuclear Man'' (vol. 3) #34</ref>

While the Matrix grants the fusers unique powers, it can also accidentally bestow them on individuals caught in the Matrix by mistake. One example is Nanette Phaedon, wife of the late Allen Phaedon, who gained the ability to change her quantum state for size-shifting and flight by her own will.<ref name="Firestorm vol. 3 #22"/> Following Raymond's resurrection during ''Brightest Day'', Firestorm gained the ability to switch "drivers" between Ronnie and Jason at will; before that, only the active driver was in control, with the dormant consciousness only able to advise the other on what action to take. One of the faults of a Firestorm fusion is that the stronger psyche will have dominance of the Matrix's power, such as when Jason fused with Luis Salvador who overpowered him from the passenger seat of the Matrix.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 3) #7</ref>

During ''[[The New 52]]'', the Firestorm Matrix could be shared through multiple users at a time. Users could fuse and become stronger, but more unstable. The entity formed between Ronnie and Jason when using the Matrix in tandem created a nuclear being called "the Fury". It was also shown that The Matrix shares a kinship to the Quantum Field in some way, enabling Firestorm users to derive its power for subatomic transmutation and manipulation.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #3–4</ref> Some believe it is key to the fabled [[God particle]] theory. Its merging properties can place a large burden on the user; Firestorm runs the risk of reaching critical mass and detonating.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref> At worst, the fusion of too many users in the Matrix could trigger a second Big Bang.

==Other versions==
Firestorm has appeared in various alternate realities within the [[DC Multiverse]]: a gender-reversed version appears in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown: The Search for Ray Palmer]]'' as an inhabitant of [[Earth-11]];<ref>''Countdown: The Search for Ray Palmer'' #1</ref> a version of the Ronnie Raymond Firestorm appeared in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', as a captive of [[Cadmus Labs]];<ref>''JLA: The Nail'' #2–3</ref> a '''Firestork''' of the [[Just'a Lotta Animals]];<ref>''Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew!'' #14</ref> a Firestorm of a Justice League 100 years in the future, where [[Maxwell Lord]] has plunged humanity into a massive [[metahuman]] war, appeared in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'',<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14</ref> and a merger of Ronnie Raymond and [[Nathaniel Adam]] of [[Earth-37]] called '''Quantum-Storm''' who was summoned by [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] in the miniseries ''[[Countdown: Arena]]''.<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #1–4</ref>

* Firestorm first appears on the 2014 series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', with Ronnie Raymond and Professor Martin Stein as the two halves. Ronnie is an engineer at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and Caitlin's fiancé while Professor Stein is the creator of the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. matrix. Ronnie is presumed deceased from the particle accelerator explosion while saving his co-workers' lives. However, he survived and merged with Stein, having the matrix on his persons, to become the entity later named Firestorm. The two spend months trapped together, with Stein in primary control of Firestorm, until Caitlin discovers information from Jason Rusch (Luc Roderique),<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=57012 | title= Roderique Cast As 'The Flash's' Jason Rusch | date= 11 November 2014 | first= Steve |last= Sunu | website= Comic Book Resources|access-date= 8 January 2015}}</ref> Stein's old assistant. [[Harrison Wells]] manages to separate the two, and they eventually learn to control their shared powers.

After the deaths of Eddie and Ronnie, Professor Stein becomes a member of Team Flash as the group's scientific advisor. Eventually, Stein begins exhibiting symptoms that the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. matrix has become unstable without a partner, endangering his life. When Team Flash searches for a likely candidate among people who have been affected by the dark matter explosion in a similar manner who also possess the same blood type, Jax Jackson ultimately becomes the new partner. A former high school football star (like Ronnie in the comics), Jax gets injured by the particle accelerator explosion, ending his collegiate career before starting. Jax is hesitant at first to become Firestorm's new half but agrees when the [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Tokamak|only other candidate]] uses the powers for revenge. Jax and Stein later leave Central City to train in using their Firestorm powers. When Barry, Cisco, and Harry Wells travel to [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]], Deathstorm (Ronnie Raymond's Earth-2 counterpart) is encountered. In addition to being Killer Frost's significant other, Deathstorm is Ronnie in control as he has not let his partner out in years and can no longer hear him. When Deathstorm and his boss Reverb nearly kills Barry, [[Hunter Zolomon (Arrowverse)|Zoom]] kills Reverb and Deathstorm both, leaving Killer Frost to mourn Ronnie's death.
* Firestorm also appears in the spin-off ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', with Martin Stein and Jax Jackson as the two halves, while [[Graeme McComb]] portrays the former's younger incarnation. In [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 1)|season one]], Jax initially does not want to participate in [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]]'s mission, to the extent that Stein has to knock him out to get on board the timeship. Eventually, Jax starts to appreciate being part of the team. During a trip to 1986, Stein is forcibly merged with '''[[Valentina Vostok]]''' to create a '''Soviet Firestorm''', but he is able to break free of the sociopathic villain with Jax's encouragement; the separation and improper merge trigger an explosion that apparently kills Vostok. The season one finale introduces Firestorm's ability to transmute matter, subsequently turning a meteor into the water before [[Vandal Savage (Arrowverse)|Vandal Savage]] could use it as part of a complex plan to undo history. In [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|season two]], Stein briefly takes on the role of team leader after Rip Hunter is lost in the timestream as the team's most experienced member, before handing the reins to [[Sara Lance]] as he recognizes that she is more qualified in this area. During a trip to 1987, Stein has an encounter with his younger self, during which he berates his younger self for his attitude towards his wife. When Stein returns to the present in the "[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion]]" crossover, he discovers that the exchange has led to him now having a daughter named Lily. Initially, Stein views Lily as a temporal paradox, but eventually becomes close and protective to Lily, thus accepting his new life as a parent. By [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 3)|season three]], Stein has become a grandfather after Lily has a son named Ronnie (named after her grandfather's original Firestorm partner), prompting Jax to ask [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] for help in working out how they might separate the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. matrix so that Jax can channel the power on his own. During the "[[Crisis on Earth-X]]" crossover, Stein is badly injured trying to help the heroes escape Earth-X and Jax gets injured as well due to the connection of the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. matrix. Stein sacrifices himself by drinking the formula created to separate the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. matrix, saving Jax's life. Afterward, Jax, still distraught over Stein's death, attempts to change history when he comes in contact with a version of Stein from 1992 that has been displaced into the 11th century, but the younger Stein rejects the offer to avoid the risk of negatively changing history, prompting Jax to depart the Legends to heal from his grief. Jax returns in season three's finale to help the Legends in the final battle against the demon Mallus. This version of Jax is presented as having been away from the team for five years, now happily married with a daughter named Martina after his deceased partner.
