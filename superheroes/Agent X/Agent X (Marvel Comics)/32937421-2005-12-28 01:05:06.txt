|}} '''Agent X''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[mercenary]] whose adventures have been published by [[Marvel Comics]].  He first appeared in ''Agent X'' #1 (Sept 2002), by [[Gail Simone]] and [[UDON]]. That series, a pseudo-[[spinoff]] of ''[[Deadpool]]'', continued the cynical, slapstick, and highly-polished action which had characterized its parent series. Indeed, a central feature of ''Agent X'' was the question of the title character's identity, sometimes implied to be Deadpool himself.

==Publication history==
''Agent X'' was born out of Marvel Comics' long-running ''[[Deadpool]]'' series, whose sales had slumped to cancellation point, with experiments including the "miniseries within a series" ''Deadpool: Agent of Weapon X'' and ''Deadpool: Funeral for a Freak'', where the main series' numbering was demoted to secondary status below the "miniseries" numbering, having failed to stymie the leak.  The decision was then taken to run a "final arc" to close the series, then restart it from #1 with an X in the title in an attempt to more closely identify it with their popular [[X-Men]] franchise (as part of the same effort, ''Cable'' was changed to ''[[Soldier X]]'' to poor reviews). Online humourist [[Gail Simone]] was chosen to write both ''Deadpool'''s final arc and the new series, with the [[UDON]] studio, who had recently revamped the [[Taskmaster]] in a well-received miniseries, to supply the art.

Unlike ''Soldier X'', Simone chose to replace Deadpool with a similar protagonist, while throwing out ambigous hints as to the nature of his relationship with Deadpool. However, while her and UDON's issues of both ''Deadpool'' and ''Agent X'' were well-received critically and increased sales, behind-the-scenes they clashed with editor Andrew Lis, who had joined the team as editor with ''Agent X'' #1, who frequently insisted on often-minor changes (one particularly infamous example quoted involved a wall in issue 2 "not being dirty enough", which caused a week's delay in the issue). Eventually, this caused Simone and UDON to leave the book after issue 7, with the protagonist's true identity still unrevealed.

The book's sales then suffered badly under a series of fill-ins, which recived mixed critical reviews, and it was eventually cancelled with #12. However, shortly after this announcement, Marvel decided to launch a ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' book, and, with Lis having been moved away from the editorial staff in the meantime, Simone and UDON agreed to do a three-issue arc tying up the loose ends and restoring Deadpool for use in the new book, which was published after a month's hiatus as ''Agent X'' #13-15.

==Character biography==
Agent X's real name is Nijo, though after suffering amnesia he took on the identity of Alex Hayden. His powers consist of augmented strength, agility, and dexterity and superhuman regeneration. He is a skilled marksman.

[[Image:Agentx13.jpg|thumb|left|With the rest of Agency X. Characters from left to right: Mary Zero, [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]], Agent X, [[Taskmaster]], Sandi Brandenberg]] He is a combined consciousness, residing in the body of the man named Nijo but possessing certain abilities and mental attributes of [[Deadpool]] and the telepathic marksman known as the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]].

He founded the mercenary outfit Agency X, with his girlfriend (and fellow mercenary) [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]], [[Taskmaster]] and managed by Deadpool's ex-business manager Sandi Brandenberg. He has been aided by a young [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] girl called Mary Zero whose power means no-one but him is able to notice her.

Eventually, the Black Swan showed up with a "tabula rasa" Deadpool in tow (who Hayden immediately shot in the head). It was revealed that "Hayden" was really the corpse of Nijo, the Swan's former partner, which had been revived and given Deadpool's healing factor by Swan's out of control mental powers (Swan had also received a copy of the healing factor), and whose mind was created from an amalgam of Deadpool and the Swan. And that Deadpool's personality was growing back (unwittingly accelerated by Hayden's bullet to his head).

In an attempt to regain the parts of his mind he had lost, as well as remove the pieces of their minds he wanted rid of ("You and Wilson have my skills, Mr Hayden. In return, I received a taste for Radiohead and an encyclopediac knowledge of pornographic knock-knock jokes. Yes, I'd like to switch back if possible"), including Nijo's sense of honour, they performed a three-way mind meld, which restored Deadpool (who immediately stabbed the Swan in the back) and  Hayden, Deadpool, Outlaw and Taskmaster killed (and stuffed) the Swan when he immediately tried to kill them.

Since the conclusion of the Agent X series, Agent X has appeared in two issues of [[Cable and Deadpool]], wherein he was hired to kill Deadpool and stop him from resurrecting [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].
