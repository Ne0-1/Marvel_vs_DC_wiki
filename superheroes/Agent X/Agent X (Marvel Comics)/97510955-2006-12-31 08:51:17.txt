|}} '''Agent X''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[mercenary]] whose adventures have been published by [[Marvel Comics]].  He first appeared in ''Agent X'' #1 (Sept 2002), by [[Gail Simone]] and [[UDON]]. That series, a pseudo-[[spinoff]] of ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'', continued the cynical, slapstick, and highly-polished action which had characterized its parent series. Indeed, a central feature of ''Agent X'' was the question of the title character's identity, sometimes implied to be Deadpool himself.

==Publication history==
''Agent X'' was born out of Marvel Comics' long-
running ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' series, whose sales had slumped to cancellation point, with experiments including the "miniseries within a series" ''Deadpool: Agent of Weapon X'' and ''Deadpool: Funeral for a Freak'', where the main series' numbering was demoted to secondary status below the "miniseries" numbering, having failed to stymie the leak.  The decision was then taken to run a "final arc" to close the series, then restart it from #1 with an X in the title in an attempt to more closely identify it with their popular [[X-Men]] franchise (as part of the same effort, ''Cable'' was changed to ''[[Soldier X]]'' to poor reviews). Online humourist [[Gail Simone]] was chosen to write both ''Deadpool'''s final arc and the new series, with the [[UDON]] studio, who had recently revamped the [[Taskmaster]] in a well-received miniseries, to supply the art.

Unlike ''[[Soldier X]]'', Simone chose to replace Deadpool with a similar protagonist, while including ambiguous hints as to the nature of his relationship with Deadpool. However, while her and UDON's issues of both ''Deadpool'' and ''Agent X'' were well-received critically and increased sales, behind-the-scenes they clashed with editor Andrew Lis, who had joined the team as editor with ''Agent X'' #1, who frequently insisted on often-minor changes (one particularly infamous example quoted involved demand to "make the walls dirtier"  [http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=1430]). Eventually, this caused Simone and UDON to leave the book after issue 7, with the protagonist's true identity still unrevealed.

The book's sales then suffered badly under a series of fill-ins, which received mixed critical reviews, and it was eventually cancelled with #12. However, shortly after this announcement, Marvel decided to launch a ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' book, and, with Lis having been moved away from the editorial staff in the meantime, Simone and UDON agreed to do a three-issue arc tying up the loose ends and restoring Deadpool for use in the new book, which was published after a month's hiatus as ''Agent X'' #13-15.

==House of M==
An asian male wearing yellow goggles and a belt forming an X around his chest is shown under the sapiens resistance group in House of M issue 4. Its highly possible that this is Nijo since Deadpool's existence was eliminated through his dimensional jump shortly before House of M, preventing him from receiving his trademark X-scars.
