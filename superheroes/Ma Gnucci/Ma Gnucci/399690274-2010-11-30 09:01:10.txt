'''Isabella Carmela Magdelena "Ma" Gnucci''' is a [[fiction]]al villain from the ''[[Punisher]]'' comics. She was created by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Steve Dillon]], and appears in the "Welcome Back, Frank" storyline. 

==Fictional character history==
Ma is the matriarch of the Gnucci Crime Family, a [[Mafia]]-like group that controls many of the  illegal activities in [[New York]]. As such, she has subtle control over both the [[mayor]] and the police [[commissioner]]. Other members of the Family include Ma's brother, Dino and her three sons- Eddie, Bobbie and Carlo. 

As the "Welcome Back" story begins, [[Frank Castle]] throws one of Ma's sons off the [[Empire State Building]]. He does this in order to re-announce his presence to the New York [[underworld]].<ref>"Punisher" #1 (2000)</ref>

The Punisher kills more of Ma's sons. Ma hires a number of [[vigilantes]] to try and eliminate Punisher out of vengeance, but The Punisher kills all of them. He murders her consigliere Joe Malizi and takes the money Ma offered as a down payment. Frank intends to "wear down Ma's defenses" before actually killing her, thus he spends the next several weeks attacking Gnucci [[soldiers]].<ref>"Punisher" #2 (2000)</ref>

Ma's brother Dino is captured by law enforcement; his lawyer is the vigilante [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]].<ref>"Punisher" #3 (2000)</ref> The Punisher overpowers Murdock and kills Dino with a sniper rifle.  The very next night, Ma and a few of her remaining soldiers find Frank Castle outside the [[Central Park Zoo]]. Despite being outnumbered and virtually unarmed, Frank manages to fight them off, killing all the soldiers and luring her and a goon into a [[polar bear]] exhibit. Ma's ally is killed and she is mauled, losing all her limbs. She survives.<ref>"Punisher" #4 (2000)</ref>

When her cousin Stevie asks her "how she is" after her mauling, she orders one of her men to shoot her cousin. When that man hesitates, she orders another man to shoot her cousin and the first man. When that man hesitates, she orders a third man to shoot her cousin and the first two, and so on until three of her men and her cousin lie dead at her non-existent feet. She puts out a $10 million [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on the Punisher's head. A man named Al Grummet has a lead on the Punisher.<ref>"Punisher" #5 (2000)</ref>

Ma's goons torture and mutilate Spacker Dave, a man who has made himself a close friend of the Punisher.  [[Russian (comics)|The Russian]] is sent in as a follow-up.<ref>"Punisher" #8</ref>

Ma's calls for reinforcements goes unanswered, the other families are distancing themselves from her as she had lost so many men and resources. Ma Gnucci tells the mayor to stay out of the situation, as she has blackmail photos of him.<ref>"Punisher" #9-10</ref>

Anticipating victory, Ma is shocked to see Frank appear on her front lawn holding The Russian's head. The remainder of her soldiers throw down their guns and leave, saying that she "can't pay us enough to fight that." Frank then burns the Gnucci house to the ground (after raiding a safe and stealing some of Ma's money and secret documents) with Ma inside who is cursing at him all the while. Gnucci manages to attack Frank, he kicks her back into the fire.  <ref>"Punisher" #11-12 (2001)</ref>

===Inheritance===
Ma Gnucci's nephew Peter realizes he stands to inherit Ma's money, if the Punisher dies. He hires [[Deadpool]] to do this. When it is falsely assumed the Punisher is dead, Peter acquires his money in the form of a check. He loses it in traffic. By the time he realizes he can ask the bank for a new one, it is too late. A truck bounces him out of the road, to impale him on the [[Charging Bull|Wall Street Bull statue]].<ref>"Deadpool" #54-55</ref>

Six years later, it appears that Ma Gnucci has mysteriously come back from the dead; the Punisher doesn't question this and instantly blows her up with a rocket launcher. She returns again and even again. However, Ma Gnucci's reputation was being capitalized upon by the rich and murderous son of 'The Elite', a racist vigilante Frank had killed years ago. She had not actually come back, the man was using trickery to make it seem as if she did. <ref>"The Punisher War Zone" Vol2 #1-4</ref>

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Ma Gnucci is one of the villains in the 2005 ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|Punisher]]'' video game. The general plot of ''Welcome Back, Frank'' remains the same (right down to the home burning down), but the polar bear attack is not included.  Following the death of both of her sons at the hands of Castle, Ma retreats to the Gnucci mansion with her remaining guards in tow.  Frank blasts his way through her forces, and after disposing of Bushwhacker in the library he finds Ma cowering in her office.  The crime lord dies when the Punisher tosses her out of the office's third-floor window.
