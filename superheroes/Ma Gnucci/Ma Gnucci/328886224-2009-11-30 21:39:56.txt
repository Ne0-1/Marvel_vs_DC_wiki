'''Isabella Carmela Magdelena "Ma" Gnucci''' is a [[fiction]]al villain from the ''[[Punisher]]'' comics. She was created by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Steve Dillon]], and appears in the "Welcome Back, Frank" storyline. 

==Fictional character history==
Ma is the matriarch of the Gnucci Crime Family, a [[Mafia]]-like group that appears to have majority control of illegal activities in [[New York]]. As such, she has subtle control over both the [[mayor]] and the police [[commissioner]]. Other members of the Family include Ma's brother, Dino and her three sons- Eddie, Bobbie and Carlo. 

As the "Welcome Back" story begins, Frank Castle is seen killing Ma's sons in order to re-announce his presence to the New York [[underworld]]. Ma hires a number of [[vigilantes]] to try and eliminate Punisher out of vengeance, but The Punisher outsmarts all of them and takes the money Ma offered as a down payment. Frank intends to "wear down Ma's defenses" before actually killing her, thus he spends the next several weeks attacking Gnucci [[soldiers]].

Finally, Frank guns down Ma's brother Dino after a run-in with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]]. The very next night, Ma and a few of her remaining soldiers find Frank Castle outside the [[Central Park Zoo]]. Despite being outnumbered and virtually unarmed, Frank manages to fight them off, killing all the soldiers and luring her and a goon into a [[Polar bear|polar bear]] exhibit. When Punisher runs by her, Ma Gnucci see a polar bear killing that goon while the other polar bears corner Ma Gnucci. Punisher escaped from the zoo as the police arrived. She was then loaded onto an ambulance still alive.

Ten days later, Ma is recouperating in the hospital having lost both arms and legs while being horribly scarred and nearly scalped. Understandably, she is much more disturbed. When her cousin Stevie asks her "how she is" after her mauling, she orders one of her men to shoot her cousin. When that man hesitates, she orders another man to shoot her cousin and the first man. When that man hesitates, she orders a third man to shoot her cousin and the first two, and so on until three of her men and her cousin lie dead at her non-existent feet. She puts out a $10 million [[bounty]] on the Punisher's head, and contacts [[Russian (comics)|the Russian]] in order to ensure Frank Castle's defeat.

When The Russian arrives, Ma sends him to the Punisher's reported hideout. In the meantime, Ma is informed that she will not receive any more help in fighting Frank Castle, who has killed 80 of her soldiers in less than 2 weeks. Anticipating victory, Ma is shocked to see Frank appear on her front lawn holding The Russian's head. The remainder of her soldiers throw down their guns and leave, saying that she "can't pay us enough to fight that." 

Frank then burns the Gnucci house to the ground (after raiding a safe and stealing some of Ma's money and secret documents) with Ma inside.  Six years later, it appears that Ma Gnucci has mysteriously come back from the dead. However, her mysterious resurrection is revealed to be part of a master plan of revenge against the Punisher. This was masterminded by the son of the deceased high-society vigilante Elite.

===Inheritance===
Ma Gnucci's nephew Peter realizes he stands to inherit Ma's money, if the Punisher dies. He hires [[Deadpool]] to do this. When it is falsely assumed the Punisher is dead, Peter acquires his money in the form of a check. He loses it in traffic. By the time he realizes he can ask the bank for a new one, it is too late. A truck bounces him out of the road, to impale him on the Wall Street Bull statue.

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Ma Gnucci is one of the villains in the 2005 ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|Punisher]]'' video game. The general plot of ''Welcome Back, Frank'' remains the same (right down to the home burning down), but the polar bear attack is not included. Instead, Ma is thrown through her mansion's top floor window after Frank fights his way through her remaining men and the mercenary [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]].
