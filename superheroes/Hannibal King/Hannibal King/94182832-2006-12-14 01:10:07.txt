'''Hannibal King''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared as a supporting character in the [[1970s]] [[comic book]] ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]''.

A private detective who made a modest living, King was bitten and killed by the [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] [[Deacon Frost]] while on a case. Waking up to find himself one of the undead, King was horrified at what he had become and vowed never to consummate the curse by passing it to another. Thus, King would subsist on blood that he purchased (or stole) from blood banks and fed on corpses or animals. King also preferred not to use his vampiric powers, believing that he gave up a part of himself every time he did so. In spite of his vampirism, King continued to operate as a private detective, but could only travel freely at night.

While searching for Deacon Frost, King eventually met [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], the vampire hunter. It was also Deacon Frost who killed Blade's mother. Initially distrustful of each other, they nevertheless teamed up to destroy Frost and parted as eternal friends.

At the time of these stories it was revealed that King had been a vampire for about five years. While investigating the murder of a friend at the hands of the [[Darkhold|Darkholders]], King contacted [[Doctor Strange]], the Sorcerer Surpreme. Through Strange, King discovered that the Darkhold contained the spell not only for creating vampires but destroying them. And it was through King that Strange learned of the apparent return of [[Dracula]]. King, with vampire hunters Blade and [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]], joined Strange in their visit to Castle [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]] where they retrieved the Darkhold and used it to cast the Montesi formula. This spell destroyed Dracula and all current vampires on Earth and prevented any more from being able to exist on Earth. King was saved through a complete blood transfusion and restored to human form. But the only real reason King did not succumb to the Montesi formula is the fact that he had never taken blood from a living human being.

They subsequently founded a detective agency initially simply known as King, Drake, and Blade; the firm was later known as Borderline Investigations. They fought several enemies such as the Darkholders. King also assisted [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]] on one of their missions.

Apparently, discord amongst the three friends caused Drake to leave the firm and Blade suffered a breakdown after a fight with a once again resurrected [[Dracula]]. Dracula's return indicated the weakening of the Montesi formula. King was unable to operate the firm on his own knowing his vampirism was returning. After an examination, Doctor Strange concluded that King, because of his recent reversion, had become a "neo-vampire", a special type of vampire with the abilities and weaknesses of the vampire, who craved blood but did not need it to survive.

Strange manipulated the three men into reuniting under the name [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] to combat supernatural enemies that were emerging. Among the enemies they fought were the Lilin, The Fallen, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s DOA, and Varnae. King and Drake were originally thought by Blade to have been killed in the explosion that destroyed Varnae. King would however show up in New Orleans, later to help Blade fight a resurrected Deacon Frost. King also accepted an assignment from Donna Garth to locate her father, Simon Garth who is also known as the Living Zombie. King tracked Garth to New York where he was assisted by [[Spider-Man]] in rescuing Garth from Lilith, the daughter of Dracula.

King would later set up a small shop in [[San Francisco]] where a CIA agent enlisted his help in stopping a vampire plot to blackmail the Earth with biochemical weapons. During this fight, CIA agent Tatjana Stiles was injured by vampire terrorist leader Navarro; although they defeated Navarro, Stiles' injuries were too painful for her to live with. Knowing the pain would eventually kill her, she begged King to make her like him "if she loves him". King, who grew attracted to Stiles, reluctantly complied and broke his years-long vow. Weeks later, King read a newspaper article about the mysterious death of two [[Iraq]]i guards in an overseas search for terrorist weapons. From the description of the deaths, King had no doubt who was responsible. Dispirited, King lost interest in his work and retreated into depression.

== Trivia ==
*In the first appearance of Hannibal King (Tomb of Dracula #25) and during the events of ''Doctor Strange'' (volume 2) #59-62, King had stated that he had been a vampire for about five years. During the events ''Journey Into Mystery'' #520-521, King revealed that he had been a vampire for about five decades, indicating that he had been a vampire since around the late 1940s.

*It was stated in Nightstalkers #1 that King's neo-vampire status (craving blood but not needing it to survive as well as his limited ability to tolerate sunlight) was due to his never directly taking blood from a living human, also the reason he survived the Montesi Formula, the Darkhold spell that had previously destroyed all vampires. This neo-vampire condition was never alluded to again after his seeming death in Nightstalkers #20 and he was shown thereafter to be a regular vampire with all of the traditional strengths and weaknesses, identical to his status before the Montesi spell was cast.

[[Image:Reynolds KING.jpg|thumb|left|Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King in [[Blade: Trinity]]]]
The character of Hannibal King appears in the [[2004]] movie ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', played by actor [[Ryan Reynolds]]. In the movie, King serves as a member of a vampire hunting group known as the Nightstalkers. This is similar to the comic book except that the leader of the Nightstalkers is Abigail Whistler, a character created for the movie and based on a recurring character from the film franchise. And Blade, instead of being a Nightstalker himself, sees them as young and inexperienced compared to him. The movie preserves the "former vampire" nature of King, but he is much younger and no longer a private detective. Also, due to Reynold's history of playing effusive, comedic characters such as [[Van Wilder]], his portrayal is very much the opposite of the more serious and reserved Hannibal King from the comics. The lasting friendship that blooms between King and Blade in the comics never happens in the movie. Although King is already an ex-vampire when they meet, the humorless Blade never takes a liking to King. Additionally, in the movie, it was Danica Talos and not Deacon Frost who turned King into a vampire. With the lackluster response to ''Blade: Trinity'' (one of the harshest criticisms was there was a lack of screen time for Blade), plans for further movie or TV adventures with Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler have evaporated.
