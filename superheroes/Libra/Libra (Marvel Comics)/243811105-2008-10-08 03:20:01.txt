==Fictional character biography==
[[Germany|German]] soldier Gustav Brandt served with the [[France|French]] forces during the [[Vietnam War]].  While in [[Saigon]], he met and fell in love with a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] woman named Lua, and eventually had a daughter with her.  However, Lua's brother, Khruul, was enraged with the [[interracial couple|interracial coupling]] of his sister and a [[European ethnic groups|European]] man.  He and his men attacked Gustav and his family with flamethrowers.  Lua was killed in the ensuing battle, and Gustav lost his eyesight.  He and his daughter took shelter in [[Pama]], where he was trained by the priests, but was forbidden to communicate with his daughter.

Joining the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac Cartel]], Gustav adopted the codename Libra, and served as a terrorist. Battling the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] on several occasions, he eventually discovered that [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] was the daughter he had left in Pama, and turned himself in to the authorities. He then vanished mysteriously, later turning up in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], where the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] revealed to everyone Mantis' transformation into the Celestial Madonna. Libra then witnessed the marriage of Mantis and the Swordsman, and returned to prison shortly after.  He did not stay in prison long, though, as he escaped and committed illegal acts alongside the Zodiac once more.

After the Zodiac's death at the hands of a [[Life Model Decoy]], Libra served alongside the Avengers briefly as they battled [[Kang (comics)|Kang]].  He is presumably residing in the The Between, a mystical world.

==Powers and abilities==
Libra is physically blind, but possesses psychic senses, and is also a skilled martial artist. He has the ability to shift into the Place Between Places, a mystical dimension that is untraceable to most life-forms.

==Other media==
Libra appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' as a member of the Zodiacs. In this show, Libra is a female alien who wields a weighing scale-like weapon.
