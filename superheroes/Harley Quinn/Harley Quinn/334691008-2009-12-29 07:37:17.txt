'''Harley Quinn''' ('''Dr. Harleen Quinzel''') is a [[fictional character]], who was first introduced as a [[supervillainess]] on September 11, 1992, in the [[list of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', later adapted into [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Batman]]'' [[comic book]]s. As suggested by her name (a play on the word "[[harlequin]]"), she is clad in the manner of a traditional [[harlequin]] [[jester]]. The character is a frequent accomplice and would-be-girlfriend of [[Batman]]'s nemesis [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], and is also a close ally of supervillainess [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]].

The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]] and was portrayed in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its [[DC Animated Universe|tie-ins]] by [[Arleen Sorkin]], and most recently by [[Hynden Walch]] on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. In the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|''Birds of Prey'' series]], she was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]], and by [[Sherilyn Fenn]] in the pilot episode.

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked Harley Quinn as #45.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/45.html Harley Quinn is Number 45]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin: ''Batman: The Animated Series''===
[[Image:Harley-tnba.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Harley Quinn in the '''''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'''''.]]Harley Quinn first appeared in the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]" (episode #7, original airdate: September 11, 1992), as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[walk-on (actor)|walk-on]] role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre (although he ended up doing so anyway). Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>Jankiewicz, Pat. [http://www.harley-quinn.com/oldsite/ainterview.html "Quinn-tessentials"] ''Starlog magazine''</ref> Dini, who had been friends with Sorkin for years, incorporated aspects of her personality into the character. 

The [[1994 in comics|1994]] [[graphic novel]] ''[[Mad Love (comic)|Mad Love]]'' recounts the character's [[origin story|origin]]. Told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book describes Harley as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychology|psychologist]] who fell for the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-off sidekick/lover. The story received wide praise <ref>http://www.harley-quinn.com/madlove.html</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode "Mad Love" in [[1999 in television|1999]], making it the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series (the other was ''[[Holiday Knights]]''). 

She becomes fascinated with the Joker while [[internship|interning]] at Arkham, and volunteers to analyze him. She fell hopelessly in love nearly instantly with the Joker during their sessions, and she helped him escape from the asylum more than once.  When the Joker is returned to Arkham in battered and broken state after a battle with Batman, the sight of the injured Joker drives Harley to don the costume and become Harley Quinn, the Joker's helper.

===Expanded role===
After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons in the [[DC Animated Universe]], appearing in the ''Justice League'' episode "Wild Cards" (alongside the Joker) and the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails" (alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]).

The animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', but it does include a flashback scene with Harley's career apparently ending by her falling down a deep pit during a battle with Batgirl. However, at the end of the movie, two twin juvenile girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their respectable-looking grandmother who angrily berates them verbally and physically for their activities &mdash; to which they answer: "Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!"

She appeared in ''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'' as a rival and foil for [[Lex Luthor|Lex Luthor's]] assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley nearly kills Mercy when she duct tapes her mouth shut and tapes her to the top of a gigantic killer [[android]], although she is rescued and untied by Batman and [[Superman]].

===Comics history===
The character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]] (although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''Batman: Thrillkiller 62'' in [[1997 in comics|1997]]).  The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of The Joker, is more dangerously [[psychosis|psychotic]] and less humorously quirky than the animated series version.

Quinn's [[DC Universe]] comic book origin, revealed in ''Batman: Harley Quinn'' (October [[1999 in comics|1999]]), is largely an adaptation of her animated origin from the ''Mad Love'' graphic novel.

A ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]] was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from [[2001 in comics|2001]] to [[2003 in comics|2003]]. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], [[A.J. Lieberman]] and Mike Huddleston.  The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. She then appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]''.  She is next seen in ''[[Villains United]]'' ''Infinite Crisis'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham. (She is, however, knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).

In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823. 

Harley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663, in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the "punchline" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.

Harley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831, written by Paul Dini. She is still a borderline psychotic, but has apparently reformed. Harley has spent the last year applying for [[parole]], only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Peyton Riley|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose, and helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Sugar escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole. 

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'' #105, Harley Quinn is revealed as the sixth member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, "Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?", thus leaving the team.

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #43, Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themiscyra]] by "Athena" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia]] as a reward. Upon return to earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to Gotham.

Harley Quinn has joined forces with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Catwoman]] in the series ''Gotham City Sirens''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at [[The Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with who she thought was Bruce Wayne (but was really disguised Hush), the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Selina, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.

==Other versions==
*Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] mini-series ''Thrillkiller''. As with the other characters, her background is very different from the established version: Bruce Wayne, for instance, is a full-time detective in the [[Gotham City Police Department]] who becomes Batman after being framed for murder, teaming up with Batgirl (aka [[Barbara Gordon]]) who has already been active for some time. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called '''Bianca Steeplechase'''. The relationship between this [[lesbian]] or [[bisexual]] Joker and Harley Quinn is short-lived but noticeably more [[egalitarian]] than its [[heterosexual]] counterpart in mainstream DC continuity. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.

*In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, "[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley."

*On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's manager. She is killed by [[Owlman (DC Comics)|Owlman]].

*In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a [[stripper]] (though this may be a ruse), and is never shown speaking.

==In other media==
===Film===
====''Batman Triumphant''====
Prior to the release of ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', [[Mark Protosevich]] was commissioned by [[Warner Bros.]] to write a script for a fifth ''Batman'' film titled ''[[Batman Triumphant]]'' to be directed by [[Joel Schumacher]]. Harley Quinn was allegedly included as one of the film's three villains, opposite [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Man-Bat]]. In July 2000, Protosevich confirmed Scarecrow and Quinn as the only two villains. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was rumored for the role, which he had rewritten as the Joker's daughter seeking revenge, not his lover and henchgirl as portrayed in the animated series and ''Batman'' comics. <!-- <ref name="rumblings" /> --> Due to ''Batman & Robin'''s poor box office run, bad [[Internet]] buzz, and several negative reviews from critics, ''Triumphant'' was never made, and the film franchise went on hiatus for eight years until ''[[Batman Begins]]'' in 2005.

===Television===
====''Birds of Prey''====
In 2002, a live-action television series called ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', loosely based on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|comic]] of the same name, included Harley Quinn as a psychotic psychiatrist and main villain.  The character was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]], who replaced [[Sherilyn Fenn]] (originator of the role in an [[Unaired Pilot (Birds of Prey)|unaired pilot episode]]).  The show aired only 13 episodes.  In this show, Harley is portrayed as an older, far more calculating and sinister character than her bubbly comic and cartoon personas. She also does not wear a costume, although she does wear an outfit that is reminiscent of her cartoon costume in the series finale, "[[Devil's Eyes]]". In that episode, she used experimental technology to transfer [[metahuman]] [[mind control]] powers to herself. It is unknown about this version's relationship with the Joker, although she does make reference to him as "Mr. J." on a few occasions, laments his loss as Gotham's crime boss and hints at a past relationship reminiscent to that of the animated series.

====''The Batman''====
Harley Quinn is introduced to the [[Kids' WB!]] series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' in the [[List of The Batman episodes#Season 4: 2006-2007|Season 4]] episode "Two of a Kind". This version of the character, voiced by [[Hynden Walch]], is originally the host of a [[pop psychology]] TV show called ''Heart to Heart with Harley''. Claiming to have obtained an [[online degree]] for psychology, she gives off-the-cuff advice to her callers that usually hurts more than helps. Her bosses, fed up with her irresponsible behavior, cancels the show on the air after she stages an ambush on Bruce Wayne during her show, after falsely promising she would allow him to promote a charity drive for crime victims. The Joker sees the episode, and proceeds to take advantage of the situation.  Initially thinking getting a tell-all from the Joker would restore her career, Harley ends up rampaging the town with the Joker.  Eventually, she is arrested after the Joker deserts her, and seemingly regrets taking up with him. Once loaded into a police car, however, she sees that Joker has left her an affectionate message, and instantly falls in love with him again. 

This incarnation of Harley wears a slightly different costume than in ''The Animated Series'': the black parts of the original are dark red here, the headdress is larger here than the original, the inverted diamond pattern on the shoulders and thighs is absent, and her mask conceals her eyes.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
In the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Mite!" while [[Bat-Mite]] is giving a speech at the [[Comic-Con]], there is a brief cameo of Harley Quinn creator [[Paul Dini]] dressed up as her. 

===Video games===
Harley Quinn also appears in several video games based upon the animated series. She appears in a [[cameo role]] in ''[[Adventures of Batman & Robin|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], and as a boss in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega Genesis]]. She also appears in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega CD]] and ''Batman: Chaos in Gotham''. Harley Quinn played a major role in the game's storyline in ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'', first posing as "Mary Flynn" in a trap for Batman set by the Joker; she later does the Joker's dirty work after he fakes his death. In Sega CD's ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' and ''Batman Vengeance'', she was voiced by series actress, [[Arleen Sorkin]]. 

She appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' as an enemy of Batman and a 1st deputy of the Joker. [[Grey DeLisle]] provides her Sound Effects. <ref>[http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/02/15/exclusive-see-a-new-lego-batman-villain/ MTV Multiplayer » Exclusive: See A New ‘LEGO Batman’ Villain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph.  See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref>

Arleen Sorkin reprises her role of Harley Quinn in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', as one of the main antagonists of the game, here with a new costume. It has been announced that in the still unnamed sequel of Batman: Arkham Asylum set to be launched in 2010, Harley is one of the main antagonists, alongside the Joker. Sorkin will reprise her role once again.
