'''Harley Quinn''' ('''Harleen Frances Quinzel''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]], and first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in September 1992. She later appeared in DC Comics's [[Batman]] comic books, with the character's first comic book appearance in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #12 (September 1993).

Harley Quinn is the frequent accomplice and lover of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], whom she met while working as a psychologist at [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]], where the Joker was a patient. Her name is a play on the name "[[Harlequin]]", a character which originated in the [[commedia dell'arte]]. The character has occasionally been depicted as an [[antihero]], and she has teamed up with fellow villains [[Catwoman]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], the latter serving as Quinn's close friend, recurring ally, and romantic interest. Harley Quinn has also been depicted as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]].

The character was originally voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]] in various tie-ins to the [[DC animated universe]]. Since then, she has also been voiced by [[Hynden Walch]] and [[Tara Strong]] in either [[DC Animated Showcase]]s or in various [[List of Batman video games|video games]]. In the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|''Birds of Prey'' television series]], she was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]]. The character made her live-action cinematic debut in the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', portrayed by [[Margot Robbie]].

==History==
===Creation===
====Introduction====
Harley Quinn first appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]",<ref name="auto"><!-- cite episode --> "[[Joker's Favor]]" (episode #7, original air date: September 11, 1992)</ref> as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[bit part|walk-on]] role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a [[pop out cake]], and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre, although he ended up doing it anyway. Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker, who would become his love interest. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials.

====Origin story====
[[File:Harley Quinn (model sheet).jpg|thumb|upright|Harley Quinn as she appears in the DC Animated Universe]]
The 1994 [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Batman Adventures: Mad Love]]'' recounts the character's [[origin story]]. Written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book is told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It describes Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, PhD as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychologist]] who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise<ref name="auto1">{{cite web | title = Mad Love|url = http://www.harley-quinn.com/oldsite/madlove.html}}</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being "Holiday Knights".

Harleen becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a badly injured Joker to Arkham, Harleen dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he truly loves her.

===Expanded role===
After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Wild Cards" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails".

Harley Quinn appears in ''[[The Batman/Superman Movie|World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie]]'' as a rival and [[foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a [[human shield]] to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.

The animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become "Joker Jr.", an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them—to which they answer: "Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].

==Characterization==
===Harleen Quinzel===
Harley Quinn, whose real name is Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel is depicted as having been a psychiatrist at [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]]. ''Gotham City Sirens'' #7 (Feb. 2010) shows Harley visiting her family for the holiday season, in which they are portrayed as being very dysfunctional, forcing Harley to become upset and leave abruptly. It is stated that the reason Harley pursued psychiatry was to understand her own broken family.<ref name="auto2">''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7</ref>

The character's origin story relates that as a psychiatrist, Dr. Harleen Quinzel, is assigned to the criminally insane [[Joker (character)|Joker]] at Arkham Asylum. Fascinated by him, she eventually falls in love with the Joker and becomes his lover and accomplice.<ref name="auto1"/> She follows suit in the Joker's clown-themed, criminal antics and adopts the name Harley Quinn, a play on "[[Harlequin]]" from the character in [[commedia dell'arte]]. Speaking with a pronounced Northeastern<!-- Do not change this to a specific place as this is variable per depiction. --> accent, Harley refers to the Joker as ''Mr. J'' and ''Puddin''', terms of endearment that have since been used in nearly every adaptation in which the two characters appear.

===Appearance===
[[File:Harley Quinn Suicide Squad Vol 5 20.png|thumb|Harley Quinn as she appears in the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' (August 2017). Art by Otto Schmidt.]]
Harley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece, black and red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.<ref name="auto"/> Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. As Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD, she is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears eye glasses, a skirt, high heeled shoes and a white lab coat.<ref name="auto3">''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics</ref>

In her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black and red, one-piece costume from the animated series. After DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black- and red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name="auto4">''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>

Following 2016's [[DC Rebirth]], Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, ripped tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots.

Harley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.

==Transition to comic books and publication history==
After the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}</ref> She first appeared in the original graphic novel, ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''Batman:  Thrillkiller and Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997.  The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue. Batman is later untied by Batgirl. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with Poison Ivy. ''Harley Quinn'' series writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Amanda Conner]] confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/dc-comics-harley-quinn-poison-ivy-are-girlfriends-w-1711038615|title=DC Comics: Harley Quinn & Poison Ivy Are Girlfriends "Without Monogamy"|author=Evan Narcisse|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku}}</ref>

A ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Cowsill|first= Alan|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski whose suicide started her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]''.  She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).

In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly upon in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (Nov. 2006).

Harley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the "punch line" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.

Harley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole.

''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #105 (June 2007) reveals Harley Quinn as the sixth member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, "Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?", thus leaving the team.

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by "Athena" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].

===Gotham City Sirens===
Harley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.

[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Harley Quinn as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD.<ref name="auto3"/> Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]
In ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn during the holiday season. Harley's father is a [[swindler]] who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the "villain and hero stuff". The dysfunctional, "horrible" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.<ref name="auto2"/>

In one instance, Harley attempts to steal from Two-Face and the Riddler, but is caught and faces the consequences. She is bound and gagged.

Following a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20–23. DC Comics</ref>

Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011). DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterwards, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011). DC Comics</ref>

August 2016 marked the debut of the six-issue miniseries ''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' volume one, reuniting Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman. Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD. with continued appearances throughout the series<ref name="auto3"/>

===The New 52===
Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance was fully revamped. The New 52 shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black and her bleached skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name="auto4"/>

After a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment.  Captured by [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #1 (September 2011). DC Comics</ref> However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan apparently pays off, and she manages to recover the face, though in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a "conversation" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #7 (March 2012). DC Comics</ref> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the "[[Death of the Family]]" story line, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where Joker is. But she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012). DC Comics</ref>

[[File:Harley Quinn Poison Ivy Cycle of Life and Death.png|thumb|left|200px|Harley Quinn in the New 52. Art by Clay Mann and Seth Mann.]]
On July 16, 2013, DC announced that a new ''Harley Quinn'' ongoing comic book series would begin publication in November 2013, co-written by [[Amanda Conner]] and her husband [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], cover illustrated by Conner, and story illustrated by Chad Hardin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=CCI EXCLUSIVE: Conner & Palmiotti Launch "Harley Quinn" Monthly|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=46652|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=46809|title=SDCC: DiDio and Lee Head DC's Meet The Co-Publishers|last=Campbell|first=Josie|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=July 21, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}</ref> The series has notably become distanced from the "Batman Family" of DC publications in both tone and premise, with Harley no longer having any significant connection to either Batman or the Joker following the "Death of the Family" storyline. In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.

Under Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]], who values human life and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood. Between issues #11 and #13 Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac [[Power Girl]] and battled [[Clock King]] and [[Sportsmaster]] before Power Girl's memory was restored and she left Harley at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] as punishment for her deceit.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #11-13 (October–December 2014). DC Comics</ref> Harley attempts to coerce a romantic connection with her tenant Mason, but was unable to make the date due to the multitude of responsibilities in her life, balancing her two jobs with her commitment to her roller derby team and her career as a crime-fighter.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #14 (February 2015). DC Comics</ref> With support from her girlfriend [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], Harley makes amends with Mason and turns to the internet to recruit other strong, young women in a crime-fighting team she is forming.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #15 (March 2015). DC Comics</ref> This team, composing of young women of various ethnic backgrounds and one gay man called Harvey Quinn, then fights [[Captain Strong|Captain Horatio Strong]], a sea captain who becomes superhumanly strong after eating an addictive alien sea-plant, in an homage to [[Popeye]]. Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.<ref>''Harley Quinn## #16-19(June–August 2015)''</ref>

''Harley Quinn'' has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the [[scratch and sniff]]-themed ''Annual'' issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the [[Arkham Asylum]] employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.<ref>''Harley Quinn Annual'' #1 (October 2014). DC Comics</ref> In the ''[[Valentines Day]] Special'', Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who unbeknownst to her is Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-super villain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses Batman and tells him to get "lessons" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which Batman privately grins.<ref>''Harley Quinn Valentines Day Special'' #1 (Feb 2015). DC Comics</ref>

In ''[[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]]'', a series set five years in the future, Harley mails herself to the Bahamas in an attempt to save money on airfare. The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an un-contacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].

After a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married. She is initially excited about the pending marriage until she discovers that the two will be sacrificed to the island's volcano as their wedding ceremony ends.<ref>"Future's End: Harley Quinn" (2014). DC Comics</ref>

A spin-off series entitled ''Harley Quinn and Power Girl'' was launched in June 2015. The series is set to run six issues and takes place while Harley has the amnesiac [[Power Girl]] convinced the two are a crime fighting duo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23500-conner-palmiotti-talk-harley-quinn-june-power-girl-spin-off-female-readers.html|title=CONNER, PALMIOTTI Talk HARLEY QUINN, June POWER GIRL Spin-Off, Female Readers|publisher=}}</ref> The story follows the two when they are sent to a part of deep space known as La Galaxia Del Sombrero during the unseen events mentioned in ''Harley Quinn'' #12 and then chronicles their journey to return to Earth.<ref>Harley Quinn and Power Girl (July 2015). DC Comics.</ref>

The ongoing series has continued with no apparent connection to ''Suicide Squad'' other than her new hairstyle, dyed for her by one of the tenants in her Brooklyn apartment. Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself. She also runs a "vigilante for hire" group she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers including Red Tool, Harley Sinn, and various other allies she has made along the way.

Harley has also broken up with the Joker and her current main love interest, though they are not exclusive, is Poison Ivy.<ref name=cbrbrian>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-and-poison-ivy-a-history/|title=Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy: A History|date=December 18, 2016|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|first=Brian|last=Cronin}}</ref>

====Controversy====
In September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, "Break into comics with Harley Quinn!",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref> in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different [[suicide]] scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bath tub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bath tub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
[[File:Harley Quinn at Belle Reve.png|thumb|Harley Quinn attacks guards at Belle Reve.<ref name="auto5">''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #20. DC Comics</ref> Art by [[Stjepan Šejić]].]] Using the end of [[the New 52]] initiative as a launching point, DC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called [[DC Rebirth]] in June 2016. ''Harley Quinn'' vol. 3, #1 was the debut bimonthly relaunch of Harley Quinn's comic book title. The character also has a recurring role in the comic book title ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', which debuted its fifth volume with ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #1 in October 2016.

Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following the events of DC Rebirth. She wears tight, blue and red shorts, ripped white tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right.

The ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at [[Belle Reve|Belle Reve Penitentiary]], attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.<ref name="auto5"/> Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Killer Croc]].

==Other versions==
* Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''Thrillkiller''. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase.  After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''. DC Comics</ref>
* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, "[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley".<ref>''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant''. DC Comics</ref>
* On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager and is killed by [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]].<ref>''Countdown'' #32. DC Comics</ref>
* In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a [[stripper]] (though this may be a ruse), and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker'' (2008). DC Comics</ref>
* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 60s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted eyeglasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as Dr. Holly Quinn, PhD, a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref>Batman '66 #3. DC Comics</ref> Dr. Quinn is manipulated by Catwoman and Joker to perfect the Joker Wave — a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects — freeing the people of Gotham, but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.<ref>Batman '66 #24. DC Comics</ref>
* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) this happens, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with Joker's death but develops an attachment to Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath but is also grief stricken when he's killed by Superman. She later confronts Black Canary but hesitates upon realizing she's pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to Black Canary that she has a 4-year old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Braniac alongside Black Canary, Green Arrow, and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks mother is actual her Aunt Harley though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. 
* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]]. She is knocked out by Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #6.

She does not wear a costume, although she does wear an outfit that is reminiscent of her cartoon costume in the series finale "[[Devil's Eyes]]". In that episode, she uses experimental technology to transfer [[metahuman]] [[mind control]] powers to herself.

She interviews Joker at Blackgate Prison and falls in love with him after he confesses his fascination with someone who he considers special to him (Batman). She later appears amongst the prison's other staff members held hostage by Joker when he takes over the facility, but she is rescued by Batman. Quinzel is last seen escorting the Joker to his cell after he is defeated by Batman in the game's ending.
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate]]'', it is detailed in the unlockable Detective Case titled "Doctor's Orders" that Quinzel's increasing obsession with the Joker is not going unnoticed by her fellow staff, who are beginning to worry that the Joker may be manipulating Quinzel. The Case also states that Quinzel has started referring to the Joker as "Mister J" in her personal journal with hearts drawn around his name, rather than "Patient ARK119805".
* In the main story of ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', it is revealed that in between the events of Arkham City and the current game, she's become a very competent gang leader, having recovered control of the Joker's former gang (including the members that were plotting to overthrow her or desert her) and has even become one of Gotham's main gang leaders, recruited by Scarecrow in his plan to kill Batman. She tries to break free and recruit the victims of Joker's blood transfusion who were not affected by the cure, all of whom started to display traces of his appearance and behavior, but they all end up dead after she was betrayed by one of the Joker patients that was working with her.
** Apart from the main game, she is a playable character via downloadable content that was once a pre-order exclusive. This content contains a story-driven mission, featuring her own weapons and abilities; it also includes four challenge maps for the character. In her mission, which takes place shortly before the main story, Harley breaks into the [[Blüdhaven]] prison to free Poison Ivy, defeating all police officers and, with Ivy's help, Nightwing.<ref name="HarleyDLC">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=794562063909621&set=a.157294880969679.40633.140262999339534&type=1|title=Pre-order Batman: Arkham Knight right now for the chance to play as Harley Quinn in an exclusive story-driven mission starring the psychotic psychiatrist!|author=Batman Arkham|publisher=Facebook|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref> At certain points, her Harleen and Harley personas are heard fighting for control of her body.
