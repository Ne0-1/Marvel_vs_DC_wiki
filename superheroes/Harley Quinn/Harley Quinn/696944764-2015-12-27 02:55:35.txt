'''Harley Quinn''' ('''Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, M.D.''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]], and first appeared on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in September 1992. She later appeared in [[DC Comics]]' Batman comic books, with her first comic book appearance in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #12 (Sept. 1993). Harley Quinn is depicted as having a very pronounced [[New York City English|New York accent]].

The character is a frequent accomplice and lover of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and ally to the supervillain [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] from whom she gained an immunity to poisons and toxins. Harley Quinn's origin story relates that she met the Joker while working as a [[psychiatrist]] at [[Arkham Asylum]], where the Joker was a patient. Her name is a play on the name "[[Harlequin]]", a character which originated in the [[commedia dell'arte]].

Harley Quinn was originally voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]] in various tie-ins to the [[DC animated universe]], and has also been voiced by [[Hynden Walch]] and [[Tara Strong]] in either [[DC Animated Showcase]]s or in various [[List of Batman video games|video games]]. In the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|''Birds of Prey'' television series]], she was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]]. The character will be making her live-action cinematic debut in the upcoming 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' portrayed by Australian actress [[Margot Robbie]].

[[IGN]]'s 2009 list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Harley Quinn as #45.<ref>{{cite web| year = 2009| title = Top 100 Comic Book hero|publisher=[[IGN]]|url = http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/45.html| title = Harley Quinn is Number 45|publisher = IGN| publisher = [[News Corporation]]}}</ref> She was ranked 16th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' 2011 "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 19| url =|isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==History==

===Creation and introduction===
[[File:Harley Quinn (model sheet).jpg|thumb|left|Harley Quinn, as she appears in the DC Animated Universe.]]
Harley Quinn first appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]",<ref><!-- cite episode --> "[[Joker's Favor]]" (episode #7, original airdate: September 11, 1992)</ref> as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[bit part|walk-on]] role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre (although he ended up doing so anyway). Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials. Arleen Sorkin gets a kick out of being the Joker's wench| url = http://www.harley-quinn.com/oldsite/ainterview.html| work = [[Starlog]]|publisher=Harley's Haven|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> Having been friends with Sorkin since college, he incorporated aspects of her personality into the character.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Dini| first1 = Paul| last2 = Chip| first2 = Kidd| title = Batman Animated | publisher = [[HarperCollins Publishers]]| year = 1998| page = | url = | isbn = 978-0-06-107327-4}}</ref>

The 1994 [[graphic novel]] ''[[Mad Love (comic)|Mad Love]]'' recounts the character's [[origin story|origin]]. Told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book describes '''Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, M.D.''' as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who falls for the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again sidekick. The story received wide praise<ref>{{cite web
| title = Mad Love|url = http://www.harley-quinn.com/oldsite/madlove.html}}</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode of the same name in 1999, making it the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series (the other was "Holiday Knights").

She becomes fascinated with the Joker while [[intern]]ing at Arkham and volunteers to analyze him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When the Joker is returned to Arkham after a battle with Batman, the sight of her badly-injured patient drives Harleen insane, leading her to quit her psychiatrist job and don a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. She later befriends [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who injects her with an [[antitoxin]] which gives her increased agility and immunity to toxins.

===Expanded role===
After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons in the [[DC animated universe]], appearing in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Wild Cards" (alongside the Joker) and the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails" (alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]).

She appeared in ''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'' as a rival and [[foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley tied Graves as a [[human shield]] to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm (other than the damage Harley had inflicted on her beforehand).

The animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene with Harley falling down a deep pit during a battle with Batgirl. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them—to which they answer: "Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!"

==Transition to comic books and publication history==
[[File:HarleyQuinn1.jpg|thumb|Harley Quinn on the cover of ''Harley Quinn'' #1 (Dec. 2000). Art by [[Terry Dodson]].]]
After the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. She first appeared in the original graphic novel, ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''Batman:  Thrillkiller and Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997.  The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue. Batman is later untied by Batgirl.

A ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Cowsill|first= Alan|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychiatry major Guy Kopski whose suicide started her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]''.  She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).

In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823.

Harley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663, in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the "punch line" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.

Harley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831, written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole.

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #105, Harley Quinn is revealed as the sixth member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, "Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?", thus leaving the team.

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #43, Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by "Athena" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].

Harley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Catwoman]] in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.

''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7 establishes that she was born and raised in [[Bensonhurst]], [[Brooklyn]], into a Jewish-Catholic family. Her father is a [[con artist]] who is still in jail. Her brother, Barry, is a slob with dreams of rock stardom, and her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the "villain and hero stuff". It is stated that the reason why Harley chose to become a psychologist in the first place was to try and understand her own broken family.

On a certain instance Harley attempted to steal from Two-Face and the Riddler, but was caught and they were not happy. Later, Poison Ivy discovers Harley bound and gagged in a closet, and Ivy removes the gag and unties her.

Following a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20–23. DC Comics</ref> Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011). DC Comics</ref> Shortly after this, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011). DC Comics</ref>

===The New 52===
Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance is fully revamped. Harley Quinn has a more revealing costume, altered hair color, and bleached skin. Her hair is half-red and half-black, like the jester cap of her previous incarnation, rather than fully blonde. Consistent with her new origin, her bleached skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>
[[File:HarleyQuinn.png|thumb|160px|left|Harley Quinn as she appears in [[the New 52]] relaunch of DC Comics.<br>Art by Amanda Conner.]]

After a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment.  Captured by [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #1 (September 2011). DC Comics</ref> However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll in her already addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan apparently pays off, and she manages to recover the face, though in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a "conversation" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #7 (March 2012). DC Comics</ref> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the "[[Death of the Family]]" story line, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where Joker is. But she only replies, in tears, that he's no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012). DC Comics</ref>

On July 16, 2013, DC announced that a new ''Harley Quinn'' ongoing comic book series would begin publication in November 2013, co-written by [[Amanda Conner]] and her husband [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], cover illustrated by Conner and illustrated by Chad Hardin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=CCI EXCLUSIVE: Conner & Palmiotti Launch "Harley Quinn" Monthly|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=46652|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=46809|title=SDCC: DiDio and Lee Head DC's Meet The Co-Publishers|last=Campbell|first=Josie|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=July 21, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}</ref> The series has notably become distanced from the "Batman Family" of DC publications in both tone and premise, with Harley no longer having any significant connection to either Batman or the Joker following the "Death of the Family" storyline. In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team and has returned to psychiatric work under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.

Under Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley has been reinvented as an [[antihero]] rather than a villain, who values human life and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood. Between issues #11 and #13 Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac [[Power Girl]] and battled [[Clock King]] and [[Sportsmaster]] before Power Girl's memory was restored and she left Harley at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] as punishment for her deceit.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #11-13 (October–December 2014). DC Comics</ref> Harley attempts to coerce a romantic connection with her tenant Mason, but was unable to make the date due to the multitude of responsibilities in her life, balancing her two jobs with her commitment to her roller derby team and her career as a crime-fighter.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #14 (February 2015). DC Comics</ref> With support from her friend [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], Harley makes amends with Mason and turns to the internet to recruit other strong, young women in a crime-fighting team she is forming.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #15 (March 2015). DC Comics</ref> This team, composing of young women of various ethnic backgrounds and one gay man called Harvey Quinn, then fights Captain Horatio Strong, a sea captain who becomes superhumanly strong after eating an addictive alien sea-plant, in an homage to [[Popeye]]. Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.<ref>''Harley Quinn## #16-19(June–August 2015)</ref>

''Harley Quinn'' has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the [[scratch and sniff]]-themed Annual issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her friend Poison Ivy, as the [[Arkham Asylum]] employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.<ref>''Harley Quinn Annual #1'' (October 2014). DC Comics</ref> In the [[Valentines Day]] Special, Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who unbeknownst to her is Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-super villain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses Batman and tells him to get "lessons" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which Batman privately grins.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' Valentines Day Special #1 (Feb 2015). DC Comics</ref>

In [[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]], a series set five years in the future, Harley mails herself to the Bahamas in an attempt to save money on airfare. The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm and Harley is washed up onto the shore's of an island inhabited by an un-contacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]. After a fight and reconciliation Harley learns that The Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and The Joker are to be married. She's initially excited about the pending marriage until she discovers that the two will be sacrificed to the island's volcano as their wedding ceremony ends.<ref>"Future's End: Harley Quinn" (2014). DC Comics</ref>

A spin-off series entitled "Harley Quinn and Power Girl" was launched in June 2015. The series is set to run six issues and will takes place while Harley has the amnesiac Power Girl convinced the two are a crime fighting duo.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/23500-conner-palmiotti-talk-harley-quinn-june-power-girl-spin-off-female-readers.html</ref> The story follows the two when they're sent to a part of deep space known as La Galaxia Del Sombrero during the unseen events mentioned in ''Harley Quinn'' #12 and the chronicles their journey to return to earth.<ref>Harley Quinn and Power Girl (July 2015).

====Controversy====
In September 2013, [[DC Comics]] announced a contest for fans and artists, "Break into comics with Harley Quinn!",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref> in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different [[suicide]] scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bath tub.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

==Other versions==
* Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''Thrillkiller''. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase. The relationship between this lesbian or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] Joker and Harley Quinn is short-lived but noticeably more [[egalitarian]] than its heterosexual counterpart in mainstream DC continuity. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''. DC Comics</ref>

* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) this happens, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley evades arrest and meets Green Arrow, who wants to save her from potential wrath from Superman. The two unexpectedly become close as a result, with Harley staying in his secret lair, the Arrow Cave (a running gag being Harley suggesting the better name, 'The Quiver' as the actual name is considered terrible). After she starts a fire, he takes her to Arkham Asylum where the patients are being illegally transferred by the League. Harley sets them all free, though is left saddened when Nightwing is inadvertently killed by Robin (Damien Wayne).{{issue|date=August 2015}} She later appears in the ''Injustice: Gods Among Us Annual'' #1, teaming up with Green Arrow and Black Canary when [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] tracks her down for a bounty Superman has placed on her head.<ref>''Injustice: Gods Among Us Annual'' #1 (November 2013)</ref> She later joins the Insurgency full-time, getting closer to Canary after the death of Green Arrow.

==In other media==

===Television===

====Animation====
*Harley Quinn makes an appearance on the [[Kids' WB]] series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]. In the episode "Two of a Kind" (written by her co-creator Paul Dini), this version of the character is at first the host of [[pop psychology]] television show "''Heart To Heart With Harley''". Harleen Quinzel claims to have obtained a degree in psychology from an [[online degree|online educational institution]], and she gives off-the-cuff advice to her callers that usually hurts more than it helps, resulting in a lot of controversy in the media which the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] finds amusing being a fan of her show. Her boss Jimmy Herbert becomes fed up with her irresponsible behavior and cancels the show on the air after she stages an ambush of Bruce Wayne on her show under a false promise to help promote a charity-drive for crime victims. Joker sees the episode and knows that Harley's having an emotional breakdown, proceeding to take advantage of the situation by making her a partner. Harley rationalizes joining Joker by telling herself that she will be able to get a tell-all that will restore her career, but then she ends up rampaging across Gotham city as Joker's partner-in-crime. Eventually, Harley learns that the network is planning to share with the police a psychological profile of her by TV psychologist Dr. Elliot Blaine, so she plans to destroy the network as revenge for her firing, something which Joker finds amusing. However, she is foiled by Batman, [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]], and she is arrested after Joker deserts her. She seemingly regrets taking up with Joker. However, once she has been taken into a police car, she sees that Joker has left her an affectionate message, and instantly falls in love again. She has a few short appearances in the episode "Rumor" and a slightly larger appearance in "The Metal Face of Comedy". This incarnation wears a slightly different costume than the one she wears in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' as in this depiction, the black parts of the original are dark red, the headdress is larger than the original, the inverted diamond pattern on the shoulders and thighs is absent, her gloves are fingerless, and her mask conceals her eyes.

*Harley Quinn appeared in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by Meghan Strange. This version is a henchwoman of the Joker modeled after a 1920s [[flapper]] woman (shown in black-and-white) instead of her traditional costume. In the episode "Legends of the Dark Mite!" while [[Bat-Mite]] is giving a speech at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]], there is a brief cameo of [[Paul Dini]] (Harley Quinn's creator) dressed up as the woman. She appears alongside the Joker in "Emperor Joker!". Though she has a mutual crush on Bat-Mite, she ultimately proves to love Joker more. Alongside virtually every other character that appeared during the show's three season run, Harley makes a cameo appearance in the [[series finale]] "Mitefall!" She is shown with Joker at the show's [[wrap party]] and kicks Gagsworthy when he tries to approach Joker.

=====Web series=====
*Harley Quinn (credited as ''[[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]]'') appears in the first episode of the web series ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles]]'' where she kidnapped and mutilated an unknown number of people and made toys and dolls out of the bodies.

[[File:HarleyBirdsOfPrey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mia Sara]] portraying Harley Quinn in ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'']]
*In 2002, a live-action television series called ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', loosely based on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|comic]] of the same name, included Harley Quinn as a psychotic psychiatrist and main antagonist. The character was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]] (replacing [[Sherilyn Fenn]] from an [[Unaired Pilot (Birds of Prey)|unaired pilot episode]]). The show aired only 13 episodes. In this show, she is portrayed as an older, far more calculating and sinister character than her bubbly comic and cartoon personas. Picking up where the Joker had left off, Harleen Quinzel used her day job as a psychiatrist to achieve her savage purpose – to take control of the city of New Gotham. She does not wear a costume, although she does wear an outfit that is reminiscent of her cartoon costume in the series finale "[[Devil's Eyes]]". In that episode, she uses experimental technology to transfer [[metahuman]] [[mind control]] powers to herself. She occasionally makes reference to her "sweet Mr. J.", laments his loss as a Gotham City crime boss and hints at a past relationship reminiscent to that of the animated series. A criminal known as the Crawler addresses her as "the Joker's girlfriend" in the seventh episode "Split".

*Harley Quinn makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' season two episode "Suicide Squad", voiced again by Tara Strong, while physically portrayed by Cassidy Alexa (credited as "Deranged Squad Female").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/arrow-suicide-squad-review|title=This Ain't No Task Force.|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|publisher=IGN|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/arrow-review-suicide-squad/|title='ARROW' REVIEW: "SUICIDE SQUAD"|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kevin|publisher=Screencrush|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}</ref> The series star [[Stephen Amell]] revealed in an interview that she was originally set to appear in the season two finale episode "Unthinkable", but was cut due to time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/06/09/harley-quinn-scene-got-cut-from-arrow-season-2-finale/|title=Harley Quinn Scene Got Cut From Arrow Season 2 Finale|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|publisher=Comic Book|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref> The show's producer [[Andrew Kreisberg]] revealed that there were plans for the character to appear, but series actress [[Willa Holland]] revealed that they had been axed due to the ''Suicide Squad'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54915|title=AMELL, KREISBERG & MORE ON HOW "ARROW" CONTINUES TO GROW THE DC UNIVERSE|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGX_4BG0qc4 Why Arrow Axed Harley Quinn & Suicide Squad + Willa Holland on Female Superheroes]</ref>

[[File:Arkham Knight Harley Quinn Promo.jpg|thumb|right|Harley Quinn in a promotional image for ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'']]
*In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', she serves as the secondary antagonist of the game, here with a new costume based on a nurse uniform. She takes control of Arkham, allowing Joker to escape, releases [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] from her cell, and kidnaps Warden [[Quincy Sharp]]. After Batman rescues Sharp, he confronts her and locks her in a cell. She returns in the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow's]] final nightmare as one of the guards escorting Batman away.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', She is shown wearing a biker-girl themed costume in this game, using a low-key version of her usual makeup, with heavy eye shadow in lieu of her domino mask. Batman encounters Harley in the Sionis Steel Mill where she was with the Joker. She later steals the cure for the Joker's illness while Batman was fighting Mr. Freeze for it, but is bound and gagged by [[Talia al Ghul]]. When the Joker dies from his illness, Quinn was with the Joker's henchmen when Batman brought his dead body out of the theater. 
** Harley also appears in "Harley Quinn's Revenge" expansion as the main antagonist, seeking revenge on Batman for the death of the Joker. By this time, Harley has dyed her hair completely black and wears almost all black, with a "J" necklace and mourning veil. After escaping from a temporary holding area following the destruction of Arkham City, Harley transforms the Steel Mill into a gigantic memorial of him. She is later beaten by the duo of Batman and Robin and taken into custody by the GCPD. 
** Included as an [[Easter egg]] in the manager's office of the Steel Mill, there is a crib with [[Scarface (comics)|Scarface]] painted as the Joker inside, surrounded by dozens of negative pregnancy tests accompanied by a single positive pregnancy test, which could indicate that she had a miscarriage, the positive test was false, or after several failed attempts she finally got pregnant just before the Joker died.
* Harley Quinn introduced Martin Tremblay, president of Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, at the [[Nintendo]] Press Conference at E3 2012 where Batman Arkham City: Armored Edition was introduced for the [[Wii U]].
* Harley Quinn appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'', where she kidnaps a reporter to use as a hostage to free the Joker. After luring Batman into a trap, she tries to execute the bound and gagged reporter, but is stopped by one of Batman's batarangs. She is once again voiced by Tara Strong.
* Dr. Harleen Quinzel, M.D. appears briefly in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' before her transformation into Harley Quinn. She interviews Joker at Blackgate Prison and falls in love with him after he confesses his fascination with someone who he considers special to him (Batman).
* While Dr. Harleen Quinzel, M.D. never makes a physical appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate]]'', she is referred to in the unlockable Detective Case titled "Doctor's Orders". According to the Detective Case, Quinzel's increasing obsession with the Joker is not going unnoticed by her fellow staff, who are beginning to worry that the Joker may be manipulating Quinzel. The Case also states that Quinzel has started referring to the Joker as "Mister J" in her personal journal with hearts drawn around his name, rather than "Patient ARK119805".
* In the main story of ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', it's revealed that in between the events of Arkham City and the current game, she's become a very competent gang leader, having recovered control of the Joker's former gang (including the members that were plotting to overthrow her or desert her) and has even become one of Gotham's main gang leaders, recruited by Scarecrow in his plan to kill Batman. She tries to break free and recruit the victims of Joker's blood transfusion who were not affected by the cure, all of whom started to display traces of his appearance and behavior, but they all end up dead after she was betrayed by one of the Joker patients that was working for her.
** Apart from the main game, she is a playable character via pre-order downloadable content in a story-driven mission, featuring her own weapons and abilities; the content also includes four challenge maps for the character. In her mission, which takes place shortly before the main story, Harley breaks into the [[Blüdhaven]] prison to free Poison Ivy, defeating all police officers and, with Ivy's help, Nightwing.<ref name="HarleyDLC">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=794562063909621&set=a.157294880969679.40633.140262999339534&type=1|title=Pre-order Batman: Arkham Knight right now for the chance to play as Harley Quinn in an exclusive story-driven mission starring the psychotic psychiatrist!|author=Batman Arkham|publisher=Facebook|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref>

====''Injustice: Gods Among Us''====
* Harley Quinn appears as a playable fighter in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' voiced again by Tara Strong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2012/05/31/netherrealm-developing-new-dc-comics-fighting-game-injustice-gods-among-us/|title=NetherRealm Developing New DC Comics Fighting Game, "Injustice: Gods Among Us"|work=MTV Multiplayer|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref> In the alternate universe depicted in the game, Quinn establishes the Joker Clan to honor the Clown Prince after he is murdered by Superman. She is part of Batman's Insurgency, and reacts very negatively when the "Prime" Joker appears, believing him to be a fake. The Joker still temporarily gains her trust after proving himself to be the real deal, but she gets over it again once he threatens to kill her when she fails to defeat her Earth's version of Lex Luthor who, unknown to them both at the time, is a fellow Insurgent posing as an ally of Superman. In her battle ending, she had gone to marry The Joker, but after he playfully smashed her face into a cake, years of abuse made Harley snap. Using the ceremonial knife she slit The Joker's throat, killing him. It is then stated she permanently became a patient at the Arkham Asylum, still wearing her wedding gown. That happens not in our universe but where everyone is at ends with each other.<ref>{{cite video |people=Tara Strong |date=November 14, 2013 |title=Infinite Crisis – Behind the Voice – Tara Strong as Harley Quinn |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPZxr2Y7zM |format= |medium=interview |publisher=YouTube |location= |accessdate=2014-03-05 |time= |quote=Why, hellllo Harley!
