'''Harley Quinn''' (real name Dr. Harleen Quinzel) is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillainess]], in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', later adapted into [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Batman]]'' [[comic book]]s. As suggested by her name (a play on the word "[[harlequin]]"), she is clad in the manner of a traditional [[Jester|harlequin jester]]. The character is a frequent accomplice of Batman's nemesis [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], and is also a close ally of supervillainess [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]].

The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]] and was voiced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its [[DC Animated Universe|tie-ins]] by [[Arleen Sorkin]], and currently by [[Hynden Walch]] on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. In the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|''Birds of Prey''  series]], she was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin: ''Batman: The Animated Series''===
[[Image:Harley-tnba.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Harley Quinn in the '''[[DC Animated Universe|DCAU]]'''.]]Harley Quinn first appeared in the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]" (episode #22, original airdate: [[September 11]], [[1992]]), as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[walk-on]] role â€“ a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre. A female follower of the Joker was thus created. Sorkin once had a starring role in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of our Lives]]'', and appeared in a dream sequence in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration, writing the character specifically so Sorkin could voice her. Dini, who had been friends with Sorkin for years, incorporated aspects of her personality into the character. 

The 1994 [[graphic novel]] ''[[Mad Love (comic)|Mad Love]]'' recounts the character's origin. Told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book describes Harley as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise <ref>http://www.harley-quinn.com/madlove.html</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode "Mad Love" in 1999, making it the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series (the other being ''Holiday Knights''). 

As portrayed in the comic, she becomes fascinated with the Joker while [[internship|interning]] at Arkham, and volunteers to analyze him.  She falls in love nearly instantly with the Joker during their sessions.  After helping him escape from the asylum more than once, she is caught by her superiors, who revoke her license and put her in her own cell.  During an [[earthquake]] in [[Gotham City]], she flees and becomes Harley Quinn, the Joker's partner-in-crime.

===Expanded role===
After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons of the [[DC Animated Universe]], appearing in the ''Justice League'' episode "Wild Cards" (alongside the Joker) and the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails" (alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]). 

She appeared in ''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'' as a rival and foil of sorts for [[Lex Luthor|Lex Luthor's]] assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each has a mutual immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's climax, Harley nearly kills Mercy when she duct tapes her mouth shut and tapes her to the top of a gigantic killer android, (to act as a human shield), although she is rescued and untied by Batman and Superman. At the conclusion, Harley is taken away in a padded ambulance screaming, "I want a lawyer! I want a doctor! I want a cheese sandwich!"; Mercy chuckles "Now ''that's'' funny!" as she watches Harley locked away on TV.

In issue #16 of the ''[[Batman Adventures]]'' comic series, Harley is almost married to the Joker.  Ivy crashes the wedding and tries to kill the Joker, only to be stopped by [[Batgirl]].  At the end of the comic, Harley vows to kill Ivy, thus apparently ending their partnership (although the ''Batman Adventures'' comic book series, while continuing on from ''Batman: The Animated Series'', does not necessarily reflect [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] developments within the wider Batman/DC Comics universe), though not all was as it seemed with Ivy in that story either.

''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' depicts Quinn's ultimate fate. After a dramatic physical battle between Harley and Batgirl, Batman presumes her dead knowing she fell into a deep crevasse during his final showdown with the Joker; however, bottomless pits are a notoriously unreliable means of [[comic book death|death in comic books]] . A scene toward the end of the film reveals that Quinn survived to start a family, with her twin granddaughters [[Dee-Dee|Delia and Deidre Dennis]] eventually joining the [[Jokerz]] gang, something which, ironically, the elderly Harley does not appreciate.

===DC Universe Comic history===
The character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]] (although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] mini-series ''Thrillkiller'' in 1997).  The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of The Joker, is more dangerously [[psychosis|psychotic]] and less humorously kooky than the animated series version.

[[Image:HarleyqLG.jpg|Cover to ''[[Batman: Harley Quinn]]''.<br>Art by [[Alex Ross]].|180px|thumb]]
Quinn's [[DC Universe]] comic book origin, revealed in ''Batman: Harley Quinn'' (October 1999), is largely an adaptation of her animated origin from the ''Batman Adventures: Mad Love'' graphic novel.

A ''Harley Quinn'' ongoing series was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003.  Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], [[A.J. Lieberman]] and Mike Huddleston.  The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum.  She is next seen in the Jeph Loeb series "Hush".  Then in ''[[Villains United]]'' Infinite Crisis special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham. (She is, however, knocked unconscious the moment she escapes.)

In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' setting, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham Asylum, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823. 

Harley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663, in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the "punchline" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.

Harley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831, written by Paul Dini. She is still a borderline psychotic, but has apparently reformed. Harley has spent the last year applying for [[parole]], only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of the medical commission of Arkham. Kidnapped, and granted a job as a henchwoman for Sugar, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], she turns her down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, and helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] foil the imposter's plans. Although Sugar escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole from Arkham Asylum. 

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'' #105, Harley Quinn is revealed as the sixth member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, "Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?", thus leaving the team.

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #43, Harleen Quinzel appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, Harley now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themiscyra]] and begin Amazon training.

In [[Batman Confidential#Lovers & Madmen (#7-12)|''Batman Confidential'''s]] version of the Joker's origin, Harley meets the Joker when he is still 'Jack'. She is working her way through college as a cocktail waitress, and goes by the nickname of Leeny. She convinces her future soulmate that whatever life he is running from is a gift and deserves a second chance. This sets in motion the chain of events that leads to Joker's transformation. In gratitude, Joker secretly pays off Harley's college bills.

==Relationships==
===The Joker===
[[Image:Madlove quinn.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Harley Quinn fantasizes about her future with the Joker in ''[[Mad Love (comic)|Mad Love]].]]
Harley's relationship with the Joker is one of the most complex in the [[DC Universe]].  While he often degrades and hurts her, sometimes near the point of death, there are many instances that show a mutually affectionate side to their bizarre relationship. Certain episodes imply that the Joker wrestles with the extremely vexing idea of actually ''caring'' for someone.  

In the book ''Batman: Animated'', [[Mark Hamill]] (who provided the voice of the Joker in ''Batman: the Animated Series'') says "Expressing emotion in any way that's real and meaningful is alien to the Joker, but he's learning those parts of himself, however unconsciously, through Harley."  

Sorkin adds, "Everyone else sees the Joker laugh; only Harley has ever seen him cry."  

One example of this occasional bend in their rollercoaster relationship comes from the ''[[Emperor Joker]]'' series (''Action Comics'' #770) where Joker shares with Harley his deeply personal reasons for destroying the [[universe]]. Instead of destroying her with it, he gives her a last kiss and turns her into a [[constellation]], saying "You get the best seat in the house for [[Armageddon]].  Say goodnight, Harley.  I always wanted to see my dame in lights. Heh.  Even in a moment of abject saccharine, I still got it."

A more in-depth look at the early stages of their [[DC Universe]] relationship is provided in [[Greg Rucka]]'s ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' novel.</p>

In ''Batman'' #663, it is revealed that Harley included in her college [[thesis]]  the theory that the Joker is constantly reinventing his personality; after she is corrupted, however, she refuses to accept that his love for her is not a constant. Furthermore, Joker relents after Harley defends herself against him, saying he will let her live, but that it would be better if she were disfigured. She apparently consents, but Batman attacks as Joker traces a razor against her cheek. The issue ends with Harley putting a bullet through Joker's shoulder.

===Poison Ivy===
====''Batman: The Animated Series''====
[[Image:Harleyivy.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and Harley Quinn.<br>Art by [[Bruce Timm]].]]
In the episode "[[Harley and Ivy]]", the Joker, frustrated with Quinn, kicks her out, so she steals a Harlequin Diamond in a museum to prove her worth. At the same time, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] robs the museum of plant toxins.  The two become quick friends and Ivy takes her back to her lair in a [[toxic waste]] dump where she nurses her back to health and injects her with a serum which has given Harley an immunity to all toxins and poisons. Harley and Ivy team up for a number of successful capers, becoming Gotham City's "Queens of Crime". 

Their partnership ends temporarily after the Joker welcomes Harley back. Ivy is continually frustrated by Harley's lingering feelings for the Joker. However, the friendship survives, and Ivy remains Harley's first port of call when she and The Joker go through a rough patch.  She adopts the role of older sister and teller of harsh truths to Harley about her helpless infatuation with the Joker.  When Ivy demands during "Harley and Ivy" that Harley stand up for herself, Harley says "I'm not a doormat &mdash; am I?" Ivy replies, "If you had a middle name, it would be 'Welcome'."

While she frequently refers to the Joker as "Puddin'" and "Mr. J", she refers to Poison Ivy as "Red" (a reference to her [[red hair]]).

In the ''Batman: Harley & Ivy'' mini-series published in 2004, written and drawn by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]], the pair are shown sharing a bed in issue #3.

====DC Universe Comic====
Their relationship was integrated into the comics in ''Batman: Harley Quinn''. In that comic, Joker finds himself beginning to care for her. Naturally, this can't be countenanced, so he decides to kill her. After he takes an apparently drugged Harley into his bed for what may or may not be the consummation of their relationship, he lures her into a rocket ship, telling her, in part: "''I've noticed some changes coming over me since you came into my life. I've been reminded what it was like to be part of a couple. To care for someone who cares for me. It's the first time in recent memory I've had those feelings... And I ''hate'' having those feelings!''" He launches the rocket, soberly telling an enraged Harley that he will truly mourn her, before erupting into a fit of his trademark diabolical laughter. 

The rocket lands in Robinson Park, where Harley first meets Poison Ivy. Ivy saves her, but after taking her in, recognizes Harley as Dr. Quinzel from the Arkham staff. When Harley regains consciousness, Ivy initially plans to kill her. The prospect of her own death totally fails to move Harley, and Ivy is curious as to why. She convinces Harley to tell her story, and comes to feel a kinship with Harley. Considering her another castoff, Ivy offers to help Harley take her revenge on both Batman and the Joker.

Ivy gives Quinn a treatment that immunizes her to various assorted toxins and Ivy's own poisonous touch. It also dramatically enhances Harley's strength and speed. Ivy intends this to give her new friend an edge on Batman and the Joker. Hot-blooded Harley, however, is angrier at the Joker than at Batman, and even initially works ''with'' the Dark Knight to help bring down the Clown Prince of Crime. While Batman eliminates the villain's muscle, Quinn chases the Joker up a damaged building, intending to send him falling to his death. Before she can do so, however, the Joker apologizes. Falling in love with him again, she forgives him on the spot, and serves as his lieutenant throughout the rest of ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'', as well as the ''Emperor Joker'' storyline.

===Holly Robinson=== 
When the Amazons attacked America and offered women access to [[Themyscira]] and their teachings, Harley volunteered, and there she befriended former Catwoman [[Holly Robinson]]. Whether this is even an association beyond friendship remains to be seen, as Holly was already in a committed relationship with a girl named Karon.

===Guy Kopski===
In ''Harley Quinn'' #8, Kopski is introduced as Harleen Quinzel's college boyfriend. His death sparks the first tragedy in Harleen's life that would lead to her eventual obsession with the Joker. 

While in college, Harleen was dating fellow student Kopski, who is writing his [[thesis]] on [[Chaos Theory]] and at the same time was developing a new "Think Drink" formula that he was planning on selling to the market. Kopski is a bit of a joker himself and entertains Harleen by reading articles from the newspaper that he thinks are funny.

In order to enter Gotham State University's graduate program, Harleen performs an experiment to help her make up for her poor grades. Deciding to test her theory on the relationship between love and crime, Harleen tests her boyfriend's love by making up a crime that she committed to see how he'd react. She does not get the results that she hoped for; Kopski picks up a loaded gun and goes after the 'perpetrator' that tried to kill his girlfriend. Realizing that her experiment failed, she goes after Kopski to stop him from killing someone, but arrives too late when she finds him in the gym with a [[homeless]] man that he accidentally shot to death.

Upon learning the truth, Kopski threatens to commit [[suicide]] and asks Harleen to help him pull the trigger. Harleen tries to convince him that she'll get rid of the body, but he insists on killing himself anyway. Harleen tearfully begs for him to put down the gun and tells him that she loves him, but pulls the trigger anyway telling her "Do it because you love me".

Harleen trashes her dorm room in her despair and decides right then and there that she wants to meet with the Joker in person by interning at Arkham Asylum. She then [[blackmail]]s her Department Head into passing her so that she can go to grad school and get her internship at Arkham.

Harleen later finds out as Harley Quinn that her Department Head was actually using them both to test out his own theories and that her experiment was really his. Harley avenges her boyfriend's death by tormenting her former Department Head and leaves him to his fate when he accidentally gets Joker Venom on himself in his attempt to kill Quinn with it.

Harley also states in ''Harley Quinn'' #1 that the Joker reminds her of an "old boyfriend", possibly in reference to Kopski.

==Other versions==
*Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] mini-series ''Thrillkiller''. As with the other characters, her background is very different to the established version ([[Bruce Wayne]], for instance, is a full-time detective in the Gotham police who becomes Batman after being framed for murder). Here she is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called '''Bianca Steeplechase'''. The relationship between this [[lesbian]] or [[bisexual]] Joker and Harley Quinn is noticeably more egalitarian than its [[heterosexual]] counterpart in mainstream DC continuity. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.
*In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories was about Lex Luthor as a music producer. One of his groups were, as the press put it, "'[[alternative lifestyle]]' folkies Ivy and Harley".

==In other media==
===Film===
Prior to the release of ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', [[Mark Protosevich]] was commissioned by [[Warner Brothers]] to write a script for a fifth ''Batman'' film titled ''Batman Triumphant'' to be directed by [[Joel Schumacher]]. Harley Quinn was allegedly included as one of the film's three villains, opposite [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Man-Bat]]. In July 2000, Protosevich confirmed Scarecrow and Quinn as the only two villains. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was rumored for the role, which he had rewritten as the Joker's daughter seeking revenge, not his lover as portrayed in the animated series and ''Batman'' comics. <!-- <ref name="rumblings" /> --> Due to ''Batman & Robin'''s poor box office run, bad [[Internet]] buzz, and several negative reviews from critics, ''Triumphant'' was never made, and the film franchise went on hiatus for eight years.

===Television===
[[Image:Quinzel.png|thumb|left|150px|Harleen Quinzel as seen on ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'', played by [[Mia Sara]].]]
In 2002, a live-action television series called ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', loosely based on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|comic]] of the same name, included Harley Quinn as a psychotic psychiatrist and main villain.  The character was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]], who replaced [[Sherilyn Fenn]] (originator of the role in an [[Unaired Pilot (Birds of Prey)|unaired pilot episode]]).  The show aired only 13 episodes.  In this show, Harley is portrayed as a far more calculating and sinister character than her bubbly comic and cartoon personas. She also does not wear a costume, although she does wear an outfit that is reminiscent of her cartoon costume in the series finale, "[[Devil's Eyes]]". In that episode, she used experimental technology to transfer [[metahuman]] [[mind control]] powers to herself.

[[Image:Harley Quinn (The Batman).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Harley Quinn, as seen in Season Four of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Harley Quinn appears in season 4 of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', in which she is voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]. While her design is relatively unchanged (though somewhat more exaggerated), her past is somewhat altered. Instead of being a psychiatrist at Arkham, she is a TV [[pop psychology|pop psychologist]] who is researching the Joker when he corrupts her. Unlike other versions, the Joker creates Harley's name and costume instead of Harley making them herself.

In the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "[[Breakfast Food Killer]]," a silhouette of Harley Quinn was among the characters auditioning to be the new cereal mascot.

===Video games===
Harley Quinn also appears in several video games based upon the animated series. She appears in a [[cameo role]] in ''[[Adventures of Batman & Robin|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super NES]], and as a boss in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega Genesis]]. She also appears in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega CD]] and ''Batman: Chaos in Gotham''. Harley Quinn was not a boss in the video game ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'' (except in the Game Boy Advance version) but she played a major role in the game's storyline. First she poses as a woman named Mary Flynn in a trap for Batman set by the Joker. Then throughout the game Harley does the Joker's dirty work after he fakes his death. In Sega CD's ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' and ''Batman Vengeance'', she was voiced by her regular voice actress, Arleen Sorkin.
