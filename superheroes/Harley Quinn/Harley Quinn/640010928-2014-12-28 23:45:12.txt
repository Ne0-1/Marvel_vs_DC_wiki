'''Harley Quinn''' ('''Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[super villain]] in the [[DC Universe]]. The character was introduced on September 11, 1992, in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and later adapted into a children's comic book called ''Batman Almost Got Im'' on April 1993. She later appeared in [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]] [[comic book]]s, first appearing in ''The Batman [[Adventure|Adventures]]'' #12 (September 1993). As suggested by her name (a play on the word "[[harlequin]]"), she is clad in the manner of a traditional harlequin [[jester]]. The character is a [[Hybristophilia|frequent accomplice and girlfriend]] of Batman's nemesis the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and is also close to the supervillain [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], from whom she gained her immunity to poisons and toxins.

The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]] and was originally voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and its [[DC animated universe|tie-ins]]. The character was voiced by [[Hynden Walch]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series and the 2014 film ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]''. In the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|''Birds of Prey'' television series]], she was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]] (and [[Sherilyn Fenn]] in an unaired version of the pilot episode). Throughout her animated depictions, she is shown to speak with a pronounced [[New York City English|Brooklyn accent]]. The character will make her live-action cinematic debut in the upcoming film adaptation of the [[Suicide Squad]], portrayed by actress [[Margot Robbie]].

==Appearances in ''Batman: The Animated Series''==

===Introduction===
[[File:Harley Quinn (model sheet).jpg|thumb|left|Harley Quinn, as she appears in the DC Animated Universe.]]
Harley Quinn first appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]",<ref><!-- cite episode --> "[[Joker's Favor]]" (episode #7, original airdate: September 11, 1992)</ref> as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[bit part|walk-on]] role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre (although he ended up doing so anyway). Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web

The [[1994 in comics|1994]] [[graphic novel]] ''[[Mad Love (comic)|Mad Love]]'' recounts the character's [[origin story|origin]]. Told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book describes '''Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzell, M.D.''' as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who falls for the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-off sidekick. The story received wide praise<ref>{{cite web
| title = Mad Love
| url = http://www.harley-quinn.com/oldsite/madlove.html
}}
</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode of the same name in [[1999 in television|1999]], making it the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series. (The other was ''[[wikia:DCAnimated:Holiday Knights|Holiday Knights]].'')

She becomes fascinated with the Joker while [[intern]]ing at Arkham, and volunteers to analyze him. She falls hopelessly in love nearly instantly with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When the Joker is returned to Arkham after a battle with Batman, the sight of her badly injured patient drives Harleen insane, leading her to quit her psychiatrist job and don a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. She later becomes fast friends with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who injects her with an [[antitoxin]] which gives her super-human strength, agility, and immunity to toxins.

===Expanded role===
After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons in the [[DC animated universe]], appearing in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Wild Cards" (alongside the Joker) and the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails" (alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]).

She appeared in ''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'' as a rival and [[foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley tied Graves as a [[human shield]] to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm (other than the damage Harley had inflicted on her beforehand).

The animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene with Harley falling down a deep pit during a battle with Batgirl. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates themâ€”to which they answer: "Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!"

==Comic book publication history==
The character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. She first appeared in Batman #570, "The Code" as part of the "No Man's Land" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''Batman:  Thrillkiller and Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in [[1997 in comics|1997]].  The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue. Batman is later untied by Batgirl.

Quinn's [[DC Universe]] comic book origin, revealed in ''Batman: Harley Quinn'' (October [[1999 in comics|1999]]), is largely an adaptation of her animated origin from the ''Mad Love'' graphic novel.

A ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Cowsill|first= Alan|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from [[2001 in comics|2001]] to [[2003 in comics|2003]]. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychiatry major Guy Kopski whose suicide started her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]''.  She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).

In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823.

Harley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663, in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the "punch line" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.

Harley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831, written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for [[parole]], only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Peyton Riley|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole.

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #105, Harley Quinn is revealed as the sixth member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, "Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?", thus leaving the team.

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #43, Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement Holly Robinson, and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by "Athena" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].

Harley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Catwoman]] in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.

''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7 establishes that she was born and raised in [[Bensonhurst]], [[Brooklyn]], into a [[Jewish]]-[[Catholic]] family. Her father is a [[con artist]] who is still in jail. Her brother, Barry, is a slob with dreams of rock stardom, and her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the "villain and hero stuff". It is stated that the reason why Harley chose to become a psychologist in the first place was to try and understand her own broken family.

On a certain instance Harley attempted to steal from Two-Face and the Riddler, but was caught and they were not happy. Later, Poison Ivy discovers Harley bound and gagged in a closet, and Ivy removes the gag and unties her.

Following a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham with the goal of killing the Joker for abusing her as often as he did. However, Harley ultimately chooses to instead release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20-23</ref> Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011)</ref> Shortly after this, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011)</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help.

===The New 52===
Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch of all its titles]], Harley Quinn's costume and appearance is fully revamped, with a more revealing costume, bleached skin and altered hair color (half-red and half-black, like the jester cap of her previous incarnation, rather than fully blonde), consistent with her new origin.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #3 (November 2011)</ref> After a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment.

Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #7 (March 2012)</ref> After the Joker returns to Gotham, he forces her to disguise herself in his old Red Hood costume and trick Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where Joker is. But she only replies, in tears, that he's not "her Joker" anymore.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012)</ref>

On July 16, 2013, DC announced that a new ''Harley Quinn'' ongoing comic book series would begin publication in November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=CCI EXCLUSIVE: Conner & Palmiotti Launch "Harley Quinn" Monthly|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=46652|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=July 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=46809|title=SDCC: DiDio and Lee Head DC's Meet The Co-Publishers|last=Campbell|first=Josie|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=July 21, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}</ref> The debut issue of the rebooted series, ''Harley Quinn'' Vol 2 #0, was released in January 2014.

===Controversy===
In September 2013, [[DC Comics]] announced a contest for fans and artists, "Break into comics with Harley Quinn!",<ref>http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1</ref> in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bath tub.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings Of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616</ref><ref>[http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/123898-dc-releases-script-for-harley-quinn-contest-internet-outraged.html "DC Releases Script for Harley Quinn Contest, Internet Outraged"]. The Outhousers. September 6, 2013.</ref>
Further exacerbating the already questionable integrity of the contest was the unveiling of the winning submission, drawn by artist Jeremy Roberts. 
His winning drew the ire of the other submitting artists and comic fans because the entire contest was promoted by DC's claim; "Beginning this November, Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner will be writing the madcap adventures of Harley Quinn and theyâ€™ll need all the help they can get to handle her, so theyâ€™re opening the invitation to '''one undiscovered talent''' to join them." and "'''We are looking for new, talented artists''' who believe they can bring something special to one of our favorite characters..."<ref>http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/125074-harley-quinn-suicide-contest-discovers-not-so-new-artist.html</ref> The reason for the outrage was that Jeremy Roberts is a professional comic book artist, with over 70 comics credits to his name at publishers Marvel, Dark Horse, Devil's Due, and DC themselves at the time of his winning the contest.<ref>http://www.comicvine.com/jeremy-roberts/4040-6697/issues-cover/</ref>

==Other versions==
* Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''Thrillkiller''. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called '''Bianca Steeplechase'''. The relationship between this [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] Joker and Harley Quinn is short-lived but noticeably more [[egalitarian]] than its [[heterosexual]] counterpart in mainstream DC continuity. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''</ref>

* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, "[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley."<ref>''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant''</ref>

* On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager. She is killed by [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]].<ref>''Countdown'' #32</ref>

* In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a [[stripper]] (though this may be a ruse), and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker''</ref>

* In [[Batman (TV series)#Batman '66|Batman '66]], a version of Harley Quinn appears as Dr. Quinn, a psychiatric specialist at Arkham Asylum here called Arkham ''Institute'' for the Criminally Insane. She convinces Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref>Batman '66 #3</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:HarleyBirdsOfPrey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mia Sara]] portraying Harley Quinn in ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.]]
In 2002, a live-action television series called ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', loosely based on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|comic]] of the same name, included Harley Quinn as a psychotic psychiatrist and main antagonist. The character was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]] (replacing [[Sherilyn Fenn]] from an [[Unaired Pilot (Birds of Prey)|unaired pilot episode]]). The show aired only 13 episodes. In this show, she is portrayed as an older, far more calculating and sinister character than her bubbly comic and cartoon personas. Picking up where the Joker had left off, Harleen Quinzel used her day job as a therapist to achieve her savage purpose â€“ to take control of the city of New Gotham. She does not wear a costume, although she does wear an outfit that is reminiscent of her cartoon costume in the series finale "[[Devil's Eyes]]". In that episode, she uses experimental technology to transfer [[metahuman]] [[mind control]] powers to herself. She occasionally makes reference to her "sweet Mr. J.", laments his loss as a Gotham City crime boss and hints at a past relationship reminiscent to that of the animated series. A criminal known as the Crawler addresses her as "the Joker's girlfriend" in the seventh episode "Split".

Harley Quinn makes an appearance on the [[Kids' WB]] series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]. In the episode "Two of a Kind" (written by her co-creator Paul Dini), this version of the character is at first the host of [[pop psychology]] television show "''Heart To Heart With Harley''". Harleen Quinzel claims to have obtained a degree in psychology from an [[online degree|online educational institution]], and she gives off-the-cuff advice to her callers that usually hurts more than it helps, resulting in a lot of controversy in the media (which the Joker finds amusing as he admits to being a fan of her show). Her boss Jimmy Herbert becomes fed up with her irresponsible behavior and cancels the show on the air after she stages an ambush of Bruce Wayne by getting him on her show under a false promise to help him promote a charity-drive for crime victims. The Joker, seeing the episode and learning that it has led to Harley having an emotional breakdown, proceeds to take advantage of the situation by making her his partner. Harley rationalizes joining the Joker by telling herself that she will be able to get a tell-all from him that will restore her career, but then she ends up rampaging across Gotham city as the Joker's partner-in-crime. Eventually, Harley learns that the network is planning to share with the police a psychological profile of her by TV psychologist Dr. Elliot Blaine, so she plans to destroy the network as revenge for her firing, something which the Joker finds amusing, so he tags along with her. However, she is foiled by Batman, Robin, and Batgirl, and she is arrested after the Joker deserts her. She seemingly regrets taking up with him. However, once she has been taken into a police car, she sees that the Joker has left her an affectionate message, and instantly falls in love with him again. This incarnation wears a slightly different costume than the one she wears in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' as in this depiction, the black parts of the original are dark red, the headdress is larger than the original, the inverted diamond pattern on the shoulders and thighs is absent, her gloves are fingerless, and her mask conceals her eyes. She has a few short appearances in the episode "Rumor" and a slightly larger appearance in "The Metal Face of Comedy".

Harley Quinn appeared in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by Meghan Strange. This version is a henchwoman of Joker modeled after a 1920's [[flapper]] woman (shown in black-and-white) and does not sport her traditional costume. In the episode "Legends of the Dark Mite!" while [[Bat-Mite]] is giving a speech at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]], there is a brief cameo of [[Paul Dini]] (Harley Quinn's creator ) dressed up as her. Harley Quinn appears alongside the Joker in "Emperor Joker!". Though she has a mutual crush on Bat-Mite, she ultimately proves to love the Joker more. Alongside virtually every other character that appeared during the show's three season run, Harley makes a cameo appearance in the [[series finale]] "Mitefall!". She is shown with the Joker at the show's [[wrap party]] and kicks Gagsworthy when he tries to approach the Joker.

Harley Quinn makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' season two episode "Suicide Squad". Tara Strong reprises her voice role, while Quinn is physically portrayed by Cassidy Alexa (credited as "Deranged Squad Female").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/arrow-suicide-squad-review|title=This Ain't No Task Force.|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|publisher=IGN|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/arrow-review-suicide-squad/|title=â€˜ARROWâ€™ REVIEW: "SUICIDE SQUAD"|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kevin|publisher=Screencrush|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}</ref> The series star [[Stephen Amell]] revealed in an interview that she was originally set to appear in the season two finale episode "Unthinkable", but was cut due to time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/06/09/harley-quinn-scene-got-cut-from-arrow-season-2-finale/|title=Harley Quinn Scene Got Cut From Arrow Season 2 Finale|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|publisher=Comic Book|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref> The show's producer [[Andrew Kreisberg]] revealed that there are plans for Quinn's appearance in film or TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54915|title=AMELL, KREISBERG & MORE ON HOW "ARROW" CONTINUES TO GROW THE DC UNIVERSE|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|publisher=Comic Book Resource|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref>

===Film===
====Live-action====
Prior to the release of ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', [[Mark Protosevich]] was commissioned by [[Warner Bros.]] to write a script for a fifth ''Batman'' film titled ''[[Batman Triumphant]]'' to be directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], with Harley Quinn and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the film's villains. Rumors spread that Harley was to be portrayed by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Protosevich wrote Harley as the Joker's daughter seeking revenge, not his lover and henchgirl. This change was made in order to keep some on-screen continuity with the 1989 film in which the Joker was killed by Batman, and rumors also circulated that [[Jack Nicholson]] might reprise his role in a nightmare sequence caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2012/01/batman-unproduced-screenplays |title=Joel Schumacher Says He Wanted Nicolas Cage To Play Scarecrow In The Aborted 'Batman Triumphant' |last1=Toro |first1=Gabe |date=April 5, 2011 |website=[[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] |publisher= |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Due to ''Batman & Robin'''s poor box office run, bad [[Internet]] buzz, and several negative reviews from critics, ''Triumphant'' was never made, and the film franchise went on hiatus for eight years until ''[[Batman Begins]]'' in 2005.

Having once worked at the Asylum and knowing its layout and schedules, she is considered vital for the task.

[[File:HarleyArkham.jpg|180px|thumb|Harley Quinn with [[Quincy Sharp|Warden Sharp]] in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''.]]
* [[Arleen Sorkin]] reprises her role of Harley Quinn in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', as the secondary antagonist of the game, here with a new costume based on a nurse uniform. She takes control of Arkham, allowing Joker to escape, releases [[Poison Ivy]] from her cell, and kidnaps Warden [[Quincy Sharp]]. After Batman rescues Sharp, he confronts her and locks her in a cell. She returns in the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow's]] final nightmare as one of the guards escorting Batman away. This has been to the date the last time Arleen Sorkin had voiced her iconic character.
* Harley Quinn appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.batmanarkhamcity.com/forums/showthread.php/951-The-Voice-Behind-Harley-Quinn |title=The Voice Behind Harley Quinn: Batman Arkham City Community |publisher=Community.batmanarkhamcity.com |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> She is shown wearing a biker-girl themed costume in this game, using a low-key version of her usual makeup, with heavy eyeshadow in lieu of her domino mask. This costume featured knee high wedge boots and a corset like top. She wears her hair in two pigtails on both sides of her head, which she has dip dyed red and black. She now has tattoos of the Joker on her upper right arm and on the left side of her waist. She is characterized as being dangerously unstable and incompetent; at one point early in the game, she may be overheard having a conversation that inadvertently reveals key details of the Joker's plans. She is alternately loathed and lusted after by the Joker's gang, whom she treats as a group of dim-witted thugs. Harley had captured some doctors and police officers as hostages when Batman finds her in the church. Harley manages to get away while the Joker's henchmen fight Batman who ends up defeating them and saving the hostages (only for them to be later captured by the [[Riddler]]). Batman later encounters Harley in the Sionis Steel Mill where she was with the Joker. She later steals the cure for the Joker's illness while Batman was fighting Mr. Freeze for it, but is gagged up by [[Talia al Ghul]]. When the Joker dies from his illness following Batman's fight with Clayface (who was masquerading as a healthier Joker), Quinn was with the Joker's henchmen when Batman brought his dead body out of the theater. After completing the game, the player can enter the Joker's office, where several negative pregnancy tests and a positive test can be found, hinting she may be pregnant with the Joker's child. In the ending credits of the new game plus mode, Harley is heard singing a version of the lullaby "Hush, Little Baby," promising that "Mama's gonna kill for you the whole damn world." Harley appears in "Harley Quinn's Revenge" expansion as the main antagonist, seeking revenge on Batman for the death of the Joker; her doctor noted Harley was "losing it big time" because the Joker was the only thing keeping Harley relatively sane. By this time, Harley has dyed her hair completely black and wears almost all black, with a "J" necklace and mourning veil. After escaping from a temporary holding area following the destruction of Arkham City, Harley transforms the Steel Mill (the Joker's former base of operations) into a gigantic memorial of him. She is later beaten by the duo of Batman and Robin and taken into custody by the GCPD. Included as an [[easter egg]] in the manager's office of the Steel Mill, there is a crib with [[Scarface (comics)|Scarface]] painted as the Joker inside, surrounded by dozens of negative pregnancy tests accompanied by a single positive pregnancy test, which indicates that she had a miscarriage, the positive test was false, or after several failed attempts she finally got pregnant just before the Joker died.
* Harley Quinn introduced Martin Tremblay, president of Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, at the [[Nintendo]] Press Conference at E3 2012 where Batman Arkham City: Armored Edition was introduced for the [[Wii U]].
* Harley Quinn appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'', where she kidnaps a reporter to use as a hostage to free the Joker. After luring Batman into a trap, she tries to execute the bound and gagged reporter, but is stopped by one of Batman's batarangs. She is once again voiced by Tara Strong.
* Dr. Harleen Quinzel appears briefly in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' before her transformation into Harley Quinn. She interviews Joker at Blackgate Prison and falls in love with him after he confesses his fascination with someone who he considers special to him (Batman). She is voiced again by Tara Strong.
* While Dr. Harleen Quinzel never makes a physical appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate]]'', she is referred to in the unlockable Detective Case titled "Doctor's Orders." According to the Detective Case, Quinzel's increasing obsession with the Joker is not going unnoticed by her fellow staff, who are beginning to worry that the Joker may be manipulating Quinzel. The Case also states that Quinzel has started referring to the Joker as "Mister J" in her personal journal with hearts drawn around his name, rather than "Patient ARK119805."

* Harley Quinn appears as a playable fighter in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' voiced again by Tara Strong.<ref>http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2012/05/31/netherrealm-developing-new-dc-comics-fighting-game-injustice-gods-among-us/</ref>  In the alternate universe depicted in the game, Quinn broke from Joker after he bombed [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] asking "What did I ever see in him?". Following this, Harley reformed and realized her "true destiny" of becoming a hero where she establishes the Joker Clan. She is part of Batman's faction of heroes, and reacts very negatively when the "Prime" Joker appears, pointing a loaded gun at him. The Joker still temporarily gains her trust, but she gets over it again once he threatens to kill her when she fails to defeat her Earth's version of Lex Luthor who, unknown to her at the time, is a fellow Insurgent posing as an ally of Superman. In her battle ending, she had gone to marry The Joker, but after he playfully smashed her face into a cake, years of abuse made Harley snap. Using the ceremonial knife she slit The Joker's throat, killing him. It is then stated she permanently became a patient at the Arkham Asylum, still wearing her wedding gown.<ref>{{cite video |people=Tara Strong |date=November 14, 2013 |title=Infinite Crisis - Behind the Voice - Tara Strong as Harley Quinn |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPZxr2Y7zM |format= |medium=interview |publisher=YouTube |location= |accessdate=2014-03-05 |time= |quote=Why, hellllo Harley!
