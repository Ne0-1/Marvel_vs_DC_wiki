'''Harley Quinn''' ('''Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel''') was first introduced as a [[villain]]  on September 11, 1992, in the [[list of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', later adapted into [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Batman]]'' [[comic book]]s. As suggested by her name (a play on the word "[[harlequin]]"), she is clad in the manner of a traditional [[harlequin]] [[jester]]. The character is a frequent accomplice and the girlfriend of [[Batman]]'s nemesis the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and is also close to [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], from whom she gained her immunity to poisons and toxins, as well as her advanced physical abilities.

The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]] and was originally voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its [[DC animated universe|tie-ins]]. The character was portrayed by [[Hynden Walch]] on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' television series. In the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|''Birds of Prey'' series]], she was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]], and by [[Sherilyn Fenn]] in the pilot episode. Throughout her portrayals, she is shown to speak with a pronounced [[New York dialect|Brooklyn accent]]. 

[[IGN]]'s 2009 list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Harley Quinn as #45.<ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin: ''Batman: The Animated Series''===
Harley Quinn first appeared in the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]",<ref><!-- cite episode --> "[[Joker's Favor]]" (episode #7, original airdate: September 11, 1992)</ref> as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[bit part|walk-on]] role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre (although he ended up doing so anyway). Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web

| work = [[Starlog|Starlog magazine]] 
}}</ref> Having been friends with Sorkin since college, he incorporated aspects of her personality into the character.

The [[1994 in comics|1994]] [[graphic novel]] ''[[Mad Love (comic)|Mad Love]]'' recounts the character's [[origin story|origin]]. Told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book describes Harley as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who falls for the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-off sidekick/lover. The story received wide praise<ref>{{cite web
| title = Mad Love
| url = http://www.harley-quinn.com/oldsite/madlove.html
}}
</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode of the same name in [[1999 in television|1999]], making it the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series (the other was ''[[wikia:DCAnimated:Holiday Knights|Holiday Knights]]'').

She becomes fascinated with the Joker while [[intern]]ing at Arkham, and volunteers to analyze him. She falls hopelessly in love nearly instantly with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When the Joker is returned to Arkham after a battle with Batman, the sight of her badly injured patient drives Harley to don the costume and become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick and on/off girlfriend. She later becomes fast friends with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who injects her with [[antitoxin]]s to give her the same immunity to poisons she has (which explains why she is not affected whenever the Joker releases his lethal laughing gas).

===Expanded role===
After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons in the [[DC animated universe]], appearing in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Wild Cards" (alongside the Joker) and the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails" (alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]).

She appeared in ''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'' as a rival and [[foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor|Lex Luthor's]] assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley nearly kills Mercy when she duct tapes her mouth shut and tapes her to the top of a gigantic killer [[Android (robot)|android]], although she is rescued and untied by [[Batman]] and [[Superman]].

The animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', but it does include a flashback scene with Harley's career apparently ending by her falling down a deep pit during a battle with Batgirl. At the end of the movie, two twin juvenile girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them &mdash; to which they answer: "Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!"

===Comics history===
The character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]] (although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''Batman:  Thrillkiller  and Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in [[1997 in comics|1997]]).  The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Ivy from killing the vigilante [[Thorn (comics)|Thorn]], instead convincing her to leave the heroine hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.<ref><!-- cite comic -->''Harley Quinn'' #14</ref>

[[Image:HarleyqLG.jpg|Harley with the Joker on the cover of ''Batman: Harley Quinn''.<br>Art by [[Alex Ross]].|180px|thumb]]
Quinn's [[DC Universe]] comic book origin, revealed in ''Batman: Harley Quinn'' (October [[1999 in comics|1999]]), is largely an adaptation of her animated origin from the ''Mad Love'' graphic novel.

A ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]] was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from [[2001 in comics|2001]] to [[2003 in comics|2003]]. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston.  The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn eventually dies, only to be resurrected and return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychiatry major Guy Kopski whose suicide started her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]''.  She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).

In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823.

Harley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663, in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the "punchline" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.

Harley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831, written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for [[parole]], only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Peyton Riley|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole.

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #105, Harley Quinn is revealed as the sixth member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, "Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?", thus leaving the team.

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #43, Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement Holly Robinson, and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira|Themiscyra]] by "Athena" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].

Harley Quinn has joined forces with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Catwoman]] in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.

''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7 establishes that she was born and raised in [[Bensonhurst]], [[Brooklyn]] into a [[Jewish]]-[[Catholic]] family. Her father is a [[con artist]] who is still in jail. Her brother, Barry, is a slob with dreams of rock stardom, and her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the "villain and hero stuff".

Following a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham with the goal of killing the Joker for abusing her as often as he did. However, Harley ultimately chooses to instead release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20-23</ref> Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straightjacket and muzzle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011)</ref> Shortly after this, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011)</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011)</ref>

Now sporting a new costume and with her hair dyed half-red and half-black, like the jester cap of her original costume, Harley is later arrested by [[Black Canary]] after murdering one of the prosecutors who put the Joker behind bars. She is then tortured and forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad (comics)|Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #1 (September 2011)</ref> It is eventually revealed that she no longer wears face paint, and that her bleached skin is now part of a permanent condition.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #3 (November 2011)</ref>

==Other versions==
[[File:Harley-tnba.jpg|thumb|A picture of Harley Quinn from ''The New Batman Adventures'']]
*Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''Thrillkiller''. As with the other characters, her background is very different from the established version: Bruce Wayne, for instance, is a full-time detective in the [[Gotham City Police Department]] who becomes Batman after being framed for murder, teaming up with Batgirl (aka [[Barbara Gordon]]) who has already been active for some time. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called '''Bianca Steeplechase'''. The relationship between this [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] Joker and Harley Quinn is short-lived but noticeably more [[egalitarian]] than its [[heterosexual]] counterpart in mainstream DC continuity. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.

*In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, "[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley."

*On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager. She is killed by [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]].

*In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a [[stripper]] (though this may be a ruse), and is never shown speaking.

==In other media==
===Film===
====''Justice League''====
In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', Harley is the name of a monkey owned by the Jester (Joker's Parallel Earth equivalent).

====''Batman Triumphant''====
Prior to the release of ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', [[Mark Protosevich]] was commissioned by [[Warner Bros.]] to write a script for a fifth ''Batman'' film titled ''[[Batman Triumphant]]'' to be directed by [[Joel Schumacher]]. Harley Quinn was allegedly included as one of the film's three villains, opposite [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Man-Bat]]. In July 2000, Protosevich confirmed Scarecrow and Quinn as the only two villains. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was rumored for the role, which he had rewritten as the Joker's daughter seeking revenge, not his lover and henchgirl as portrayed in the animated series and ''Batman'' comics. <!-- <ref name="rumblings" /> --> Due to ''Batman & Robin'''s poor box office run, bad [[Internet]] buzz, and several negative reviews from critics, ''Triumphant'' was never made, and the film franchise went on hiatus for eight years until ''[[Batman Begins]]'' in 2005. The unmade film served as a testament for Quinn's popularity, as the film's production and initial planned release was set before she had been introduced into DC's continuity.

===Television===
====''Birds of Prey''====
In 2002, a live-action television series called ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', loosely based on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|comic]] of the same name, included Harley Quinn as a psychotic psychiatrist and main villain.  The character was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]], who replaced [[Sherilyn Fenn]] (originator of the role in an [[Unaired Pilot (Birds of Prey)|unaired pilot episode]]).  The show aired only 13 episodes.  In this show, Harley is portrayed as an older, far more calculating and sinister character than her bubbly comic and cartoon personas. She also does not wear a costume, although she does wear an outfit that is reminiscent of her cartoon costume in the series finale, "[[Devil's Eyes]]". In that episode, she used experimental technology to transfer [[metahuman]] [[mind control]] powers to herself. It is unknown about this version's relationship with the Joker, although she does make reference to him as "Mr. J." on a few occasions, laments his loss as Gotham's crime boss and hints at a past relationship reminiscent to that of the animated series.

====''The Batman''====
Harley Quinn is introduced to the [[Kids' WB]] series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' in the [[Seconds (The Batman)|Season 4]] episode ''"Two of a Kind."'' This version of the character, voiced by [[Hynden Walch]], is originally the host of a [[pop psychology]] television show called "''Heart To Heart With Harley''". Claiming to have obtained an [[online degree]] for psychology, she gives off-the-cuff advice to her callers that usually hurts more than helps. Her boss, Jimmy Herbert, fed up with her irresponsible behavior, cancels the show on the air after she stages an ambush on Bruce Wayne during her show, after falsely promising she would allow him to promote a charity-drive for crime victims. The Joker sees the episode and proceeds to take advantage of the situation. Initially thinking getting a tell-all from the Joker would restore her career, Harley Quinn ends up rampaging the town with the Joker. Eventually, she is arrested after the Joker deserts her, and seemingly regrets taking up with him. Once loaded into a police car, she sees that Joker has left her an affectionate message, and instantly falls in love with him again. This incarnation of Harley Quinn wears a slightly different costume than the one she wears in ''Batman: The Animated Series,'' as the black parts of the original are dark red here, the headdress is larger here than the original, the inverted diamond pattern on the shoulders and thighs is absent, her gloves are fingerless, and her mask conceals her eyes.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
In the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Mite!" while [[Bat-Mite]] is giving a speech at the [[Comic-Con]], there is a brief cameo of Harley Quinn's creator [[Paul Dini]] dressed up as her. Harley Quinn appears alongside the Joker in "Emperor Joker!", voiced by [[Meghan Strange]]. This version is a henchwoman of Joker, modeled after  a 1920's [[flapper]] woman, shown in black-and-white, and does not sport her traditional costume, but Bat-Mite does. Though she has a mutual crush on Bat-Mite, she ultimately proves to love the Joker more. Alongside virtually every other character that appeared duing the show's three season run, Harley makes a cameo appearance in the [[series finale]], "Mitefall!" She is shown with the Joker at the show's [[wrap party]], and kicks Gagsworthy when he tries to approach the Joker.

===''Young Justice''===
A teenager dressed as Harley Quinn appears at a costume party in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Secrets". 

===Video games===
[[Image:HarleyArkham.jpg|Harley with Warden Sharp in ''Batman: Arkham Asylum''.|180px|thumb]]
Harley Quinn also appears in several video games based upon the animated series.

* She appears in a [[cameo appearance|cameo role]] in ''[[The Adventures of Batman & Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], and as a boss in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]].

* She also appears in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' (voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]]) for the [[Mega-CD|Sega CD]] and ''[[Batman: Chaos in Gotham]]''.

* Harley Quinn played a major role in the game's storyline in ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'' voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]]. She first appears posing as "Mary Flynn" in a trap for Batman set by the Joker; she later does the Joker's dirty work after he fakes his death.

* She appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'' with her sound effects provided by [[Grey DeLisle]]. She appears as an enemy of Batman and a 1st deputy of the Joker..<ref>{{cite web

She can perform high jumps like most women in the game.

* Arleen Sorkin reprises her role of Harley Quinn in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', as one of the main antagonists of the game, here with a new costume based on a nurse uniform. Her friendship with Poison Ivy is referenced here, where she hesitates on releasing Ivy from her cell in fear of angering the Joker. She is finally caught after her attempt to trap Batman in a cell in the intensive treatment ward failed, Batman defeating a swarm of henchmen before trapping Harley in a cell. After her capture Harley is shown in one of the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow's]] hallucinations as one of the villains escorting Batman into Arkham, similar to the guards who brought the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] into Arkham Asylum at the beginning of the game. When the player finds one of the Riddler trophies in a cell next to hers after her capture, Harley taunts Batman for falling in a trap of hers, but she is surprised only seconds later when the player breaks out of the cell.

* Harley Quinn was also seen in the initial [[teaser trailer]] for ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' alongside the Joker. She appears to be wearing a biker-girl themed costume in this game, using a low-key version of her usual makeup, with only black eye shadow in lieu of her domino mask and with the tips of her hair dyed red and black. It is mentioned that Joker's illness has put great stress on Harley, and she is more erratic and irrational. She is voiced by [[Tara Strong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.batmanarkhamcity.com/forums/showthread.php/951-The-Voice-Behind-Harley-Quinn |title=The Voice Behind Harley Quinn: Batman Arkham City Community |publisher=Community.batmanarkhamcity.com |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> The game's prequel comic reveals that Harley was able to free the Joker from Arkham after attacking a female guard and stealing the woman's uniform. She then murdered a number of other guards and was able to take the Joker to an abandoned factory.<ref>''Batman: Arkham City'' #2</ref> Harley is eventually attacked by [[Talia al Ghul]], who leaves her bound and gagged in the factory after stealing the cure for the Joker's condition, which she gives to Batman. She somehow frees herself and is present at the end of the game, where she breaks down and begins sobbing after the Joker dies of his condition. After completing the game, the player can enter Harley's room, where a positive pregnancy test can be found. In the ending credits, Harley is heard singing to a baby, promising the child that she plans on killing "the whole damn world", leaving a cliffhanger for a possible sequel. After Joker is killed most of the clowns talk of either quitting or revolting, as Harley is hated and feared by her subordinates. If there are any Harley-Heads left after beating the game you can hear Harley crying over the Joker's death.

* Harley Quinn appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game, with Arleen Sorkin returning as her voice.
