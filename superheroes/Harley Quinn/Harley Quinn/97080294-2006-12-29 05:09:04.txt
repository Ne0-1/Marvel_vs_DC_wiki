'''Harley Quinn''' (real name '''Dr. Harleen Quinzel''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillainess]] in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', as well as the [[Detective Comics|DC Comics]] [[Batman]] series and its spin-offs, and subsequently in various Batman-related [[comic book]]s. As suggested by her name (a play on the word "[[harlequin]]"), she is clad in the manner of a traditional [[Jester|harlequin jester]].  She is one of the rare characters to have originated in an animated series and thereafter been added to the comic book continuity, as opposed to the other way around (other examples are [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]], [[Renee Montoya]], [[Mercy Graves]], and Marvel's [[Firestar]] and [[X-23]]). She is also the only such character to have gone on to have an eponymous comic book.

The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]] and is voiced in the [[animated series]] by [[Arleen Sorkin]].

==History on ''Batman: The Animated Series''==

The idea of the Joker having a female sidekick was not new by the time of The Animated Series. Like many other male [[Enemies of Batman|Batman villains]], he had, at one time or another, a female assistant in the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|60's television show]]. One of the Joker's TV female sidekicks was named Venus who appeared in the episode "The Zodiac Crimes". Joker treated her much as he did Harley, ignorant to her feelings, especially when she began to have second thoughts about a life of crime. This may be the inspiration for the type of relationship Joker and Harley have together.

Harley Quinn first appeared in the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]" (episode #22, original airdate: [[September 11]] [[1992]]), where she served as a humorous female [[sidekick]] and on-again, off-again girlfriend to the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. In her first appearances she was depicted as completely devoted to the Joker, oblivious to what a [[psychopath]]ic monster he truly is; a characterization that has remained more or less consistent throughout her subsequent appearances.

At one point, the Joker, frustrated with Quinn, kicked her out.  She proceeded to steal a Harlequin Diamond in the Gotham Museum to prove her worth to the Joker.  The same day in the museum, [[Poison Ivy]] was robbing it of plant toxins.  The two became quick friends and Ivy took her back to her lair in a [[toxic waste]] dump where she nursed her back to health, as well as injecting her with a serum which has given Harley an immunity to all toxins and poisons (offscreen, the side effect of it also dramatically enhances Harley's strength, stamina, and speed).   Harley and Ivy teamed up and conducted a number of successful capers, which came to a temporary end after Joker welcomed Harley back (Ivy was not happy with Harley's lingering feelings for the Joker, whom she never liked).

However, Ivy remained Quinn's first point of call when she and The Joker were going through a rough patch.  She adopted the role of older sister and teller of harsh truths to Quinn about her helpless infatuation with The Joker.  When Ivy demanded during "Harley and Ivy" that Quinn stand up for herself, Quinn said "I'm nobody's doormat &mdash; am I?" Ivy replied, "If you had a middle name, it would be 'Welcome'.

She frequently refers to the Joker as "puddin'" and "Mr. J," and she refers to Poison Ivy as "red" (a reference to her [[red hair]]).

The 1994 [[graphic novel]] ''[[Mad Love (comic)|The Batman Adventures: Mad Love]]'' recounted the character's origin. Told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book described Harley as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who fell in love with the Joker. The story received wide praise [http://www.harley-quinn.com/madlove.html] and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode "Mad Love" in 1999, making it the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series. 

[[Image:Justice_league_harley_quinn.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Harley Quinn, as seen in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series (Episode: Wild Cards).]]

In the animated series, Quinn often teamed up with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] against [[Batman]]. Quinn's partnership with Ivy was one of the few villainous team-ups in the animated series seemingly rooted in genuine friendship, although Quinn's flaky personality often tried Ivy's patience. The close friendship between the two characters, particularly in the animated series, fueled fan speculation of possible [[lesbian]] undertones. Hints to the existence of such a relationship appeared in "Batgirl Adventures #1" (February 1998) and the "Harley and Ivy" miniseries (May-June 2004), both by Dini and Timm (in the latter they are actually shown sharing a bed when Ivy wakes up from having a nightmare).

After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley made several other animated appearances. She appeared as one of the four main female characters of the [[web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons of the [[DC Animated Universe]], appearing in the ''Justice League'' episode "Wild Cards" (alongside the Joker) and the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails" (alongside Poison Ivy).

In issue #16 of the ''[[Batman Adventures]]'' comic series, Harley was almost married to the Joker.  When Ivy came to crash the wedding and tried to kill the Joker, she was stopped by [[Batgirl]].  At the very end of the comic, Harley vowed to kill Ivy no matter what, thus apparently ending their partnership (it should be noted, however, that the ''Batman Adventures'' comic book series, while continuing on from ''Batman: The Animated Series'', does not reflect [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] developments within the wider Batman/DC Comics universe).

''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' depicted Quinn's ultimate fate. Batman and others presumed her dead after she fell into a deep crevasse during Batman's final showdown with the Joker; however, bottomless pits are a notoriously unreliable means of [[comic book death|death in comic books]] . Indeed, a scene toward the end of the film revealed that Quinn survived to start a family, with her twin granddaughters Delia and Deidre Dennis eventually joining the [[Jokerz]] gang, something which the elderly Harley does not appreciate. (After the twins are released from their cell, one of them says to Quinn, "Shut up, Nana Harley.") Harley is both Paul Dini's favorite character and his main original addition to the Batman mythos, and having to kill her off unsettled him, so he inserted that scene into the script on his own. It survived thanks to Timm, who felt the lighter moment provided appropriate relief after the intensity of the [[climax (narrative)|climax]].

==DC Universe Comic history==

The character proved so popular that a version of her was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]].  The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of The Joker, is more dangerously [[psychosis|psychotic]] and less humorously kooky than the animated series version.

Quinn's [[DC Universe]] comic book origin, revealed in ''Batman: Harley Quinn'' (October 1999), is largely an adaptation of her animated origin from the ''Batman Adventures: Mad Love'' graphic novel.

While interning at Arkham, Harleen Quinzel became fascinated with one particular inmate, the Joker, and ambitiously volunteered to analyze him.  She fell in love nearly instantly with the Joker during their sessions.  After helping him escape from the asylum more than once, she was caught by her superiors, her license was revoked, and she was put in her own cell.  During an earthquake in [[Gotham City]], she fled and became Harley Quinn, The Joker's partner-in-crime. 

In ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', Joker finds himself beginning to care for her. Naturally, this can't be countenanced, so he decides to kill her. After he takes her into his bed for what may, or may not be the consummation of their relationship (Harley is apparently drugged) he lures her into a rocket ship, telling her, in part: "I've noticed some changes coming over me since you came into my life. I've been reminded what it was like to be part of a couple. To care for someone who cares for me. It's the first time in recent memory I've had those feelings... And I ''hate'' having those feelings!" He launches the rocket, soberly telling an enraged Harley that he will truly mourn her, before erupting into a fit of his trademark diabolical laughter. 

The rocket lands in Robinson Park, where Harley first meets Poison Ivy. Ivy saves her, but after taking her in, recognizes Harley as Dr. Quinzel from the Arkham staff. When Harley regains consciousness, Ivy initially plans to kill her. The prospect of her own death totally fails to move Harley, and Ivy is curious as to why. She convinces Harley to tell her story, and comes to feel a kinship with Harley. Considering her another castoff, Ivy offers to help Harley take her revenge on both Batman and the Joker.

Ivy gives Quinn a treatment that immunizes her to various assorted toxins and Ivy's own poisonous touch. It also dramatically enhances Harley's strength and speed. Ivy intends this to give her new friend an edge on Batman and the Joker. Hot-blooded Harley, however, is angrier at the Joker than at Batman, and even initially works ''with'' the Dark Knight to help bring down the Clown Prince of Crime. While Batman eliminates the villain's muscle, Quinn chases the Joker up a damaged building, intending to send him falling to his death. Before she can do so, however, the Joker apologizes. Falling in love with him again, she forgives him on the spot, and serves as his lieutenant throughout the rest of ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'', as well as the ''Emperor Joker'' storyline.

A ''Harley Quinn'' ongoing series was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003.  Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], [[A.J. Leiberman]] and Mike Huddleston.  The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum.  She is next seen in the DC Universe in the ''[[Villains United]]'' Infinite Crisis Special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham. (She is, however, knocked unconscious the moment she escapes.)

[[One Year Later]], Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham Asylum, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823. As she watches Poison Ivy wrestle with a huge plant, she exclaims excitedly, "Now that's entertainment!". Dini said in a press conference that she will appear in an upcoming issue of ''Detective Comics'' soon and that the cover has already been done.

Harley Quinn continues to appear in other DC comic books.  She should not be confused with [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]], a distinct ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' character originally appearing in the seventies.

==Harley and the Joker==
Harley's relationship with the Joker is one of the most complex and controversial in the [[DC Universe]].  While he often degrades and hurts her, sometimes near the point of death, there are many instances that show a more playful or mutually affectionate side to their bizarre relationship. In the animated universe, the Joker said of her, "a sweet kid, but a lousy cook". In some stories that dare to deal with the touchy subject more in depth, it is implied that the Joker wrestles with the extremely vexing idea of actually ''caring'' for someone.  In the book ''Batman: Animated'', [[Mark Hamill]] (who provided the voice of the Joker in ''Batman: the Animated Series'') says "Expressing emotion in any way that's real and meaningful is alien to the Joker, but he's learning those parts of himself, however unconsciously, through Harley."  Sorkin adds, "Everyone else sees the Joker laugh; only Harley has ever seen him cry."  One example of this occasional bend in their rollercoaster relationship comes from the ''Emperor Joker'' series (''Action Comics'' #770) where Joker shares with Harley his deeply personal reasons for destroying the [[universe]], and instead of destroying her with it, he gives her a last kiss and turns her into a [[constellation]], saying "You get the best seat in the house for [[Armageddon]].  Say goodnight, Harley.  I always wanted to see my dame in lights. Heh.  Even in a moment of abject saccharine, I still got it."

A good source for a more in-depth look at the early stages of their DC Universe relationship is [[Greg Rucka]]'s ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' novel.</p>

==Other media==

Harley Quinn also appeared in several video games based upon the animated series- as a cameo only role as she only has a couple of lines of dialogue in ''[[Adventures of Batman & Robin|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super NES]], and as a boss in ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega Genesis]], ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega CD]] and ''Batman: Chaos in Gotham''. Harley Quinn was not a boss in the video game ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'', but she played a major role in the game's storyline. First she poses as a woman named Mary Flynn in a trap for Batman set by the Joker. Then throughout the game Harley does the Joker's dirty work after he fakes his death. She does command a fat clown during one of the boss battles, but is not battled directly. In Sega CD's ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' and ''Batman Vengeance'', she was voiced by her regular voice actress, Arleen Sorkin.

In 2002, a live-action television series called ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'', loosely based on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|comic]] of the same name, included Harley Quinn as a psychotic psychiatrist and main villain.  The character was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]], who replaced [[Sherilyn Fenn]] (originator of the role in an unaired [[pilot episode]]).  The show aired only 13 episodes.  In this show, Harley was portrayed as a far more calculating and sinister character than her bubbly and energetic comic and cartoon personas.

Harley Quinn will appear in season 4 of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. While her design is relatively unchanged, her past is somewhat altered. Instead of being a psychiatrist at Arkham, she will begin as a TV [[pop psychology|pop psychologist]]. The Joker will take an interest in her once Batman takes out [[Punch and Judy]], his two henchmen, once again. She will be voiced by [[Hynden Walch]].[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/thebatman/?x=guides/04]

In 2005, [[Mattel]] released a Harley Quinn [[Barbie]] doll, along with dolls of several other [[DC Comics]] characters.

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
*Comic book fanatic and filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]] named his daughter Harley Quinn Smith after the character.[http://www.viewaskew.com/harley/]
*[[Arleen Sorkin]], the voice of Harley Quinn, starred in a [[soap opera]] which included a dream sequence where she wore a jester costume. [[Paul Dini]] used this scene as an inspiration for the character, writing her specifically so Sorkin could voice the character. Dini, who had been friends with Sorkin for years, adapted aspects of her personality into the character.
*In Harley Quinn's first appearance, in the episode "Joker's Favor," her sole purpose was to walk into a police banquet with a giant cake.  She did not have her trademark costume on for most of the episode, dressing instead as a police officer.  In addition, Harley evidently was originally supposed to be a typical stereotypical gun moll of the type from the campy live action [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] television show from the 1960's.  This shows when she is easily captured by Batman and handcuffed for the police;  she ruefully remarks, "Oy, Beauty school is starting to look really good now.".  In retrospect, that is an unusual statement coming from a woman who is revealed to have been a licensed doctor, but she probably was being sarcastic or she was originally going to be a beautician before going into psychology and meeting The Joker.
*According to the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "Harlequinade," Harley bleaches her hair and is not a natural blonde.
*Many references in the show and comics suggest that Harley is of Jewish faith or ancestry.
*Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the animated series was in the [[Elseworlds]] mini-series ''[[Batman Thrillkiller]]'', though, like the other characters, her background is very different to the established ones (in this case she is a schoolgirl who dresses up to help a womanised version of the Joker).
*At one time, [[Bizarro]] created a Bizarro-Harley Quinn after he had a crush on her. Bizarro-Harley died due to instabilities.
