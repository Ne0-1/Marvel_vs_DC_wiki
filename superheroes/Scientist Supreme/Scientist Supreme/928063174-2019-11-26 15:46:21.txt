'''Andrew Forson''' is the sixth character within A.I.M. to use the title of Scientist Supreme. The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #610 and was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Ryan Stegman]].

Forson was the Scientist Supreme of A.I.M. after the organization became public and established their base in the now-sovereign island nation of Barbuda and overthrew the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] with consent of the rest of A.I.M.. Barbuba was then renamed A.I.M. Island.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #610 (November 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Forson appears as the Supreme Leader of the new High Council of A.I.M., consisting of [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] (as the Minister of Science), Jude the Entropic Man (as the [[Health minister|Minister of Health]]), [[Mentallo]] (as the Minister of Home Affairs), [[Superia]] (as the [[Education minister|Minister of Education]] in Bagalia), the female [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Super-Adaptoid]] (as the [[Minister of State]] in Bagalia), and the undercover [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] (as the [[Defence minister|Minister of Defense]]).<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #2 (March 2013).

During the battle, Forson takes the opportunity to steal the [[Iron Patriot]] armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3 (April 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Daisy Johnson]] launched an unsanctioned operation to send the Secret Avengers to A.I.M. Island to assassinate Forson, and the group seemingly killed him. Despite Johnson ending up suspended for breaking protocol and [[Maria Hill]] being put in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. again, Forson was revealed to be alive all along, and the news of A.I.M. being a new permanent member of the Security Council is known.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #5 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Forson finds Superia when she is badly injured after an incident on A.I.M. Island regarding an escaped creature.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> An A.I.M. Agent then approaches Forson and Superia showing them a 2-D hologram of the organism beating the Avengers. Taking pride in this, Forson orders their translocator activated and to retrieve their "lost child".<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #16 (July 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Taskmaster is shot and seemingly killed by Mockingbird now under Forson's control,<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #13 (February 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Forson revealed that Mockingbird was secretly working for Forson years ago, and that he used Mockingbird to "get [[Victorius (comics)|Victorious]] out of the way" so that he could take over the Cult of Entropy.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #14 (March 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref> Forson also uses [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptoids]] from an alternate reality to combat the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #25-28 (January–April 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Using an as-yet-unidentified device, Forson and A.I.M. accelerate the flow of time in the limits of A.I.M. Island, creating in a matter of hours for the real world year of progress and transforming A.I.M. into a technologically advanced empire.<ref>''Avengers World'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]] comes to the island, Forson has Jude the Entropic Man transform her into his messenger.<ref>''Avengers World'' #2 (January 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Forson is an experienced scientist with genius-level intellect.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The A.I.M. Scientist Supreme appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]''. In the episode "Ready, A.I.M., Fire", he was shown to be among the A.I.M. agents working on [[MODOK]]. In “Designed Only For Chaos” A.I.M. succeeds in creating MODOK using the [[Living Laser]]. The Scientist Supreme is ultimately murdered by MODOK so MODOK can take control of A.I.M.; ironically, he had intended to put MODOK in command of A.I.M. anyway.
* Two different versions of the A.I.M. Scientist Supreme appears on ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]] (first iteration),<ref>{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew of ''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes'' "Breakout: Part 1|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699027fullcredits#cast |work=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=2011-12-01}}</ref> and by [[Kyle Hebert]] (Lyle Getz).<ref>{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew of ''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes'' "Prisoner of War|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2355209fullcredits#cast |work=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=2012-01-07}}</ref> The first version that is seen comes off as the unknown iteration. In "Breakout" Pt. 1, the unidentified Scientist Supreme has a deal with [[Lucia von Bardas]] (on [[Doctor Doom]]'s behalf) which gets interrupted by [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark). He gets transferred to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] only just when the prison breakouts occur, escaping alongside other villains. In "Alone Against A.I.M", the Scientist Supreme gets his revenge by unleashing [[Technovore]] within [[Stark Industries]]. He also holds [[Pepper Potts]] hostage until he's defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In "Prisoner of War", Getz is captured and replaced by a Skrull impersonator. Although imprisoned, he assists [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) and other captured individuals ([[Invisible Woman]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]], [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], [[Clay Quartermain]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]) in escaping from the [[Skrull]]s' custody and the [[Super-Skrull]]. In "Secret Invasion", Getz's Skrull imposter uses his satellite weapon inventions that could destroy all life when [[Veranke]]'s invasion wasn't in the Skrulls' favor, however, Getz's satellites were destroyed by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and his Skrull imposter is arrested by [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] agents.
* An amalgamated iteration of the A.I.M. Scientist Supreme appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Ultron Revolution]]'', voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Adapting to Change|series=Avengers: Ultron Revolution|serieslink=Avengers Assemble (TV series)|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=1|airdate=March 13, 2016}}</ref> This version has George Clinton's appearance, Valdemar Tykkio's accent, and Andrew Forson's attire. In the episode "Adapting to Change", he has three advanced [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptoid]]s fight the Avengers. The Scientist Supreme then merges with the three Adaptoids as the '''[[Super-Adaptoid|Supreme Adaptoid]]''', resulting in a more challenging fight but eventually ends up defeated by the Avengers. However, [[Ultron]]'s salvaged duplicate absorbs the Super Adaptoid's technology and intelligence, presumably killing the Scientist Supreme in the progress. 
* The Monica Rappaccini version of the A.I.M. Scientist Supreme appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=School of Hard Knocks|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=30|airdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref> This version is a Scientist Supreme of A.I.M. who oversees their front at an elite boarding school called the Bilderberg Academy while posing as its headmistress. In the episode "School of Hard Knocks", she ran an experiment labeled 237 on selected students that enable them to have the combined powers of Captain America, [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Hulk]]. After subduing one of the escaped students, [[Spider-Man]] infiltrates Bilderberg Academy and encounters [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]] who has been assigned by Iron Man to do the same. When the two heroes confront her, she manipulates the student Grady Scraps into synching the powers into the student Douglas and a random student. Due to Grady overloading upon being thrown into the chamber, Spider-Man and Ms. Marvel reverse the procedure just in time for Iron Man and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] to round up the A.I.M. agents involved and hand them over to the police.
