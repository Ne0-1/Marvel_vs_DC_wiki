* The A.I.M. Scientist Supreme appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]''. In the episode "Ready, A.I.M., Fire", he was shown to be among the A.I.M. agents working on [[MODOK]].
* Two different versions of A.I.M. Scientist Supreme appears on ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]] (first iteration),<ref>{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew of ''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes'' "Breakout: Part 1|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699027fullcredits#cast |work=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=2011-12-01}}</ref> and by [[Kyle Hebert]] (Lyle Getz).<ref>{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew of ''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes'' "Prisoner of War|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2355209fullcredits#cast |work=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=2012-01-07}}</ref> The first version that is seen comes off as the unknown iteration. The second iteration is the creator of satellite weapons that could destroy all life. In "Breakout" Pt. 1, the unidentified Scientist Supreme has a deal with [[Lucia von Bardas]] (on [[Doctor Doom]]'s behalf) which gets interrupted by [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark). He gets transferred to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] only just when the prison breakouts occur, escaping alongside other villains. In "Alone Against A.I.M", the Scientist Supreme gets his revenge by unleashing [[Technovore]] within [[Stark Industries]]. He also holds [[Pepper Potts]] hostage until he's defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In "Prisoner of War", Getz is captured and replaced by a Skrull impersonator. Although imprisoned, he assists [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) and other captured individuals ([[Invisible Woman]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]], [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], [[Clay Quartermain]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]) in escaping from the [[Skrull]]s' custody and the [[Super-Skrull]]. In "Secret Invasion", Getz's Skrull imposter uses his satellites when [[Veranke]]'s invasion wasn't in the Skrulls' favor, however, Getz's satellites were destroyed by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and his Skrull imposter is arrested by [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] agents.

Scientist Supreme appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Ultron Revolution]]'', voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Adapting to Change|series=Avengers: Ultron Revolution|serieslink=Avengers Assemble (TV series)|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=1|airdate=March 13, 2016}}</ref> This version has George Clinton's appearance, Valdemar Tykkio's accent and Andrew Forson's attire. In the episode "Adapting to Change", the Scientist Supreme has three advanced [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptoid]]s fight the Avengers. The Scientist Supreme then merges with the three Adaptoids to be the '''[[Super-Adaptoid|Supreme Adaptoid]]''', resulting in a more challenging fight but eventually ends up defeated by the Avengers. However, [[Ultron]]'s salvaged duplicate absorbs his Adaptoid remains, presumably killing him in the process.
