'''Gamora''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]].  She is the adopted daughter of [[Thanos]] and the occasional love interest of [[Adam Warlock]] and [[Nova (comics)| Nova]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Gamora is the last of her species, the '''Zen Whoberi''', who were exterminated by the [[Badoon]] (in her original timeline, her species was exterminated by the [[Universal Church of Truth]]). Thanos found the child and decided to use her as a weapon. Gamora was raised and trained by Thanos to assassinate the Magus, an evil alternate version of [[Adam Warlock]]. Thanos showed her little kindness during her childhood, but Gamora was very loyal to the man who promised her the opportunity to avenge the death of her family. Gamora became very proficient in the [[martial arts]], earning the nickname ''"The most dangerous woman in the universe"''. When she was a teenager, Thanos took her on a trip. Gamora came into conflict with a group of thugs and despite her skill they defeated her. Thanos found her and restored her to health, cybernetically enhancing her to superhuman levels.

As an adult, Gamora was sent as an assassin against the Universal Church of the Truth, quickly becoming feared by its agents, the Black Knights. Gamora teamed up with Adam Warlock, who wanted to stop his older version. She even managed to get close to the Magus but failed her assassination in the last second. Together with Warlock, [[Pip the Troll]] and Thanos, Gamora fought to escape the Universal Church of Truth. Eventually the Magus was defeated, but Thanos revealed himself as an even greater threat. Gamora and Pip tried to stop him, but were killed by Thanos.<ref>Avengers Annual #7</ref> Adam Warlock absorbed their souls into his [[Infinity Gems|Soul Gem]]. <ref>Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2</ref>

===Infinity Watch===
Inside the Soul Gem was '''Soulworld''', a place where Gamora, Pip and eventually Adam Warlock himself lived at peace. When Thanos managed to obtain all the [[Infinity Gems]], forming the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], Adam Warlock decided that he must be stopped. Warlock led Gamora and Pip the Troll out of Soulworld into the real world. Their souls took over the bodies of three humans, who had recently died in a car crash. Gamora was erased from existence by Thanos when he erased half the population in the universe. Thanos was defeated and Gamora returned to existence. 

Warlock now had the Infinity Gauntlet, giving him near [[omnipotence]]. However, the [[Living Tribunal]] intervened and Warlock divided the Infinity Gems among several guardians, known as the Infinity Watch. Gamora received the [[Time Gem]], but was incapable of consciously using it, though it did give her sporadic [[precognition|precognitive]] dreams and visions. Gamora had become romantically interested in Adam, but Adam did not respond to her. In an argument over the Infinity Watch member [[Maxam]], Gamora left the Infinity Watch and the Time Gem behind. She returned to work as a [[mercenary]] until Adam Warlock approached her again. They continued to travel together and eventually Adam reciprocated her love. Adam and Gamora remained in a pocket dimension outside the [[Marvel Universe]] to raise the cosmic being known as [[Atleza]].

===Annihilation===

Gamora later reappears in the pages of ''[[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]'', having left the company of Adam Warlock and settled on the world Godthab Omega as leader of a group of female warriors called The Graces. She is intent on re-establishing her reputation as the deadliest woman in the universe and now wields a powerful blade known as ''Godslayer''. She joins the United Front of Nova, using her skills to launch quick counterattacks against the [[Annihilation Wave]] and is engaged in a sexual relationship with the United Front's leader, [[Nova (comics)| Nova]].

During the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]'s invasion of the Kree homeworld following the Annihilation War, Gamora is assimilated as a "select" of the hive mind. They dispatch her to apprehend Nova after he flees the planet. (''Nova'' #4, vol. 4)

==Powers and abilities==
In her first appearances, Gamora's speed and strength were enhanced by Thanos to rival Warlocks (to better slay The Magus); he also gave her intensive martial training. In the pages of ''Infinity Watch'', it is revealed that Gamora had been cybernetically enhanced to have superhuman strength, speed, and a healing factor equal to that of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. Gamora's strength and speed were further enhanced by Adam Warlock when they returned from Soulworld.

Gamora is one of the most skilled martial artists in the Marvel Universe. She is capable of defeating opponents who possess superhuman strength and durability that far surpasses her own, and she has defeated a military platoon containing dozens of combat-trained men in only a few minutes. She has learned to paralyze or kill opponents using vital point strikes directed at certain nerve clusters. Although skilled in the use of most conventional weapons, she prefers to use knives and swords.

When she was carrying the [[Infinity Gems|Time Gem]], Gamora was prone to precognitive dreams and visions, though she had no conscious control over them.
