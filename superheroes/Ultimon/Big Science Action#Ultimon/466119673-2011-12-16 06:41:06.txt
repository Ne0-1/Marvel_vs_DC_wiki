Bosozuko's hair is made up of [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] flames as are the tires on his special motorcycle. His name [[Bōsōzoku]] translates as "violent running gang", and stems from the Japanese Bōsōzoku motorcycle gangs of the [[1950s]].<ref>As seen in ''Final Crisis Sketchbook'' #1 (May 2008)</ref>

===Cosmo Racer===

Using his roller boots Cosmo Racer can currently travel at the [[speed of sound]]. His body is made from an unknown nearly frictionless alien material similar in texture to terrestrial [[ceramic]]s or [[plastic]]s. He is apparently a hybrid of [[Astro Boy]] and the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>As seen in ''Final Crisis Sketchbook'' #1 (May 2008)</ref>

===Goraiko===
{{see also|International Ultramarine Corps#Goraiko}}
Goraiko is a psionic construct projected from the mind of an unnamed young Japanese girl who resides in a high tech [[sensory deprivation]] tank. The Goraiko construct only speaks in [[haiku]] and [[mathematical equation]]s. The girl has a [[My Neighbor Totoro|Totoro]] styled doll in the tank that appears to be the inspiration for Goraiko's shape, but it is unknown if it is necessary for the manifestation of the being. The being known as Goraiko is large and superhumanly strong, two versions of the Goraiko construct are known to exist, the 'green version' in Big Science Action and the 'gray version' in the Ultramarines. According to writer Grant Morrison "I also threw in Goraiko, the ‘Nuclear Totoro’ character I created for the Ultramarine Corps back in the JLA days and changed his colour as a little tip of the hat to gray Hulk/green Hulk". He is a member of the [[International Ultramarine Corps]].<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080721-MorrisonFC02.html</ref>
