'''Typhon''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Typhon is the giant humanoid son of the gargantuan non-humanoid monster Typhoeus and an unnamed Titaness.  In the days of ancient Greece Typhoeus unsuccessfully attempted to destroy the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] and was buried alive beneath the Sicilian volcano Mt. Etna by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].  Intent on revenge, Typhon battled Zeus and managed to imprison him.  Zeus was rescued by his son [[Hermes (Marvel Comics)|Hermes]] and defeated and exiled Typhon.

Typhon has since been imprisoned in the section of the Olympian underworld Hades which is called Tarterus, where the wicked are punished, but he still desires revenge on Zeus and on [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], who has also defeated him and killed several of Typhoeus' inhuman offspring.
