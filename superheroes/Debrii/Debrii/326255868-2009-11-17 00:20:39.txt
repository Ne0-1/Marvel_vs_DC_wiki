'''Debrii''' ('''Deborah Fields''') is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. She debuted in ''New Warriors Vol. 3'' Issue 4. She was created by artist [[Skottie Young]] with the help of writer [[Zeb Wells]]. Little is known about her at this time. She avoided being killed in the opening shots of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] by not reuniting with the team after their reality show was cancelled the first time in ''New Warriors Vol. 3'' #6.

==Fictional character biography==
Debrii was introduced by the New Warriors' TV producer, Ashley, and so was the only member of [[Night Thrasher]]'s revised team to have not been hand-picked by him. The TV company's board of directors felt that there was no "friction" in the current team - they all liked each other too much - and that the show would get better ratings if an unknown quantity was added to the team. Debrii's abrasive, antagonistic personality was perfect in this regard; she didn't get on well with any of the team members, frequently making snide comments about [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]]'s relatively-useless powers, and constantly arguing with [[Namorita]].<ref>''New Warriors'' (volume 3) #4-6</ref>

===Civil War===
Debrii was one of the former Warriors who felt the sting of the growing anti-New-Warriors movement when her secret identity was "outed" online through a New Warriors [[hate site]], after which her car was overturned and set on fire.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>

After the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] at the hands of a cloned [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Debrii was compelled to become involved and joined up with [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Deborah has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are a part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative program]]<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>. She was one of the former Warriors that was accused of [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]]'s beating.<ref>As seen within ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #6</ref>

Debrii later quit the Initiative, along with [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], [[Rage (comics)|Rage]], and [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] forming the a team called [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> She later returned to Camp Hammond with the team, now calling themselves the New Warriors again,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> and battled [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], the clone of Thor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref>

Debrii eventually quits the team, and leaves the country to go into hiding with [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] members Nonstop and Telemetry.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Debrii is described as a "high level telekinetic magnet". She is able to move masses of huge objects at will, and is capable of manipulating many such objects at one time. She can use any "debris" around her to defend herself from attacks, or to attack her enemies. During the New Warriors' battle with the [[Mad Thinker]]'s Intellectual Robots, she took control of a pile of scrap metal, crafting a shell in the form of a large monster around her body, and manipulating this creation as a weapon.

In the ''New Avengers'' series where they star on a reality television show Debrii is actually considered a low level electromagnetic telekine. Although she is able to move massive amounts of debris she cannot lift anything heavy with her powers.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}
