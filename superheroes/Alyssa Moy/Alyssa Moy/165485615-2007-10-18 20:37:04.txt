'''Alyssa Moy''' is a character in the [[Marvel comics]] universe. She is an old friend and colleague of [[Reed Richards]]. Alyssa works as a scientist, and has a genius-level intellect nearly equal to that of Reed. She first appeared in [[Fantastic Four]] Vol. 3 #5.

Allyssa would lend her hovercar to assist Reed and Ben Grimm in retrieving an essential item tossed miles away.

Allyssa and [[Franklin Richards]] faced down the extra-dimensional threat of the [[Warwolves]], who pursued them through the New York City. Their efforts to find help were hampered because it was a natural time for the sections of the city they fled through to be quiet and mostly empty. The wolves took on the shape of civilians to try and entrap them. Allyssa witnesses the wolves killing at least one police officer, a sight she tries to shield Franklin from. Allyssa and Franklin were soon saved by the Fantastic Four.

Allyssa would also help uncover the mental manipulation done to Reed. Her first clue was when he failed to perform as expected during one of their long-running mental chess games.
