'''Alyssa Moy''' is a character in the [[Marvel comics]] universe. She is a former lover and colleague of [[Reed Richards]]. Alyssa works as a scientist, and has a genius-level intellect nearly equal to that of Reed. She first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 3 #5 (May 1998).

==Fictional character biography==
Alyssa Moy has been a seldom used character since her creation and has been associated almost exclusively with the Fantastic Four. In one instance, for example, she lends her hovercar to assist Reed and Ben Grimm in retrieving an essential item a villain has tossed miles away. In another instance, Alyssa and [[Franklin Richards]] face down the extra-dimensional threat of the [[Warwolves]], who pursue them through the New York City. The wolves take on the shape of civilians to try and entrap them. Alyssa witnesses the wolves killing at least one police officer, a sight she tries to shield Franklin from. Alyssa and Franklin are soon rescued from the wolves by the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 # 7; July 1998; Chris Claremont (plot), Salvador Larroca (pencils), Art Thibert (inks), Comicraft (letters), Liquid! (colors), Mark Powers (editor), Bob Harras (editor in chief)</ref><ref>[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=4111 Uncannyxmen.net issue summary].</ref>

Moy and the others also face the other-dimensional bounty squad of [[Gatecrasher (Marvel Comics)|Gatecrasher]] and her [[Technet (comics)|Technet]]. Everyone is transported to the Otherworld, to face the entire [[Captain Britain Corps]], which is controlled by Roma. The entire incident had started because Roma believed Franklin to be a threat to the multiverse. He uses these powers to save everyone and the [[Human Torch]] convinces Roma Franklin is better off with his family. Alyssa helps uncover the mental manipulation done to Reed. Her first clue is when he fails to perform as expected during one of their long-running mental chess games. Alyssa also helps rescue the alternate-version [[Alysande Stuart]] from her extra-dimensional captors. 

Alyssa later returns to solicit Reed's help with 'Nu-World', an man-made planet designed to take refugees from what is seemingly our doomed Earth. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Relationship with Reed Richards===
At some time in the far past, [[Reed Richards]] had proposed to Moy, Moy turning him down with the claim that they had a 'duty' to spread their genius-level genes as widely as possible rather than 'confine' themselves to each other. Reed did not tell Susan this until some time after Moy had re-entered his life.

According to the current Fantastic Four writer, [[Mark Millar]], Moy will again play a role in the comic as he explores her relationship with Reed Richards much more in depth. Millar said: "It just always struck me that Reed would have had someone prior to Sue, since he's ten years older than she is. Also, Sue's so different from Reed and I felt the girl out there would be much more like he was, a female Reed Richards of sorts, and someone he'd have met at university. As luck would have it, Chris Claremont created exactly such a character and her name is Alyssa Moy. Her nickname in our story is Mrs. Fantastic and you'll see why when you read the first issue."<ref>Interview with Mark Millar in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' # 495. Brubaker, Choi, Oback.</ref>

During a recent reunion, Alyssa suggested to Reed that both of them had married the wrong people on the grounds that neither of their spouses could fully understand their work, but Reed informed Alyssa that he married Sue because he loved her.

==Alternate Versions==
The Alyssa of eight years in the future of 'Nu-World' is now a floating brain in a robotic body, helping to keep the planet from being destroyed. She is slain by her enemies.<ref>"Fantastic Four" #573 (Jan 2010)</ref>
