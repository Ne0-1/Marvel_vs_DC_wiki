'''Rodstvow''' is a [[fictional character]] that [[First appearance|first appears]] in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created as part of Marvel's [[New Universe]], he became the major recurring villain in the ''[[Psi-Force]]'' series.  His name is a mis-transcription of Russian word for ''Kinship'' (the real Russian word for ''kinship'' is ''Rodstvo/Родство'').  

== Fictional character biography ==
A Russian paranormal created by the [[White Event]], Rodstvow was a peaceful [[sculptor]] who went insane after his family died due to the surge of uncontrolled power that first manifested his abilities.

He was later recovered by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government, and spent some time comatose, before awakening.  While they studied him, Rodstvow had a habit of killing the psychiatric staff.  It was during this time that he learned of and grew obsessed with [[Psi-Force]], and particularly their gestalt manifestation [[Psi-Hawk]].  Although his government wanted to capture the teens, Rodstvow decided to destroy them and, on his own initiative, teleported to [[San Francisco, California]] in short hops over the course of two weeks, and destroyed their home.  He felt he was too drained to take the team on face-to-face, so decided to use the most expedient method to kill them.  The team survived, however, and he next confronted them in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they joined together into Psi-Hawk and battled Rodstvow over the city.  Rodstvow was victorious and took the comatose bodies of Psi-Force to the Siberian Project in the [[Yamal Peninsula]] of [[Siberia]].  

He was eventually killed by [[Justice (New Universe)|Justice]], Psi-Force, the Medusa Web and his own [[Crasniye Solleetsi]] teammates when he became too insane to control.

== Powers and abilities ==
Rodstvow was an extremely powerful paranormal, with a wide range of [[psychic]] abilities.   His powers included flight, [[Teleportation|teleportation]], spontaneous molecular combustion, heat and fire absorption, holographic projection.   He could project energy and use telekinesis.

Rodstvow's mind appeared to be immune to direct telepathic harm/control, although characters speculated that this is in part because he had no mind left.  He has displayed some limited telepathic powers.

His body was infused with a large amount of energy when he received his powers.  It was in fact too much energy, and use of his powers eats away at his physical body.  The exposed area is contained by a [[plastic]] alloy compound originally developed for the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Space Program]].  More casing had to be added as he burned off more of himself.  This plastic also gave him a certain degree of protection, even against paranormal attacks and energy bolts. 

Extensive use of his powers also required Rodstvow to rest afterwards.
