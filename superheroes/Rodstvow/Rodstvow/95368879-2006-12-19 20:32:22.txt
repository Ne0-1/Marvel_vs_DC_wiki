Rodstvow was a character from the [[New Universe]] line of [[Marvel comics]].

== Fictional character biography ==
A Russian paranormal created by the [[White Event]], Rodstvow went insane after his family died due to the surge of uncontrolled power that first manifested his abilities.

He later worked for the Soviet government, attacking [[Psi-Force]]. He was eventually killed by [[Justice (New Universe)|Justice]], Psi-Force, the Medusa Web and his own [[Crasniye Solleetsi]] teammates.

== Powers and abilities ==
Rodstvow was an extremely powerful paranormal, with a range of [[psychic]] abilities. He could fly and teleport, could project energy and use telekinesis.

His body armour also gave him a certain degree of protection, even against paranormal attacks and energy bolts. His armoured form was also superheated and appeared to have enhanced strength. Rodstvow's mind appeared to be immune to telepathic harm/control and he displayed some limited telepathic powers.
