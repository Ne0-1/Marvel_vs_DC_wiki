'''Fantomex''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Fantomex first appeared in ''[New] X-Men'' #128 (August, 2002) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]]. Fantomex was most likely based on the titular character of the [[Italian comics]] ''[[Diabolik]]'', whose film adaptation was released as ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]''. Diabolik himself was based on the character [[Fant√¥mas]], the subject of a series of early-20th century [[France|French]] detective thrillers, whose name is more directly reflected in Fantomex's own name.

==Character biography==
Fantomex is a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] thief, a result of the [[Weapon X|Weapon Plus]] Program's experimentation with technological-human hybrids (Weapon XIII). Though his real name is unknown, he said his name is Jean-Phillipe, however this may not be true. His experiment designation at The World facility was Charlie Cluster-7. Once he escaped from Weapon Plus custody, he sought a safe haven at the X-Corporation in Paris while being chased and shot at by authorities.  He asked for asylum, which [[Professor X]] granted him as he had information about the [[Channel Tunnel]] disaster.  Fantomex explained to Professor X and Jean Grey that he was being hunted because he was one of the most wanted thieves in Europe.  Neither Professor X nor Jean Grey were able to use their telepathy on Fantomex to verify his claims due to his ceramic mask, a device that blocked their mental probes.  After putting himself in a trance and removing the bullets that riddled his body, Fantomex took Professor X and Jean Grey to his "home" in France and even introduced them to his "mother."  However, all of this turned out to be a highly elaborate ruse designed by Fantomex to hide his true origin.

Fantomex then led Professor Xavier and [[Jean Grey]] to the Chunnel, full of people and animals that Weapon XII had turned into mindless slaves. He killed [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]] and other people who had already fallen prey to Weapon XII's influence. After Fantomex destroyed Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it was noticed that there were two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel:  one that had held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII.  After the battle, Fantomex's ceramic mask slipped a bit and Jean Grey used her telepathy to deduced his true identity:  Fantomex was actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the Chunnel.  It was during the accident in the Chunnel that he had escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building.  He confessed to Jean Grey that he was not the master thief that he had claimed, but was now set out to earn that reputation.  He assured Jean Grey that he refused to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allowed Fantomex to disappear into the Chunnel before the authorities arrived.

He has since appeared in the ''[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'' miniseries.

In addition, Fantomex has appeared in issues of Frank Tieri's "Weapon X" title.  During this series, it was revealed that Fantomex considers John Sublime (actually a super-intelligent bacteria capable of taking control of its human hosts) to be his most hated foe.  Although Fantomex tried to kill Sublime numerous times, this resistant bacteria always seemed to resurface, alive and well in another human host.  During this series, Fantomex also explained that he was not in fact French (further adding to his mysterious origin), but rather spoke with a French accent because he found it annoyed and distracted others.

In an alternate future ruled by a Sublime-controlled Beast, Fantomex reappears as Beast's top assassin, Apollyon.  In this future, E.V.A. separated from Fantomex/Apollyon, and took the shape of a metalic woman.  She joined the remaining X-Men, including Wolverine and Cassandra Nova.  This future was destroyed, however, upon the re-emergence of Jean Grey as the Phoenix.  She sacrificed herself by allowing her cosmic life blood to change the past, therefore rendering this distopic future null and void.

==Powers and abilities==
He is incapable of feeling pain most of the time. His nervous system has separated from his body and has transformed into a techno-organic flying saucer-like vessel called E.V.A. The relationship between E.V.A and Fantomex is symbiotic, so if E.V.A experiences pain when she is not within Fantomex, he will feel it as well. E.V.A can fly "herself" and can generate electrical charges to be used as weapons.

Fantomex's other powers include the ability to regenerate through the absorption of water and expulsion of foreign solid objects in his body (i.e. bullets) by melting them with heat. Another of his powers is psionic misdirection, which prevents anyone from telling that he is lying. This also allows him to create telepathic illusions that can fool some of the most powerful telepaths such as Professor Xavier and Jean Grey. Fantomex can also enter a trance state and perform crucial tasks such as performing surgery on himself. His mask incorporates telepathy-blocking ceramics.
