'''Solomon O'Sullivan''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''X-Force #129''.

After the death of [[U-Go Girl]], Solomon O'Sullivan arrived at the home of Edie's parents and tried to charm them. He later met with [[X-Statix|X-Force]] at the recruitment drive and attempted to gain them as his clients by revealing his mutant powers.

After Venus Dee Milo, one of his clients, appeared on TV with X-Statix, Solomon sent lawyer [[Sharon Ginsberg]] to give X-Statix a cease-and-desist order that [[Venus Dee Milo]] could not join X-Statix because she was under contract. He then sent his [[O-Force]] against the reality-altering mutant [[Fan Boy|Arnie Lundberg]], only to see them beaten and nearly killed. His team was saved by X-Statix as he was kidnapped and forced in allying himself with Sharon Ginsberg who was revealed to be a mutant as well. 

Solomon O'Sullivan watched with Sharon Ginsberg as the X-Statix team bashed the [[Mister Sensitive|Orphan]] on television. Later at Sharon's home, Solomon worried over the words being printed on his body. He proceeded to get drunk and noticed that while he is drunk the words seem to spell out "Bad Guy is not Guy Smith." Later, after a battle with Bad Guy, Solomon brought a bleeding Sharon Ginsberg to X-Statix Headquarters, where he hoped they could save her.

In a hospital, Solomon spoke to Sharon about her wings and how [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]] saved her life. He added that she needed to stay in the hospital until she could work through her pain, lest her powers manifest themselves in other ways. Sharon blamed X-Statix for all of her problems and grew claws, breaking through her restraints. She then plunged her claws into Solomon's chest, killing him.
