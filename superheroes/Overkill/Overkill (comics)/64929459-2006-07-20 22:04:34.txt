'''Overkill''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''X-Statix #1''.

Overkill was a tryout from the [[O-Force]] [[television show]]. He won a place on the team and joined them in their missions. He didn't seem to care very much of his teammates, given the fact that he left [[Ocean (Marvel Comics)|Ocean]] to die during their mission against [[Fan Boy|Arnie Lundberg]]. 

==Powers==
He can project a form of energy from his hands. I notice that he has a diamond gem on his forehead, reminiscent of the Vision, so maybe it's stored solar energy.
