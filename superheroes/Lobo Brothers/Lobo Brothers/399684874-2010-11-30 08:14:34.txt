==Fictional characters biography==
Carlos and Eduardo Lobo grew up in poverty on the streets of [[Puebla de Zaragoza]], [[Mexico]], surviving by stealing and scavenging for food. As a teenager, Eduardo had fallen in love with a girl name Esmelda Valdez, the daughter of a wealthy ranch owner. The two had a romantic relationship until it was discovered by Esmelda's brother Ramon Valdez. One full moon night, Ramone and his men ambushed the two lovers and tried to drive Eduardo away by using whips on him. Pain and rage from this whipping triggered a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] change in Eduardo's body. He turned into a black-furred [[werewolf]] and slaughtered Ramone and his men. But when he woke up in his human form the next morning, he discovered he had murdered Esmelda as well. Carlos also discovered he was a mutant that can turn into a brown-furred werewolf. The brothers then turned to crime using their powers to unite all the mobs of South Texas into Los Hermanos De La Luna. The Lobos were so successful that they not only gained a mansion in a Dallas suburb but drew the attention of the [[Arranger (comics)|Arranger]], the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s lieutenant. The Arranger used the [[Persuader (Marvel Comics)|Persuader]] to brainwash the [[Punisher]] into attempting an assassination of the Lobo Brothers. The plan failed thanks to [[Spider-Man]]'s interference and the iron will of the Punisher, who ended up killing the Persuader instead. The Lobo Brothers knew who was responsible for the attempt and they vowed revenge.

The Lobo Brothers moved to New York and began to slaughter the Kingpin's men and they leave messages in blood at the murder scenes which say things like "Kingpin: Wolves Bite Back" and "Kingpin: Wolves Kill."

Soon after arriving in New York and in the Daily Bugle, Eduardo bumped into [[Glory Grant]], secretary of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and plans to seduce her into getting the newspaper files of the Kingpin which he secretly steals.

As the Gang War accelerates, Glory discovers that Eduardo is a werewolf. The Lobo Brothers arranged a meeting with the Kingpin until [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] crash the meeting as well as the appearance of Spider-Man. During the battle, Glory gets her hands on the Arranger's gun loaded with silver bullets. As Spider-Man and Eduardo clash, Gloria kills Eduardo claiming she was aiming at Spider-Man and missed. Carlos Lobo was knocked unconscious and was presumably arrested and imprisoned, where he remains.

The current whereabouts of Carlos Lobo are unknown, but it is assumed that he is plotting his revenge on Spider-Man since he believes that he is the true cause of his brother's death. It is also unknown if he was one of [[Decimation (comics)|the few mutants who retained their powers]] after the [[House of M]] fiasco.

==Powers and abilities==
As mutants who shared the same powers, the Lobo brothers possessed the ability to transform themselves into humanoid wolves. They possessed razor-sharp claws and fangs, as well as superhuman speed, strength and agility, enough to battle Spider-Man in hand-to-hand combat. Even in their human forms, they possessed exceptional strength and agility, as Eduardo once protected Gloria from a [[forklift]] that had been possessed by one of the demons released during  the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] storyline and turned into a monster, destroying it with one blow.
