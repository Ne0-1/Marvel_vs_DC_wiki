The '''Lobo Brothers''', '''Carlos''' and '''Eduardo Lobo''', are two [[Marvel Comics]] [[werewolf|werewolves]].

==History==
Carlos and Eduardo Lobo grew up on the streets of Puebla De Zaragoza, [[Mexico]] and they have been surviving by stealing and scavenging for food. As a teenager, Eduardo had fallen in love with a girl name Esmelda Valdez, the daughter of a wealthy ranch owner. The two had a romantic relationship until it was discovered by Esmelda's brother Ramon Valdez. One full moon night, Ramone and his men ambushed the two lovers and tried to drive Eduardo away by using whips on him. Pain and rage from this whipping triggered a [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] change in Eduardo's body. He turned into a black-furred werewolf and slaughtered Ramone and his men. But when he woke up in his human form the next morning, he discovered he had murdered Esmelda as well. Carlos also discovered he was a mutant werewolf and the brothers turned to crime, using their powers to unite all the mobs of South Texas into Los Hermanos De La Luna. The Lobos were so successful that they not only gained a mansion in a Dallas suburb but drew the attention of the [[Arranger (comics)|Arranger]], the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s lieutenant. The Arranger used the [[Persuader (Marvel Comics)|Persuader]] to brainwash the [[Punisher]] into attempting an assassination of the Lobo Brothers. The plan failed thanks to [[Spider-Man]]'s interference and the iron will of the Punisher, who ended up killing the Persuader instead. The Lobo Brothers knew who was responsible for the attempt and they vowed revenge.

The Lobo Brothers moved to New York and began to slaughter the Kingpin's men and they leave messages in blood at the murder scenes which say things like "Kingpin: Wolves Bite Back" and "Kingpin-Wolves Kill".

Soon after arriving in New York and in the Daily Bugle, Eduardo bumped into Gloria Grant, secretary of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and plans to seduce her into getting the newspaper files of the Kingpin which he secretly steals.

As the Gang War accelerates, Gloria discovers that Eduardo is a werewolf. The Lobo Brothers arranged a meeting with the Kingpin until [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] crash the meeting as well as the appearance of Spider-Man. During the battle, Gloria gets her hands on the Arranger's gun loaded with silver bullets. As Spider-Man and Eduardo clash, Gloria kills Eduardo claiming she was aiming at Spider-Man and missed. Carlos Lobo was knocked unconscious and was presumably arrested and imprisoned.
