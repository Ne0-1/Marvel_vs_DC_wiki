'''''Professor Carter Nichols''''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] character introduced in 1944 in [[Batman]] stories.

==Fictional character biography==
His appearances nearly always involved some form of [[time travel]] technology, or at least hypnosis-based experiences that simulated time travel; the stories themselves are less than clear on this respect.

Professor Nichols was a useful character to lend some ''sci-fi'' "color" to ''Batman'' stories in the late 1940s and 1950s, when more conventional [[superhero]] tales were out of favor and most remaining books of the genre drifted into sci-fi and related genres.

In the mid-1970s the character was reintroduced in the comicbook ''[[Superfriends]]'' continuity as a mentor for the [[Wonder Twins]], who lived with him in their civil identities of John and Joanna Flemming.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Professor Nichols appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Last Bat On Earth" voiced by [[Richard McGonagle]]. The villain [[Gorilla Grodd]] forces him to transport him to [[Kamandi]]'s time using a time ray, and later uses it to transport Batman there, in order to stop him.
