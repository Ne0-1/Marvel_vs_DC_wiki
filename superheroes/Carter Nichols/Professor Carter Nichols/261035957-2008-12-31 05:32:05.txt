'''''Professor Carter Nichols''''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] character introduced in 1944 in [[Batman]] stories.  His appearances nearly always involved some form of [[time travel]] technology, or at least hypnosis-based experiences that simulated time travel; the stories themselves are less than clear on this respect.

Professor Nichols was an useful character to lend some ''sci-fi'' "color" to ''Batman'' stories in the late 1940s and 1950s, when more conventional [[superhero]] tales where out of favor and most remaining books of the genre drifted into sci-fi and related genres.

In the mid-1970s the character was reintroduced in the comicbook ''[[Superfriends]]'' continuity as a mentor for the [[Wonder Twins]], who lived with him in their civil identities of John and Joanna Flemming.
