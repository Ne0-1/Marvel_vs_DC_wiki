'''Morgan Edge''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], leader of the mob known as [[Intergang]] and one of [[Superman]]'s enemies. He was created by [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'' #133 (October 1970).

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
In his original incarnation, Edge was the president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System, (owners of television station WGBS), the media corporation which eventually bought the [[Daily Planet]]. Edge was in many ways a [[stereotype]] of a ruthless [[capitalism|capitalist]], intervening in the Planet's homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older [[Perry White]], but he was a decent man who had moments of good-heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees, including [[Clark Kent]]. Following the takeover of the Planet, Edge promoted Kent to news anchorman on WGBS, a move which added several TV co-workers to the Superman supporting cast, including fretful producer Josh Coyle, sports broadcaster [[Steve Lombard]] <ref name="superman264">{{Cite comic | writer = Cary Bates | penciller = Curt Swan | inker = Murphy Anderson | story = Secret of the Phantom Quarterback! | title = '''Superman''' | volume = 1 | issue = 264 | date = '''June 1973''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref>, weather forecaster Oscar Asherman, and co-anchor [[Lana Lang]] (who had been one of Clark's childhood friends in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]]).

As one of the wealthiest men in [[Metropolis]], Edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered [[Superman]], the subject of many of his network's news stories, whom he, like most others, failed to realize was also Clark Kent. Although rarely integral to a plotline, Edge was a supporting character in many Superman stories.

For a while it appeared that Edge was connected to the [[Apokolips]]-sponsored crime organisation [[Intergang]], but this was revealed to be clone created by the 'Evil Factory', a genetics laboratory working for Darkseid. For example, this clone attempted to have [[Jimmy Olsen]], the [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] and, incidentally, a random Daily Planet employee named 'Goody', murdered as part of a cover-up. <ref>''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #139 (August 1971)</ref>

In a back-up story in Action Comics #468 (February 1977), it was revealed that Morgan Edge's birth name was Morris Edelstein. After he won his first TV station in a game of poker, he changed his name to Morgan Edge and kept the details of his past closely guarded.

===Post-Crisis===
When DC [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was rebooted after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Edge remained president of WGBS, but his ties to the Planet and friendship with Superman were [[retcon]]ned away, and he was genuinely connected to Intergang. He was eventually exposed by the Daily Planet, in articles by Clark Kent and [[Cat Grant]], who was working for WGBS undercover. Edge was imprisoned, but subsequently returned as sponsor of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]].

Recently, Morgan Edge has resurfaced as a powerful media pundit, with the show "Edge of Reason", where he gives off anti-Kryptonian spin for [[Sam Lane|General Lane]].  He is also seen in a "flash-forward" panel in Adventure Comics #1, making a mysterious deal with [[Despero]].

Edge appears in Superman #1 (2011) as a powerful media mogul and the new owner of the Daily Planet.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', a character similar to Morgan Edge, named '''Bill Church, Jr.''' (portrayed by [[Bruce Campbell]]), appeared as the head of the "Intergang" crime organization. His father '''Bill Church, Sr.''' was played by [[Peter Boyle]]. Like Morgan Edge, Bill Church, Jr. owned a TV station, which was called "Multiworld Communications" instead of the comics' "Galaxy Communications".

* Morgan Edge has appeared in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Secret Society" Pt. 1 voiced by an uncredited [[Brian George]]. [[Gorilla Grodd]] and his [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] broke into his mansion to free [[Clayface]] from his prison. He attempted to flee on a boat while disguised as a chef, but [[Killer Frost]] froze the water and Morgan's alligator shoes gave away his identity to the Secret Society. Gorilla Grodd had him lead them to where Clayface was stored. As the other Secret Society members enter the room, Killer Frost (off screen) entraps Morgan Edge in ice, presumably freezing him to death. 

* Morgan Edge is a recurring villain in ''[[Smallville]]''. He has appeared as a Metropolis crime lord, and old friend of [[Lionel Luthor]], initially played by [[Rutger Hauer]], and later by [[Patrick Bergin]]. In the episode "Exile", [[Clark Kent]] stole the money from a bank while one of Edge's gangs were in the middle of a heist. Edge approached Clark in his apartment and offered him a job. At first Clark turned him down, but after Lana found him, he decided he could use the money to disappear and meets Edge to accept his offer. Edge asked him to break into Lionel's LuthorCorp office and steal a package from a titanium reinforced safe. Clark later learned that the item he stole was the blood sample taken by Helen Bryce. [[Jonathan Kent (fictional character)|Jonathan Kent]] destroyed it immediately. Edge came to Smallville and demanded the package. Clark told him that he didn't have it, but Edge took Jonathan and [[Martha Kent]] hostage to force Clark to give it to him. Clark used a piece of green meteor rock to cut his arm and give him a new sample. Edge returned the blood to Lionel and told him that he could provide him with the source. Lionel was very interested because he did not know the source. Edge's thugs brought Clark to Metropolis in the back of a truck for the hand off, but Clark used his heat vision to create an explosion, which destroyed the truck. Lionel believed that Edge set him up to be killed. Edge fell into the water after being shot by Lionel's security, where he was presumed dead. Morgan survived, however, and was found by [[Lex Luthor]]. This time, Edge had received plastic surgery in order to hide from Lionel. Edge ultimately confesses, on tape, to the murder of Lionel's parents, but ultimately conspires with Lionel to break Lex's fragile psyche and discredit his testimony. Lex eventually tracks down Edge, also shooting him, but he manages to escape. In one last attempt, Edge attempts to kill Lex using his car, but is shot several times and killed before he has a chance to do so.

===Film===
* In ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'', a similar media mogul takes over the [[Daily Planet]]. His name in this film is '''David Warfield''' and he is played by [[Sam Wanamaker]].

* A man with traits similar to Morgan Edge appeared in ''[[Superman Returns]]''. His name is '''Grant''' and he is a henchman of [[Lex Luthor]]. He (along with three other henchmen) were killed when [[Superman]] regained his conscioussness and flew the land mass into space.
