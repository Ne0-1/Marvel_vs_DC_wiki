'''Morgan Edge''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], leader of the mob known as [[Intergang]] and one of [[Superman]]'s enemies. He was created by [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'' #133 (October 1970).

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
In his original incarnation, Edge was the president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System, (owners of television station WGBS), the media corporation which eventually bought the [[Daily Planet]]. Edge was in many ways a [[stereotype]] of a ruthless [[capitalist]], intervening in the Planet's homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older [[Perry White]], but he was a decent man who had moments of good-heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees, including [[Clark Kent]]. Following the takeover of the Planet, Edge promoted Kent to news anchorman on WGBS, a move which added several TV co-workers to the Superman supporting cast, including fretful producer Josh Coyle, sports broadcaster Steve Lombard, weather forecaster Oscar Asherman, and co-anchor [[Lana Lang]] (who had been one of Clark's childhood friends in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]]).

As one of the wealthiest men in [[Metropolis]], Edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered [[Superman]], the subject of many of his network's news stories, whom he, like most others, failed to realize was also Clark Kent. Although rarely integral to a plotline, Edge was a supporting character in many Superman stories.

For a while it appeared that Edge was connected to the [[Apokolips]]-sponsored crime organisation [[Intergang]], but this was revealed to be clone created by the Evil Factory.

===Post-Crisis===
When DC [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was rebooted after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Edge remained president of WGBS, but his ties to the Planet and friendship with Superman were [[retcon]]ned away, and he was genuinely connected to Intergang. He was eventually exposed and imprisoned, but subsequently returned as sponsor of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]].

==In other media==
*Morgan Edge has appeared as a Metropolis crime lord, and old friend of [[Lionel Luthor]], in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', initially played by [[Rutger Hauer]], and later by [[Patrick Bergin]].  In a deleted scene, he mentions his affiliation with [[Intergang]].
*Morgan Edge has appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' when the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] broke into his mansion to free [[Clayface]] from his prison. [[Killer Frost]] entraps him in ice, presumably frozen to death.
*Although Edge himself does not appear, the storyline of a media tycoon buying the ''Daily Planet'' was adapted as a subplot of the 1987 film ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]''.
