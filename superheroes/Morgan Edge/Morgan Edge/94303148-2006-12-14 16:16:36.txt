'''Morgan Edge''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], leader of the mob known as [[Intergang]] and one of [[Superman]]'s enemies. He was created by [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'' #133 (October 1970).

In his original incarnation, Edge was the president of Galaxy Communications (a.k.a. Galaxy Broadcasting System, or W-GBS), the media corporation which eventually bought out the [[Daily Planet]]. In this capacity, Edge was in many ways a typical [[stereotype]] of a ruthless [[capitalist]], intervening in the Planet's homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older [[Perry White]], but he was a basically decent man who had moments of good-heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees, including [[Clark Kent]]. Following the buyout, Edge promoted Kent to news anchorman on W-GBS, a move which added several TV co-workers to the Superman supporting cast, including fretful producer [[Josh Coyle]], sports broadcaster [[Steve Lombard]], weather forecaster [[Oscar Asherman]], and co-anchor [[Lana Lang]] (who had been one of Clark's childhood friends in [[Smallville]]).

As one of the wealthiest men in [[Metropolis]], Edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered [[Superman]], the subject of many of his network's news stories, whom he, like most others, failed to realize was also Clark Kent. Although rarely integral to a plotline, Edge was a supporting character in many Superman stories.

When DC [[continuity]] was rebooted after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Edge remained president of W-GBS, but his ties to the Planet and friendship with Superman were [[retcon]]ned away, and he was eventually revealed as an underworld leader.

== Other Media ==

Morgan Edge has appeared as a Metropolis gang boss, and old friend of [[Lionel Luthor]], in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', initially played by [[Rutger Hauer]], and later by [[Patrick Bergin]].

Edge has appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' when the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] broke into his mansion to free [[Clayface]] from his prison. [[Killer Frost]] entraps him in ice, presumably frozen to death.
