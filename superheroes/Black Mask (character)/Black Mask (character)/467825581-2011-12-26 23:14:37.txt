==Fictional character biography==
===Dark beginning===
Black Mask's [[origin story]] was established in his first appearance. '''Roman Sionis''' was born to wealthy and utterly self-absorbed parents who cared more about their social status than their son; moments after his birth, the doctor carelessly dropped him on his head. Roman's parents were less concerned about their son's well-being than in covering up the entire incident so their high society friends wouldn't find out. As a child, he was attacked by a [[rabies|rabid]] [[raccoon]] at the Sionis family country estate; his parents forbade him to mention the incident to anyone.

Further adding to the cauldron was his father's "friendship" with [[Thomas Wayne]]; both of Roman's parents disliked Wayne and his wife [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], and were quite vocal about it in private, but they continued to associate with them to ensure their social status, to the extent of literally forcing Roman to become friends with their son, Bruce. His parents' hypocrisy had a deep impact on him, and he grew to hate and resent them and the "masks" they wore in public. 

After graduating from high school, Sionis was given a high ranking position inside his father's company, Janus Cosmetics. There, he met and fell in love with Circe, a [[working class]] secretary. His parents did not approve of the relationship and made it clear that they wanted him to break it off. Enraged, Sionis burned down the family's mansion, killing both of his parents. Upon their deaths, he inherited the family fortune and business. Sionis lacked his father's business acumen, however, and eventually ruined Janus Cosmetics by funding a failed line of face-paint make-up. In desperation, he threw large sums of money at the staff chemists to create a product to save the company, and what came back to him was a kind of water-proof makeup. The product was rushed to market without proper testing, and once it hit the market, it turned out to be a deadly [[toxin]] which disfigured several hundred women. 

Circe, now Sionis' fianc√©e, broke up with him in front of his entire staff. Bruce Wayne, now the head of Wayne Enterprises, offered to bail out the company on the condition that Sionis give up control and allow Wayne to appoint his own Board of Directors. Sionis agreed, but was furious at the humiliation he had suffered. He went to the family [[mausoleum]] and broke his father's [[ebony]] coffin lid, from which he carved a mask; he thus became the crime lord "Black Mask".

He later kidnapped Circe, and disfigured her along with anybody else who refused to join his gang using the same toxin. Circe then lost her mind and commited [[suicide]]. Black Mask then started using a [[mannequin]] based after her and talked to it in her place, as if the mannequin was actually her.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Cult leader===
In "The Cult" storyline, Black Mask reappears as a crime boss, having given up his vendetta against Bruce Wayne. Forging alliances with [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] at some times, working alone at others, he controls much of [[Gotham City]]'s underworld until the city is destroyed by an [[earthquake]] in the "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" story arc. 

Sionis discards the ebony mask, believing his [[scar]]s to be a sign of his strength and determination to survive. By now completely [[insanity|insane]], he leads a [[cult]] whose trademark is ritual scarring, killing anyone who refuses to join, destroying any buildings left standing under the quake by claiming that they are remnants of the 'lie' of civilisation that was exposed as false by the quake. He leads a powerful group until Batman and [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] dissolve it by defeating him in battle. Sionis is imprisoned in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], but he escapes before the city is made a part of the country again.

===Relentless===
In ''Catwoman'' #16, Black Mask begins a [[illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] ring and decides to move his organization into Gotham's East End, drawing the attention of [[Catwoman]], who had sworn to protect that area of the city.

Catwoman interferes in Black Mask's plans, stealing money from him and giving it to the poor, and injuring many of his men. Black Mask decides he wants to remove the problem, and so finds an old friend of Selina Kyle's, Sylvia Sinclair, who is working in the Gotham mobs. She reveals Catwoman's [[secret identity]] to him, and he begins a campaign of terror against her. He blows up the new [[youth club|youth center]] she had endowed with the stolen money, hounds her, and kidnaps her sister and brother-in-law. Black Mask tortures Catwoman's brother-in-law to death in front of her sister, and then makes the woman eat pieces of her husband's corpse.

Catwoman arrives to find her brother-in-law dead, her sister insane, and her friend [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] on the verge of being tortured. She attacks Black Mask, and the two of them fight across his penthouse. At the end of the battle, Black Mask falls from the top of the building, leaving everyone to assume he is dead.

===''War Games'' & ''War Crimes''===
When [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] quits his role as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in the ''[[Batman: War Games|War Games]]'' arc, Batman chooses Stephanie Brown, aka [[Spoiler (comics character)|The Spoiler]], to replace him.  Batman quickly discovers that her lack of focus and inability to follow orders make her a danger to herself and others, and fires her. Desperate to prove herself, she takes charge of one of Batman's contingency plans: To get all of Gotham's crime lords under the control of [[Orpheus (comics)|Orpheus]], an agent of Batman, and therefore under the control of Batman himself. The plan fails because Spoiler is unaware that a key contact with the crime lords, [[Matches Malone]], is actually none other than Batman himself. When "Matches Malone" does not appear as expected, the tension at the meeting accidentally degenerates into a firefight, leaving many dead and wounded. This creates a [[power vacuum]] that quickly erupts into a brutal gang war on the streets of Gotham.

In ''War Games Act Two'', Spoiler seeks out Orpheus, believing that if she could enlist his help there could still be a chance to bring the plan to some sort of successful conclusion. As she finishes telling Orpheus his role in the plan, Black Mask murders him by slitting his throat in front of Spoiler. He then tortures Spoiler to obtain information about the rest of the plan.

Black Mask assumes Orpheus' identity, using face putty and padding, fooling even Batman and [[Onyx (comics)|Onyx]]. As Orpheus, he fans the flames of the crisis, driving Gotham's criminal element into a frenzy, seeking to kill any member or associate of the [[Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]]. He then returns to torture Spoiler for his own enjoyment, only to find that she has escaped.  Black Mask soon tracks her down again and they fight.  Spoiler defeats Black Mask and gets away, but is left with severe internal injuries.

Black Mask then infiltrates [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s Clocktower in an attempt to expose her to the mob. Batman attacks him in a blind rage and Oracle, fearful for Batman's life, is forced to activate a self-destruct device in the tower to get Batman to save her.

In the end, Spoiler supposedly dies due to the injuries inflicted on her and the willful negligence of [[Leslie Thompkins]] (although a recent [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] establishes that Leslie had faked Stephanie's death). 

Black Mask then becomes the overlord of the Gotham underworld, recruiting [[Mr. Freeze]] as an enforcer and even gathering enough financial resources to purchase an [[Amazo]] [[Android (robot)|android]] and a large supply of [[kryptonite]], although the Amazo is destroyed by Batman and [[Nightwing]] when it is activated prematurely and the kryptonite is stolen by the [[Jason Todd#Red Hood|Red Hood]].

Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask begins a campaign to discredit Batman. While Rodriguez slams Batman in the press, Black Mask commits a series of murders disguised as Batman. This plan is complicated by the arrival of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]; Black Mask is intent on killing the Clown Prince of Crime and framing Batman for it, but the Joker wants to kill Black Mask, because he robbed him of the opportunity to kill another Robin. The two nearly kill each other before Batman intervenes. Batman eventually exposes Rodriguez and finally captures Black Mask. However, while being taken to jail, Black Mask kills the escorting officer and escapes again.

===Death===
The assassin [[Deathstroke]] later approaches Black Mask, offering him a place within [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Society]]. Eager to strengthen his increasingly tenuous grip on the underworld (Batman and the new [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]] had both been targeting his operations), he accepts, and [[Captain Nazi]], [[Hyena (comics)|one of the Hyenas]], and [[Count Vertigo]] are sent after Batman and Red Hood. However, Batman defeats them all, and ultimately prevents the Society from securing a foothold in Gotham.

In an attempt to "improve himself" after this debacle, Black Mask threatens the most important people in Catwoman's life, from [[Slam Bradley]] to [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]]. Enraged, Catwoman retaliates by blowing off his jaw with her gun, killing him.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After the shooting, Selina Kyle passes the mantle of Catwoman to her friend Holly. Not long after, Holly is arrested for Black Mask's murder.

===Blackest Night===
In ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Black Mask comes back from the dead as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] to show Catwoman why "shooting him in the head, was a bad idea". In October 2009, DC announced they were taking a month off from primary ''Blackest Night'' comics by "reanimating dead runs" and tying them into the event. The campaign involved releasing the next numeric issue of a comic run that had long been cancelled by DC and associating it with the ''Blackest Night'' (i.e. bringing the 'dead' back to life, so to speak). As a result, ''Catwoman'' #83 was released on January 13, 2010, 'reanimating' the cancelled series for one issue involving Selina Kyle being confronted by Black Lantern Black Mask. In an attempt to scare Catwoman, the Black Lantern Black Mask goes after her sister Maggie, who had been institutionalized after he killed her husband and forced her to eat his eyeballs. He demonstrates the ability to fly and reorganize the very structure of buildings. Maggie Kyle, previously near catatonic, is shocked back to motion and speech after seeing her sister placed in the same situation her husband did not escape. Both escape physically unharmed but the incident causes Maggie to believe her sister has been taken over by a demon. [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] manages to stop Black Mask by trapping him inside a mutated [[Pitcher plant]], its digestive juices dissolving his body as fast as his ring could regenerate it. The plant itself is transferred to Slaughter Swamp, which is nearby.<ref>''Catwoman'' #83 (January 2010)</ref>

===Black Mask's legacy===
{{main|Jeremiah Arkham}}
[[Image:JArkhamasBlackMask.jpg|120px|right|thumb|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham, as the new Black Mask, orders his predecessor's men to destroy his asylum in ''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1. Art by Tony Daniels.]]
In the ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]'' storyline, a second crime lord, Black Mask II, emerges.  He has drugged [[Arkham Asylum]]'s inmates, including The [[Great White Shark (comics)|Great White Shark]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Mr. Zsasz]], [[Jane Doe (comics)|Jane Doe]], and [[Scarecrow (comics)|the Scarecrow]], with a substance that can kill when triggered. Black Mask is quickly acknowledged as the leader of the group when he blows up the asylum, and then prepares for his ascension by destroying [[Two-Face]]'s and [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin's]] reign and becoming Gotham City's crime lord once again. In a recent ''Batgirl'' storyline, he had Scarecrow develop a new recreational drug, "Thrill."   In a change from previous appearances of the character, "Battle For The Cowl" issue #3 displays a character implied to be Black Mask referring to himself as "we".  

The new Black Mask absorbs Penguin's mob and kicks [[Two-Face]] out of Gotham, becoming the city's sole crime lord. He is shown to be behind the separate actions of several Gotham criminals like [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], [[Victor Zsasz]], Jane Doe, [[Clayface]], Alyce Sinner, [[Fright (comics)|Fright]], [[Doctor Death (comics)|Dr. Death]] and [[Hugo Strange]], providing funding in exchange for favors.<ref>Batman 688-691</ref> However, in "Life after Death", he is targeted by both the National Guard and the returning [[Carmine Falcone|Falcone crime family]], led by Mario Falcone, forcing him to retreat to an area in Gotham called Devil's Square.<ref>Batman 691-697</ref>

Black Mask's identity has been revealed to be Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]].<ref>''Batman'' #697 (March 2010)</ref> He and Fright have become lovers. Following his capture and defeat by the new Batman, [[Dick Grayson]], he is imprisoned in the rebuilt Arkham Asylum. He also starred in the three-issue follow up, ''[[Arkham Reborn]]'', where he begins manipulating patients, a plotline that culminated in ''[[Detective Comics]],'' with the revelation of his role as Black Mask and his incarceration in his own asylum. However the new head of Arkham, Dr. Alyce Sinner, who had secretly been manipulating events in ''Arkham Reborn,'' continues her work for the [[Intergang|Church of Crime]] and allies with him.

==Powers and abilities==
Black Mask has no super-human abilities. However, he is a master criminal strategist with a vast amount of resources. He was the crime lord of Gotham city for many years as an undercover businessman. 

Black Mask is skilled in the use of handguns. He usually carries at least two automatic pistols.
He is a capable hand to hand fighter, able to hold his ground against  even accomplished martial artists such as Batman and Catwoman. He can take high amounts of damage, while continuing to fight.

Black Mask's most important weapons are fear and intimidation. He is known for his brutal and sadistic torture techniques, especially on the face. Black Mask also uses his connections to gather information on his enemies, and then hits them at their weak points, such as family and friends.

==Other versions==
===Crimson Mist===
Black Mask makes a brief appearance in the [[Elseworlds]] storyline ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', attempting to stave off a rampage by the maddened vampire Batman. During the ensuing bloodbath, he initially rejects joining an alliance with [[Two-Face]] and [[Killer Croc]], mistakenly believing himself to be untouchable. This is a decision Sionis comes to severely regret when Batman assaults his hideout and butchers the entire False Face Society, leaving their decapitated heads outside [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] as a warning to other criminals housed there.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:BlackMask.JPG|right|thumb|Black Mask, as he appears in ''The Batman''.]]
* Black Mask appears as a recurring villain in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[James Remar]]. This version of Black Mask is a powerful crime boss with a right-hand man named Number One (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) and a vast organization of henchmen with high-tech weapons. What makes this Black Mask different from his comic appearances is the fact that, while he wears a mask made of some black material over his face, it is unremovable. He has no noticeable fingerprints or any other distinguishing features either, so it is impossible to identify him. In the episode "The Breakout", he steals a powerful shock-wave generator, and holds Gotham City hostage. To convince the city - and specifically, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]], who is dealing with his demands - he is not bluffing, he arranges a demonstration of the powerful device, which ends up destroying several blocks from its activating point. While dealing with Gordon, he battles Batman, who defeats him and takes him to [[Gotham City Police Department]] headquarters so Gordon can question him. However, Number One and the henchmen try to break Black Mask out of jail, first by filling Gotham PD with knockout gas, from which Black Mask escapes unaffected thanks to his mask. [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] knock Black Mask unconscious, lock him in a cell and seal the precinct from Black Mask's army's siege. Number One and the henchmen surround the police building, and eventually break Black Mask free. However, the furious crime boss shocks Number One with his own shock gun, names a random soldier as his new Number One, and gets on a helicopter, ready to activate the generator and destroy Gotham. However, Robin and Batgirl battle him, while Batman deactivates the device. At the end, he is once again arrested. In "Rumors," Black Mask later reappears as one of the many villains captured by the [[vigilante]] Rumor. At the end, he is freed only to be brought to justice. In "The Batman/Superman Story, Part One", Black Mask works with [[Lex Luthor]]. He, [[Clayface]] (Basil Karlo), and his henchmen kidnap [[Lois Lane]], and assembles [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Mr. Freeze]] to lure [[Superman]] into a trap and kill him. He is foiled by the Man of Steel, along with Batman and Robin as Lois Lane trips him. In "What Goes Up...", Black Mask employs [[Shadow Thief]] in order to break out of [[Arkham Asylum]] (where the doctors there are trying to remove his mask) and steal a rare [[Nth metal|Nth]] element meteor in order to use the Nth element to easily rob a gem depository. He also employs a new Number One (voiced by [[John Mariano]]) whom he later exposes to Nth powder which caused him to fly upward after he questioned how Black Mask would use the Nth Metal in his caper. Black Mask then replaces him with an eyepatch-wearing woman. Batman and Robin foil his plan, with the help of [[Hawkman]].

* Black Mask appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Plague of the Prototypes!", voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. This version's mouth can move its lips, but his teeth remain shut when he talks. His right-hand henchman is Tattoo, and he commands the False-Face Society. He and the society rob a bank when Batman leaves Gotham, only to be foiled by the Caped Crusader's army of Bat-Robots. In his second attempt, Black Mask has Tattoo reprogram the Bat-Robots to do his bidding, and uses them to nearly defeat Batman, who is later rescued by [[Ace the Bat-Hound]] and the Prototype Bat-Robot (Proto). Black Mask later has the robots steal powerful explosives for him, and orders them to take out the rest of the False-Face Society except for Tattoo. Black Mask plans to use the robots to set-off explosives and destroy half the city, intimidating the survivors. However, Proto tracks down his lair, and Batman captures the villain while he, Proto, and Ace take down the five robots. When a sixth robot is unleashed, Black Mask escapes and tries to detonate it, but Proto flies off and redirects it away from the city. Batman finds Black Mask and defeats him.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/advance-guides |title=Schedule for Channel 9, Oct. 31st, 2010 |publisher=Tvtonight.com.au |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> In "Shadow of the Bat!", Black Mask and the False-Face Society are seen robbing a bank until they are attacked by a vampire Batman who bites him. It is not shown if he recovered from this condition, although the ending suggests that the episode was a dream.

===Film===
* Black Mask appears in the animated movie, ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'', voiced by [[Wade Williams]].<ref name="TWF2">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=704 |title=The World's Finest - New Cast Details For Upcoming ‚ÄúBatman: Under The Red Hood‚Äù Animated Feature |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> Here, he is given a female assistant named Ms. Li (voiced by [[Kelly Hu]]), and is portrayed as a crime lord in the midst of a massive turf war. In the film's climax, Black Mask, pressured by the Red Hood, arranges to get [[Joker (comics) | the Joker]] out of Arkham Asylum. Consequentially, the Black Mask is kidnapped and left trapped in a truck with a bound and gagged Li and the rest of his henchmen. The Joker attempts to kill all of the mobsters at once by covering them in [[gasoline]] and setting them ablaze, but they are ultimately rescued by the timely intervention of Batman. In the epilogue, Black Mask is awaiting trial.

===Video games===
* Black Mask appears as a boss in the ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]'' game voiced by [[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]]. He and his False Facers are involved in a gang war with [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist & Scarface]].

* [[LEGO]] pieces to create Black Mask in the character creation feature can be unlocked in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'' after obtaining all the mini-kits in the villain chapters. He is also featured as an unlockable character in the "Villain Hunt" minigame in the [[Nintendo DS]] version. Black Mask in the games resembles his animated versions.

* Black Mask's eponymous mask appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' as an answer to one of the Riddler's riddles; scanning it unlocks a profile of Sionis.

* Black Mask makes a brief cameo in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]]. Appearing as one of Arkham's latest inmates, he holds several armed warders at bay with a chair in the opening sequence. It should be additionally noted that the character has also been featured as the focus of several exclusive challenge maps later released by the game's producers.

* Black Mask appears in '''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

===Miscellaneous===
* Black Mask appeared in ''[[Batman Adventures]]'' #5-8. Additionally, this version was in the employ of the [[Red Hood]] and his False Face Society is composed largely of other costumed criminals, including [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]], [[Deadshot (comics)|Deadshot]], [[Sportsmaster]], and [[Black Spider|Black Spider I]]. In the arc, most of his lieutenants are apprehended and his criminal empire dismantled after Batman infiltrates the False Facers under the guise of [[Matches Malone]]. Following a failed assault on one of Bruce Wayne's corporate offices, the ganglord himself is finally taken into custody. [[Andrea Beaumont|The Phantasm]] is subsequently named as Black Mask's underworld successor.

* The [[Cartoon series|animated version]] of Black Mask has also appeared in the spinoff comic series ''[[The Batman Strikes!]]'', where he [[extortion|extorts]] Bruce Wayne into making a deal with him, and attempts to take over crime in Gotham City by ridding it of other villains.
