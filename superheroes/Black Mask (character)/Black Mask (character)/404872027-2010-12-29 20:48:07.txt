==Fictional character biography==
===Dark beginning===
Black Mask's [[origin story]] was established in his first appearance. '''Roman Sionis''' was born to wealthy and utterly self-absorbed parents who cared more about their social status than their son; moments after his birth, the doctor carelessly dropped him on his head. Roman's parents were less concerned about their son's well-being and more concerned about covering up the entire incident out of fear of how their wealthy friends would react to the news of their son's injury. A second incident occurred when he was a child: While at the Sionis family country estate he was attacked by a [[rabies|rabid]] [[raccoon]]. This incident was also covered up by the Sionis family, who forbade Roman to mention it to anyone.

Further adding to the cauldron was his father's "friendship" with [[Thomas Wayne]]; both of Roman's parents disliked the Waynes and were quite vocal about it in private with their son. However, to their son's dismay, they continued to associate with Thomas and [[Martha Wayne]], to the extent of literally forcing him to become friends with their son, Bruce. His parents' hypocrisy had a deep impact on him, and he grew to hate and resent them and the "masks" they wore in public. 

After graduating from high school, Sionis was given a high ranking position inside his father's company, Janus Cosmetics. There, he met and fell in love with Circe, a [[working class]] secretary. His parents didn't approve of the relationship and made it clear that they wanted him to break it off. Enraged, Sionis burned down the family's mansion, killing both of his parents. Upon their deaths, he inherited the family fortune and business. Sionis wasn't the businessman his father was and eventually ruined Janus Cosmetics by funding a failed line of face-paint make-up. In desperation, he threw large sums of money at the staff chemists to create a product to save the company, and what came back to him was a kind of water-proof makeup. The product was rushed to market without proper testing, and once it hit the market turned out to be a deadly [[toxin]] which disfigured several hundred women. 

Circe, now Sionis' fiancée, broke up with him in front of his entire staff. At that time, now successful mogul Bruce Wayne offered to bail out the company on the condition that Sionis give up control and allow Wayne to appoint his own Board of Directors. Sionis agreed, but was furious at the humiliation he had suffered. He went to the family [[mausoleum]] and broke his father's [[ebony]] coffin lid. From a piece of this, Sionis carved a mask, becoming ''"Black Mask"''.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Becoming ''Black Mask''===
Despite having proved inept at business, Sionis finds he has an amazing aptitude for crime, and he soon has a large gang working for him. Calling them the False Face Society, the one requirement is that all members must select a mask from his collection and wear it at all times when on the job and in his presence. They become more and more powerful in the Gotham underworld, until Black Mask decides it is time to take his revenge on Bruce Wayne. He begins [[kidnapping]] [[Wayne Enterprises]] executives, putting masks on their faces coated in the deadly make-up once made by Janus Cosmetics. He also targets Circe and forcibly disfigures her with the chemicals in order to force her to reunite with him. Circe ultimately commits [[suicide]], leading Black Mask to replace her with a mannequin that he talks to as if it were a real person.

These kidnappings attract Batman's attention, and he begins hunting down the False Facers. He slowly begins to dismantle the organization until he finally finds Black Mask in the ruins of the Sionis Family home. Black Mask lights the wreckage on fire, in an attempt to "kill" his old self and become his new self, Black Mask. Batman saves him, but the mask had been burned onto Sionis' face and leaves him disfigured.

==="Warpaint"===
Black Mask spends some time in [[Arkham Asylum]], but escapes and subsequently restarts the False Faces. He takes on a new second-in-command, Tattoo (whose face is covered in a [[tattoo]] mask pattern), and begins burning down Wayne properties. The False Faces kidnap [[Lucius Fox]], CEO of Waynetech and friend of Bruce Wayne. Batman infiltrates the gang and is able to save Fox from Black Mask's [[torture]], and even brings in Tattoo, but Black Mask escapes. This contributes to Batman's deteriorating confidence prior to ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]''. (''Batman'' #484-485)

===Cult leader===
In "The Cult" storyline, Black Mask reappears as a crime boss, having given up his vendetta against Bruce Wayne. Making allegiance with [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] at some times, working alone at others, he controls much of [[Gotham City]]'s underworld until the city is destroyed by an [[earthquake]] in the "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" story arc. 

Sionis discards the ebony mask, believing his [[scar]]s to be a sign of his strength and determination to survive. By now completely [[insanity|insane]], he leads a [[cult]] whose trademark is ritual scarring, killing anyone who refuses to join. He leads a powerful group until Batman and [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] dissolve it. Sionis is imprisoned in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], but he escapes before the city is made a part of the country again.

===Relentless===
In ''Catwoman'' #16, Black Mask begins a [[illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] ring and decides to move his organization into Gotham's East End, drawing the attention of [[Catwoman]], who had sworn to protect that area of the city.

Catwoman interferes in Black Mask's plans, stealing money from him and giving it to the poor, and injuring many of his men. Black Mask decides he wants to remove the problem, and so finds an old friend of Selina Kyle's, Sylvia Sinclair, who is working in the Gotham mobs. She reveals Catwoman's [[secret identity]] to him, and he begins a campaign of terror against her. He blows up the new [[youth club|youth center]] she had endowed with the stolen money, hounds her, and kidnaps her sister and brother-in-law. Black Mask tortures Catwoman's brother-in-law to death in front of her sister, and then makes the woman eat pieces of her husband's corpse.

Catwoman arrives to find her brother-in-law dead, her sister insane, and her friend [[Holly Robinson]] on the verge of being tortured. She attacks Black Mask, and the two of them fight across his penthouse. At the end of the battle, Black Mask falls from the top of the building, leaving everyone to assume he is dead.

===''War Games'' & ''War Crimes''===
When [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] quits his role as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in the ''[[Batman: War Games|War Games]]'' arc, Batman chooses Stephanie Brown, aka [[Spoiler (comics character)|The Spoiler]], to replace him.  Batman quickly discovers that her lack of focus and inability to follow orders make her a danger to herself and others, and fires her. Desperate to prove herself, she takes charge of one of Batman's contingency plans: To get all of Gotham's crime lords under the control of [[Orpheus (comics)|Orpheus]], an agent of Batman, and therefore under the control of Batman himself. The plan fails because Spoiler is unaware that a key contact with the crime lords, [[Matches Malone]], is actually none other than Batman himself. When "Matches Malone" does not appear as expected, the tension at the meeting accidentally degenerates into a firefight, leaving many dead and wounded. This creates a [[power vacuum]] that quickly erupts into a brutal gang war on the streets of Gotham.

In ''War Games Act Two'', Spoiler seeks out Orpheus, believing that if she could enlist his help there could still be a chance to bring the plan to some sort of successful conclusion. As she finishes telling Orpheus his role in the plan, Black Mask murders him by slitting his throat in front of Spoiler. He then tortures Spoiler to obtain information about the rest of the plan.

Black Mask assumes Orpheus' identity, using face putty and padding, fooling even Batman and [[Onyx (comics)|Onyx]]. As Orpheus, he fans the flames of the crisis, driving Gotham's criminal element into a frenzy, seeking to kill any member or associate of the [[Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]]. He then returns to torture Spoiler for his own enjoyment, only to find that she has escaped.  Black Mask soon tracks her down again and they fight.  Spoiler defeats Black Mask and gets away, but is left with severe internal injuries.

Black Mask then infiltrates [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s Clocktower in an attempt to expose her to the mob. Batman attacks him in a blind rage and Oracle, fearful for Batman's life, is forced to activate a self-destruct device in the tower to get Batman to save her.

In the end, Spoiler supposedly dies due to the injuries inflicted on her and the willful negligence of [[Leslie Thompkins]] (although a recent [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] establishes that Stephanie's death had been faked). 

Black Mask then becomes the overlord of the Gotham underworld, recruiting [[Mr. Freeze]] as an enforcer and even gathering enough financial resources to purchase an [[Amazo]] [[Android (robot)|android]] and a large supply of [[kryptonite]], although the Amazo is destroyed by Batman and [[Nightwing]] when it is activated prematurely and the kryptonite is stolen by the [[Jason Todd#Red Hood|Red Hood]].

Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask begins a campaign to discredit Batman. While Rodriguez slams Batman in the press, Black Mask commits a series of murders disguised as Batman. This plan is complicated by the arrival of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]; Black Mask is intent on killing the Clown Prince of Crime and framing Batman for it, but the Joker wants to kill Black Mask, because he robbed him of the opportunity to kill another Robin. The two nearly kill each other before Batman intervene. Batman eventually exposes Rodriguez and finally captures Black Mask. However, while being taken to jail, Black Mask kills the escorting officer and escapes again.

===Death===
The assassin [[Deathstroke]] later approaches Black Mask, offering him a place within [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Society]]. Eager to strengthen his increasingly tenuous grip on the underworld (Batman and the new [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]] had both been targeting his operations), he accepts, and [[Captain Nazi]], [[Hyena (comics)|one of the Hyenas]], and [[Count Vertigo]] are sent after Batman and Red Hood.  However, Batman defeats them all, and ultimately prevents the Society from securing a foothold in Gotham.

In an attempt to "improve himself" after this debacle, Black Mask threatens the most important people in Catwoman's life, from [[Slam Bradley]] to [[Holly Robinson]]. Enraged, Catwoman retaliates by shooting him in the head, killing him.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After the shooting, Selina Kyle passes the mantle of Catwoman to her friend Holly. Not long after, Holly is arrested for Black Mask's murder.

===Blackest Night===
In ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Black Mask comes back from the dead as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] to show Catwoman why "shooting him in the head, was a bad idea". In October 2009, DC announced they were taking a month off from primary ''Blackest Night'' comics by "reanimating dead runs" and tying them into the event. The campaign involved releasing the next numeric issue of a comic run that had long been cancelled by DC and associating it with the ''Blackest Night'' (i.e. bringing the 'dead' back to life, so to speak). As a result, ''Catwoman'' #83 was released on January 13, 2010, 'reanimating' the cancelled series for one issue involving Selina Kyle being confronted by Black Lantern Black Mask. In an attempt to scare Catwoman, the Black Lantern Black Mask goes after her sister Maggie, who had been institutionalized after he killed her husband and forced her to eat his eyeballs. [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] manages to stop him by trapping him inside a mutated [[Pitcher plant]], its digestive juices dissolving his body as fast as his ring could regenerate it.<ref>''Catwoman'' #83 (January 2010)</ref>

===Black Mask's legacy===
{{main|Jeremiah Arkham}}
[[Image:JArkhamasBlackMask.jpg|120px|right|thumb|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham, as the new Black Mask, orders his predecessor's men to destroy his asylum in ''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1. Art by Tony Daniels.]]
In the ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]'' storyline, a second crime lord, Black Mask II, emerges.  He has drugged [[Arkham Asylum]]'s inmates, including The [[Great White Shark (comics)|Great White Shark]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Mr. Zsasz]], [[Jane Doe (comics)|Jane Doe]], and [[Scarecrow (comics)|the Scarecrow]], with a substance that can kill when triggered. Black Mask is quickly acknowledged as the leader of the group when he blows up the asylum, and then prepares for his ascension by destroying [[Two-Face]]'s and [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin's]] reign and becoming Gotham City's crime lord once again. In a recent ''Batgirl'' storyline, he had Scarecrow develop a new recreational drug, "Thrill."   In a change from previous appearances of the character, "Battle For The Cowl" issue #3 displays a character implied to be Black Mask referring to himself as "we".  

The new Black Mask absorbs Penguin's mob and kicks [[Two-Face]] out of Gotham, becoming the city's sole crime lord. He is shown to be behind the separate actions of several Gotham criminals like [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]], [[Victor Zsasz]], Jane Doe, [[Clayface]], Alyce Sinner, [[Fright (comics)|Fright]], [[Doctor Death (comics)|Dr. Death]] and [[Hugo Strange]], providing funding in exchange for favors.<ref>Batman 688-691</ref> However, in "Life after Death", he is targeted by both the National Guard and the returning [[Carmine Falcone|Falcone crime family]], led by Mario Falcone, forcing him to retreat to an area in Gotham called Devil's Square.<ref>Batman 691-697</ref>

Black Mask's identity has been revealed to be Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]].<ref>''Batman'' #697 (March 2010)</ref> He and Fright have become lovers. Following his capture and defeat by the new Batman, [[Dick Grayson]], he is imprisoned in the rebuilt Arkham Asylum. He also starred in the three-issue follow up, ''[[Arkham Reborn]]'', where he begins manipulating patients, a plotline that culminated in ''[[Detective Comics]],'' with the revelation of his role as Black Mask and his incarceration in his own asylum. However the new head of Arkham, Dr. Alyce Sinner, who had secretly been manipulating events in ''Arkham Reborn,'' continues her work for the [[Intergang|Church of Crime]] and allies with him.

==Powers and abilities==
Black Mask has no super-human abilities. However, he is a master criminal strategist with vast amount of resources. He was the crime lord of Gotham city for many years as an undercover businessman. 

Black Mask is skilled in the use of handguns. He usually carries at least two automatic pistols.
He is a capable hand to hand fighter, able to hold his ground against accomplished martial artists such as Batman and Catwoman. He can take high amounts of damage, while continuing to fight.

Black Mask's most important weapons are fear and intimidation. He is known for his brutal and sadistic torture techniques, especially on the face. Black Mask also uses his connections to gather information on his enemies, and then hits them at their weak points, such as family and friends.

==Other Versions==
In ''Batman: Crimson Mist''- the third part of the trilogy that began with ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', where Batman has become a vampire-, Black Mask rejects the offer of an alliance from [[Two-Face]] and [[Killer Croc]] as he believes that the Black Mask gang is too powerful for anyone to defeat, only for his entire gang to subsequently be brutally slaughtered by the vampire Batman when he crashes into their warehouse headquarters. Having decapitated the gang, Batman left their heads impaled on the fence outside [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] as a warning to the inmates.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:BlackMask.JPG|right|thumb|Black Mask, as he appears in ''The Batman''.]]
* Black Mask debuted in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "The Breakout" voiced by [[James Remar]]. This version of Black Mask is a powerful crime boss with a right-hand man named Number One and a vast organization of henchmen with high-tech weapons. What makes this Black Mask different from his comic appearances is the fact that, while he wears a mask made of some black material over his face, it is unremovable. He has no noticeable fingerprints or any other distinguishing features either, so it is impossible to identify him. He steals a powerful shock-wave generator, and holds Gotham City hostage. To convince the city - and specifically, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]], who is dealing with his demands - he is not bluffing, he arranges a demonstration of the powerful device, which ends up destroying several blocks from its activating point. While dealing with Gordon, he battles Batman, is defeated, and taken to [[Gotham City Police Department]] headquarters for questioning by Gordon. However, Number One and the henchmen try to break him out of jail, first by filling Gotham PD with sleep gas, from which Black Mask escapes unaffected thanks to his mask, and when Batgirl and Robin knock Black Mask unconscious, lock him in a cell and seal the precinct from Black Mask's army's siege, they start entering by the elevator shafts and destroy the blast doors sealing the PD. Number One and the henchmen surround the police building, and eventually break Black Mask free. However, the furious crime boss shocks Number One with his own shock gun, promotes a random soldier to be the new Number One, and gets on a helicopter, ready to activate the generator, and destroy Gotham. However, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and [[Batgirl]] battle him, while Batman deactivates his device. At the end, he is once again arrested. In "Rumors," Black Mask later reappears as one of the many villains captured by the [[vigilante]] Rumor. At the end, he is freed only to be brought to justice. In "The Batman/Superman Story, Part One", Black Mask works with [[Lex Luthor]]; he and his henchmen kidnap [[Lois Lane]], and assembles a team of villains ([[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Mr. Freeze]], and the second [[Clayface]]) to lure [[Superman]] into a trap and kill him. He is foiled by the Man of Steel, along with Batman and Robin, and Lois Lane, who foils his attempt to flee, is rescued. In "What Goes Up...", Black Mask employs [[Shadow Thief]] in order to break out of [[Arkham Asylum]] and steal a rare [[Nth metal|Nth]] element meteor in order to use the Nth element to easily rob a gem depository. He also employs a new Number One whom he later exposes to Nth powder which caused him to fly upward. Black Mask replaces him with an eyepatch-wearing woman. Batman and Robin foil his plan, with the help of [[Hawkman]].

* Black Mask appears in the episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' "The Plague of the Prototypes!", voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. His right-hand henchman is Taboo, and he commands the False-Face Society. He and the society rob a bank when Batman leaves Gotham, only to be foiled by his army of Bat-Robots. In his second attempt, Black Mask has Taboo reprogram the robots to do his bidding, and uses them to nearly defeat Batman, who is later rescued by [[Ace the Bat-Hound]] and the Prototype Bat-Robot (Proto). Black Mask later has the robots steal powerful explosives for him, and orders them to kill the rest of the False-Face society, except for Taboo. Black Mask plans to use the robots to set-off explosives and destroy half the city, intimidating the survivors. However, Proto tracks down his lair, and Batman captures the villain while he, Proto, and Ace take down the five robots. When a sixth robot is unleashed, Black Mask escapes and tries to detonate it, but Proto flies off and redirects it away from the city. Batman finds Black Mask and defeats him.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/advance-guides |title=Schedule for Channel 9, Oct. 31st, 2010 |publisher=Tvtonight.com.au |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>

===Film===

In the film's climax, Roman, Li, and a number of Gotham mobsters are kidnapped by the Joker and left bound and gagged in the back of a truck. The Joker attempts to wipe out all of the mobsters at once by covering them in [[gasoline]] and setting them ablaze, but they are ultimately rescued by the timely intervention of Batman.
