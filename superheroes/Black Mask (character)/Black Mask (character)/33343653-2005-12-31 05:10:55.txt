'''Black Mask''' is the name of a [[DC Comics]] comicbook character associated with the [[Batman]] series. He first appeared in ''Batman'' #386 (August, 1985) and was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Tom Mandrake]].

==Dark Beginning==

'''Roman Sionis''' was born into one of [[Gotham City]]&#8217;s elite families, dropped on his head moments after birth. His family was wealthy, but his parents were distant. His father was friends with Thomas Wayne, and he knew  the young Bruce Wayne, who would grow up to become Batman. The young Sionis had no friends, but he and Bruce were civil with each other. 

One night, Sionis burned down his family's [[mansion]], killing both of his parents. Barely out of his teens, he inherited the family fortune, as well as the family's business Janus Cosmetics. But Sionis wasn't good with business and he began squandering his money,  running the firm into the ground. Eventually, he only had one chance to bail the company out; a new face paint make-up. He was so sure of it he had his own girlfriend, the [[model (person)|model]] Circe, act as model for the product.

Unfortunately, the make-up had not been properly tested, and it horribly disfigured Circe and anyone else who had tried it. The company in ruins, Sionis was financially saved when his childhood acquaintance Bruce Wayne bought the company. Sionis was not grateful, seeing this as "losing face." Enraged, he went to the family [[mausoleum]] and broke his father's [[ebony]] coffin lid. Sionis had always been obsessed with masks, and the old idea that when a person dons a mask, they become someone else. He took a large piece of the coffin and carved a mask from it, becoming '''Black Mask'''.

==Becoming Black Mask==

Sionis found he had an amazing aptitude for [[crime]], and he soon had a large gang working for him. Calling them the False Face Society, the one requirement was that all members must select a mask from his collection and wear it at all times when on the job and in his presence. They were successfully gaining power in the Gotham underworld, until Black Mask decided it was time to take his [[revenge]] on Bruce Wayne. He began [[kidnapping]] Wayne Enterprise executives, putting masks on their faces that were coated in the deadly make-up once made by Janus Cosmetics.

These kidnappings drew Batman's attention, and he began hunting down the False Facers. He slowly began to dismantle the organization until he finally found Black Mask in the ruins of the Sionis Family home. Black Mask lit the wreckage on fire trying to escape, but was caught in the burning house. Batman was able to save him, but the mask had been burned onto his face. Even when the wood was removed, his face kept the shape and color of the Black Mask.

Black Mask spent some time in [[Arkham Asylum]], and upon his eventual release, he restarted the False Facers. He took on a new second, called Tattoo (whose face was covered in a [[tattoo]] mask pattern), and he began burning down Wayne properties. This time he also kidnapped [[Lucius Fox]], CFO of Waynetech and friend of Bruce Wayne. Batman infiltrated the gang and was able to save Fox from Black Mask's [[torture]], and even brought in Tattoo, but Black Mask escaped.

==Cult Leader==
Black Mask seemingly gave up his quest against Wayne, and became the leading figure in the Gotham mobs. Making allegiance with [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] at some times, working alone at others, he controlled much of Gotham's underworld until the city was destroyed by an [[earthquake]] and declared by the government to be a 'No Man's Land." Sionis discarded the ebony mask, believing his [[scar]]s to be a sign of his strength and determination to survive. By now completely [[insane]], he led a [[cult]] whose [[trademark]] was ritual scarring, killing anyone who refused to join. He led a powerful group until Batman and [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] broke it up. He was imprisoned in Blackgate Penitentiary, but managed to escape before the city was made a part of the country again.

=="Relentless"==

Black Mask had lost much of his power base, and it took him some time to rebuild his empire. He began a [[drug trafficking]] ring and decided to move his organization into Gotham's East End, drawing the attention of [[Catwoman]], who had sworn to protect that area of the city.

Catwoman interfered in Black Mask's plans, stealing money from him and giving it to the poor, and injuring many of his men. Black Mask decided he wanted to remove the problem, and so found an old friend of Selina Kyle's, Sylvia Sinclair, who was working in the Gotham mobs. She revealed Catwoman's [[secret identity]] to him, and he began a campaign of terror against her. He blew up the new [[youth center]] she had endowed with the stolen money, hounded her, and kidnapped her sister and brother-in-law. Black Mask tortured Catwoman's brother-in-law brutally in front of her sister, and then made the woman eat pieces of her husband's [[corpse]].

Catwoman arrived to find her brother-in-law dead, her sister insane, and her friend Holly on the verge of being tortured. She attacked Black Mask, and the two of them fought across his penthouse. At the end of the battle, Black Mask fell from the top of the building, leaving everyone to assume he was dead. They were wrong.

=="War Games"==

[[Spoiler (comics)|Spoiler]] had become the new Robin when [[Robin (comics)|Tim Drake]] quit. However, Batman believed she was a danger to herself and to others and fired her. Desperate to prove herself, she took one of Batman's contingency plans and set it into action. The plan was to get all of Gotham's crime lords under the control of [[Orpheus (comics)|Orpheus]], an agent of Batman, and therefore under the control of Batman himself. The plan failed because Spoiler was unaware that the man who was set to meet with the crime lords, Matches Malone, was really just one of Batman's disguises. When "Matches Malone" did not show the meeting quickly broke out into a fight, leaving many dead. This quickly erupted into a brutal [[gang war]] on the streets of Gotham. 

Feeling guilty, Spoiler went to go find Orpheus, believing that if she could find him and fill him in on the particulars of the plan and what he had to do everything would turn out okay. However, right when she told Orpheus that the whole plan depended on him Black Mask came out from behind and slit Orpheus's throat. He then tortured the Spoiler for the rest of information on the plan. 

Black Mask assumed Orpheus' identity, using face putty and padding, (as seen in 'Batman: War Games, Act 2') managing to fool Batman and Onyx into thinking he was the real deal. As Orpheus he made things worse by sending Gotham's criminals into a wild mob, demanding blood from the [[Batman Family|Bat-family]]. He then returned to Spoiler, intending to torture her further for his own enjoyment. However, the young heroine had managed to escape, but Black Mask soon tracked her down again. The two fought and Spoiler managed to overcome Black Mask and get away, but was left with severe internal injuries.

Black Mask then infiltrated [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]]'s Clocktower, trying to expose her to the criminals. Batman went after Black Mask and attacked him in a rage, and Oracle was forced to activate a self destruct mode for the tower in order to snap Batman out of his rage by getting him to save her.

In the end, the Spoiler passed away due to the injuries inflicted on her and the willful negligence by [[Leslie Thompkins]], and Black Mask rose to become the overlord of Gotham's [[Mafia]].

==War Crimes==
Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask began a campaign to discredit Batman. While Rodriguez slammed Batman in the press, Black Mask committed a series of murders disguised as Batman. This plan was complicated by the arrival of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Black Mask was intent on killing the Clown Prince of Crime and framing Batman for it, but the Joker wanted to kill Black Mask, because he robbed him of the opportunity to kill another member of the Bat-family. The two nearly killed each other before Batman intervened. Batman eventually exposed Rodriguez and finally managed to capture Black Mask. However, while being taken to jail, he managed to kill the escorting officer and escape again.

==Infinite Crisis==
Slade Wilson, a.k.a. [[Deathstroke]], approached Black Mask offering him a place within the [[Secret Society of Supervillains|Society]]. Eager to strengthen his increasingly tenuous grip on the underworld, he accepted. This has led to several Society members setting up shop in Gotham City.
