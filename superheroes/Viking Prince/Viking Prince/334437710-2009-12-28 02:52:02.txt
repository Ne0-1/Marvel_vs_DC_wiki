'''Viking Prince''' is a [[DC Comics]] title which featured in the [[comic book]] ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]''. It was a historic adventure story about a [[Viking]] named '''Jon'''. The story was written by [[Robert Kanigher]] and drawn by [[Joe Kubert]].

==History==
In ''The Brave and the Bold'' #1, the main character is found amnesiac, on a beach by 10th century [[Scandinavia]]n fishermen, who named him "Jon" after a legendary prince. His enemy, Thorvald, knew his true identity, and wanted to kill him before he regained his memory, or met someone else who recognised him. This set-up was ignored by later writers, some of whom made no mention of his background, while others portrayed him as an actual prince, the son of King Rikk. 

He continued to appear in ''The Brave and the Bold'' until #26 (Jul 1959).

===Later appearances===
* In ''[[Our Army at War]]'' #162 {Jan 1966) [[Sergeant Rock]] found the Viking Prince in a glacier. He was defrosted, and fought alongside Rock in [[World War II]]. Jon had a [[death drive|death wish]], because he had fallen in love with a [[valkyrie]], and was banished from [[Valhalla]] by [[Odin]], who said he could only return to his love if he died a heroic death. However, Odin also made the Viking Prince invunerable to all known weapons. He is killed by [[plastique explosive]], an unknown weapon at the time the curse was made. (In current continuity, Jon was still killed in World War II, but made his way to this period through a time warp, rather than being frozen.)
* The Viking Prince appeared in a back up strip in "Arak, Son of Thunder", issues 8 - 11 (April - July, 1982). The four part story, "Frozen hell for a Viking" was written by Kanigher and drawn by Jan Duursema, a graduate of Kubert's art school. 
* In ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' #35 (early Aug 1992)  [[Batman]] encounters '''Jon Rikkson''', a modern day descendent of the Prince who has become an environmental crusader. The story also features a legend describing Prince Jon's encounter with a Viking Batman.
* In ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'' #29 (Jul 2001) [[Black Canary]], having been sent back in time to 12th century America, meets '''Jon Haraldson''', the Viking Prince, who is one of the Viking explorers who have discovered [[Vinland]], and they have a brief relationship before she returns to the 21st century. Jon takes a bullet intended for Dinah, but apparently survives, later being described as mourning "a love lost to time".
* The Viking Prince appears in ''[[The War That Time Forgot]]'' (2008 miniseries), in which warriors from throughout history find themselves on a mysterious island.

==Other media==
===Television===
* Jon appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "To Another Shore". The episode introduces him in an account of his love for a valkyrie named Valkyrior, but Odin disapproved and cast Jon out of Valhalla, stating that an honorable battle will enable him to gain re-entry into Valhalla and the love of Valkyrior. Being that Odin was crafty, he secretly blessed Jon with immortality where no weapon would kill him. Jon travelled the Earth and took part in various battles. After every battle, Jon sailed off into the north eventually dying of cold and becoming frozen in a glacier. Many years later, [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] members [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]], [[Giganta]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], and [[Killer Frost]] attempt to steal his body so that [[Gorilla Grodd]] can gain the secret of immortality. Justice League members [[Wonder Woman]], Martian Manhunter, and Green Arrow alongside [[King Faraday]] fight them off. Wonder Woman ensures that he gets a proper Viking funeral. The still images accompanying the origin story are drawn in the style of [[Joe Kubert]].

* Viking Prince will appear in an upcoming episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''.
