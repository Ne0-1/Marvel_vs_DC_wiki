'''Titania''' is a supervillain in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She was created by then Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]], in the successful company-wide crossover known as [[Secret Wars]].  An aspiring bully, Titania became a significant threat, and a major foe of [[She-Hulk]].

She is the second super-villainess to carry the name.  The first was a female wrestler (a member of [[Grapplers (comics)|The Grapplers]]) who was assassinated by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

Titania was introduced in the series Marvel Super Heroes' ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #3.

== Fictional character biography ==
Titania is introduced in ''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' # 3, but details of her early life are fleshed out in ''She-Hulk'' (vol. 1) #10 (2004), an issue which centered around depicting her backstory in flashback.

Born prematurely in a suburb of [[Denver, Colorado]], '''Mary MacPherran''' grew up scrawny and short-statured, inspiring a popular girl at school, Vanessa Ashwood, to nickname her "Skeeter" (a slang word for mosquito).  As a high school senior, she worked as a salesclerk alongside her only other friend, [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Marsha Rosenberg]].  Resentful of Vanessa's popularity and wealth, Mary fantasized about gaining super powers and using them to turn the tables on her tormentors.

After the second [[Arachne (comics)|Spider-Woman]] (Julia Carpenter) makes one of her early appearances in their town, Marsha remarks that the new superheroine's reddish-blonde hair color matches Mary's.  Mary then falsely confides to her friend that she is secretly Spider-Woman.  Shortly afterward, Mary was invited to a fancy party at Vanessa's house, where she was surprised to find that her newfound popularity is due to Marsha spreading around the false Spider-Woman rumor.

However, in the middle of the party, their section of Denver was torn from [[Earth]] and became part of the composite planet [[Battleworld]], created by the [[Beyonder]] as a stage for a selected group of superheroes and supervillains to battle each other.  When the real Spider-Woman arrives on the scene to save the guests from a collapsing structure, an enraged Vanessa and her guests turn on Mary and Marsha, chasing them into the forests of Battleworld. 

Scared and exhausted, the two girls are found by [[Doctor Doom]], who was in need of further metahuman operatives to further his ambitions.  Mary and Marsha both agreed to Doom's offer of power in exchange for serving in his army of supervillains. 

=== Secret Wars ===

Using the highly advanced alien technologies found in "''Doombase''", the appropriately-named villain headquarters, powered by immense energies from the ferocious alien storm outside, Doom recreated both women; able to use the technology entirely as he desired, Doom induced high-level metahuman abilities of specific and particular design.  Whilst Rosenberg (now known as '''[[Volcana]]''') received a fiery form composed of ionized plasma, MacPherran gained powers in diametric opposition to her previous incarnation - where once she had been "the scrawny one who got her face rubbed in the dirt", she was now far taller, muscular, and buxom than average, and also wielded perhaps the most impressive physical power statistics for any female in the Marvel Universe at the time. 
(Until the [[She-Hulk]] gained Class 100 strength as well as the ability to grow even stronger as she got angrier, Titania was the strongest female mortal in the Marvel Universe, surpassed in strength only by the goddess [[Hela]]).

The changes were not only physical, but mental in nature.  Where Mary MacPherran had been small and timid, the newly-named Titania, so called because of strength like a titan, was proud, and confident, perhaps to extremes.  No sooner had Volcana melted machinery into a large pile of red-hot slag, than Titania picked it up, boldly ignoring the slight possibility of injury, and hurled it through the wall; soon after, she challenged Carl "Crusher" Creel, the [[Absorbing Man]], to a fight which he refused, reasoning that he had "nothing to prove...to a dame."

Titania began to work for Doom in earnest, battling the superheroes, with her most impressive conquest being Jennifer Walters, the [[She-Hulk]]; she did not know it, but this would be the beginning of a long rivalry.

Yet, when the heroes later stormed Doombase to rescue She-Hulk, Titania tried to face up against veteran super-hero [[Spider-Man]]; despite her massive strength and durability advantages, Spider-Man's highly-increased speed, agility, and long experience against more powerful foes, allowed him to not only dodge her attacks, but to be able to attack her with impunity, culminating in throwing her through an exterior wall.  During this fight, Titania's attitude and newfound arrogance quickly evaporated, giving way to what Spider-Man called the "whining little wimp-ette" - it was clear that the arrogance could only last whilst Titania had the upper hand, otherwise a reversion to her previous character would occur.  Mindful of this beating, Titania would harbor a fear of Spider-Man for some time.

After her run-in with Spider-Man, a previously hinted-at relationship between the Absorbing Man and Titania began; Titania seemed fairly dependent on Creel at this point.  Once Owen Reece, the [[Molecule Man]], managed to seal off the chunk of Denver, and begin to navigate it back to Earth, Creel and MacPherran revealed that they were done with Doom and his war, and simply wanted to go home.

=== Back to Earth ===

Once back on Earth, however, the pair did not settle down to the quiet life, instead joining [[Baron Zemo]], and his latest incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].  Their first assignment was to recruit the powerful [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] into the group, which also prevented them from joining the main group in the assault on Avengers Mansion.  To kill time, Titania robbed a jewelery store, only to come to the attention of Spider-Man; too afraid to fight, she ran from combat, only to encounter him again in LaGuardia Airport.  There, once more, Titania tried not to fight, having Creel do so on her behalf; yet the sight of his near-defeat at Spider-Man's hands was enough for Titania to temporarily overcome her arachnophobia, charging into combat.  It was a moot point, though, since Creel ended the fight by threatening to destroy a plane full of innocents if Spider-Man refused to leave the scene, which he (Spider-Man) reluctantly did.

The villain couple received another assignment from the Masters: to kill Hercules, who had been gravely injured previously by the Masters, and was in hospital.  Yet despite a guard of only [[Scott Lang]] (Ant-Man), and Janet Van Dyne (the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]), Hercules survived; with Creel stung by insects in human form, and Titania shrunk to the size of Wasp, the villains were easily subdued, with Titania taken to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], a superhuman penitentiary.

Her stay in the Vault was not to last long, however.  When Tony Stark, [[Iron Man]], began the Armor Wars, the battle to destroy or disable all enhanced armor types based on stolen Iron Man designs, this inevitably led him to the Guardsmen, The Vault's wardens.  The ensuing conflict, whilst successful from his point of view, created a power failure, allowing Titania and Mister Hyde to escape.  Whilst The Captain ([[Steve Rogers]]) managed to subdue and capture Mister Hyde, his colleague [[D-Man]] was unsuccessful in apprehending Titania; when allowed the opportunity for a rematch, D-Man simply let the villainess escape.  

Using her newfound freedom, Titania travelled to Washington D.C; losing a succession of battles with She-Hulk, Titania promised to never attack her again, and to return to jail.

Broken out yet again, Titania joined with [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|the Wizard]], [[Klaw]], and [[Hydro-Man]], to become the new [[Frightful Four]].  Battling the [[Fantastic Four]], the team only won due to help from Professor Gregson Gilbert's creation [[Dragon Man]], and Aron, a rogue [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]; in the rematch, the Fantastic Four prevailed, only to have both Fours imprisoned by Aron in suspended animation, using clones of the Fantastic Four to act out adventures he wished to witness.  When both teams were freed, Aron chose to witness the dreams of his clones instead, transporting the Frightful Four back to The Vault, as a service to the Fantastic Four.

However, this stay in The Vault was as permanent as earlier ones - a conspiracy between Loki and the Wizard saw Titania free once more, in Loki's [[Acts of Vengeance]] plan.  Teaming supervillains to fight enemies not usually their own, Titania was dismayed when Doctor Doom, her partner, told her she would face not She-Hulk, but Spider-Man.  Yet Doom managed to stoke her pride and anger, allowing her to overcome her fear and engage Spider-Man; it was unfortunate that at this time, Spider-Man had temporarily bonded with the [[Captain Universe|Uni-Power]], making him Captain Universe.  This granted him the power to render Titania unconscious in one massive energy discharge; the only benefit of the situation was that Titania lost her fear of Spider-Man.

This time, Titania did not even make it back to The Vault; freed by [[Graviton]], who also collected the Trapster and the Brothers Grimm; all had been humiliated by Spider-Man in the Captain Universe guise.  Along with [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]], they attempted to take revenge, only to fail.  Titania, humiliatingly, was defeated by a collision with a speeding bus.

=== Finding Romance ===

Escaping The Vault once again, Titania, ever the team player, joined [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]], as foes of [[Captain America]] and the [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]; this did not work out, however, and so Titania resolved to track down her old flame - the Absorbing Man.  Finding him battling the Eric Masterson [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]; when she appeared injured by a blow from [[Mjolnir]], Creel admitted his love for her, which she gladly reciprocated.  Seeing this, Thor allowed them to leave.

Whilst Creel made an attempt to live a normal life, Titania went back to robbing jewelery stores; concerned, Creel attempted to "scare her straight", collaborating with Thor in a ploy involving a Guggenheim exhibit.  Whilst the appearance of Spider-Man and special police unit Code: Blue complicated matters, ultimately Titania remembered her love for Creel.

Drawn to an AIM convention in Boca Caliente, Titania joined with the Abomination and Gargantua to battle the Town Called Hulk; once this was done, Titania came to her senses somewhat, asking Creel to marry her.  The wedding was attended by many supervillains; whilst the Avengers interrupted the ceremony, they left the couple alone.  In their new life, the pair seemed not to be able to stay under the radar, assuming the guises of Thunder Girl and Lightning Bolt in order to hunt Spider-Man for the reward offered by [[Norman Osborn]].

This was not the end of the pair's villainy; committing more robberies, Titania also clashed repeatedly with She-Hulk.

=== Illness and Recuperation ===

However, this was not a permanent state of affairs; despite her enhanced durability, Titania contracted a terminal illness: cancer.  Without health insurance and no money, she was quickly forced to move from the hospital to an abandoned building.  Slowly weakening, but still massively strong, she fought through the illness with the help of doctors provided by Thor; as a result, the Absorbing Man repented to Thor, bowing to the new Lord of Asgard.

However, Titania proved unable to stay away from She-Hulk; battered by her, Titania was offered the chance at revenge after obtaining the Power Gem, one of the legendary [[Infinity Gems]], from its former owner, the former [[Champion of the Universe]], now known as the Fallen One because of his own defeat at the She-Hulk's hands.  The Fallen One had agreed to cease using the Power Gem as a condition of his defeat, but was free to gain his own revenge by proxy through Titania.  After an initial defeat by the newly-empowered Titania, She-Hulk tricked her into believing that she had killed the Jade Giantess in a second battle; Titania's initial rush of triumph suddenly melted into uncertainty, as she realized that her life now had no meaning or focus without the object of her obsessive hatred.  The She-Hulk then took advantage of Titania's confusion to pluck the Power Gem from the criminal's forehead, and proceeded to use the Gem's power to knock Titania out with a single punch.

Titania was last seen incarcerated in the [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Lang]] Memorial Penitentiary, a.k.a. the [[Henry Pym|Pym]] Experimental Prison #2, a prison in which superhuman inmates are shrunk with [[Henry Pym#Powers and abilities|Pym particles]] to less than an inch in height, to reduce both their chances of escape and their threat to guards and the public if they do escape, since inmates can only be returned to their full size by prison technicians or the few others who have access to Pym particles.

== Powers and Abilities ==

Titania possesses great physical strength enabling her to trade blows with individuals such as the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[She-Hulk]]. Titania's muscles produce considerably less fatigue toxins than the muscles of an ordinary human, granting her superhuman levels of stamina. Titania's body is also highly resistant to physical injury. She can withstand high caliber bullets, temperature extremes, falls from great heights, and blunt force trauma without sustaining injury.

== Appearances in other media ==
Titania appears as a boss character in the 1996 video game, ''[[Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal]]''.
