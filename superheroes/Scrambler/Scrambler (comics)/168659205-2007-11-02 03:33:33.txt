'''Scrambler (Kim Il Sung)''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men #210'' and was created by [[Chris Claremont]], [[John Romita Jr]] and [[Dan Green]].

==Fictional character biography==
Scrambler is mutant and a sociopath and a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a band of assassins who were gathered together by the mutant thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] at the request of the enigmatic mastermind known as [[Mister Sinister]]. 

Sinister first sent the Marauders to murder the entire population of the underground mutant community known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. In the course of this mutant massacre, the Marauders clashed with the mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]] and the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. Subsequently, the X-Men thwarted the Marauders' attempt to assassinate Sinister's former pawn, [[Madelyne Pryor]], in San Francisco.

Later, Sinister sent the Marauders to battle the X-Men during the time of the demonic invasion of [[New York]] City known as the "Inferno". The Marauders were all killed during the "Inferno", but Sinister possesses the ability to clone them thanks to samples of their DNA. The Marauders later clashed with the dimensionally-displaced young mutant known as [[X-Man|Nate Grey]] after they attempted to assassinate Sinister's former servant, [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]].

Scrambler's clone retained his mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and will return in  ''[[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]]'' #200 once again as a member of the New Marauders, alongside old-time members like [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] and new ones like [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].

==Powers and abilities==
Scrambler is a mutant who possesses the ability to disrupt any system with his touch.  His touch disrupts systems, whether they be a living being, a machine, or a field of energy. Scrambler must physically touch his target in order to affect it. Scrambler can control the effect  so that, in the case of a nervous system, he can cause immobilization, unconsciousness, or seizures.  If his victim is a person possesses superhuman powers, Scrambler can nullify, backfire or disrupt the function of those powers.  Often he causes superhuman powers to go into overdrive, which is traumatic for the victim and causes their powers to flare up and then burn out for a period of time.
