'''Scrambler''' ('''Kim Il Sung''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men #210'' and was created by [[Chris Claremont]], [[John Romita Jr]] and [[Dan Green]].

==Fictional character biography==
Scrambler is mutant and a sociopath and a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a band of assassins who were gathered together by the mutant thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] at the request of the enigmatic mastermind known as [[Mister Sinister]]. 

Sinister first sent the Marauders to murder the entire population of the underground mutant community known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. In the course of this mutant massacre, the Marauders clashed with the mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]] and the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. Subsequently, the X-Men thwarted the Marauders' attempt to assassinate Sinister's former pawn, [[Madelyne Pryor]], in San Francisco.

Later, Sinister sent the Marauders to battle the X-Men during the time of the demonic invasion of [[New York]] City known as the "Inferno". The Marauders were all killed during the "Inferno", but Sinister possesses the ability to clone them thanks to samples of their DNA. The Marauders later clashed with the dimensionally-displaced young mutant known as [[X-Man|Nate Grey]] after they attempted to assassinate Sinister's former servant, [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]].

During the final battle for the mutant baby, the first birth since Decimation, Scrambler goes over to Wolverine and shuts off his healing factor so that he won't heal from the bullet, after being shot in the eye by Scalphunter.  However, X-23 appears and literally dismantles Scrambler, cutting off both his hands and eviscerating him.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Scrambler is a mutant who possesses the ability to disrupt any system with his touch.  His touch disrupts systems, whether they be a living being, a machine, or a field of energy. Scrambler must physically touch his target in order to affect it. Scrambler can control the effect  so that, in the case of a nervous system, he can cause immobilization, unconsciousness, or seizures.  If his victim is a metahuman who possesses powers, Scrambler can cancel or disrupt the function of those powers, often causing them to go into overdrive, in which they flare up and then burn out for a certain period of time.
