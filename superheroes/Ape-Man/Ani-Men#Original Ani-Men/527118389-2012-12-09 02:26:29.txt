The '''Ani-Men''' is the name of several fictional teams within the [[Marvel Universe]]. Four of them are villain groups, while one of them was introduced as a team of agents serving the [[High Evolutionary]].

==Fictional team history==
===Original Ani-Men===
The original lineup of Ani-Men ([[Ape-Man]], [[Bird-Man]], [[Cat-Man (Marvel Comics)|Cat-Man]], [[Frog-Man (Ani-Men)|Frog-Man]]) are recruited by a man named the Organizer. The Organizer is secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sends the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] defeats them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all go to prison. Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man form a team called the "Unholy Three" and work with the [[Death-Stalker|Exterminator]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #39</ref>

Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoin the Ani-Men, and the group goes to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria also recruits a new member for the group, [[Dragonfly (Marvel Comics)|Dragonfly]]. Nefaria's scientists submit the unwilling Ani-Men to processes that give them superhuman powers and animal-like forms, although eventually they revert back to normal after their fight with the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #95</ref>

Nefaria sends the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]; however the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] had intended to kill Stark with a bomb, which kills the Ani-Men instead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115</ref>

Dragonfly has continued her career as a villain, both on her own and as part of a team, such as the Femizons,<ref>''Captain America'' #389-392</ref> and the Masters of Evil.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-25</ref>

===Exterminator's Ani-Men===
The Exterminator, who was now known as the Death-Stalker, sometime later recruits a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man.<ref>''Daredevil'' #157</ref>  He sends the new Ani-Men to capture [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]]. The [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] defeats Bird-Man, and the Death-Stalker murders Ape-Man and Cat-Man upon the completion of their mission.<ref>''Daredevil'' #158</ref>

The Bird-Man is later murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] in the "Bar with No Name" incident.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>

===High Evolutionary's Ani-Men===
A new group wearing the name Ani-Men is created by the [[High Evolutionary]] and carries out his orders. The High Evolutionary's Ani-Men included Buzzard (an evolved [[hawk]]), Crushtacean (an evolved [[crab]]), Flying Fox (an evolved [[bat]]), [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]] (an evolved [[lizard]]), and Spinneret (an evolved [[spider]]). The Evolutionary dispatches the Ani-Men to a laboratory operated by his former assistant Miles Warren (the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]) to clean up Warren's files. After three weeks, the Ani-Men are almost done with their cleanup and have spread a virus into all of Warren's files, but they are discovered by the [[Scarlet Spider]]. When the High Evolutionary teleports the Ani-Men back to his home base at Wundagore, the Scarlet Spider is accidentally brought with them, having stuck himself to Crushtacean with his webbing. Later, the Scarlet Spider joins members of the Cult of the Jackal in sneaking into the citadel of the High Evolutionary in an attempt to learn the truth about Warren's involvement with the High Evolutionary. The Ani-Men come to face the cult members and the Scarlet Spider, but the fight is brought to an end after the Scarlet Spider is able to learn the truth from the High Evolutionary. The High Evolutionary sends the Scarlet Spider home, but Crushtacean foolishly touches a ball of impact webbing the hero has left behind, covering himself and the other Ani-Men with webbing, much to their embarrassment. <ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1 (November, 1995)</ref>

===Ani-Men IV===
A new group of Ani-Men surfaced in ''[[Great Lakes Avengers]]'' #1 (June 2005). This assemblage has no known connection to any prior incarnations or any info on their history. This group consisted of Giraffe-Man (a humanoid [[giraffe]]), Great Horned Owl-Man (a humanoid [[Great Horned Owl]]), Pig-Man (a humanoid [[pig]]), and Rabbit-Woman (a humanoid [[rabbit]]). They attacked the Milwaukee Convention Center, holding humans responsible for their trangressions against the animal kingdom. Model [[Big Bertha (comics)|Ashley Crawford]] (AKA Big Bertha) was at a modeling shoot there at the time and phoned her teammates in the GLA for help. By the time the Great Lakes Avengers showed up, the actual [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] also showed up telling them to sit this one out so that they won't get hurt. The Ani-Men were defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Great Lakes Avengers'' #1</ref>

===Hammerhead's Ani-Men===
During the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a new version of the Ani-Men (consisting of a new [[Ape-Man]], [[Bird-Man]], and [[Frog-Man (Ani-Men)|Frog Man]]) were shown committing crimes while the heroes were on Battleworld. They somehow got the equipment of the original Ani-Men and used it to rob a vault wagon only to be opposed by the NYPD.<ref>''Code of Honor'' #3</ref>

A new set of these Ani-Men (consisting of a new [[Ape-Man]], [[Bird-Man]], [[Cat-Man (Marvel Comics)|Cat-Man]]) are among the many criminals hired by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] in an effort to take over the underworld while the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] is incarcerated. Unbeknownst to them, the Kingpin has tricked Iron Man into leading a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] unit to the warehouse where they are meeting, which Iron Man believes to be the headquarters of [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers. Iron Man and the S.H.I.E.L.D. unit break in, and a huge fight breaks out. The battle results in arrests, injuries and death, but it is unrevealed if any of those apply to the new Ani-Men.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1</ref>

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the ''[[Earth X]]'' universe, the Ani-Men were animals in the Wakandan preserve that were mutated when the Terrigen Crystals were detonated in the atmosphere.<ref>''Earth X'' #4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, there is a group called the Ani-Men who are associated with [[Mole Man|Dr. Arthur Molekevic]].<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #3</ref>
