The '''Ani-Men''' is the name of several fictional teams within the [[Marvel Universe]].  Four of them are villain groups, while one of them was introduced as a team of agents serving the [[High Evolutionary]].

==Original Lineup==
The original lineup of Ani-Men ([[Ape-Man]], [[Bird-Man]], [[Cat-Man (Marvel Comics)|Cat-Man]], [[Frog-Man (Ani-Men)|Frog-Man]]) were recruited by a man named the Organizer.  The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration.  Daredevil defeated them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.  Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man formed a team called the "Unholy Three" and worked with the [[Death-Stalker|Exterminator]].<ref>Daredevil #39</ref>

Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoined the Ani-Men, and the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]].  Nefaria also recruited a new member for the group, [[Dragonfly (Marvel Comics)|Dragonfly]].  Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwilling Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms, although eventually they reverted back to normal.

Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], however the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] had intended to kill Stark with a bomb, which killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>Iron Man #115</ref>

==The Exterminator Groups==
The Exterminator, who was now known as the Death-Stalker, sometime later recruited a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man.<ref>Daredevil #157</ref>  He sent the new Ani-Men to capture [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]].  The [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] defeated Bird-Man, and the Death-Stalker murdered Ape-Man and Cat-Man upon the completion of their mission.<ref>Daredevil #158</ref>


The Bird-Man was later murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] in the "Bar with No Name" incident.<ref>Captain America #319</ref>

==Servants of the High Evolutionary==
New group wearing the name Ani-Men she was created by the [[High Evolutionary]]  and she carried his orders out. The High Evolutionary dispatched the Animen to a laboratory operated by his former assistant Miles Warren (the [[Jackal]]) to clean up his files. After three weeks, the Animen were almost done with their cleanup and had spread a virus into all of Warren's files, but they were discovered by [[Scarlet Spider]]. When the High Evolutionary teleported the Animen back to Wundagore, the Scarlet Spider was accidentally brought with them, having stuck himself to Crushtacean with his webbing. 

Later, the Scarlet Spider joined members of the Cult of the Jackal in sneaking into the citadel of the High Evolutionary in an attempt to learn the truth about Warren's involvement with the High Evolutionary. The Animen came to face the cult members and Scarlet Spider, but the fight was brought to an end after the Scarlet Spider was able to learn the truth from the High Evolutionary. The High Evolutionary sent the Scarlet Spider home, but Crushtacean foolishly touched a ball of impact webbing the hero had left behind, covering himself and the other Animen with webbing, much to their embarrassment. 

Animen: [[Buzzard (comics)|Buzzard]], [[Crushtacean]], [[Flying Fox(comics)|Flying Fox]], [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], [[Spinneret (comics)|Spinneret]], first appearance in Scarlet Spider Unlimited#1 (November, 1995).  

==Fourth Lineup==
A new group of Ani-Men surfaced in [[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]] #1 (June 2005). This assemblage has no known connection to any prior incarnations. They attacked the Milwaukee Convention Center, holding humans responsible for their trangressions against the animal kingdom. This group consisted of Giraffe-Man, Great Horned Owl-Man, Pig-Man, and Rabbit-Woman.<ref>Great Lakes Avengers #1</ref>

==Civil War==
A new set of Ani-Men were among the many criminals hired by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] in an effort to take over the underworld while the Kingpin was incarcerated. Unbeknownst to them, [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] had tricked Iron Man into leading a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] unit to the warehouse where they were meeting, which Iron Man believed it to be the headquarters of [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers. Iron Man and the S.H.I.E.L.D. unit busted in, and a huge fight broke out. The battle resulted in arrests, injuries and death, but it is  unrevealed if any of those appiled to the new Ani-Men. 
The New Ani-Men: [[Ape-Man]], [[Bird-Man]], [[Cat-Man (Marvel Comics)|Cat-Man]], first appearance in [[Civil War: War Crimes]]. <ref>Civil War: War Crimes #1</ref>
