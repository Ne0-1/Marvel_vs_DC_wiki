The '''Runner''' is fictional character that appeared in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. He is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Runner is a traveler and explorer who has lived for billions of years. He seeks complete freedom and to see all there is to see. As such, he has spent his long life traveling across and experiencing the universe. He is regarded as one of the more pacifistic Elders. He once encountered [[Moondragon]] when she first left [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], years ago.<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #143</ref>

The Runner was one of the eleven [[Elders of the Universe|Elders]] who conspired against [[Galactus]] and battled the [[Silver Surfer]] in an attempt to gain power in a new, re-created universe.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #3-4</ref> He battled Galactus and the Silver Surfer,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> and was converted to energy for consumption by Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> However, along with the other four Elders that had been consumed by Galactus, the Runner caused Galactus "cosmic indigestion" from within until they were forced out of him by [[Master Order]] and [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #17</ref> The Runner was one of the four Elders who aided the Silver Surfer and Nova in helping Galactus to defeat the In-Betweener.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18</ref> Once that was done the five Elders used the five [[Infinity Gems]] they had retained to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #19</ref> Afterwards, the Runner kept the Space Gem, one of the Infinity Gems.

Later, the Runner visited Earth as part of a galaxy-wide project to find the fastest being in the galaxy. Over a long-running story arc in that series the Eternal [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] sought a means to achieve a speed to surpass the Runner. Eventually, the Runner sponsored a race between Earth-dwelling possessors of superhuman speed, including Makkari, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Whizzer (comics)#Stanley Stewart|Whizzer]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]], [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super-Sabre]], and [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]]. Ultimately, the Runner declared the extra-dimensional "Buried Alien" the winner, and took him to a "galactic marathon." (The issue ended by paying homage to the DC Universe's most famous Flash, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]],{{cn|date=November 2012}} who started the race later than all the other speedsters, but still won against all the other contestants with ease).<ref>''Quasar'' #17</ref>

Later, the Runner battled [[Thanos]], who sought to collect all of the Infinity Gems. Through the Infinity Gems, Thanos bypassed the Elder's immunity to aging. Thanos changed the Runner to an old man and then reverted him to infancy and took the Space Gem from him. Thanos used the infant Runner as a pawn in his conflict with the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]; Thanos gave the Runner to the Collector in exchange for the Reality Gem. When Thanos left, he restored the Runner back to adulthood; the Collector and the Runner then fought each other.<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #2</ref>

Sometime later, the Runner, as one of the seven fastest runners in the Milky Way Galaxy, took part in the Galactic Marathon. He came in second after Makkari (who had used a super-speed technique that left him stuck permanently in super-speed so he could only communicate with other super-fast beings such as the Runner himself). However, the judges discovered that one of the racers had cheated so they nullified the results and decided to stage a new race. The Runner was sure that he would be able to beat Makkari in the new race but his hopes were frustrated when Makkari decided that he didn't have to race anymore to prove himself.<ref>''Quasar'' #58</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Runner possesses the [[Power Primordial]], which consists of cosmic energies leftover from the [[Big Bang]] that still remain in the universe. The Runner possesses a cosmic-enhanced life force which grants him a variety of superhuman traits, including augmentation of his physical attributes and senses, a virtually immortal body, immunity to aging and disease, and imperviousness to conventional injury through regeneration of any injury. Also, the Runner can utilize his cosmic life force for a variety of effects, including the projection of powerful energy blasts from his head, the transformation and rearrangement of matter on a planetary scale. The Runner's body has developed to survive unaided in space with no need for food, air or water. He is virtually indestructible and his durability rivals that of the Silver Surfer. He has the ability to stimulate the pleasure centers of beings around him, allowing him to influence the emotions of others and causing them to "feel good" in his presence even if he has wronged or betrayed them; this attribute may not be under his conscious control.

He appears virtually immortal and immune to aging, disease, poison, and conventional injury. Due to the Grandmaster's machinations against [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], he was unable to die.

The Runner's primary ability is his speed. He can literally "run" several times faster-than-light speed under his own power by using only his legs.
