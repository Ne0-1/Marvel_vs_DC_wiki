The '''Runner''' is fictional character that appeared in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. He is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]].

The Runner has lived for billions of years.  He seeks complete freedom and to see all there is to see. As such, he has spent his long life traveling across and experiencing the universe.  He is regarded as one of the more pacifistic elders.

==Fictional character biography==
The Runner was among the Elders who conspired against [[Galactus]] and battled the [[Silver Surfer]] in an attempt to gain power in a new, re-created universe. When their plan was foiled he escaped with the Space Gem, one of the [[Infinity Gems]].

Later, he battled [[Thanos]], who sought to collect all of the Infinity Gems.  Through the Infinity Gems, Thanos bypassed the Elders' immunity to aging. The Runner was changed to an old man and then an infant.  Thanos gave the infant Runner to the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] in exchange for the Reality Gem. When Thanos left, he altered The Runner back to his normal form; the Collector and the Runner fought.

Later, during the [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] series, the Runner visited Earth as part of a galaxy-wide project to find the fastest being in the galaxy. (The issue ended with an homage to the DC Universe's most famous Flash, [[Barry Allen]], who started the race later than all the other speedsters, but still won against all the other contestants with ease). Over a long-running story arc in that series the Eternal [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] sought a means to achieve a speed to surpass the Runner.  Eventually, Makkari defeated the Runner in a race. This came at the cost of being stuck permanently in super-speed, where Makkari could only communicate with other superfast beings such as the Runner himself. The Runner had known of this superspeed technique but of course, had not utilized it himself.

==Powers and abilities==

The Runner possesses the [[Power Primordial]], cosmic energies leftover from the [[Big Bang]] that still remain in the universe. He can survive unaided in space with no need for food, air or water. The Runner's body has developed to survive space.  He is virtually indestructible and his durability rivals that of the Silver Surfer's.  He can also channel incredibly powerful blasts of energy from his head and influence the emotions of others.  Due to his influence over emotions others usually find themselves "liking" the Runner in his presence even if he has wronged or betrayed them.  

He appears virtually immortal and immune to aging, disease, poison, and conventional injury.

The Runner's primary ability is his speed.  He can literally "run" many times faster-than-light speed under his own power using only his legs.
