The '''Runner''' is fictional character that appeared in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]].

The Runner has lived for billions of years.  He seeks complete freedom and to see all there is to see.  As such, he has spent his long life traveling across and experiencing the universe.  He is regarded as one of the more pacifistic elders.

==Fictional character biography==
The Runner was among the Elders who conspired against [[Galactus]] and battled the [[Silver Surfer]].  When their plan was foiled he escaped with the Space Gem.

Later, he battled [[Thanos]], who sought to collect all of the [[Infinity Gems]].  Through the Infinity Gems, Thanos bypassed the Elders' immunity to ageing and aged the Runner to an old man and then an infant.  Thanos gave the infant Runner to the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] in exchange for the Reality Gem, but as he left he put the Runner back to normal who attacked the Collector.  

Later, the Runner visited Earth as part of a galaxy-wide project to find the fastest being in the galaxy during the [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] series.  Over a long-running story arc in that series the Eternal [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] sought a means to achieve a speed to surpass the Runner.  Eventually, Makkari ran against the Runner in a race and won, but at the cost of being stuck in super-speed where only other superfast beings like the Runner or beings with power over space and time could interact with him. This is why the Runner never utilizes the method Makkari used since it sacrificed everything for speed.

==Powers and abilities==

The Runner possesses the [[Power Primordial]], cosmic energies leftover from the [[Big Bang]] that still remain in the universe.

Like all elders, the Runner is completely immortal and immune to aging, disease, poison, and conventional injury.  He can survive in space unaided without food, air, or drink.  

The Runner's body has developed to survive space.  He is virtually indestructible and his durability rivals that of the Silver Surfer's.  He can also channel incredibly powerful blasts of energy from his head and influence the emotions of others.  Due to his influence over emotions others usually find themselves "liking" the Runner in his presence even if he has wronged or betrayed them.  

The Runner's primary ability is his speed.  He can literally "run" many times faster-than-light speed under his own power using only his legs.
