'''Devastator''' is a name used by two [[fictional character]]s appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

The first Devastator was [[Soviet]] officer Kirov Pterovna, who wore a suit of [[power armor]] designed by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]].  Gremlin was told by the State that his father, the [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], had been killed by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and the deformed super-scientist sought revenge.  During the battle, the Hulk caused the energy in the suit's gauntlets to feed back into the suit, destroying both suit and wearer.

The second Devastator was another unnamed Soviet officer, using a version of the Devastator suit re-built by Societ scientists using the Gremlin's notes (Gremlin had defected in the meantime).  This time, Devastator was defeated by Gremlin and two [[Spaceknights]] ([[Rom the Spaceknight|Rom]] and Starshine), and the satellite power source was destroyed.

The plans for the suit presumably remain a Soviet state secret, so future Devastators could return.

Unofficially, the [[Constructicons|Constructicon]] [[gestalt]] [[Constructicons|Devastator]] from [[Transformers series|The Transformers]] was also created Marvel (in comics and by Marvel Productions as a cartoon), making the third Marvel character to wear the name.

Another unrelated character called [[Devos the Devastator]] later fought the [[Fantastic Four]].

==Powers & abilities==
The Devastator power armor drew power from [[microwave]] energy beamed down from a [[satellite]] located in [[geosynchronous orbit]]; the satellite itself was protected by [[Electronic countermeasures|ECMs]] which rendered it invisible to conventional modes of detection.  The wearer of the Devastator powersuit could fly via boot-thrusters and generate devastating force blasts from the gauntlets.
