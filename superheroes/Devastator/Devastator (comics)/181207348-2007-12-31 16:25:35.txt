'''Devastator''' is a name used by two [[fictional character]]s appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Devastator (Kirov Petrovna)===
The first Devastator was [[Soviet]] officer, spy, and saboteur Kirov Petrovna, who wore a suit of [[power armor]] designed by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]].  Gremlin was told by the State that his father, the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]], had been killed by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and the deformed super-scientist sought revenge.  Petrovna infiltrated the [[Hulkbuster]] base in New Mexico, and smuggled in the Devastator suit. He attempted to destroy the base under his Soviet leader's orders. During the battle with the Hulk, the Hulk caused the energy in the suit's gauntlets to misdirect the microwave energy back into the suit, incinerating both suit and wearer.<ref>''Hulk'' #186</ref>

===Devastator (Soviet Super-Soldiers)===
The second Devastator was another unnamed Soviet officer, using a version of the Devastator suit re-built by Soviet scientists using the Gremlin's notes (Gremlin had defected in the meantime).  He was sent by the Soviet government along with the Soviet Super-Soldiers to Khystym to execute the Gremlin. This time, Devastator was defeated by Gremlin and two [[Spaceknights]] ([[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Starshine (comics)#Brandy Clark|Starshine]]), and his satellite power source was destroyed.<ref>''Rom'' #44-45</ref>

He was next seen battling the [[Dmitri Bukharin|Crimson Dynamo]] in a training exercise.<ref>''Iron Man'' #255</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Devastator power armor was designed by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]].  This full body armor is equipped with electronic devices which absorb microwave energy and can convert it for use as blasts of heat or concussive force. Its solar powered boot jets enable the wearer to fly at just under Mach 1, with range limited only by available light plus 3 hour battery reserve. The gauntlets contain microwave projectors that generate devastating force blasts.

Because the battle-suit draws power from [[microwave]] energy beamed down from a [[satellite]] located in [[geosynchronous orbit]], the suit's wearer must maintain a line-of-sight position relative to the satellite to avoid sudden power cut-off. The satellite itself was protected by [[Electronic countermeasures|ECMs]] which rendered it invisible to conventional modes of detection.  

The second Devastator also possesses extensive hand-to-hand combat training, while the original possessed limited hand-to-hand combat training.

==Transformers character==
Unofficially, the [[Constructicons|Constructicon]] [[gestalt]] [[Constructicons|Devastator]] from The [[Transformers series|Transformers]] was also created Marvel (in comics and by Marvel Productions as a cartoon), making the third Marvel character to wear the name.
