==Fictional character biography==
Arnim Zola was a [[Swiss]] [[biochemist]] during [[World War II]] who became one of the first human [[genetic engineer]]s in history after finding papers and equipment used by the offshoot race of humanity known as the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. He finds a ready home among the [[Nazi]] party, who see his experiments as a means to ensure the existence of the Master Race.

One of his first accomplishments is the creation of a brain pattern imprinting device, which allows a person's mental essence to be projected into a cloned brain. Zola uses this machine on [[Adolf Hitler]], creating the [[Hate-Monger]].<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' #9 - 11</ref>

The [[Red Skull]] also financed some of Zola's experiments, allowing him to produce such creations as [[Primus (Marvel Comics)|Primus]], [[Doughboy (comics)|Doughboy]], and [[Man-Fish]].<ref>''Captain America'' #209 (May 1977)</ref>
During one such experiment Zola collects humans from the rubble of [[New York City]] after the devastation caused by the being known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Zola endows a teenager with superpowers, creating the hero known as [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], who is eventually stopped by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts #1-4</ref> Zola also collected DNA samples of [[Captain America]] at the time when the Skull's body began to age rapidly,<ref>''Captain America'' #293-300</ref> and used this template to create a new body for his ally.<ref>''Captain America'' #350</ref>

As part of another experiment, he collects the DNA of [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] I, [[Uncle Ben|Ben]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]], [[Bird-Man]] II, [[Bucky]], [[List of Marvel Comics characters: C#Cheetah|Cheetah]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]], [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] I, [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] I, [[Red Raven (Marvel Comics)|Red Raven]], [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], 5 of the [[Salem's Seven]], [[Turner D. Century]], and [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] and then uses them to create Proto-Husks that are destroyed by Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #0</ref>

A copy of Zola, who had been impersonating [[Brian Braddock]]'s mentor Professor Walsh, dies at [[Meggan]]'s hands.<ref>''Excalibur'' v.1 #36</ref>

During the ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]'' storyline, Arnim Zola was among the nine supervillain geniuses recruited by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].<ref>''X-Men: Endangered Species'' #1</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]], Zola joins the [[Red Skull]] in his newest attempt to kill Captain America, which succeeds. Afterwards, while the Skull is busy with his plans to control America with a puppet government, Zola attempts to reverse-engineer a mysterious device given to him by [[Doctor Doom]], as well as craft a device that will separate the Skull's consciousness from the mind of [[Aleksander Lukin]], which was the result of misuse of the [[Cosmic Cube]]. He manages to unlock the device's secrets and has a brainwashed [[Sharon Carter]] hooked up to it. However, she breaks off the connection, just as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents storm the base. Zola quickly transfers the Skull out of Lukin but his body is destroyed by the [[Grand Director]]. The Skull is stuck in one of Zola's robot bodies.<ref>''Captain America'' vol 5 #25-42</ref>

Stuck in a computer somewhere, Zola is located by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. He informs Osborn, the current director of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], that Captain America is locked in space and time on the date of his supposed death. Doom's machine was meant to bring him back for an unknown purpose but because of Sharon, he has become unstuck in time, causing him to relive the events of World War II.<ref>''Captain America'' #600</ref> By the time Zola rebuilds the machine in Castle Doom, Sharon Carter is brought to him so that he can transfer the Red Skull's mind into her body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref>

Eventually, [[Captain America]] finds Zola hiding in an alternate dimension, Dimension Z, where time moves at faster rate than on Earth.  There Zola has built a massive fortress where he is making a massive army of genetically altered soldiers with the intent of conquering Earth. In the initial assault, Cap rescues a genetically engineered infant boy (Zola's son, Leopold). In the decade stranded in Dimension Z, Cap raises the boy as his own son, Ian. The two take up with the peaceful Phrox, and eventually lead a rebellion to stop Zola's forces, now commanded by Zola's daughter, Jet Black. Ian is later captured by Zola, and brainwashed to accept Zola as his father again, but eventually breaks out of his control, only to be shot by [[Sharon Carter]]. Eventually, Carter sacrifices herself to destroy Zola and his fortress, allowing Cap and a now reformed Jet to escape back to Earth, where only seconds have passed since his arrival in Dimension Z.<ref>Captain America v7 #1-10</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Red Skull tells Arnim Zola that everything is in place on his end. Zola is confronted by his daughter Jet Zola who refuses to return to her father's side. Falcon sneak attacks Zola. Ian finds and frees Sharon Carter, only to learn that Zola has a bomb strong enough to destroy all of New York City. Falcon removes the telepathic antenna on Zola's body to stop him from controlling the bomb, but it only sets it to activate. Falcon takes the bomb high into the sky above New York before it goes off.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 7 #24</ref>

===Arnim Zola 4.2.3===
A flawed copy of Arnim Zola's consciousness in a robot body is recruited by the [[Shadow Council]]. He faces the [[Secret Avengers]] who are investigating the Shadow Council's mining operations inside of a "bad continuum" (a malformed reality). Although he is defeated by the Secret Avengers, his fate afterwards is unknown.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arnim Zola has no natural superpowers, but he is a scientific genius and biochemist specializing in genetics and cloning. He is not only capable of creating exact clone copies of his "clients". He has also created monsters which are conditioned to do his bidding.

Zola's most noticeable feat was performed upon himself. He constructed a specially-modified robot body which lacks a head. Instead, Zola's face is located via holographic projection on his chest. Atop his shoulders is an ESP Box, a psychotronic device which he uses to exert his control over his monster creations. The ESP Box grants Arnim Zola with a mind-control ability, a mind ray, and a mind transfer ability. In a limited effect, the Box can also be used as an offensive weapon. Whenever his body is damaged or utterly destroyed, Arnim is able to send his personality to another one stored elsewhere, thus giving himself a form of [[immortality]].<ref>''Captain America'' #38 (2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
In 2007 Arnim Zola appeared in ''Ultimates'' Annual # 2, written by [[Charlie Huston]]. Just like his [[Earth-616]] incarnation he was also a Nazi biochemist. His role in [[World War II]] was to make a cadre of special [[master race]] troops so as to serve as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s bodyguards.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2">''Ultimates'' Annual # 2 (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Captain America#Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] was able to infiltrate Arnim Zola's facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed "Siegsoldat" ("Victory soldier"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/> Zola did not die and the [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war [[supersoldier|super soldier]] program. Later they mapped his brain and created an [[artificial intelligence]] out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

A short time before the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] attacked the United States,<ref>[[Millar, Mark]] (w), [[Hitch, Bryan]] (p). ''The Ultimates 2'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> a white survivalist group called the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole it, along with some other weaponry. Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the Marauders to allow Zola to commence experiments on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest and was called Uber-Siegsoldat. He then took over the Marauders and got them to gather people for his experiments. Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]] were sent after him and were able to defeat him by freeing the people he had kidnapped, who promptly tore apart his body, whereupon Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

A young, apparently fully human named Arnim Zola III appeared in ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'', as a member of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s brain trust.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

* Arnim Zola appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy", voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. During World War II, Zola was a member of HYDRA where he fought Captain America and Whizzer. In the present, he is the source behind the hacking of [[Amadeus Cho]]'s Iron Spider armor. When Spider-Man and Iron Spider accidentally leave his cell open at the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], Zola's robot body activates. The next day, Zola tricks Iron Spider into bringing the ESP Box to him, allowing Zola to reassemble his body. While tracing Arnim Zola, Spider-Man and Iron Spider bring Agent Venom and Power Man to the Triskelion's underground laboratory where Zola unleashes his synthezoid army. In the nick of time, Robert Frank ([[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|the Whizzer]]) arrives to help. Whizzer tells the heroes to target Zola's ESP box. This causes Zola to lose control of the synthezoids, and the laboratory to explode. 
** Zola returns in the episode "Attack of the Synthezoids", in which he replaces S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy staff and students at the Triskelion with Synthezoids, leaving only Spider-Man, Cloak, Agent Venom, and Rhino to fight. After most of the Synthezoids are defeated, Cloak tracks Dagger to the Tri-Carrier where Arnim Zola has the real agents.  Zola then uses the Tri-Carrier to launch missiles which destroy the Triskelion as Spider-Man leads Cloak, Agent Venom, and Rhino into going after the Tri-Carrier.
* Armin Zola appears in the  Marvel Cinematic Universe series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' with [[Toby Jones]] reprising his role from the films. At the end of the episode "Valediction", [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Johann Fennhoff]] (who has a special device that is keeping his mouth shut) is placed in a prison cell where he meets his cellmate Arnim Zola. Zola mentions being a fan of Fennhoff's work while giving him a pencil and paper so they might collaborate, telling him the advantages of the American justice system.

===Film===
[[File:Toby Jones as Arnim Zola.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Toby Jones]] as Arnim Zola in the 2011 film, ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''.]]
* [[Toby Jones]] portrays Arnim Zola in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] movie series produced by [[Marvel Studios]].
** First appearing in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', Zola is a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] scientist who helped the [[Red Skull]] harness the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]'s power. Later captured by Captain America, Zola is forced to reveal the location of the Red Skull's base to Colonel Chester Phillips.
** As revealed in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Zola took advantage of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Operation Paperclip]] to create a new incarnation of Hydra that slowly takes over the organization from within. Having also experimented on Bucky previously, Zola personally oversees the young man's transformation into the Winter Soldier. Suffering a terminal illness in 1972, Zola had his consciousness transferred into a 1970s era supercomputer located in a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. facility in New Jersey. From there, Zola masterminded S.H.I.E.L.D./Hydra's "Project Insight" as a means to identify and target potential threats to Hydra's interests. Zola reveals all of this to Captain America and Black Widow when they find the supercomputer housing his consciousness, stalling them in a sacrificial attempt to kill them with a missile sent by his Hydra allies. The apparent destruction of Zola's host supercomputer is ultimately meaningless when Captain America and his allies foil "Project Insight" and expose Hydra within S.H.I.E.L.D., effectively leading to the agency's downfall.
