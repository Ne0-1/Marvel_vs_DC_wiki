==Fictional character biography==
Arnim Zola was a [[biochemist]] during [[World War II]] who became one of the first human [[genetic engineer]]s in history after finding papers and equipment used by the offshoot race of humanity, the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. He finds a ready home among the [[Nazi]] party, who see his actions as the ability to ensure the existence of a master race.

One of his first accomplishments is the creation of a brain pattern imprinting device, which allows a person's mental essence to be projected into a cloned brain. Zola uses this machine on [[Adolf Hitler]], creating the [[Hate-Monger]].<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' #9 - 11</ref>

The [[Red Skull]] also financed some of Zola's experiments, allowing Zola to produce such creations as [[Primus (Marvel Comics)|Primus]], [[Doughboy (comics)|Doughboy]], and [[Man-Fish]] in the [[jungle]]s of [[Central America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #209 (May 1977)</ref>
During one such experiment Zola collected humans from the rubble of [[New York City]] after the devastation caused by the being known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Zola endowed a teenager with superpowers, creating the hero known as [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], who brought the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to stop him.<ref>''Thunderbolts #1-4</ref>

As part of another experiment, he collected the DNA of [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] I, [[Uncle Ben|Ben]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]], [[Bird-Man]] II, [[Bucky]], [[Cheetah (Marvel Comics)|Cheetah]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]], [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] I, [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] I, [[Red Raven]], [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], 5 of the [[Salem's Seven]], [[Turner D. Century]], and [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] and then used them to create Proto-Husks that were destroyed by Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #0</ref>

A copy of Zola, who had been impersonating a Professor Walsh who was [[Brian Braddock]]'s mentor, dies at [[Meggan]]'s hands.<ref>''Excalibur'' v.1 #36</ref>

During the ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]'' storyline, Arnim Zola was among the nine supervillain geniuses recruited by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].<ref>''X-Men: Endangered Species'' #1</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]], Zola joins the [[Red Skull]] in his newest attempt to kill Captain America, which succeeds. Afterwards, while the Skull is busy with his plans to control America with a puppet government, Zola attempts to reverse-engineer a mysterious device given to him by [[Doctor Doom]], as well as craft a device that will separate the Skull's consciousness from the mind of [[Aleksander Lukin]], which was the result of misuse of the [[Cosmic Cube]]. He manages to unlock the device's secrets and has a brainwashed [[Sharon Carter]] hooked up to it. However, she breaks off the connection, just as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agents storm the base. Zola quickly transfers the Skull out of Lukin but his body is destroyed by the [[Grand Director]]. The Skull is stuck in one of Zola's robot bodies.<ref>''Captain America'' vol 5 #25-42</ref>

Stuck in a computer somewhere, Zola is located by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. He informs Osborn, the current director of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], that Captain America is locked in space and time on the date of his supposed death. Doom's machine was meant to bring him back for an unknown purpose but because of Sharon, he has become unstuck in time, causing him to relive the events of World War II.<ref>''Captain America'' #600</ref> By the time Arnim Zola had rebuilt the machine in Castle Doom, Sharon Carter was brought to him so that he could transfer the Red Skull's mind into her body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref>

===Dimension Z===
Eventually, [[Captain America]] finds Zola hiding in an alternate dimension, Dimension Z, where time moves at an incredibly faster rate as compared to Earth, and Zola has built a massive fortress where he is making a massive army of genetically altered soldiers with the intent of conquering Earth. In the initial assault, Cap rescues a genetically engineered infant boy (Zola's son, Leopold).  In the decade stranded in Dimension Z, Cap raises the boy as his own son, Ian. The two take up with the peaceful Phrox, and eventually lead a rebellion to stop Zola's forces, now commanded by Zola's daughter, Jet Black. Ian is later captured by Zola, and brainwashed to accept Zola as his father again, but eventually broke out of his control, only to be shot by [[Sharon Carter]]. Eventually, Carter sacrifices herself to destroy Zola and his fortress, allowing Cap and a now reformed Jet to escape back to Earth, where relatively only seconds have passed since his arrival in Dimension Z a decade earlier.<ref>Captain America v7 #1-10</ref>

===Arnim Zola 4.2.3===
A flawed copy of Arnim Zola's consciousness in a robot body is recruited by the [[Shadow Council]]. He faces the [[Secret Avengers]] who are investigating the Shadow Council's mining operations inside of a "bad continuum" (a malformed reality). Although he is defeated by the Secret Avengers, his fate afterwards is unknown.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arnim Zola has no natural superpowers, but he is a scientific genius specializing in genetics and cloning. He is not only capable of creating exact clone copies of his "clients", he has also created monsters which are conditioned to do his bidding.

Zola's most noticeable feat was performed upon himself. He constructed a specially modified body which lacks a head. Instead, Zola's face is located—via holographic projection—on his chest, and atop his shoulders is an ESP Box, a [[psychotronic (mind control)|psychotronic]] device which he uses to exert his control over his monster creations. In a limited effect, the Box can also be used as an offensive weapon.

Whenever his body is damaged, or utterly destroyed, Arnim is able to send his personality to another one stored elsewhere, thus giving himself a form of [[immortality]].<ref>''Captain America'' #38 (2008)</ref>

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
Arnim Zola appeared in the second Annual of [[the Ultimates]] written by [[Charlie Huston]]. Just like his [[Earth-616]] incarnation he was also a Nazi biochemist. His role in [[World War II]] was to make a cadre of special [[master race]] troops so as to serve as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s bodyguards.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2">''Ultimates'' Annual # 2 (2007)</ref> [[Captain America#Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] was able to infiltrate Arnim Zola's facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed "Siegsoldat" ("Victory soldier"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2" /> Zola did not die and the [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war [[supersoldier|super soldier]] program. Later they mapped his brain and created an [[artificial intelligence]] out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2" />

A short time before the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] attacked the United States,<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #9</ref> a white survivalist group called the "[[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole it, along with some other weaponry. Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the "Marauders" to allow Zola to commence experiments on him.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2" /> Zola mutated the man until he was approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest and was called "Uber-Siegsoldat". He then took over the "[[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]" and got them to gather people for his experiments.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2" /> Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]] were sent after him and were able to defeat him by freeing the people he had kidnapped, who promptly tore apart his body, whereupon Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2" />

A young, apparently fully human "Arnim Zola III" appeared in [[Ultimate Mystery]], as a member of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s brain trust.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #3</ref><ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #4</ref>
