==Fictional character biography==
Arnim Zola was a [[biochemist]] during [[World War II]] who became one of the first human [[genetic engineer]]s in history after finding papers and equipment used by the offshoot race of humanity, the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. He found a ready home among the [[Nazi]] party, who saw his actions as the ability to ensure the existence of a master race.

One of his first accomplishments was the creation of a brain pattern imprinting device, which would allow someone's mental essence to be projected into a cloned brain. Zola presented such a gift to [[Adolf Hitler]], creating the [[Hate-Monger]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Zola also used these skills to form a new body for himself, surviving through the war and into modern times.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

The [[Red Skull]] also financed some of Zola's experiments, allowing Zola to produce such creations as [[Primus (Marvel Comics)|Primus]],{{Issue|date=November 2009}} [[Doughboy (comics)|Doughboy]],{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and [[Man-Fish]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}} This association led to Zola's first confrontation with Captain America in the [[jungle]]s of [[Central America]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Zola has since continued his experiments at various times and locations around the globe. Often, his crimes against humanity bring him into conflict with various heroes, from Captain America to [[Deadpool]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

During one such experiment Zola collected humans from the rubble of [[New York City]] after the devastation caused by the being known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Zola endowed a teenager with superpowers, creating the hero known as [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]],{{Issue|date=November 2009}} who brought the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to stop him.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

As part of another experiment, he collected the DNAs of [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] I, [[Uncle Ben|Ben]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]], [[Bird-Man]] II, [[Bucky]], [[Cheetah (Marvel Comics)|Cheetah]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]], [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] I, [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] I, [[Red Raven]], [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], 5 of the [[Salem's Seven]], [[Turner D. Century]], and [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] and then used them to create Proto-Husks that were destroyed by Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #0</ref>

During the ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]'' storyline, Arnim Zola was among the 9 supervillain geniuses recruited by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

In the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]], Zola joined the [[Red Skull]] in his newest attempt to kill Captain America, which succeeds.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Afterwards, while the Skull is busy in his plans on controlling America with a puppet government, Zola attempted to reverse-engineer a mysterious device given by [[Doctor Doom]], as well as craft a device that will separate the Skull's consciousness from the mind of [[Aleksander Lukin]], which was the result of misuse of the [[Cosmic Cube]]. He manages to unlock the device's secrets and had a brainwashed [[Sharon Carter]] hooked up to it. However, she breaks off the connection, just as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agents storm the base. Zola quickly transfers the Skull out of Lukin but his current body was destroyed by the [[Grand Director]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Currently, the Skull is stuck in one of Zola's robot bodies.

Stuck in a computer somewhere, Zola is located by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. He informs the current director of H.A.M.M.E.R. that Captain America was really locked in space and time on the date of his supposed death. Doom's machine was meant to bring him back for an unknown purpose but because of Sharon, he had become unstuck in time, causing him to relive the events of World War II.<ref>''Captain America'' #600</ref> By the time Arnim Zola had rebuilt the machine in Castle Doom, Sharon Carter was brought to him so that he could transfer the Red Skull's mind into her body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref>

===Arnim Zola 4.2.3===
A flawed copy of Arnim Zola's consciousness in a robot body was recruited by the Shadow Council. He faced the [[Secret Avengers]] who were investigating the Shadow Council's mining operations inside of a bad continuum (a malformed reality). Although he was defeated by the Secret Avengers, his fate afterwards is unknown.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arnim Zola has no natural superpowers, but he is a scientific genius specializing in genetics and cloning. He is not only capable of creating exact clone copies of his "clients", he has also created monsters which are conditioned to do his bidding.

Zola's most noticeable feat, however, was performed upon himself. He has constructed a specially modified body which lacks a head. Instead, Zola's face is located - via holographic projection - on his chest, and atop his shoulders is an ESP Box, a [[psychotronic]] device which he uses to exert his control over his monster creations. In a limited effect, the Box can also be used as an offensive weapon.

Whenever his current body is damaged, or utterly destroyed, Arnim is able to send his personality to another one stored elsewhere, thus giving himself a form of [[immortality]].<ref>''Captain America'' #38 (2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Arnim Zola===
Arnim Zola recently appeared in the second Annual of [[the Ultimates]] written by [[Charlie Huston]]. Just like his [[Earth-616]] incarnation he was also a Nazi biochemist. His role in [[World War II]] was to make a cadre of special [[master race]] troops so as to serve as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s bodyguards.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2">''Ultimates'' Annual # 2 (2007)</ref>

[[Captain America#Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] was able to infiltrate Arnim Zola's facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed "Siegsoldat" ("Victory soldier"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

However Arnim Zola did not die and the [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war [[supersoldier|super soldier]] program. Later they mapped his brain and created an [[artificial intelligence]] out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

A short time before the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] attacked the United States,<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #9</ref> a white survivalist group called the "Marauders" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole it, along with some other weaponry. Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the "Marauders" to allow Zola to commence experiments on him.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

Zola mutated the man until he was approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest and was called "Uber-Siegsoldat". He then took over the "[[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]" and got them to gather people for his experiments.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]] were sent after him and were able to defeat him by freeing the people he had kidnapped, who promptly tore apart his body, whereupon Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

A young, apparently fully human "Arnim Zola III" appeared in [[Ultimate Mystery]], as a member of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s brain trust.<ref> ''Ultimate Mystery'' #3</ref><ref> ''Ultimate Mystery'' #4</ref>

===Film===
[[File:Toby Jones as Arnim Zola.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Toby Jones]] as Arnim Zola as depicted in the 2011 film, ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''.]]
* Arnim Zola appears in the television film ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (film)|Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' portrayed by [[Peter Haworth]]. He appears as Dr. Arnim Zola, an elderly wheelchair-bound [[HYDRA]] chemist responsible for the creation of the Death's Head virus.
* Arnim Zola appears in the film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', portrayed by [[Toby Jones]]. Zola is a Nazi scientist who works with the [[Red Skull]] to harness the [[Cosmic Cube]]'s power (known in the film as the [[Tesseract]]). When HYDRA was organized he became his second in command and personal scientist. After HYDRA forces found the Cube, Schmidt asked Zola if he could study its power, and he accidentally discovered how to transform its energy into advanced laser ammunitions. He designed advanced weapons for HYDRA when they became separated from Nazi Germany and was valued enough by the Red Skull to help him escape by giving the scientist access to his personal automobile when Captain America raided the base, thus enabling Zola to also deliver it to safety in the process. He later staged an ambush for Captain America and the Howling Commandos onboard a train, in which Bucky lost his life, but was eventually captured and interrogated by Chester Phillips, Phillips noting that his lack of the cyanide pills normally used by HYDRA agents to prevent capture suggested that he did not want to die personally. In exchange for sanctuary after Phillips sent a fake letter confirming that he had provided the Allies with information, Zola told them everything he knew about HYDRA and revealed that Red Skull's plans were of world domination. The character's first appearance in the film is a close-up of his face on an old-style television screen, evoking his comic-book counterpart and at 1:03:37 when Zola is gathering his papers to escape the factory, the blueprints for Dr. Zola's android body can be seen in the film.

===Video games===
* Arnim Zola appears as a villain in the video game ''[[Captain America: Super Soldier]]'' voiced by [[André Sogliuzzo]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Reilly |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/112/1125597p1.html#ixzz11WLb93H2 |title=Captain America: Super Soldier Announced |publisher=Xbox 360 IGN |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> When Captain America is apprehended by Iron Cross following his fight with Baron Strucker, Arnim Zola and Madame Hydra end up extracting some of Captain America's blood so that Arnim Zola can recreate the Super Soldier Serum with it. Later on, Captain America encounters one of Arnim Zola's robots where Arnim Zola speaks through it stating that he will kill Captain America, drain his corpse of his blood, and use it in order to make Montgomery Falsworth his pawn. All of Arnim Zola's robots are destroyed by Captain America, and the small amount of super-soldier serum he has managed to create from prior analysis of Captain America's blood is destroyed. In the post-credits, Arnim Zola comes across one of his robots. Red Skull tells Arnim Zola to stop wasting time on his failed experiments and to get back to work for they will see Captain America again.
