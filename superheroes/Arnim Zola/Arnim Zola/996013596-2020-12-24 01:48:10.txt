'''Arnim Zola''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a master of [[biochemistry]] and is an enemy of [[Captain America]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #208 (April 1977), created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=436}}</ref> He was originally a Nazi biochemist during [[World War II]] and survived into the modern age by transferring his conscious mind into the body of a sophisticated robot which protected it by storing it in its chest and displaying a digital image of Zola's face on its chest plate.

Arnim Zola was a biochemist during World War II, experimenting with genetic engineering. His skills as a geneticist drew the attention of the [[Red Skull]] who used him in an attempt to create super soldiers. One of his experiments led to the brain of [[Adolf Hitler]] being copied into a being later known as [[Hate-Monger]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=9}}</ref> In order to survive the end of World War II Zola managed to transfer his mind into a robot body and later enabled his mind to survive by uploading itself to various networks as the robotic body was destroyed.

Arnim Zola has appeared in television animations and live-action movies. [[Toby Jones]] portrayed the character in the Captain America films ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014) set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Arnim Zola was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[biochemist]] during [[World War II]] who became one of the first human [[genetic engineer]]s in history after finding papers and equipment used by the offshoot race of humanity known as the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. He finds a ready home among the [[Nazi Party]], who see his experiments as a means to ensure the existence of the Master Race.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=179}}</ref>

One of his first accomplishments is the creation of a brain pattern imprinting device, which allows a person's mental essence to be projected into a cloned brain. Zola uses this machine on [[Adolf Hitler]], creating the [[Hate-Monger]]. Zola was later approached by [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] into taking part in the establishment of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #9 - 11. Marvel Comics..</ref>

The [[Red Skull]] also financed some of Zola's experiments, allowing him to produce such creations as [[Primus (Marvel Comics)|Primus]], [[Doughboy (comics)|Doughboy]], and [[Man-Fish]].<ref>''Captain America'' #209 (May 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> During one such experiment, Zola collects humans from the rubble of [[New York City]] after the devastation caused by the being known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Zola endows a teenager with superpowers, creating the hero known as [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], who is eventually stopped by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zola also collected DNA samples of [[Captain America]] at the time when Red Skull's body began to age rapidly,<ref>''Captain America'' #293-300. Marvel Comics.</ref> and used this template to create a new body for his ally.<ref>''Captain America'' #350. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of another experiment, he collects the DNA of multiple superpowered individuals and uses it to create Proto-Husks that are destroyed by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A copy of Zola, who had been impersonating [[Brian Braddock]]'s mentor Professor Walsh, dies at [[Meggan]]'s hands.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]" storyline, Arnim Zola was among the nine supervillain geniuses recruited by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].<ref>''X-Men: Endangered Species'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]], Zola joins the [[Red Skull]] in his newest attempt to kill Captain America, which succeeds. Afterwards, while Red Skull is busy with his plans to control America with a puppet government, Zola attempts to reverse-engineer a mysterious device given to him by [[Doctor Doom]], as well as craft a device that will separate the Skull's consciousness from the mind of [[Aleksander Lukin]], which was the result of misuse of the [[Cosmic Cube]]. He manages to unlock the device's secrets and has a brainwashed [[Sharon Carter]] hooked up to it. However, she breaks off the connection, just as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents storm the base. Zola quickly transfers Red Skull out of Lukin but his body is destroyed by the [[Grand Director]]. Red Skull is stuck in one of Zola's robot bodies.<ref>''Captain America'' vol 5 #25-42. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Stuck in a computer somewhere during the "Captain America: Reborn" part of the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Zola is located by [[Norman Osborn]]. He informs the current director of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] that Captain America is locked in space and time on the date of his supposed death. Doom's machine was meant to bring him back for an unknown purpose but because of Sharon, he has become unstuck in time, causing him to relive the events of World War II.<ref>''Captain America'' #600. Marvel Comics.</ref> By the time Zola rebuilds the machine in Castle Doom, Sharon Carter is brought to him so that he can transfer the Red Skull's mind into her body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually, [[Captain America]] finds Zola hiding in an alternate dimension, Dimension Z, where time moves at faster rate than on Earth. There. Zola has built a massive fortress where he is making a massive army of genetically altered soldiers with the intent of conquering Earth. In the initial assault, Cap rescues a genetically engineered infant boy (Zola's son, Leopold). In the decade stranded in Dimension Z, Cap raises the boy as his own son, Ian. The two take up with the peaceful Phrox, and eventually lead a rebellion to stop Zola's forces, now commanded by Zola's daughter, Jet Black. Ian is later captured by Zola, and brainwashed to accept Zola as his father again, but eventually breaks out of his control, only to be shot by [[Sharon Carter]]. Eventually, Carter sacrifices herself to destroy Zola and his fortress, allowing Cap and a now reformed Jet to escape back to Earth, where only seconds have passed since his arrival in Dimension Z.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 7 #1-10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Red Skull tells Arnim Zola that everything is in place on his end. Zola is confronted by his daughter Jet Zola who refuses to return to her father's side. Falcon sneak attacks Zola. Ian finds and frees Sharon Carter, only to learn that Zola has a bomb strong enough to destroy all of New York City. Falcon removes the telepathic antenna on Zola's body to stop him from controlling the bomb, but it only sets the bomb to activate. Falcon takes the bomb high into the sky above New York before it goes off.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 7 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon the Unvengers being defeated, Arnim Zola fled with Jet Zola.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 7 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Arnim Zola later appears as a member of Hydra's High Council at the time when Captain America had previously been brainwashed by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[Kobik]] to be a Hydra sleeper agent.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Otto Octavius' mind in the Proto-Clone's body returns to one of his old bases only to find it is being occupied by Hydra following the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, he defeats the Hydra soldiers when Arnim Zola appears to recruit him into Hydra. Zola grants him the leadership of some Hydra soldiers to work for him in arranging the destruction of Parker Industries.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Arnim Zola was present with Hydra's High Council as Hydra takes over the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later revealed that Arnim Zola was behind the A.I. Virus that is controlling [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] to be a part of Hydra's Avengers. As the Hydra Helicarriers attack the hideout of the Underground, Arnim Zola mentions that their attacks won't bring down their defenses. Captain America states that they will unleash their secret weapon. Arnim Zola tells Captain America that their subject in the vault is awake but disoriented and that the procedure they did on him is temporary as his condition will degrade quickly. After brushing off Arnim Zola's concerns, Captain America states that they only need their subject for a short time to bring the Underground down. When the vault opens, it is revealed that the person they are talking about that is a somehow-revived Bruce Banner.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Arnim Zola and some Hydra agents locate Superior Octopus' hideout in order to get him to return to Hydra and help rebuild it. When Superior Octopus states that he upheld his bargain with Hydra, Arnim Zola states that one "leaves" Hydra when he dies. Upon taking down the Hydra agents, Superior Octopus is then attacked by a bio-duplicate of Gorgon that Arnim Zola created. When Gorgon's blindfold falls off, Superior Octopus is turned to stone by his petrifying stare. Under Arnim Zola's orders, the bio-duplicate of Gorgon shatters the petrified Superior Octopus. Just then, the bio-duplicate of Gorgon is beheaded by Superior Octopus who revealed that Arnim Zola is not the only one who is an expert at cloning. After dismantling Arnim Zola, Superior Octopus has him carry a message to the rest of Hydra stating that he rejects their offer and that anyone who comes after him will receive similar "treatment."<ref>''Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Arnim Zola 4.2.3===
A flawed copy of Arnim Zola's consciousness in a robot body is recruited by the [[Shadow Council]]. He faces the [[Secret Avengers]] who are investigating the Shadow Council's mining operations inside of a "bad continuum" (a malformed reality). Although he is defeated by the Secret Avengers, his fate afterwards is unknown.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arnim Zola has no natural superpowers, but he is a scientific genius and biochemist specializing in genetics and cloning. He is not only capable of creating exact clone copies of his "clients", he has also created monsters which are conditioned to do his bidding.

Zola's most noticeable feat was performed upon himself. He constructed a specially modified android body which lacks a head. Instead, Zola's face is located via holographic projection on his chest. Atop his shoulders is an ESP Box, a psychotronic device which he uses to exert his control over his monster creations. The ESP Box also lets Arnim Zola gain mental control over others, fire mental blasts, and transfer his consciousness into another android body. In a limited effect, the Box can also be used as an offensive weapon. Whenever his body is damaged or utterly destroyed, Arnim is able to send his personality to another one stored elsewhere, thus giving himself a form of [[immortality]].<ref>''Captain America'' #38 (2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Arnim Zola appeared in ''[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimates]]'' Annual #2, written by [[Charlie Huston]]. Just like his [[Earth-616]] incarnation he was also a Nazi biochemist.

Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] was able to infiltrate Arnim Zola's facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed "Siegsoldat" ("Victory soldier"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/> Zola did not die and the [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war [[supersoldier|super soldier]] program. Later they mapped his brain and created an [[artificial intelligence]] out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/> A short time after the Liberators attacked the United States,<ref>[[Millar, Mark]] (w), [[Hitch, Bryan]] (p). ''The Ultimates 2'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> a white survivalist group called the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] attacked the military base where Zola's AI was being held and stole it, along with some other weaponry. Zola was then able to convince the leader of the Marauders to allow Zola to commence experiments on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest and was called Uber-Siegsoldat. He then took over the Marauders and got them to gather people for his experiments. Captain America and Falcon were sent after him and were able to defeat him by freeing the people he had kidnapped, who promptly tore apart his body, whereupon Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2"/>
