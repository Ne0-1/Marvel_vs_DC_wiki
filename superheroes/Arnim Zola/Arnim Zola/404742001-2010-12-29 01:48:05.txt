==Fictional character biography==
Arnim Zola was a [[biochemist]] during [[World War II]] who became one of the first human [[genetic engineer]]s in history after finding papers and equipment used by the offshoot race of humanity, the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. He found a ready home among the [[Nazi]] party, who saw his actions as the ability to ensure the existence of a master race.

One of his first accomplishments was the creation of a brain pattern imprinting device, which would allow someone's mental essence to be projected into a cloned brain. Zola presented such a gift to [[Adolf Hitler]], creating the [[Hate-Monger]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Zola also used these skills to form a new body for himself, surviving through the war and into modern times.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

The [[Red Skull]] also financed some of Zola's experiments, allowing Zola to produce such creations as [[Primus (comics)|Primus]],{{Issue|date=November 2009}} [[Doughboy (comics)|Doughboy]],{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and [[Man-Fish]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}} This association led to Zola's first confrontation with Captain America in the [[jungle]]s of [[Central America]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Zola has since continued his experiments at various times and locations around the globe. Often, his crimes against humanity bring him into conflict with various heroes, from Captain America to [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

During one such experiment Zola collected humans from the rubble of [[New York City]] after the devastation caused by the being known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Zola endowed a teenager with superpowers, creating the hero known as [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]],{{Issue|date=November 2009}} who brought the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to stop him.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

As part of another experiment, he collected the DNAs of [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] I, [[Uncle Ben|Ben]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]], [[Bird-Man]] II, [[Bucky]], [[Cheetah (Marvel Comics)|Cheetah]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]], [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] I, [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] I, [[Red Raven]], [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], 5 of the [[Salem's Seven]], [[Turner D. Century]], and [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] and then used them to create Proto-Husks that were destroyed by Deadpool.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Decimation===
Arnim Zola was among the 9 supervillain geniuses whose help [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] acquired to assist in reversing the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] in ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]''.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===The Death of Captain America===
In the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]], Zola joined the [[Red Skull]] in his newest attempt to kill Captain America, which succeeds.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Afterwards, while the Skull is busy in his plans on controlling America with a puppet government, Zola attempted to reverse-engineer a mysterious device given by [[Doctor Doom]], as well as craft a device that will separate the Skull's consciousness from the mind of [[Aleksander Lukin]], which was the result of misuse of the [[Cosmic Cube]]. He manages to unlock the device's secrets and had a brainwashed [[Sharon Carter]] hooked up to it. However, she breaks off the connection, just as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agents storm the base. Zola quickly transfers the Skull out of Lukin but his current body was destroyed by the [[Grand Director]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Currently, the Skull is stuck in one of Zola's robot bodies.

===Reborn===
Stuck in a computer somewhere, Zola is located by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. He informs the current director of H.A.M.M.E.R. that Captain America was really locked in space and time on the date of his supposed death. Doom's machine was meant to bring him back for an unknown purpose but because of Sharon, he had become unstuck in time, causing him to relive the events of World War II.<ref>''Captain America'' #600</ref> By the time Arnim Zola had rebuilt the machine in Castle Doom, Sharon Carter was brought to him so that he can transfer the Red Skull's mind into her body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arnim Zola has no natural superpowers, but he is a scientific genius specializing in genetics and cloning. He is not only capable of creating exact clone copies of his "clients", he has also created monsters which are conditioned to do his bidding.

Zola's most noticeable feat, however, was performed upon himself. He has constructed a specially modified body which lacks a head. Instead, Zola's face is located - via holographic projection - on his chest, and atop his shoulders is an ESP Box, a [[psychotronic]] device which he uses to exert his control over his monster creations. In a limited effect, the Box can also be used as an offensive weapon.

Whenever his current body is damaged, or utterly destroyed, Arnim is able to send his personality to another one stored elsewhere, thus giving himself a form of [[immortality]].<ref>''Captain America'' #38 (2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Arnim Zola===
Arnim Zola recently appeared in the second Annual of [[the Ultimates]] written by [[Charlie Huston]]. Just like his [[Earth-616]] incarnation he was also a Nazi biochemist. His role in [[World War II]] was to make a cadre of special [[master race]] troops so as to serve as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s bodyguards.<ref name="ultimate_annual_2">''Ultimates'' Annual # 2 (2007)</ref>

[[Captain America#Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] was able to infiltrate Arnim Zola's facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed "Siegsoldat" ("Victory soldier"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref  name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

However Arnim Zola did not die and the [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war [[supersoldier|super soldier]] program. Later they mapped his brain and created an [[artificial intelligence]] out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind.<ref  name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

A short time before the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] attacked the United States,<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #9</ref> a white survivalist group called the "Marauders" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole it, along with some other weaponry. Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the "Marauders" to allow Zola to commence experiments on him.<ref  name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

Zola mutated the man until he was approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest and was called "Uber-Siegsolsdat". He then took over the "[[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]" and got them to gather people for his experiments.<ref  name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]] were sent after him and were able to defeat him by freeing the people he had kidnapped, who promptly tore apart his body, whereupon Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI.<ref  name="ultimate_annual_2"/>

A young, apparently fully human "Arnim Zola III" appeared in [[Ultimate Mystery]] #3 and #4.
