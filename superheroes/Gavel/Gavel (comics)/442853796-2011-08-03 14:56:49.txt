'''Gavel''' is a minor fictional character in the [[Marvel comics]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
Gavel was a masked mystery man who served as the judge for all of [[The Jury (comics)|The Jury]]'s trials which were usually little more than a farce before they executed their prisoners. Little is known about Gavel and it was revealed by Jury member [[Ramshot]] that he and the other members do not know his real identity or even if he was ever a real judge. How he came to work with the Jury is a mystery but presumably Gavel was tied to whatever party was financing the Jury after they parted ways with [[General Orwell Taylor]]. In the Jury's court [[Olivia Lentz]] served as prosecutor while former Jury member [[Screech (comics)|Screech]] served as defense attorney.

Gavel is never on site with the Jury. He is always seen on a monitor whose image is transmitted from a secret location.

It was mentioned in ''Thunderbolts'' #23 that the Jury had lost their funding and no longer worked with Gavel.
