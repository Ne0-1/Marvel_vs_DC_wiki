'''Jemma Anne Simmons''' is a fictional character that originated in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] before appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], first appeared in the 2013 [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' and has continually been portrayed by [[Elizabeth Henstridge]].

In the series, Simmons is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top scientific minds. Though her experience is vast, she is particularly expert in biological sciences. Many of her storylines involve her relationship with her best friend, and later lover, [[Leo Fitz]]. Over the course of the series, she develops from a relatively young and inexperienced S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist to one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most senior agents, also clocking significant experience as a field agent. She is distinguished from her colleagues by taking very determined and sometimes coldly rational decisions in the pursuit of what she believes is right.

== Concept and creation ==
In November 2012, [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] was cast as Jemma Simmons.<ref name="HenstridgeDeCaestecker" /> She described her character as "a biochem expert. She's young and hungry and she's a great woman to play because she's intelligent and focused and curious and she doesn't apologize for it. She's got a wonderful relationship with Fitz. They kind of bounce off each other."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com.au/tv/interviews/599141-exclusive-interview-elizabeth-henstridge-on-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d |title=Exclusive Interview: Elizabeth Henstridge on ‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’ |last=Topel |first=Fred |date=November 5, 2013 |website=[[CraveOnline]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6SYCUnkQR?url=http://www.craveonline.com.au/tv/interviews/599141-exclusive-interview-elizabeth-henstridge-on-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |access-date=September 13, 2014}}</ref> After the reveal during the [[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|season two premiere]] that Fitz was just imagining Simmons in the episode, Henstridge explained that the showrunners "tell you what you need to know to act your scenes, but anything after that, you never know."<ref name="HenstridgeHydra" /> For Simmons' costume design, Foley tried to have her clothes reflect her personality, without "getting too cliché...we mix the hard with the soft—we combine the feminine elements like peter pan collars, silk blouses and florals with the masculine touches like ties".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tyrannyofstyle.com/agents-of-shield-costume-design |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

== Characterization ==
Henstridge talked about the characters of Fitz and Simmons being separated over the course of the series, noting that they have "never been without each other. When you see them without each other, that brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters in discovering what it's like to have to be independent".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/agents-shield-elizabeth-henstridge-1071757.aspx |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Elizabeth Henstridge: Fitz and Simmons Are "Like a Married Couple" |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=October 7, 2013 |website=[[TV Guide]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6SYCg3uuK?url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/agents-shield-elizabeth-henstridge-1071757.aspx |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> On Simmons' guilt over Fitz's brain damage, Henstridge said "She feels a huge amount of guilt. There's a lot of emotions happening. A lot of it revolves around Fitz and Ward. She feels a lot of anger and resentment at the situation. When something catastrophic happens to someone you love, or a situation arises that affects people you love the most, if that's the first time you’ve been in that position, you never really know what to do."<ref name="HenstridgeHydra" /> As this relationship developed through the second season, Henstridge said, "I don't think they fully realize the implication of how far apart they are. There's so much hurt there. I don't think they realize what they're sacrificing by not figuring this out."<ref name="HenstridgeDeCaestecker" /> Talking about the harsher side of Simmons seen later in the second season, after the reveal of the Inhumans and the subsequent death of Agent Triplett, Henstridge explained that at the beginning of the series, Simmons was "very mathematical" but throughout the first season "understood that it was more about human relationships and what it means to save someone's life". Now, "she's had a traumatic event and she's gone straight back to what she knows of trying to make everything black and white", and so "It makes sense [to her] if there are these people—call them what you want; Inhumans—that cause destruction, and you can get rid of them, then they won't be {{sic|a destruction}} anymore....Of course it isn't" that simple.<ref name="HenstridgeDeCaestecker" />

After Simmons is trapped on the planet Maveth for six months, she becomes "profoundly different", with Henstridge describing her as "definitely still her essence—she doesn't just completely change. But she's been through so much. She's hardened. She's had to face things that she never would’ve imagined, also by herself without Fitz, so she's definitely changed, stronger and kind of damaged."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/29/agents-shield-simmons-planet-premiere-spoilers |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. postmortem: Where the heck is Simmons? |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=September 30, 2015 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hIGBaLrO?url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/29/agents-shield-simmons-planet-premiere-spoilers |archive-date=May 6, 2016 |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> Describing the relationship that Simmons develops with Daniels on the planet, and comparing it to that with Fitz, Henstridge said, "It's very visceral. It's more primal and intense. That just comes from having to survive in a hostile environment, only having each other on the whole planet. The stakes are always so high, so it's more physical than her relationship with Fitz. FitzSimmons is a slow burn that's taken years and years, and they connected over intellect, whereas her and Will, it's an "us against the world" kind of thing."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/agents-shield-elizabeth-henstridge-simmons-834912 |title='Agents of SHIELD': Elizabeth Henstridge Dives Deep into What Happened to Simmons |last=Bucksbaum |first=Sydney |date=October 27, 2015 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hIGH7mNt?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/agents-shield-elizabeth-henstridge-simmons-834912 |archive-date=May 6, 2016 |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> After Daniels dies and Simmons eventually moves on with Fitz, the latter two are shown consummating their relationship after several seasons worth of build up. "We imagine they spend the morning after laughing a lot about what just happened," said Whedon and Tancharoen, "We want their relationship to feel like their friendship did, because all the best relationships are just that. So moving forward, while this change in their friendship would hopefully only deepen their connection, it is bound also to make things a bit more complicated."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/27/agents-shield-fitz-simmons-sex-spoilers |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. bosses answer THE burning question |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=April 27, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hIGLom3W?url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/27/agents-shield-fitz-simmons-sex-spoilers |archive-date=May 6, 2016 |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref>
