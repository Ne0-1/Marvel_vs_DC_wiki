'''Risque (Gloria Dolores Muñoz)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. Her first appearance was in ''X-Force (1st series) #51''.

Risque grew up in [[Florida]] to a Seminole mother and Cuban father. When her powers mainfested at around age thirteen, she ran away from home and was on her own ever since. She worked at the Wacky World amusement park for a few weeks, but was thrown out for smoking in costume on the grounds. She then got into some trouble, which the mysterious Sledge helped extricate her from, in return for doing him a favor. 

Risque had to send a message to [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] intimating that she had knowledge regarding the Camp Verde massacre. She met Warpath in [[New York]], where she introduced herself to him from the shadows, planted a kiss on his lips and left. 

Then, when [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] made her move against the [[Externals]], killing those who remained, Risque arrived and pulled the wounded Warpath out of [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]]'s before Selene could drain his life. Risque took James to Florida to recuperate and they fell for each other. Finally, James wanted to get back to his friends, and the duo arrived just in time to defend [[X-Man]] from [[Mister Sinister]]. 
Warpath intended to remain at the Mansion, but after being confronted by the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] in New York City, Risque finally fulfilled her "mission" by slipping a sleeping pill into Jimmy's drink and bringing him to Sledge in Detroit. Unfortunately, her betrayal of Warpath's trust ruined their relationship, as she had feared it would. 

Months later, Risque ran into [[X-Force]] again while she was helping the [[Vanisher]] steal the Heart of Pele, a scared Hawaiian gem. However, when she was attacked by one of the Lava Men, Warpath saved her and got X-Force involved in the quest for the stone. They eventually returned the stone to Pele, the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] goddess of the volcano, in order to keep the Lava Men who had obtained it from using the gem to power an ancient Deviant machine that would have activated every volcano on Earth. After the Lava Men were defeated "Risque" revealed herself as Pele, and said that the real Risque (who had indeed come to find the Heart) was still asleep on the beach. 

When the psychic and physical connection between [[Danielle Moonstar]] and [[Arcadia (comics)|Arcadia]] spawned a new Demon Bear than rampaged through Sledge's warehouse, Risque was sent to help X-Force defeat the bear in [[San Francisco]]. Unfortunately, she was of very little help, and spent most of the time flirting with Warpath. 

Months later, Risque was apparently contacted by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], who made her part of his [[X-Corporation]] monitoring mutant rights violations in [[Asia]]. Risque found out about a company trafficking in mutant body parts and went to investigate. Unfortunately, she was ambushed by the U-Men, followers of [[Sublime (comics)|John Sublime]], founder of the Third Species movement. Risque did manage to compress one of her attackers into the size of a baseball, but could not fend them all off and was murdered. 

==Powers==
Risque can create localized [[gravity]] fields to affect inorganic matter, placing a gravitronic charge within an object to compress it into a small, high-density mass and then maneuver that gravity charge to propel the object at high velocities
