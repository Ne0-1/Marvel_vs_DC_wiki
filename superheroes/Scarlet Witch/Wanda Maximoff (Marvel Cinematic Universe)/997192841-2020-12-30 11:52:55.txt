'''Wanda Maximoff''' is a [[character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Elizabeth Olsen]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]] who is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character of the same name (more commonly known as the '''[[Scarlet Witch]]'''). {{As of|2019}}, Maximoff has appeared in the films ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), all of which take place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Olsen will reprise the role in the upcoming [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2021) and the film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'' (2022).

==Conception, characterization, and appearance==
Scarlet Witch debuted, together with her brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964).<ref name="DeFalco99">{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|author-link = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 99|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Stan Lee and Jack Kirby decided to try their hands at a pair of reluctant super villains when they created Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in ''The X-Men'' #4.}}</ref> They were depicted as reluctant villains, uninterested in [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s ideologies.

Lee also wrote the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' comic book, composed by the most prominent heroes of the editorial. He eventually removed all of them, save for [[Captain America]], and replaced them with villains from other comics: the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver from the [[X-Men]], and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from [[Iron Man]]'s adventures in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''. The team was known as "Cap's Kooky Quartet."<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 108: "[Stan Lee] replaced Thor, Iron Man, Giant-Man, and Wasp with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch."</ref> Although common in later years, such a change in the roster of a super hero group was completely unprecedented.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicbook.com/2015/03/29/all-different-avengers-10-most-questionable-roster-moves/|title= All-Different Avengers: 10 Most Questionable Roster Moves|author= Mark Ginocchio|date= March 31, 2015|publisher= Comic Book|access-date=May 18, 2017}}</ref> Some years later, ''Avengers'' writer [[Roy Thomas]] started a long-running romantic relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], considering that it would help with the series' character development.

[[Steve Englehart]] succeeded Thomas as writer of the Avengers. He gave her a more assertive personality, removed Quicksilver, and expanded her powers by turning her into an apprentice of [[witchcraft]].<ref name="back45"/> The Vision and the Scarlet Witch married in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975), at the end of the ''Celestial Madonna'' arc.<ref name="Sanderson169">[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 169: "Writer Steve Englehart and veteran Avengers artist Don Heck presented the grand finale of the long-running 'Celestial Madonna' saga...

In the 1990s, Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], to [[20th Century Fox]]. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started its own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused on the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The main core of this franchise were the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement so that both of them would use the characters. It was made on the condition that the plots do not make reference to the other studio's properties: the Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, and the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title= Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies|first= Kirsten|last= Acuna|date= April 30, 2015|work= [[Business Insider]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|archive-date= August 17, 2016|url-status= live|access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> Despite this deal, films in the Fox X-Men series did not feature Scarlet Witch.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ''X-Men: Days Of Future Past'' Cuts All Mentions Of Scarlet Witch|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|first= Gabe|last= Toro|publisher= Cinema Blend|date = April 28, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222142319/http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|archive-date= December 22, 2015|url-status= live|access-date= October 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto-daughter-2016-6|title= The most tragic scene in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' has an even sadder comic history|author= Sidney Fussell|date= June 1, 2016|publisher= Business Insider|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

Paul Bettany described it as the most emotional arc for the characters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/paul-bettany-elizabeth-olsen-vision-scarlet-witch-avengers-infinity-war|title=Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen on Vision, Scarlet Witch, and their 'most emotional' Avengers story yet|first=Matthew|last=Jackson|date=March 26, 2018|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref> In early drafts of ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', the screenwriters had Maximoff survive the snap and participate more substantially in the events of ''Endgame'', while still mourning Vision, but this angle was ultimately dropped because "she'd gotten so much mileage and story in the first movie that she didn't really have anything that equaled that in the second."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a29620207/avengers-infinity-war-ending-scarlet-witch-almost-survived/|title=Scarlet Witch almost survived the Snap in Avengers: Infinity War|first=Dan|last=Seddon|date=October 29, 2019|website=Digital Spy}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''===
{{main|Captain America: The Winter Soldier}}
Wanda Maximoff and her twin brother Pietro are first introduced as test subjects in a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility in the [[Eastern Europe]]an country of Sokovia commanded by Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker]]. The twins are among the few survivors of Strucker's experiments on humans using the scepter previously wielded by [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]].

===''Avengers: Age of Ultron''===
{{main|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}
The [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]—[[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], and [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]]—later raid Strucker's facility and encounter the twins, with Wanda using her telepathic abilities to interfere with their attack.

Stark and Banner subsequently use an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the [[Infinity Gems#Film|scepter's gem]] to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program, and the unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers attack Ultron in [[Johannesburg]], but Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing Banner to turn into the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and rampage through the city. Ultron travels to [[Seoul]] and uses Loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend, Dr. Helen Cho, using her synthetic-tissue technology, [[vibranium]], and the scepter's gem to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. After Stark, Banner, and Thor cooperate to turn the captured synthetic body into the "[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]," the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Barton encourages a frightened Wanda to join the Avengers in fighting Ultron. Pietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The other Avengers thwart Ultron's plan, and the Avengers establish a new team led by Rogers and Romanoff, and featuring James Rhodes, Vision, [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], and Wanda.

===''Captain America: Civil War''===
{{main|Captain America: Civil War}}
Approximately one year later, Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, and Wanda stop [[Crossbones (comics)|Brock Rumlow]] from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in [[Lagos]]. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Wanda telekinetically contains the explosion and throws it upward, accidentally damaging a nearby building and killing several [[Wakanda]]n humanitarian workers, to her dismay. [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informed the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Registration acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. Wanda is restricted by Stark to remain at Avengers headquarters in New York, watched over by Vision, who attempts to comfort her, for the two have developed romantic feelings for each other. Rogers and Wilson go rogue to pursue villain [[Helmut Zemo]], sending Clint Barton to recruit Wanda, who rejects Vision's warnings and goes with Barton. Stark's team intercepts Rogers's group, including Wanda, at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. The rest of Rogers's team, including Wanda, is captured and detained at the Raft prison, until Rogers returns to break them out.

===''Avengers: Infinity War''===
{{main|Avengers: Infinity War}}
Several years later, Wanda and Vision have begun a secret romantic relationship while living off the grid in [[Edinburgh]], when they are ambushed by [[Proxima Midnight]] and [[Corvus Glaive]], servants of [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] sent to retrieve the Mind Stone, which is in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson rescue them, and they take shelter with [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] and Banner at Avengers Compound. Vision asks Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it, but Wanda refuses. Rogers suggests they travel to [[Wakanda]], which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone without destroying Vision. Thanos's army invades Wakanda as [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision, but she is unable to complete the extraction of the Mind Stone from Vision before Thanos arrives to retrieve it. Wanda is forced to destroy the Mind Stone and Vision, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions. He rips the repaired Mind Stone from Vision's forehead, killing him. Thanos, with the completed Gauntlet, snaps his fingers, and half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Wanda.

===''Avengers: Endgame''===
{{main|Avengers: Endgame}}
Five years later, when the remaining Avengers are able to use [[Quantum mechanics of time travel|quantum time travel]] to steal the stones from the past and create a new gauntlet, Wanda is restored along with the other people who were disintegrated. Sorcerers bring heroes from around the galaxy, including Wanda, to Avengers headquarters in upstate New York, where a time-traveling past version of Thanos is mounting a new attack. Wanda confronts Thanos directly, and nearly defeats him, destroying his sword and forcing him to order his ship to bomb the area, including his own troops, to escape. Wanda then assists [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]] in an unsuccessful attempt to use [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]]'s van to return the gauntlet to the past. After Stark sacrifices his life to defeat Thanos, Wanda attends Stark's funeral and consoles Barton over the death of Romanoff.

===''WandaVision''===
{{main|WandaVision}}

Afterward, Wanda enters a sitcom-themed dimension with Vision, where they marry and live their ideal suburban life together.

==Powers and abilities==
Wanda has the ability to harness magic, which typically presents itself in [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]], [[telepathy]] and energy manipulation/projection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2014/07/17/avengers-age-of-ultron-quicksilver-scarlet-witch-and-the-vision/|title='Avengers: Age of Ultron': Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and The Vision|website=EW.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/scarlet-witch-wanda-maximoff/on-screen|title=Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff) On Screen Powers, Enemies, History &#124; Marvel|website=Marvel Entertainment}}</ref>

In her first full-length introduction in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron|Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', Maximoff's powers are mostly telekinetic and semi-telepathic. Throughout the movie she is shown moving objects with her mind and engaging in [[hypnosis]], inducing nightmarish-like images into the heads of multiple Avengers. She also displays moments of energy projection, including when she took out an army of Ultrons with a wave of energy and [[Force field (fiction)|created energy shields]] to protect herself and Sokovian citizens from the crossfire.

In ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', her powers have advanced. Her telekinesis is now strong enough to let her hold up the debris of a falling building as well as allow her to engage in limited [[flight]]. Her energy manipulation now allows her to, in a fight with [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], forcibly manipulate his density.

In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Wanda is now capable of throwing energy bolts. Vision reveals that due to Wanda's powers being linked to the [[Mind stone|mind stone]], she is able to use her powers to destroy it, which she later does. She also is shown to be able to telepathically communicate with the stone when she tries to figure out why Vision is in pain in a hotel room.

The upcoming series ''[[WandaVision]]'' will explore her ability to warp reality like her [[Scarlet Witch|comic counterpart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/wandavision-marvel-cover-story/|title=Honey, I'm Chrome: Marvel prepares to take over TV with 'WandaVision'|website=EW.com}}</ref>

==Differences from the comics==
Maximoff in the MCU "possesses a drastically different powerset to her comic book counterpart," having been described less as a wielder of actual magic and more as "a [[Jean Grey]] analogue, gifted with both telepathic and telekinetic powers," with her abilities in the MCU being derived at least in part from experiments in which she was exposed to the Mind Stone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-mcu-comic-powers-changes/|title=Scarlet Witch’s Comic Powers Compared To The Movies|date=October 25, 2019|first=Thomas|last=Bacon|website=ScreenRant}}</ref> {{As of|2019}}, Magneto and other characters from the X-Men franchise have not been introduced into the MCU because Marvel Studios didn't own the rights for the X-Men until early 2019, and therefore no mention has been made of Maximoff's traditional depiction as the daughter of Magneto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/how-marvel-could-build-an-avengers-x-men-crossover-event-1210355|title=How Marvel's Next 10-Year Saga Could Unite Avengers and X-Men|first=Richard|last=Newby|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 14, 2019}}</ref>

==Reception==
Rachel Leishman of the feminist "geek site" ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' wrote that Maximoff "isn't the most fleshed out of characters because she is often tied down to a male character and very rarely does anything but kill people accidentally," but that ''Avengers: Infinity War'' provided "the Wanda Maximoff who understands her placement among the Avengers and her abilities," and that by the end of ''Avengers: Endgame'', Maximoff is "taking on her position as one of the new leaders of the Avengers."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/my-love-for-wanda-maximoff/|title=I Just Want to Share My Love for Wanda Maximoff|first=Rachel|last=Leishman|date=April 29, 2019|website=TheMarySue}}</ref>
