Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as mutants, to Fox. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused in the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers. The main core of this franchise were the Avengers, both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement so that both of them would use the characters. It was made on the condition that the plots do not make reference to the other studio's properties: the Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, and the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title= Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies|first= Kirsten|last= Acuna|date= April 30, 2015|work= [[Business Insider]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|archivedate= August 17, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref>

The 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', however, did not feature Scarlet Witch. There is a brief image of Quicksilver with a small girl in the film, and a deleted scene of Quicksilver complaining about his sister, but the director [[Bryan Singer]] denied that the girl was Scarlet Witch, saying that she was only Quicksilver's little sister, and that it was just a nod for comic book fans.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ''X-Men: Days Of Future Past'' Cuts All Mentions Of Scarlet Witch|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|first= Gabe|last= Toro|publisher= Cinema Blend|date = April 28, 2014|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222142319/http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|archivedate= December 22, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 25, 2015}}</ref> The sequel film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' introduces another daughter of Magneto, Nina, who is also unrelated to the Scarlet Witch.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto-daughter-2016-6|title= The most tragic scene in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' has an even sadder comic history|author= Sidney Fussell|date= June 1, 2016|publisher= Business Insider|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

[[Elizabeth Olsen]] plays Wanda Maximoff in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. The comic book costume was ignored in favor of more everyday clothes. She first appeared, as well as Quicksilver, in a [[mid-credits scene]] of the 2014 film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' as a prisoner of [[Baron Strucker]] ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]).<ref>{{cite web |first=Jenna |last=Milly |date=March 14, 2014 |title=''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' premiere: Crossover is the word |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/03/14/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-premiere/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |archivedate=March 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6O8p8aDD8?url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/03/14/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-premiere/ |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Scarlet Witch became a supporting character in the 2015 film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', where the siblings initially conspire with [[Ultron]] ([[James Spader]]) but later defect to the Avengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/21563/official_elizabeth_olsen_aaron_taylor-johnson_join_avengers_age_of_ultron|title=Official: Elizabeth Olsen & Aaron Taylor-Johnson Join ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''|publisher=Marvel|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6O8qT8YHP?url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/2013/11/25/21563/official_elizabeth_olsen_aaron_taylor-johnson_join_avengers_age_of_ultron|archivedate=March 17, 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|date=May 5, 2014 |title=''Avengers 2'': Aaron Taylor Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen Talk Quicksilver & Scarlet Witch  |url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2014/07/27/avengers-2-aaron-taylor-johnson-elizabeth-olsen-talk-quicksilver-scarlet-witch|publisher= [[IGN]]|accessdate=July 27, 2014|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141126115151/http://www.ign.com/videos/2014/07/27/avengers-2-aaron-taylor-johnson-elizabeth-olsen-talk-quicksilver-scarlet-witch|archivedate= November 26, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref> Quicksilver dies in the ensuing conflict while Wanda goes on to become a member of [[Captain America]]'s Avengers.
