==Background==


[[File:Elizabeth Olsen & Paul Bettany (48469160767).jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany at the 2019 San Diego Comic Con International, for ''WandaVision'']]

The Scarlet Witch debuted, alongside her twin brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964).<ref name="DeFalco99">{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |author-link=Tom DeFalco |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura |chapter=1960s |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |date=2008 |location=London, United Kingdom |page=99 |isbn=978-0756641238 |quote=Stan Lee and Jack Kirby decided to try their hands at a pair of reluctant super villains when they created Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in ''The X-Men'' #4.}}</ref> They were depicted as reluctant villains, uninterested in [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s ideologies. Scarlet Witch was depicted as introverted and disdainful of her teammates.

Stan Lee, author of the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' comic book, composed the team of Marvel's most prominent heroes. However, he eventually altered the team roster, removing all but [[Captain America]], and added villains from other comics: the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver from the [[X-Men]], and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from [[Iron Man]]'s adventures in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''. The team was known as "Cap's Kooky Quartet".<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 108: "[Stan Lee] replaced Thor, Iron Man, Giant-Man, and Wasp with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch".</ref> Although common in later years, such a change in the roster of a superhero group was completely unprecedented.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/news/all-different-avengers-10-most-questionable-roster-moves/ |title=All-Different Avengers: 10 Most Questionable Roster Moves |author=Mark Ginocchio |date=March 31, 2015 |publisher=Comic Book |access-date=May 7, 2022|archive-date=August 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805100753/http://comicbook.com/2015/03/29/all-different-avengers-10-most-questionable-roster-moves/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Scarlet Witch would now become a lasting member of the team.

Some years later, ''Avengers'' writer [[Roy Thomas]] started a long-running romantic relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], considering that it would help with the series' character development. He selected those characters because they were only published in the ''Avengers'' comic book, so it would not interfere with other publications.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal |last=Walker  |first=Karen |date=December 2010 |title=Shattered Dreams: Vision and the Scarlet Witch |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=45 |pages=59–65 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

===Adaptation and appearances===
In the 1990s, Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], to [[20th Century Fox]]. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started its own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused on the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The main core of this franchise was the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement so that both of them would use the characters. It was made on the condition that the plots do not make reference to the other studio's properties: the Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, and the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4 |title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies |first=Kirsten |last=Acuna |date=April 30, 2015 |work=[[Business Insider]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4 |archive-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> Despite this deal, films in the Fox ''X-Men'' series did not feature Scarlet Witch.<ref>{{Cite web |title=''X-Men: Days Of Future Past'' Cuts All Mentions Of Scarlet Witch |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html |first=Gabe |last=Toro |publisher=Cinema Blend |date=April 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222142319/http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto-daughter-2016-6 |title=The most tragic scene in ''X-Men: Apocalypse'' has an even sadder comic history |author=Sidney Fussell |date=June 1, 2016 |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=June 16, 2017 |archive-date=June 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629065453/http://www.businessinsider.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto-daughter-2016-6 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May 2013, [[Joss Whedon]] considered [[Saoirse Ronan]] to be his "prototype" actress for the part, but by August of that year, [[Elizabeth Olsen]] had been cast for the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/elizabeth-olsen-scarlet-witch-avengers-sequel/ |title=Elizabeth Olsen Calls Prep Work for Scarlet Witch 'So Much Fun' |first=Perri |last=Nemiroff |publisher=Collider |date=November 11, 2013 |access-date=November 12, 2019 |archive-date=November 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112002633/https://collider.com/elizabeth-olsen-scarlet-witch-avengers-sequel/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Olsen has since played Wanda Maximoff in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Olsen explains that Wanda and Vision have maintained a romance while Wanda remains in hiding and are "trying to within that time find points of meeting in different places in order to try and forward our relationship".

== Fictional character biography ==
<!-- Please DO NOT change surnames to first names; unless to distinguish from another character with the same surname -->

=== Childhood and origin ===
{{further|Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Previously On}}
Wanda Maximoff was born in 1989 in [[Sokovia]], Eastern Europe, unaware that she was born a witch and unknowingly engaging in basic hex magic. While growing up with her twin brother [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro]] and her parents Oleg and Iryna in a small apartment during a war, she enjoyed watching American [[sitcom]]s, which her father sold DVD box sets of so their family could practice speaking English in the hopes of emigrating to America. However, Oleg and Iryna were killed when a missile struck their apartment while Wanda and Pietro were trapped in the debris for two days. While a second [[Stark Industries (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Industries]] missile flew in, it never went off as Wanda unknowingly cast a probability hex that turned it into a dud, though the twins lived in fear of it going off until they were rescued. Years later, as young adults, Wanda and Pietro volunteered for [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]]'s enhancement program overseen by Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wolfgang von Strucker]]. The organization exposed the twins and numerous other test subjects to the [[Mind Stone]], with Wanda and Pietro being the only survivors and the former gaining psychic abilities while her magic was greatly amplified. During the experiments, Wanda gained a glimpse of herself as the Scarlet Witch. 

=== Becoming an Avenger ===
{{Further|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Previously On}}
In 2015, Wanda uses her telepathic abilities to interfere with the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]'s raid of Strucker's facility. Shortly after, [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] recruits Wanda and Pietro, who hold [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, to help him destroy the Avengers. In [[Johannesburg]], Wanda subdues most of the Avengers with haunting visions, but is weakened by [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]]. Following this, Ultron travels to [[Seoul]] and uses the Mind Stone to enslave Dr. [[Helen Cho]] so he can use her synthetic-tissue technology, [[Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|vibranium]], and the Mind Stone to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into it, Wanda reads his mind and discovers his plan to cause human extinction. She and Pietro turn against Ultron and join forces with [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] to stop him while the other Avengers capture the synthetic body. Upon learning of Stark's plan to give the body life and fearing what he will do with it, the twins and Rogers head to [[Avengers Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Tower]] to stop Stark, but [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor Odinson]] turns the body into the "[[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]". After the twins tell the Avengers of Ultron's plot, they and Vision travel to Sokovia, where Ultron has used his remaining vibranium to build a machine capable of lifting a large section of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the Earth and cause global extinction. Wanda becomes overwhelmed by her role in Ultron's scheme until Barton befriends and encourages her to join the Avengers in stopping Ultron. Wanda volunteers to protect the machine's core from Ultron, but abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body after sensing Pietro's death, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. Vision rescues Wanda from the collapsing city, after which they join the Avengers.

Sometime later, Vision visits Wanda and comforts her over Pietro's death, assuring her that the grief she feels over losing her family meant that she still loved them.

=== Avengers Civil War ===
{{further|Captain America: Civil War}}
In 2016, Wanda joins the Avengers in stopping [[Brock Rumlow (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brock Rumlow]] from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in [[Lagos]]. Rumlow detonates his suicide vest in an attempt to kill Rogers, but Wanda telekinetically contains the explosion and throws it upward, accidentally killing several [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]n humanitarian workers, to her horror. As a result, [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]], informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. Stark has Wanda confined to the [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]], where Vision watches over her and they begin to develop romantic feelings for each other. After Rogers and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] go rogue to aid [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], they send Barton to pick up Wanda and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] before regrouping at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], Germany. Wanda significantly helps her team through the battle. Despite being intercepted by Stark's team, Rogers and Barnes escape while Wanda and the rest of Rogers' allies are captured and detained at the [[Raft (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raft]] until Rogers eventually breaks them out.

=== Infinity War and resurrection ===
{{further|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}
In 2018, Wanda and Vision have begun a romantic relationship and gone into hiding in [[Edinburgh]]. However, they are ambushed by [[Proxima Midnight (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Proxima Midnight]] and [[Corvus Glaive (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Corvus Glaive]], members of the [[Children of Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Children of Thanos]]<!--Not referred to as the Black Order in the MCU--> sent to retrieve the Mind Stone. Rogers, Wilson, and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] rescue them and regroup at the [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]], where Vision asks Wanda to destroy the Stone, but she refuses as it would kill him. Rogers suggests they travel to [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]], which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision. As [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]] works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision, Wanda is tasked with staying behind and watching over the operation until the Stone is removed. Nevertheless, she leaves to aid the Avengers in their fight against the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]], killing Midnight in the process. When [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] arrives to retrieve the Mind Stone himself, Wanda reluctantly kills Vision and destroys the Stone, but Thanos uses the [[Time Stone]] to reverse the action and rip the repaired Mind Stone from Vision’s forehead, before knocking out a horrified Wanda and activating the completed [[Infinity Gauntlet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Infinity Gauntlet]]. Wanda, along with half of all life in the universe, disintegrates in an event that would later be called [[the Blip]].

Five years later, Wanda is restored to life and joins the Avengers and their allies' battle against an alternate timeline version of Thanos and his army, during which Stark sacrifices himself to defeat Thanos.

A week later, Wanda attends Stark's funeral and reunites with Barton.

=== Life in Westview ===

==== The Hex and the ''WandaVision'' program ====
{{Further|Previously On|Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience|Don't Touch That Dial|Now in Color|We Interrupt This Program (WandaVision){{!}}We Interrupt This Program}}
The next day, Wanda goes to [[S.W.O.R.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.W.O.R.D.]]'s headquarters to retrieve Vision's body. After meeting with S.W.O.R.D.'s acting director [[Tyler Hayward]] however, she is shown Vision being dismantled and realizes she can no longer sense him. She leaves and drives to the suburban town of Westview, [[New Jersey]] to view a vacant lot that Vision had purchased in 2018 for the two "to grow old in". Overcome with grief, Wanda accidentally unleashes waves of [[chaos magic]] that transforms Westview into a sitcom-themed false reality and isolates it from the outside world via a hexagonal barrier, later called the "Hex". She materializes a new version of Vision that lacks any prior memories and starts living with him in the Hex as a newly-married couple trying to live their ideal suburban life.

While attempting to befriend her neighbors and concealing her and Vision's powers, Wanda becomes visibly pregnant. As it progresses at an accelerated rate, she encounters [[Monica Rambeau (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Monica Rambeau]], who had been absorbed into the Hex and took on the alias of "Geraldine", and receives her help in giving birth to twin boys [[Tommy Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tommy]] and [[Billy Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Billy]]. However, Rambeau mentions Pietro and his death at Ultron's hands, inciting Wanda to telekinetically cast her out of Westview. When Vision returns moments later, he briefly appears as a corpse before Wanda resets him.

==== Hunted by S.W.O.R.D. ====
{{Further|On a Very Special Episode...|All-New Halloween Spooktacular!}}
As Wanda's children age rapidly, S.W.O.R.D. sends an armed drone into Westview in an attempt to kill Wanda. Enraged, she exits the Hex, warns Hayward to leave her alone, and emphasizes her point by hypnotizing his agents into turning their guns on him. Rambeau, who empathizes with Wanda, tries to offer help, but is rebuffed. Back in Westview, Wanda gets into a heated argument with Vision when he finds out the truth after reading a S.W.O.R.D. communique at work. The argument is interrupted when a [[Ralph Bohner|man claiming to be Pietro]] appears and Wanda briefly accepts him into her life. During the town's Halloween festival, Wanda reveals to "Pietro" that she does not remember what happened to her other than feeling alone and empty, which seemingly made her create the Hex. When Wanda learns that Vision has breached the barrier and is dying, she expands the Hex to save his life, in the process also absorbing the nearby S.W.O.R.D. outpost and [[Darcy Lewis]].

==== Battle of Westview ====
{{Further|Breaking the Fourth Wall (WandaVision){{!}}Breaking the Fourth Wall|Previously On|The Series Finale}}
Following her expansion of the Hex, Wanda starts losing control of the altered reality and begins having a mental breakdown. Rambeau returns to Westview to warn Wanda of Hayward's plan to revive and weaponize Vision, but an enraged Wanda refuses to listen and attempts to cast her out once more. When Rambeau resists using her newly acquired powers, Wanda's neighbor "Agnes" interrupts and takes Wanda to her house, where she reveals her true identity as the sorceress [[Agatha Harkness (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Agatha Harkness]] and forces Wanda to relieve her most traumatic memories to learn how she created the Hex by threatening Tommy and Billy's lives. Eventually, Harkness releases her, mocking Wanda for not knowing the full extent of her own abilities before revealing Wanda is the legendary "[[Scarlet Witch]]", who wields chaos magic and is capable of spontaneously altering reality and weaving together numerous high-level spells that run automatically. As Wanda battles Harkness, the latter absorbs her magic. They are briefly interrupted by Hayward's Vision, but Wanda's version fends him off. Continuing their battle, Harkness reveals further that Wanda is even more powerful than the [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sorcerer Supreme]] and that she is destined to destroy the world as the "Harbinger of Chaos" before freeing Westview's citizens from Wanda's influence, allowing them to reveal to Wanda that her spell has been causing them to experience her repressed grief and nightmares. Overwhelmed, Wanda accidentally loses control of her powers once more and nearly chokes them all to death. Horrified by what she has done, Wanda brings down the Hex so the citizens can escape, but restores it after her Vision, Billy, and Tommy begin to disappear. As invading S.W.O.R.D. agents attack Westview, Billy and Tommy disarm them while Rambeau and Lewis stop Hayward and Wanda and Harkness renew their fight. The latter seemingly absorbs all of Wanda's magic, but realizes too late that Wanda had placed protective runes at the Hex's borders to neutralize Harkness's magic. Claiming her new identity as the Scarlet Witch, Wanda traps Harkness in her Agnes identity before permanently bringing down the Hex and sharing a tearful goodbye with her family. Wanda meets with a sympathetic Rambeau to apologize and vow to better understand her powers before flying away to live remotely in a mountainside cabin, where she studies the ''[[Darkhold (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Darkhold]]'' to learn more about her powers before hearing her sons cry out for help.

=== Corrupted by the ''Darkhold'' ===
{{Further|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness}}
By late 2024, Wanda had gradually been corrupted by the ''Darkhold'' as she learns that alternate versions of her sons exist in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] and resolves to join them in another reality. After learning of [[America Chavez (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|America Chavez]] and her ability to freely travel the multiverse, Wanda secretly sends [[demons]] after her to take her powers for herself. When [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] seeks Wanda's help in protecting Chavez, she accidentally reveals her knowledge of the girl and explains her plans to him. Strange refuses to give Chavez to Wanda, so she attacks [[Kamar-Taj (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kamar-Taj]], killing many of the sorcerers.

During the attack, Chavez accidentally sends herself and Strange to the alternate reality [[Earth-838]].  In pursuit of the pair, Wanda attempts to dream-walk; a spell which involves temporarily possessing alternate versions of oneself into a counterpart's body. When a surviving sorceress, Sara, sacrifices herself to destroy the ''Darkhold'' and break the dream-walk, Wanda forces [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] to lead her to a temple dedicated to the ''Darkhold''{{'}}s author [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] atop [[Mount Wundagore (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mount Wundagore]], the origial source of the ''Darkhold''{{'}}s spells.

Using the temple's magic, Wanda re-establishes her dream-walk and successfully possesses her Earth-838's counterpart's body. She then breaks into the [[Illuminati (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Illuminati]]'s headquarters and slaughters most of them while Strange and Chavez escape with the help of scientist [[Christine Palmer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Christine Palmer]]. The trio enter the Gap Junction, a space between universes to find the ''[[Book of Vishanti]]'', the antithesis of the ''Darkhold'', but Wanda appears, destroys the book, and takes over Chavez's mind, sending Strange and Palmer to an post-incursion universe, and opening a portal back to [[Earth-616 (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Earth-616]].

=== Redemption and Sacrifice ===

At Mount Wundagore, Wanda begins to absorb Chavez's powers but is confronted by a dreamwalking Strange who encourages Chavez to believe in herself and use her powers to bring Wanda to Earth-838. Tommy and Billy recoil in horror of her as she is choking a kneeling Chavez. The boys run from the "witch" and cry out for their real mother. As a result, Wanda is broken free of the ''Darkhold''{{'}}s control and collapses with grief. She is assured by her 838-counterpart that "they will be loved." After being returned to Earth-616, Wanda lets Chavez and Wong leave before using her powers to destroy the temple along with all copies of the ''Darkhold'' across the multiverse, seemingly sacrificing herself in the process as self punishment.

== Alternate versions ==
=== Zombie outbreak ===
{{See also|What If...? (TV series)}}
{{Further|What If... Zombies?!|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}
In an alternate 2018, Wanda is among the Avengers who became infected by a quantum virus, turning into a [[zombie]]. She is then taken by Vision to [[Camp Lehigh]], where he attempts to cure her with the Mind Stone, though she proves immune. In the present, a group of survivors come to Vision for his cure, but Wanda breaks free and kills several of them before she engages the Hulk in combat.

Sometime later, amidst the [[Guardians of the Multiverse]]'s fight with an Ultron variant empowered by the Infinity Stones, [[Doctor Strange Supreme]] transports a horde of zombies and the zombified Wanda to him to distract Ultron. Wanda seems to stop, either seeing that her magic doesn't work on Ultron or seeing him unmasked and thinking that he's Vision (whose body Ultron had been occupying in his own reality) and allowing Ultron a chance to get rid of her and the rest of the zombies using the stones' full power to obliterate the planet they were on, while Strange allows himself and the Guardians escape to another alternate universe.

=== Earth-838 ===
{{Further|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness}}
In an alternate reality, Wanda lives a peaceful suburban life with her children Tommy and Billy. She is possessed by her counterpart from Earth-616, who is hunting for America Chavez through the multiverse. The possessed Wanda then kills most of the Illuminati, but is eventually freed of the spell. When 616-Wanda returns through a multiverse portal, Wanda attempts to protect her frightened children from 616-Wanda, causing the latter to acknowledge the suffering she has caused and end her deadly hunt for Chavez.

==Powers and abilities==
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2021}}
Wanda is a naturally-born sorceress with the ability to harness [[Chaos magic (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|chaos magic]], typically presenting itself in [[telekinesis]], [[telepathy]], and energy manipulation/projection. Her magic is also capable of altering reality. Wanda’s psionic abilities were later enhanced by experimental exposure to the [[Mind Stone]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2014/07/17/avengers-age-of-ultron-quicksilver-scarlet-witch-and-the-vision/|title='Avengers: Age of Ultron': Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and The Vision|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=November 12, 2020|archive-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113005401/https://ew.com/comic-con/2014/07/17/avengers-age-of-ultron-quicksilver-scarlet-witch-and-the-vision/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/scarlet-witch-wanda-maximoff/on-screen|title=Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff) On Screen Powers, Enemies, History|website=Marvel Entertainment|access-date=January 10, 2019|archive-date=November 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125081457/https://www.marvel.com/characters/scarlet-witch-wanda-maximoff/on-screen|url-status=live}}</ref>

In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', Wanda's powers are mostly telekinetic and semi-telepathic, occasionally engaging in [[hypnosis]] by inducing nightmarish-like images into the heads of four Avengers, inspiring nightmarish visions in Stark in the twins' first confrontation with the team and Rogers, Thor and Romanoff in their second, as well as provoking Banner to transform into a rampaging Hulk, before she is incapacitated by Barton. She also displays moments of energy projection, including throwing energy bolts, creating [[Force field (fiction)|forcefields]] to protect herself and Sokovian citizens and taking out an army of Ultron's drones with a wave of energy. At the new [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]] afterwards, she is seen briefly levitating.

In ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', Wanda's powers have advanced and her telekinesis is strong enough to let her hold up the debris of a falling building as well as fly for brief periods of time. Her powers allow her to, in a fight with the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], forcibly manipulate his density by controlling the Mind Stone.

In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Wanda has significantly better control over her ability to fly. Vision explains that due to Wanda's powers being linked to the Mind Stone, she is able to use her powers to destroy it. She is shown to be able to telepathically communicate with the Stone when she tries to figure out why Vision is in pain. She later single-handedly holds Thanos at bay, who was already wielding five Infinity Stones, while simultaneously destroying the Mind Stone.

In her brief appearance in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Wanda’s powers are strong enough to telekinetically incapacitate Thanos until he disrupts her efforts by ordering a bombardment of the battlefield.

''[[WandaVision]]'' explores Wanda's ability to warp [[reality]] like her [[Scarlet Witch|comic counterpart]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/tv/wandavision-marvel-cover-story/|title=Honey, I'm Chrome: Marvel prepares to take over TV with 'WandaVision'|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=November 12, 2020|archive-date=November 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201110144657/https://ew.com/tv/wandavision-marvel-cover-story/|url-status=live}}</ref> After being overwhelmed with grief after Vision’s death, Wanda releases waves of chaos magic which accidentally creates a reinforced [[CMBR]] force-field (known as "[[Westview anomaly|The Hex]]") over the town of [[Westview, New Jersey]], rewriting everything and everyone inside to be part of her own fictional reality that presents itself as a television sitcom. The rewrite occurs on a [[molecular]] level, meaning her powers allow her to manipulate molecules. This comes as a surprise to Darcy Lewis, Jimmy Woo and Monica Rambeau, since Wanda's previous power set was thought to be limited to illusions. Darcy informs Rambeau that her DNA has been molecularly rewritten after she passed through the CMBR field multiple times, eventually granting Rambeau light-related superhuman abilities.

Wanda’s history is later explored, revealing that Wanda was born a witch and would unknowingly engage in basic hex magic as a child, including unknowingly using a probability hex to turn a Stark Industries missile into a dud and save her and Pietro after an initial one killed her parents.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Singer |first1=Matt |title='WandaVision': The Coolest Easter Eggs on Episode 8 |url=https://screencrush.com/wandavision-episode-8-easter-eggs/ |website=Screen Crush |access-date=February 27, 2021 |archive-date=February 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227121203/https://screencrush.com/wandavision-episode-8-easter-eggs/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The two were unaware this was because of Wanda's magic. After Hydra experimented on her with the Mind Stone, her powers were greatly enhanced. Agatha tells Wanda that she is the only person who is able to engage in chaos magic, making her the infamous and mythical Scarlet Witch.

As Wanda begins to battle Agatha, she begins to explore the extent of her true abilities, manifesting for the first time magical abilities such as teleportation, [[rune]]-casting and power absorption, with her energy blasts also becoming more concentrated. After reclaiming her powers, she has significantly better control over her magic, being able to consciously manipulate reality with ease, such as instantly altering her clothes into her uniform and reverting Agatha back into 'Agnes', this time truly under her will. Wanda is later shown leading a secluded life in a remote location, simultaneously using astral projection to study the ''[[Darkhold (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Darkhold]]'', now in her possession.

In ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', Wanda's powers are shown to have reached new levels, as she is able to successfully attack Kamar-Taj, defended by dozens of sorcerers and magical weapons. Wanda also practices dreamwalking, which involves taking control of one's alternate-self in other universes. Wanda successfully takes control of her variant from Earth-838, using her to pursue Strange and Chavez, invade the Illuminati headquarters, dispatch waves of Ultron drones, and kill the central members of the Illuminati. The latter involved warping reality to remove Black Bolt's mouth, causing his head to explode when he attempts a sonic blast; unravelling Reed Richards' elastic body and exploding his brain; bisecting Captain Carter by launching her own shield back at her; dueling Captain Marvel to a standstill before crushing her with rubble; and telepathically snapping Charles Xavier's neck when he attempts to use his mutant powers to enter her mind and shut it down. In this final mental struggle, it is revealed that Wanda is accomplishing all of this while continually keeping the consciousness of Earth-838 Wanda incapacitated.

==Differences from the comics==

===In the comics===
{{As of|2019}}, Magneto and other characters from the X-Men franchise have not been introduced into the MCU because Marvel Studios didn't own the rights for the X-Men until early 2019, and therefore no mention has been made of Wanda's traditional depiction as the daughter of Magneto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/how-marvel-could-build-an-avengers-x-men-crossover-event-1210355/|title=How Marvel's Next 10-Year Saga Could Unite Avengers and X-Men|first=Richard|last=Newby|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 14, 2019|access-date=May 7, 2022|archive-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112010301/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/how-marvel-could-build-an-avengers-x-men-crossover-event-1210355|url-status=live}}</ref>

In addition, the Maximoff twins have been depicted as [[Romani people|Romani]] characters in Marvel Comics since 1979. They were ethnically ambiguous for the first 15 years of their publication history, after which they were shown to have been adopted and raised by a Romani couple. It was later revealed that their biological father was Magneto and their mother was Magda Eisenhardt, a Romani woman he met in a concentration camp during World War II. A later retcon it is shown that Magneto was not their father after all, and they are not mutants. Their mother was actually Natalya Maximoff, the biological sister of the twins' adoptive father. She passed on the title "The Scarlet Witch" to her daughter, and the biological father is assumed to also be from the Romani community. This makes the twins fully Romani by blood.

===In the Marvel Cinematic Universe===
Wanda in the MCU initially "possesses a drastically different powerset to her comic book counterpart", having been described less as a wielder of actual magic and more as "a [[Jean Grey]] analogue, gifted with both telepathic and telekinetic powers", with her abilities in the MCU being derived at least in part from experiments in which she was exposed to the Mind Stone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-mcu-comic-powers-changes/|title=Scarlet Witch's Comic Powers Compared To The Movies|date=October 25, 2019|first=Thomas|last=Bacon|website=ScreenRant|access-date=October 31, 2019|archive-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027153417/https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-mcu-comic-powers-changes/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In ''[[WandaVision]]'', however, Wanda is revealed to be a powerful sorceress, the only being currently capable of wielding chaos magic. The series explores her ability to manipulate reality like her comic counterpart. While it is maintained that her abilities emerged from the Mind Stone, in the MCU she is retconned into having possessed the latent ability to wield chaos magic since birth, and the Mind Stone simply unlocked these dormant abilities, and her subsequent persistent use of basic telekinesis, telepathy and hypnosis were seemingly an unwitting result of the same unique magical source.

==Reception==
Following the release of ''Avengers: Endgame'', Rachel Leishman of the feminist "geek site" ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' wrote that Wanda "isn't the most fleshed out of characters because she is often tied down to a male character and very rarely does anything but kill people accidentally," but that ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' provided "the Wanda who understands her placement among the Avengers and her abilities", and by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Wanda is "taking on her position as one of the new leaders of the Avengers".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/my-love-for-wanda-maximoff/|title=I Just Want to Share My Love for Wanda Maximoff|first=Rachel|last=Leishman|date=April 29, 2019|website=TheMarySue|access-date=October 31, 2019|archive-date=October 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031201205/https://www.themarysue.com/my-love-for-wanda-maximoff/|url-status=live}}</ref> Jen Chaney of [[Vulture Magazine|''Vulture'']] reviewed ''WandaVision'' positively, stating that "Olsen and Bettany's characters were often treated like benchwarmers on an all-star team in the Avengers movies.
