==Publication history==
The Scarlet Witch debuted, together with her brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964). After several brief appearances as a villain in issues #5 (May 1964); #6 (July 1964); #7 (Sept. 1964); & #11 (May 1965), Wanda and her brother were added to the cast of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965).  The Scarlet Witch was a semi-regular member of the team until issue #49 (Feb. 1968), and then returned in issue #75 (April 1970) and was a perennial member of both the main team and several affiliated teams (such as the [[West Coast Avengers]] and [[Force Works]]) until Avengers #503 (Dec. 2004), the final issue of the first volume.

The Scarlet Witch also starred in two [[limited series]] with husband and fellow Avenger the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]: ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #1 - 4 (Nov. 1982 - Feb. 1983), by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciller]] [[Rick Leonardi]], and a second volume of the same title numbered #1 - 12 (Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986), written by [[Steve Englehart]] and penciled by Richard Howell.  A solo limited series, titled simply ''Scarlet Witch'', ran four issues in 1994.

The character played a pivotal role in the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline and related limited series ''[[House of M]]'', and is currently appearing in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

[[Don Markstein]] asserted that the character was unlike another, and stated that "...The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a [[wimple]]. Her super power is unlike any other — she can alter probability so as to cause mishaps for her foes. In other words, she "hexes" them." <ref>{{Cite web|last= Markstein|first= Don D.|title= The Scarlet Witch|publisher= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|url= http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|accessdate= 10 July 2010}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Magda — pregnant with the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]], after seeing her husband [[Magneto (comics)|Magnus]] use his magnetic powers for the first time.  The twins are born, and as Mt. Wundagore is the prison of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], his residual energies alter Wanda and will later give her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities. Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bova]]. Bova soon assists the [[World War II]] superheroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America loses her own life in the process.  These complications are thought to be due to [[radiation poisoning]] deliberately caused by the villain [[Isbisa]], the enemy of Miss America's husband Robert Frank, AKA [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]]. Bova hides the truth from Frank and claims that only the mother has died, and that he now has twin children. Frank is shocked at the death of his wife and flees at super speed.<ref name="Avengers' 1979">''Avengers'' #185 - 187 (July - Sept. 1979)</ref> As Wundagore was no place for human infants, the High Evolutionary places them in the care of the [[Romani people|gypsies]] Django and Marya Maximoff, who raise the twins as their own children. The twins are forced to flee a mob when Wanda uses her powers to protect herself and accidentally causes a fire that kills their adoptive gypsy mother.<ref>Recounted in ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #1 - 12 (Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986)</ref>

===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
Once Pietro (Quicksilver) and Wanda (The Scarlet Witch) reach adolescence, they discover that they are in fact mutants. Pietro possesses [[superhuman]] speed, while Wanda learns that she can control probability. When the pair display their powers in public, and are again attacked by a superstitious crowd, they are saved by their father — now the supervillain Magneto — although neither Magneto nor his children are aware of their connection. Magneto then recruits the pair for the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Brotherhood battles the [[X-Men]] on several occasions,<ref>''X-Men'' #5 (May 1964); #6 (July 1964) & #7 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and the twins become reluctant members of the Brotherhood and only remain because of their obligation to Magneto.  When Magneto and his lackey [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] are abducted by the cosmic entity [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], the Brotherhood dissolves and the twins declare that their debt to Magneto has been paid.<ref>''X-Men'' #11 (May 1965)</ref>

===Avengers===
Soon after Magneto's abduction, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch are recruited by the hero [[Iron Man]] to join The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Along with [[Captain America]] as leader, and former villain [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the four become the second generation of The Avengers and are later dubbed as "Cap's Kooky Quartet".<ref>"Avengers #16 (May 1965)</ref>

Wanda becomes close friends with Hawkeye and a loyal member of the team until she is accidentally shot on a mission against Magneto. Quicksilver then flees from the Avengers with his wounded sister.<ref>''Avengers'' #49 (Feb. 1968)</ref> The pair accompany Magneto back to his mid-Atlantic base,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #43 (Apr. 1968)</ref> and Wanda spends the next few weeks recovering from her wound. She watches as Magneto captures the X-Men<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #44 (May 1968)</ref> and Pietro skirmishes with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], one of the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #45 (Jun. 1968)</ref> and later [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' #71 (Apr. 1969)</ref> After these encounters, the twins finally realize that Magneto is the true villain. Wanda and Pietro are then kidnapped along with several other mutants by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but are subsequently freed by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #59 - 60 (Aug - Sept. 1969)</ref>

Quicksilver later returns to the Avengers and advises them that Wanda has been kidnapped and taken to another dimension by the warlord [[Arkon]].<ref>''Avengers'' #75 - 76 (April - May 1970)</ref> After being rescued, Wanda — together with Pietro — rejoins the team. The Scarlet Witch then falls in love with teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], an android originally created as a weapon by Avenger's foe [[Ultron]]. Before long, the two develop a romantic relationship.<ref name="Avengers #109 March 1973">''Avengers'' #109 (March 1973)</ref> Their relationship has a tumultuous start as both Quicksilver and Hawkeye object — Quicksilver cannot accept the idea that his sister loves a robot while Hawkeye loves Wanda himself.<ref name="Avengers #109 March 1973">''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)</ref> Despite this, the pair eventually marry with the blessing of the entire team.<ref name="Giant-Size Avengers' 1975">''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975)</ref>

The Scarlet Witch begins to become frustrated with the fluctuating level of her mutant ability, and is tutored by a true witch, [[Agatha Harkness]]. The training allows Wanda even greater control over her hexes<ref>''Avengers'' #128 - 137 (Oct. 1974 - July 1975)</ref> and this proves invaluable in battle against foes such as Ultron.<ref>''Avengers'' #161 (Jul. 1977)</ref> Wanda and Pietro also met Robert Frank, who briefly joins the Avengers, believing them to be his children.<ref>Whizzer joins unofficially as of ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (1974)</ref> This is later disproved when Wanda and Pietro are abducted by Django Maximoff and taken to Wundagore. Wanda is temporarily possessed by the [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], but after being released is advised by Bova that neither Frank nor Maximoff is their biological father.<ref name="Avengers' 1979"/> Soon after, while trying to track down Magda one last time, Magneto would learn that he was the father of the twins. He immediately informed them of their relationship shortly after the birth of Pietro's daughter Luna.<ref>''Vision and Scarlet Witch #4 ()</ref> The Scarlet Witch and Vision take a leave of absence from the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)</ref> settling in the town of [[Leonia, New Jersey]],<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol.1, #1 (Nov. 1982)</ref> and courtesy of Wanda's enhanced power conceive twin boys named Thomas and William.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #3 (Dec. 1985)</ref> Wanda gives birth,<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #12 (Sept. 1986)</ref> and, with Vision, eventually leaves the east coast to join the [[West Coast Avengers]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #34 (Aug. 1988)</ref> needing some time away from the main team after Vision becomes unbalanced and tries to take over the world's computers.<ref>Climaxed in ''Avengers'' #254 (April 1985)</ref>

Their relationship is almost ended when Avenger Mockingbird betrays the team and helps a coalition of the world governments kidnap and dismantled Vision, having viewed him as a threat to humanity. Although rebuilt, Vision is recreated as a colorless, emotionless synthezoid.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #42 - 45 (March - June 1989)</ref> Wanda's agitation is increased when [[Wonder Man]] - whose brain patterns were the model for the Vision - refuses to repeat the process and "humanize" Vision, as he is secretly in  love with the Scarlet Witch and sees an opportunity for himself.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #45 (Jun. 1989)</ref> Now desperate, the Scarlet Witch consults a Dean of Robotics in the state of Texas, who secretly manages a mutant research facility.

Wanda is, however, rescued by her teammates with the assistance of Captain America and [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #47 - 49 (Aug. - Sept. 1989)</ref>

Another personal setback follows when it is revealed that Wanda's children are in fact two missing shards of the soul of the demonic entity [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Absorbed back into Mephisto, Wanda's mentor Agatha Harkness temporarily erases Wanda's memories of her children from her mind in order to ensure that she can temporarily disrupt Mephisto's physical form.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #51-52 (Nov. - Dec. 1989)</ref>  Combined with Wanda being captured and mind controlled as a bride of the serpent god Set,<ref>Avengers Annual #20, Avengers West Coast Annual #5</ref>  Vision announcing his intent to relocate to the East Coast Avengers,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #53 (Mid Dec. 1989)</ref> and Magneto seeking to recruit Wanda into a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #55 - 57, #60 (Feb. - Apr. 1990)</ref> Wanda begins to go into and out of various catatonic states. It is then ultimately revealed that Immortus was behind these attacks on Wanda, as he sought to destroy Wanda's life so that he could steal her away and transform her into a power source, tapping into the temporal nexus energy she possessed. The Avengers ultimately rescue Wanda, who regains her memories of her children in the process (Avengers West Coast #61-#62).

However, Immortus's actions leave Wanda's hex power drained and highly unreliable as far as not working most of the time .<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #65-68, 89-90</ref> Turning to Agatha Harkness and Doctor Strange for help, Wanda eventually discovers a way to reignite her powers .<ref>''Darkhold'' #5-6</ref>  Wanda is ultimately nominated as leader of the Avengers West Coast team <ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #98</ref> and during a fight with Satanish and the Hangman, Mockingbird (in truth a Skrull imposture) is killed, taking a blast meant to kill Wanda.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #100</ref>

When the West Coast team is dissolved by the main team due to internal disputes<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #102 (Jan. 1994)</ref> Wanda goes on to lead a breakaway team called [[Force Works]].<ref>''Force Works'' #1 (July 1994)</ref> The team suffers several setbacks, including the death of Wonder Man on the first mission.<ref>''Force Works'' #2 (Aug. 1994)</ref> When the team splinters after the last mission involving [[Kang the Conqueror]],<ref>''Force Works'' #22 (April 1996)</ref> the Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye return to the main team.<ref>''Avengers'' #397 (April 1996)</ref>

As Wanda attempts to reconcile with Vision, the Scarlet Witch sought out help from Doctor Doom to see if he can help her restore her children to life. To do so, they summon a mysterious cosmic entity which merges with Scarlet Witch and resurrects her children into new bodies. However, the entity opts to hide the children from Wanda as it hides within her body <ref name="Avengers Children Crusade #7">Avengers Children Crusade #7</ref>

Vision and Scarlet Witch reconcile shortly before sacrificing themselves with the other Avengers and the [[Fantastic Four]] to stop the mutant villain [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>''Onslaught: Marvel Universe'' (1996)</ref> Due to the intervention of [[Franklin Richards]], Scarlet Witch and her teammates exist in a parallel universe for a year,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 - 13 (Nov. 1996 - Dec. 1997)</ref> until being returned to the mainstream universe by Franklin.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' #1 - 4 (Sept. - Dec. 1997)</ref>

Shortly after the heroes return, Scarlet Witch is kidnapped by the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], with the intention of using Wanda's powers to warp reality in le Fay's image. Although successful, Wanda retaliates by restoring Captain America's memories, who in turn is able to restore several Avengers' memories. Wanda also accidentally resurrects Wonder Man, who assists in her escape. Although the Avengers defeat le Fay, Vision is damaged in the final battle when Le Fay destroys the lower half of his body. Vision is placed in a surgical repair device, and via [[holography|hologram]] communicates with Wanda and asks her not to visit him while he heals.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 - 4 (Feb. - April 1998)</ref>

An upset Wanda visits Agatha Harkness and learns that she is now able to channel [[chaos magic]], which will allow her to change reality. In truth though, the entity that resurrected her children has boosted her magical powers to the point that she can now rewrite reality itself as well as harness the unstable chaos energy.<ref name="Avengers Children Crusade #7"/>  After much deliberation and still hurting from Vision's rejection, Wanda resurrects Wonder Man and the two become lovers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #10 (Nov. 1997)</ref> Vision is eventually repaired and once Wonder Man dumped Wanda,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #51 (April 2002)</ref> Vision resumes a relationship with her.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #57</ref> Her ability to channel chaos magic culminates when the villain  [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] splits the cosmic entity the [[In-Betweener]] into his separate order and chaos personas and Wanda has to reassemble the entity.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #58 - 60 (June - Aug. 2002)</ref>

===Avengers Disassembled===
{{Main|Avengers Disassembled}}
The entity inside Wanda slowly begins to dominate her mind, as it tries to begin a relationship with Captain America  only to be rejected by him.<ref>Captain America and the Falcon #1-5</ref> The entity later overhears Wasp mock Wanda's ambitions for motherhood, which drives her to confront Agatha Harkness to find her resurrected but missing children. Murdering Harkness for being unwilling to help her, Wanda (under the influence of the entity) launches a campaign of terror against the Avengers for their failure to save her children. In the end, Vision is destroyed and Hawkeye is killed (Scott Lang is presumed to be killed too, but is saved by Wanda's future self, who arranges for him to be teleported to the future seconds before dying) before Doctor Strange and the Avengers defeat Wanda, by way of using the Eye of Amagetto to cause Wanda to fall asleep. However, Magneto arrives and forces the Avengers to turn his daughter over to him.<ref>''Avengers'' #500-503 (Dec. 2004)</ref>

===House of M and Decimation===

Realizing that the Avengers and the X-Men are seriously contemplating killing his sister, due to her unstable powers, Quicksilver convinces Scarlet Witch to use her powers to create a world where everyone has their heart's desire fulfilled, complete with a world ruled by Magneto and one where the entire Maximoff family is together.<ref>House of M #7</ref> Although the reality warp succeeds, several heroes (Hawkeye, Wolverine, and Layla Miller) regain their memories and gather Earth's heroes to stop the "House of M".<ref>House of M #1-5</ref> When the heroes (who think Magneto is responsible for the warping of reality) and Magneto discover what Quicksilver did, Magneto murders his son only for Wanda to resurrect him and denounce her father and his dreams as causing nothing but misery for his children and the people he claims to want to help. As a result, Wanda uses her powers to depower 90% of the mutant population, with the proclamation of "No More Mutants".<ref>House of M #7-8</ref> For added insult, Wanda also depowers her father and brother as she retires to Wundagore to live a normal life away from everyone.<ref>House of M #8, X-Men Decimation</ref> Her final act though is to resurrect Hawkeye, who begins a frantic search for Wanda as the mysterious entity within Wanda claimed her body for itself, plunging Wanda into an amnesiac state.

===Return===
The Scarlet Witch resurfaced in the 2010-2011 miniseries ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''. In the series, it is revealed that the Scarlet Witch that has been seen was actually a Doombot, which prompted the [[Young Avengers]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to journey to [[Latveria]] with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] following behind him. [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] eventually finds the real Wanda, apparently devoid of her powers, amnesiac and engaged to be married to [[Doctor Doom]]. With Wolverine and the Avengers behind them in pursuit, the Young Avenger Iron Lad rescues the team and Wanda, teleporting them into the past where Wanda slowly regains her memory as she witnesses the corpse of Jack Of Hearts (who she reanimated into becoming a suicide bomber) approach Scott Lang, ultimately distracting the creature long enough for her children and their teammates to rescue Lang and bring him into the future. When the group returns to the present, Scarlet Witch is shown in a depression where she thinks that she killed her father, her brother, and the Avengers. She vows to kill herself with Kree ships and Ultron clones which the Young Avengers destroy. During that time, Beast and X-Factor Investigations arrive, and Beast learns that the Scarlet Witch he previously encountered was actually a Doombot. Wiccan tells her that her father, her brother, and her "sons" are still alive. Wanda acknowledges Wiccan and Speed as her children as she recruits them to undo the damage she caused to the mutant community. Beast asks her if she can reverse the "No more mutants spell". She is unsure a reverse spell would work. They meet up with X-Factor Investigations who has many clients who are depowered mutants. Rictor volunteers and has his powers restored. The X-Men show up and Wanda tells X-Factor Investigations that she will give the X-Men whatever they want.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #6</ref> However, a battle ensues between the X-Men and the Avengers over what to do with Wanda forcing her and the Young Avengers to flee back to Doctor Doom. It is revealed that Wanda's enhanced powers were a result of her and Doctor Doom's combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children. This proves to be too much for Wanda to contain and it overtook her. With Wiccan and Doctor Doom's help, they seek to use the entity that is possessing Wanda to restore mutantkinds' powers. This is stopped by the Young Avengers (who are concerned at the fall-out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly repowered) only to find out Doom's real plan: to transfer the entity into his own body and gaining Wanda's god-like powers for himself.<ref>Avengers Children's Crusade #1-7</ref> Doom becomes omnipotent with powers surpasing those of beings as Beyonder or the Cosmic Cube.The Young Avengers confront him, but Doom kills Cassie just before Wanda and Wiccan stole his newfound powers.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Scarlet Witch is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who had the ability to manipulate probability via her "hexes" (often manifesting physically as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts"). These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration and despite this precision, the hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if Wanda is tired or using her powers excessively. If overextended, Wanda's hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes. Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent. These hexes would only manifest "bad luck" effects. She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects. She can use her hexes to light flammable objects, contain or remove air from a particular volume, deflect objects, stop the momentum of projectiles, open doors, explode objects, create force fields and deflect magical attacks etc. The effects are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>''Avengers'' #118 (Dec. 1973)</ref> the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Jul. 1977)</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #10 (1981)</ref> Wanda is an expert combatant having been trained by both [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], as well as being an adept tactician due to her years of experience working as an Avenger and her experience in a variety of combat situations. The Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined the Scarlet Witch's powers, and maintained that it was in fact an ability to manipulate chaos magic, activated when she was born. Busiek's redefinition upgraded Wanda's powers substantially, and she is shown as being capable of feats such as the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]]. She was here described as the "nexus being" of the Marvel Universe, capable of birthing children with power enough to challenge [[Incarnation|avatar]]s of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1-12 (1997)</ref>

Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] revamped Wanda's powers yet again, with [[Doctor Strange]] stating that there was in fact no such thing as chaos magic, and that Wanda had been altering reality all along. Her power was here depicted as sufficient to rewrite her entire universe,<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> and cause multiverse-threatening ripples.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462 - 465</ref>

When the Elder god and primeval demon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] was summoned to Earth Dimension by the power of the [[Darkhold]] and took Quicksilver as his host, he revealed that there is in fact Chaos Magic, a form of magic so dreaded and horrific that all of Earth's sorcerers made a pact to end Chthon's reign with a lie, that there is no God of Chaos and no Chaos Magic which is the basis for Chthon's unholy might. Later on after Chthon was exorcised from Quicksilver, he mentioned that he found in the Darkhold a leading text on Chaos Magic, the power which he believes is the source for his sister's insanity.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #23</ref>

Wanda's power to alter reality was spawned from the combination of her natural mutant abilities to affect probability and Chaos Magic. Because of the nature of her powers, she does not possess certain limitations such as other reality warpers such as [[Mad Jim Jaspers]] who needs existing reality to use his powers. Her powers which stemmed out from the ability to manipulate probabilities suggest that she does not need existing matter to warp reality, only possibilities which are endless. It must also be noted that the Scarlet Witch is responsible for the resurrection of Mad Jim Jaspers which happened when her powers altered reality.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Scarlet Witch appeared as a part of the Avengers in select episodes of the Captain America portion of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* The Scarlet Witch appears in the 1994 animated television series ''[[Iron Man (1994 TV series)|Iron Man]]'', voiced by Katherine Moffat in Season One and by [[Jennifer Darling]] in Season Two.<ref name="imdb.com">[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001123/]</ref> The cartoon's Scarlet Witch owes next to nothing to the comic book character: here, she is a mystical, tarot-reading spiritualist identified in the closing credits as "Wanda Frank" (an alias used by her in the comics, in which her real name is "Wanda Maximoff"), who speaks with a thick Eastern-European (or according to the [[closed captioning]], German) accent and refers to other characters as "pumpkin" and "cupcake". Her power is identified as a "hex sense," but what that ''means'' is never explained, and seems to allow her to do anything, from shape-changing to matter manipulation. In a sub-plot crafted solely for the cartoon, Spider-Woman and the Scarlet Witch vie for the affections of Iron Man.
* Scarlet Witch made both a guest and a cameo appearance in the 1990s [[X-Men (1992 TV series)|X-Men]] animated series, voiced by [[Susan Roman]]. In the episode "Family Ties", she and Quicksilver arrive on Mount Wundagore to learn of their past and ended up learning that Magneto was their father.
* Scarlet Witch appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'', voiced by Stavroula Logothettis.<ref name="imdb.com"/> Here little to no mention is made regarding her family ties to Magneto or Quicksilver, or even that she is a mutant. Her relationship with Wonder Man remains, as well as hints to feelings towards Vision. In the series, in order to activate her hex powers she must utter the phrase "Winds of Destiny, Change!" She has a heavy combination of a German and Russian accent.
* Scarlet Witch appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Kelly Sheridan]].<ref name="imdb.com"/> She was locked away in an asylum at a young age by her father, Magneto. With the help of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] she was able to breakout in order to get revenge on her father and joined the Brotherhood in an attempt to take down the X-Men on behalf of Mystique (even though she has tense feelings toward her brother, Quicksilver). Eventually, Magneto used [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] to change Wanda's memories of her father to show him in a new light, and she began seeing him as a loving father as a result. She and her brother, Quicksilver participated in the battle against [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], and saved their father. Eventually they along with the rest of the Brotherhood became members of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as seen when Professor X mentions what he had seen in Apocalypse' mind.

In the episode "Hunting Grounds", she and Nightcrawler are kidnapped by Mojo, and forced to fight a mind-controlled Wolverine on Mojovision.

In the episode "Backlash", she was present when Quicksilver appeared and argued with his father about why he cut him loose. After Quicksilver left, Magneto told Scarlet Witch to notify the MRD about where the Brotherhood of Mutants' hideout is. In the episode "Aces and Eights", Wolverine and Nightcrawler arrived on Genosha and convinced Scarlet Witch into helping them prevent [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] from stealing Magneto's helmet on Senator Kelly's orders. In the episode "Foresight" Pt. 1, Scarlet Witch is visited by Quicksilver who showed him Senator Kelly after he abducted him on his father's orders. In the episode "Foresight" Pt. 2, Scarlet Witch objected to Magneto's invasion plans after he had reprogrammed the Sentinels to attack humans. In the episode "Foresight" Pt. 3, Magneto mentions another plan to make mutants superior only for Scarlet Witch to state that she used to believe in his goals. She then tells Quicksilver that he is always welcome on Genosha, but it is no longer their father's country. Scarlet Witch then had Blink teleport Magneto and Quicksilver away.
* Scarlet Witch first appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Hexed, Vexed, and Perplexed" voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. She arrives in Super Hero City alongside Magneto and Quicksilver.

In the episode "World War Witch", Scarlet Witch trying to deflect Thanos' Time Gem ended up sending her back in time to World War II. When she tries to stop a missile launch, she gets spotted by the Red Skull and tied to a rocket only to be saved by the Invaders.
