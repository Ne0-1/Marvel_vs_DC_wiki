The '''Scarlet Witch''' ('''Wanda Lensherr Maximoff''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who was introduced as a super-villainess before reforming and becoming a [[Superhero#superheroines|superheroine]] early in her history. 

Over the years of her long-running Avengers membership, various aspects of her back story were embellished. As a character she has had three separate sets of supposed parents, until a lasting connection with super-villain Magneto was established. Her power levels have shifted and grown as well, with diverse (pseudo)scientific, demonic, magical, and physical explanations offered by different writers. She recently suffered a mental breakdown, explained as the end result of her fluctuating powers and personality over her entire history.  

Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #4 ([[1964]]). In the historic [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #16, she was recruited by Captain America along with her brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the former villain [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. For much of her Avengers career her powers involved the ability to alter [[probability]] with various degrees of success, causing random effects with force beams that were called "hexes" she projected from her hands.  Eventually she became a trained [[witchcraft|witch]], and channeled a highly dangerous form of magic known as "Chaos Magic" to augment her powers.  She is the daughter of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], twin sister of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], half-sister of [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and ex-wife of [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Birth===
[[Image:Wandapietrro.png‎|180px|thumb|right|Magda gives birth to Wanda and Pietro. Art by [[John Byrne]] and [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]]. ]]
The Scarlet Witch is the fraternal twin sister of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (Pietro Maximoff); the twins are the children of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his late wife Magda.  Magda fled from Magneto before either learned that she was pregnant.  The twins were born on [[Wundagore|Mt. Wundagore]] of  [[Transia]], the prison of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]].  Chthon's residual energies altered Wanda, giving her the ability to use magic, in addition to her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant power]].  Magda survived giving birth to the twins but days after left the refuge of the [[High Evolutionary]].  She feared that Magneto would locate her and force her to surrender the children to him.  She instead fled, and [[Comic book death|is believed to have]] chosen to commit [[suicide]] by exposing herself to the frozen wasteland surrounding the refuge.

[[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bova]], a genetically-engineered humanoid cow who served as their [[nursemaid]], decided to find foster parents for the apparent orphans. Nearby, [[World War II]] superheroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] was giving birth to her own twins.  Her husband the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] asked for Bova to assist the birth.  Mother and children died due to [[radiation poisoning]] deliberately caused by her former enemy [[Isbisa]].  Bova only reported the death of the mother, but presented the living set of twins to Whizzer as his own.  He was however shocked by the death of his wife and chose to flee as far away from Wundagore Mountain as possible.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #185-187</ref>

Bova returned the children to Wundagore.  She later found a suitable pair of foster parents in the [[Romani people|Roma]] couple Django and Marya Maximoff.  Their own children Ana and Mateo had recently died and the couple saw little Wanda and Pietro as suitable replacements.  They would raise them as their own.  Both siblings manifested powers due to [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]] in early [[adolescence]].  The Roma were however victims of [[prejudice]] by the mainstream population of Transia who considered them [[morality|immoral]].

====Orphaned====
Django was a [[doll]]-maker but had increasing difficulty in finding customers as Transians did not allow their children to approach the Roma.  He eventually resorted to stealing food in order to save his family from starvation.  Pietro took the initiative to also start stealing food.  Wanda was also introduced to prejudice when a Transian boy her age attempted to sexually molest her.  She used her powers to return to safety but was accused of attempting to seduce the boy.  Eventually, angry Transian villagers attacked the Roma and burned their wagons.  Marya Maximoff was trapped in their wagon and burned alive.  Django was clubbed to unconsciousness, but Pietro and Wanda managed to flee.  The twins were now on their own.

Wanda and Pietro considered at this point that they were the only family left to each other.  Pietro was in fact especially protective of his sister.  However, they were mistaken in their belief.  They had lost three different mothers: Magda, Miss America, and Marya Maximoff.  But their natural father, Magneto, and their adoptive fathers, Whizzer and Django Maximoff, were alive.  Eventually, all three would try to contact their children again.

===The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
[[Image:Wandabrotherhood.PNG|Wanda being rescued by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and joining the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] as the Scarlet Witch. Art by Aaron Lopresti.|left|thumb]]
One day, Wanda accidentally caused a fire with her hex powers and was almost killed by an angry mob who thought she was a witch. Her father Magneto saved her and Pietro from the mob, though none of them knew he was their father at this time.  For saving their lives, Magneto had the twins join his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], as the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Though the twins were mistrustful of humans because of their past experiences, they were not as opposed to humanity as the other members.

Wanda aided the Brotherhood on many missions, until an encounter with the X-Men and the enigmatic [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] would result in Wanda and Pietro decisively breaking with the Brotherhood at last.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #11-12</ref>

===The Avengers===
[[Image:ScarletXmen7.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Jack Kirby]] depicts a characteristic uneasy moment in Wanda's brief villainous career.]]

After Magneto's abduction by the alien [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] effectively broke up the Brotherhood, the twins relocated back to Europe but quickly returned to America with the intention of becoming Avengers and redeeming themselves for their actions while part of the Brotherhood.  They were accepted by [[Captain America]] and became part of the team alongside [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], who would become Wanda's closest friend inside the team.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #16-47</ref>

The Scarlet Witch would become one of the team's mainstays after that, and one of the most popular Avengers in the title's run.  When Roy Thomas took over the book in the late 1960s, Wanda's courtship with the synthoid [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] would become one of the book's main plotlines and become one of the most beloved romance stories of the book's franchise.  The relationship was filled with turmoil though, from Vision's feelings that Wanda deserved a lover who was human and not an android to both Quicksilver and Hawkeye's objections to the relationship (Quicksilver's due to his disdain for his sister loving a robot while Hawkeye's objections came due to his own feelings of love for Wanda).  [[Steve Englehart]]'s creation [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] also complicated things for a time, competing with Wanda as one of the potential candidates to become ''Celestial Madonna'', and like Wanda drawn to Vision's strength. As supporting characters next to the "big guns" of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America (characters who had their own titles), Vision/Scarlet Witch (like [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]/[[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]]) have been used for soap opera plots and received their primary character development over the years in Avengers-related titles.

While Hawkeye quickly got over his jealousy and gave Wanda and Vision his blessing, Quicksilver disowned his sister for her marriage and only relented when the Titanian telepath [[Moondragon]] telepathically erased Quicksilver's disdain for Vision from his mind, after witnessing Quicksilver's bigotry in full display during an argument.

Frustrated with the unreliable nature of her power, the Scarlet Witch finally underwent training in sorcery under the tutelage of a true witch, [[Agatha Harkness]].<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #128-137</ref>  The mental discipline of sorcery aided Wanda's powers of concentration, enabling her to exercise much greater control over her mutant "hexes" than ever before.  She also learned that she had been blessed with an affinity for chaos magic. 

Wanda would ultimately marry [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].  For some time, Wanda believed herself the daughter of the golden age super-hero, the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], (''[[Avengers (comics)|Giant-Size Avengers]]'' #1).  The revelation that Magneto was her biological father has been a source of much anger for Wanda, as she still harbors anger and fear towards him from their time together in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. (''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4, 1982). Ultimately while attempting to avenge the apparent death of Agatha Harkness, Wanda received an infusion of magic power that allowed her to became pregnant with twins, Thomas and William.  She and the Vision retired from their careers as super-heroes to raise their children, but came out of retirement to join the Avengers West Coast.

===The West Coast Avengers===
[[Image:Vsw3.png|right|thumb|Cover to ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #3.  Art by Richard Howell.]]

Wanda's happiness would be short-lived: Vision was kidnapped and nearly destroyed by a multi-national coalition of countries who were angry at his attempted takeover of the world through computers several years earlier.  Vision was rebuilt, but his memory was blank, his body a ghostly white, and his human personality and emotions utterly erased. Wanda's family was damaged beyond repair.

Wanda sought the one man who had a hope of restoring her husband's mind (even partially), his "brother" [[Wonder Man]].  Wonder Man's memory template had been used as the basis for Vision's mind years ago. Wonder Man was jealous of Vision's relationship with Wanda and felt that he should have Vision's place in her life.  Wonder Man received support from Wasp in this notion, as the childless Wasp had grave doubts about Wanda's children.  She counseled Wonder Man not to allow his brainwave patterns to be used to restore Vision.  Meanwhile, Wanda's children began to blink in and out of existence, frightening the various nannies Wanda hired to help her watch her twins. Agatha Harkness returned; she had survived her apparent death but had been in hiding. She had new insight on Wanda's children. 

Agatha revealed that the energies used by Wanda to conjure her children into existence were fragmented portions of the soul of the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].  Mephisto, through his minion Master Pandemonium, kidnapped Wanda's children and reabsorbed them into his being.  With Thomas and William having effectively ceased to exist (inasmuch as they had ever truly existed in the first place) Agatha made a controversial move that would bear bitter fruit years later: she erased all of Wanda's memories of the twins in order to release her from despair and allow the Avengers to escape from Mephisto's realm. 

A guilt-ridden Wonder Man finally attempted to give his brainwave patterns to Vision, but his tardy offer was rejected.  Enough time had passed since Vision's reconstruction to allow an emotionless, logic-driven personality to emerge and this personality felt no connection whatsoever with Wanda, even after Wanda was kidnapped as part of the [[Atlantis Attacks]] crossover. 

After rescuing her, Vision showed little concern for his mentally fragile wife, revealing that he was returning to the group's East Coast branch.  Vision coldly stated that the East Coast team, which had lost several members, needed Vision more than his wife did, despite her pleas. A devastated Wanda had a complete nervous breakdown, making her vulnerable to a renewed bid by Magneto to reform the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants alongside Quicksilver. 

The family reunion was brief, however, as Quicksilver quickly revealed that he only played along in order to protect his emotionally damaged sister from Magneto.  As the Avengers launched a rescue mission, Wanda fell into a trance and was kidnapped by [[Immortus]].  He revealed that he manipulated Wanda's entire relationship with Vision, in order to render Wanda emotionally vulnerable enough that he might easily use her as a vessel for a large amount of "Nexus" energy. Her probability powers made her a conduit for multiple parallel timelines. She was ultimately rescued and returned to the Avengers West Coast with help from Agatha Harkness, freed from the clutches of either Magneto or Immortus. 

Wanda remained on the Avengers West Coast, her friendship with Hawkeye helping her deal with the destruction of her marriage and the loss of her children (Wanda's memories of the twins were shown to be restored in ''[[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]] Annual'' #7 and also referenced several times in Kurt Busiek's run in Avengers Volume 3).  Adventures as a hero and a team player augmented her leadership skills. She also worked on her powers again, as they began to fluctuate due to a spike in the chaos magic energies of the Marvel Universe. 

Wanda eventually became the leader of the West Coast Avengers, just as her estranged husband Vision arranged for the group's dissolution.  Wanda went on to become a founding member and field leader of the short-lived superhero team [[Force Works]].  Her relationship with Wonder Man remained on very tense terms but came to an abrupt end when [[Wonder Man]] died during Force Works' first adventure. 

Wanda and Hawkeye rejoined the Avengers when Force Works disbanded.  Wanda and Vision (now having regained his emotions and memories of their marriage) even attempted to reconcile, but the two were quickly forced to "sacrifice" their lives to stop the evil that was [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].  They were exiled instead alongside their fellow Avengers and Fantastic Four members into an alternate reality for a year before returning to Earth.

===Heroes Return===
When she did return, Wanda was promptly kidnapped again by the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], with the intention of using Wanda's powers to warp reality in her image (using a stolen Asgardian relic). To escape her clutches, Wanda restores Captain America's memories (who proceeds to restore other Avenger's memories, similar to the storyline in House of M) and eventually accidentally resurrected Wonder Man, now in an energy-based form. [http://www.comics101.com/comics101//?mode=project&action=view&project=Comics%20101&chapter=50 [1] During the final battle, Wanda watched helplessly as Vision was mortally wounded yet again. Le Fay destroyed the lower half of his body.  Vision was still functional but put into a surgical repair device designed to fix his body.  Communicating with his wife via hologram, the two had a tense confrontation where a distraught Vision begged Wanda to not visit him while he was in his damaged state.  Vision would later state that he didn't want to put Wanda through any additional trauma caused by his injuries, but his actions put an end to their marriage for good.

Around this time, Wanda visited Agatha Harkness and learned that her mutant powers were evolving to the point that she was able to channel Chaos Magic, a feat that was generally considered dangerous by most magicians.  According to Agatha, Wanda could do just about anything with this magic, including raising the dead.  After much deliberation and still hurting from Vision's rejection, she gave Wonder Man her love and restored him to life. 

The two became lovers, openly carrying on their affair in front of a restored Vision, who fled the Avengers briefly after a confrontation in which Wonder Man declared ''himself'' "the victim" in the three-way love triangle.  Wanda waited for Simon to take their relationship to the next level.  Unfortunately, while held prisoner by Kang, Wanda broke up with Wonder Man, whose dreams of the future did not include marriage and children.

When writer Geoff Johns took over the Avengers book in 2002, Vision and Scarlet Witch reconciled off-panel and attempted once again to rebuild their relationship.  Meanwhile, Wanda's use of Chaos Magic began to heavily affect her. She became consumed with chaos energy as a side effect of the mysterious Scorpio splitting the cosmic being the [[In-Betweener]] into the two aspects of his order and chaos based powers.

===JLA/Avengers===
Wanda being consumed by Chaos Magic was further explored in the much-anticipated ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' crossover, which had Wanda tap into the highly dangerous (and powerful) chaos magic of the DC Universe, which is normally only controlled by [[Lords of Chaos and Order|the Lords of Chaos]]. She proved barely able to utilise the magic, and the attempt caused her visible physical damage. Her unauthorized use of Chaos Magic mystified and enraged the Lords, according to [[Zatanna]].

On her return to 616 Marvel Earth, Scarlet Witch was reluctantly drawn into a battle between Captain America and an evil, government-sponsored doppelganger (''Captain America & the Falcon'' #7).  During their team-up, Captain America found himself attracted to Wanda, but didn't act upon his feelings.

===Avengers Disassembled===

After the Avengers returned from events in England, Janet Van Dyne, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], entered into a romantic tryst with the wounded-but-recovering [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. While discussing the affair with Wanda, a slightly tipsy Wasp also confessed to a pregnancy scare on her part, which led to Wasp mentioning Wanda's children. The mention of her lost children, plus her growing powers, caused Wanda to suffer a mental breakdown. Wanda started rewriting reality in order to recreate her children, causing a series of threats and incidents to inexplicably occur one after the other, including the deaths of the Vision, Scott Lang, and Hawkeye.

Dr. Strange was able to determine that Wanda was the one responsible for all the incidents, and with the Avengers tracked her down to find she had created an illusion where she was having dinner with the Vision and their children. When they confronted her, she believed that they were trying to take her children away from her and started attacking them, until Dr. Strange was able to shut her mind down. Meanwhile in Genosha, Magneto heard his daughter's psychic cry for help and, using a wormhole, whisked her away before the Avengers could do anything.

===House of M===
{{main|House of M}}
[[Image:Houseofm1.jpg|225px|Variant cover to ''House of M'' #1.<br>Art by [[Joe Quesada]] and Danny Miki.|left|thumb]]
In Genosha, Magneto asked his longtime friend and nemesis [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] to help Wanda. Unfortunately, Xavier refused to do so as Wanda attempted to restore her husband to life and undo the damage she had caused. Keeping Wanda in a comatose state, Xavier ultimately called a meeting between the Avengers and X-Men to decide whether or not Wanda should be killed. Quicksilver was horrified at the fact that Xavier seriously considered killing Wanda and convinced Wanda to take desperate action to keep this from happening: By using her powers, Wanda warped reality into the [[House of M]], a world where mutants were the majority, humans the minority, and Magneto the ruler (simultaneously giving various other heroes what they wanted most, hoping this would prevent them rebelling). In this reality, Wanda was believed to be a human, due to an alternate body she created to represent her in public while she cared for her children in private.

A young mutant named [[Layla Miller]] (whom Dr. Strange believed was actually an aspect of Wanda's psyche, but later revealed to be a deformed mutant who was given a normal body thanks to Wanda's reality warp) was able to use her mutant abilities to restore several of the heroes' memories. Meanwhile [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and a resurrected [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] gathered these heroes into an assault force to try to restore reality. This rag-tag army headed to Genosha to attack Magneto, believing him to be the one responsible for the change. During the battle between Magneto's forces and the others, Layla was able to restore Magneto's memories; as well, Wanda confessed to Dr. Strange that it was Quicksilver, not Magneto, who had initiated the reality warp. 

Enraged, Magneto confronted Quicksilver, angry that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name. Quicksilver told Magneto that he would have let Wanda die. Magneto replied that Quicksilver had only used him and Wanda. He then killed Quicksilver.

===="No More Mutants"====
Wanda revived her brother, telling Magneto that Quicksilver had only wanted him to be happy and that Magneto had ruined them, choosing the mutants over his own children. She further denounced Xavier and in three words ("No more mutants") Wanda changed the world back to its original form but adding the mass depowering of 98% of the entire mutant population, thus being responsible for many deaths as shown in the ''[[Generation M (comics)|Generation M]]'' mini-series. Surviving mutants and ex-mutants now refer to this as "M-Day: The worst day in mutant history."

After the fallout, Wanda was missing and was last seen in a small, unknown European village, happy and in a state of peace.

===Post-House of M===

The resurrected Hawkeye/Clint Barton tracks Wanda to a small city near Wundagore Mountain, where he unknowingly saves her from a thief.  Wanda has been living in a small apartment with her only relative, her "Aunt Agatha" (who is never seen, but could possibly a manifestation of Wanda's now-dead mentor Agatha Harkness). She appears to be powerless and believes that she has lived her entire life in the city, and does not recognize Hawkeye, nor does she remember being a part of the Avengers or other events. Wanda tells Hawkeye that he was her "hero" for dealing with the thief and kisses him, and they spend the night together. The following morning, while Wanda is sleeping, Hawkeye becomes curious about the next room where "Aunt Agatha" is supposedly sleeping, but the doorknob appears to shift away from his hands, a subtle reality manipulation usually associated with the Scarlet Witch.  However, Clint looks back to see that Wanda is still asleep.

===Endangered Species===

Still on his journey to research the events of M-Day, Beast travels to Transia where he meets Wanda on the streets.  Similar to Clint's meeting with Wanda, she still does not remember anything of her life as the Scarlet Witch.  Beast and Wanda sit down for tea where he speaks to her about his research, and Wanda ironically states she "doesn't believe in Magic."  Beast tries to tell Wanda who she was and what she has done, but she simply dismisses the topic and leaves.

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, the Scarlet Witch had the ability to manipulate [[probability]] via her "hexes" (often manifesting physically as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts").  These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight.  Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration.  Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent.  These hexes would only manifest random "[[luck|bad luck]]" effects: objects falling or breaking, people tripping, and so on.  She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects.  Despite this enhanced precision, her hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if she has been straining herself or using her powers excessively.  If overextended, her hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes.

[[Image:ScarletAvengers149.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Scarlet Witch in action, employing magic to augment her mutant hex. Art by [[George Pérez]] and [[Sam Grainger]].]]

Her hexes seem to have a wide, almost limitless variety of recorded and possible effects, though they often boil down to a kind of ''[[Deus ex machina]]'' superpower.  They have been known to alter the molecular composition and physical state of objects, to negate or distort physical laws, and to cause various forms of energy to spontaneously appear or disappear.  She has an affinity with natural elements and phenomena, stemming largely from her magical training under [[Agatha Harkness]], and has trained often at using her hexes to deflect projectiles or to cause enemies to stumble or otherwise suffer the effects of "bad luck".  

Though her powers resemble [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], her probability-altering powers are more than enough to allow her to transform energy around her into "energy bolts", or even to grant Wanda short flight capability (the latter seen in [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #153). Although her hexes can cause objects to suddenly move or change course, they do not have the ability to "hold on" to objects as a telekinetic might.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}  Ultimately, the hexes are not under the Witch's direct control, although she can influence the nature of their effects with great concentration and effort.  This makes her one of the few Avengers that [[Ultron]] fears; his [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] shell cannot repel her magic.  She has displayed the ability to cancel [[Longshot]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]'s powers of probability {{issue}}. 

The first major reclassification of Wanda's fairly-indistinct hex powers came during [[Kurt Busiek]]'s run on ''Avengers'', where her power was claimed by Agatha Harkness to be an ability to manipulate chaos magic, given to her by the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] (imprisoned within Wundagore Mountain) when she was born.  Her hexes were, by extension, simple, indirect manifestations of this magic, destabilizing probabilities by inducing [[chaos (physics)|chaos]].  Across Busiek's run, Wanda's powers grew continuously, as she gained the ability to manipulate organic matter and summon [[Wonder Man]] back to life.  While in the [[DC Universe]] (during the ''JLA/Avengers'' crossover), she displayed the ability to access that universe's chaos magic, but had great difficulty in doing so at first, since it was much more powerful than that of [[Earth-616|616]].

The second redefinition of Wanda's powers came under the writing of Brian Michael Bendis, whose final Avengers story [[Avengers Disassembled]] declared all previous explanations about Wanda's powers to be lies or mistakes and recast her as an insane [[reality warping]] mutant whose powers work on an unconscious level.  While it was implied by [[Immortus]] that Wanda possessed the potential for such, when he turned Wanda into a "Nexus Battery"{{issue}}, Immortus specifically claimed that Wanda could only manipulate past [[alternate history|alternate timeline]]s.  Her powers were used by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fey]] to alter reality in ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1-3, although this was only accomplished through a much more complicated spell that involved a slew of magical artifacts that actually brought about the warping of reality with Wanda simply used as a power source.

Under Bendis' definition, the Scarlet Witch's powers are not fully under her conscious control, and their effects persist even after [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] shut down her mind.  There seem to be no limits to her powers during [[House of M]], as she was easily able to alter the entire [[Earth-616]] reality at will, and is also altering reality on a multiversal scale without even realizing what she had done, though certain of her victims claim to be able to discern the difference between reality and her spells. In the House of M storyline, Wanda also showed that she could paralyze other mutant's powers. She also possessed the ability to fly.

Wanda's ability to channel and wield magical energy was brought about by the demonic sorcerer [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]].  On the day that Wanda was born, the ghostly spectre of Chthon visited the newborn Wanda and "blessed" Wanda so that Wanda could channel the dangerous Chaos Magic that was the basis for Chthon's unholy might.  Chthon's intentions were to create a vessel that he could possess one day, when Wanda was a full-grown adult, though his schemes to do so were foiled by the Avengers.  

Due to Chthon's "blessing", Wanda is also vulnerable to having all of her powers disabled if Chthon is ever disrupted.  During the period in which pages from Chthon's sacred tome, the [[Darkhold]], were scattered across the globe, Wanda's powers were periodically disabled -- with her being left powerless in several dangerous battles against various super-villains -- until several of the missing pages were restored to the book. Although this explanation was given by Agatha Harkness after possibly being reanimated by Wanda. Whether it was true or how much of it is more unconscious manifestations of the Wanda's reality manipulation is up to the reader's preference  

Wanda has also been trained in hand-to-hand combat by both Captain America and Hawkeye, and evinces, when sane, the experience and leadership skills that come from years of active duty as an Avenger.

Scarlet Witch has immense power, capable of manipulating Earth 616 and alternate timelines, however it seems as though she depowered herself as well after Decimation.

====Magical progeny====
In ''[[Young Avengers]]'', the characters Tommy Shepherd ([[Speed (comics)|Speed]]) and Billy Kaplan ([[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]]) look almost exactly alike. Wiccan has abilities similar to the Scarlet Witch, while Tommy has Quicksilver's superspeed. Their names, Thomas and William, are the same names of the Scarlet Witch's twins. The Super Skrull, upon meeting the two, assumed they were her children. Although it is not public knowledge that the Scarlet Witch had any children, the Super Skrull claimed, through Skrull Intelligence, that he knew they existed.

The new Vision used the previous Vision's memory files to explain that the Scarlet Witch created her children from two lost souls. When Mephisto was destroyed by Franklin Richards, two of his fragments became Wanda's twin sons. When Mephisto claimed those souls as his own to restore himself, they caused Mephisto to be destroyed when he absorbed them, setting the souls free. Wiccan theorized that when the souls were set free they formed into the people that became Speed and himself. This remains Billy's theory, however [[Allan Heinberg]]'s plans for the new 'season' involved the two searching for Wanda and the true source of their powers [http://www.prismcomics.org/display.php?id=1233].

==Other versions==
===1602===
In ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', the Scarlet Witch character is '''Sister Wanda''', a [[nun]] working for [[Inquisition|Inquisitor]] Enrique (Magneto). The full extent of her powers is unrevealed but she was able to sense and banish the astral form of [[Doctor Strange#1602|Stephen Strange]]. After they are revealed as Witchbreed (mutants), the Inquisitor leaves her and her brother Petros in the care of Carlos Javier (Professor X), on condition he never reveals that Enrique is their father.

===Age of Apocalypse===
During the [[Age of Apocalypse]], The Scarlet Witch was a member of Magneto's X-Men. She died while defending the X-Men's base on Wundagore Mountain from an attack by [[Holocaust (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Nemesis]].<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1</ref>

===Exiles===
[[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] is a former member of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate-reality]] traveling [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], but is now a member of [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]]. Like all members of the Exiles she is from an alternate dimension, and in her dimension the Scarlet Witch married [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. Nocturne is the daughter of the Scarlet Witch and the Nightcrawler of [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Exiles|that reality]].

===Heroes Reborn===
Scarlet Witch was one of the Avengers in the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, in which she was raised by Agatha Harkness. The Asgardian sorceress [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] falsely claimed to be her mother.

===[[Marvel Zombies]]===
Another version of Scarlet Witch appears on an Earth undersiege by zombie superhumans. She helps [[Ash Williams|Ash]] find the [[Necronomicon]]. She is killed in the siege of Doctor Doom's castle by [[Punisher#Other versions|The Punisher]].

===MC2===
An older version of the Scarlet Witch first appeared in the [[MC2]] universe, during the short-lived [[A-Next]] series.  The original team of Avengers disbanded following a disastrous battle with their evil counterparts in an alternate universe. For several years afterward, Scarlet Witch remained in suspended animation beneath Avengers Mansion powering a gate to this world. Eventually, she was freed by the next generation of Avengers, although she remained in a coma for some time afterward. When the mad god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], the evil half-brother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], chose to avenge his earlier defeats, he took Wanda out of her coma to act as one of his "puppets".  Wanda was eventually released from said spell, and later chose to return into action as part of [[A-Next]].  No mentioning of Quicksilver has been made so far in the MC2 universe, and Wanda currently appears sporadically in the [[Spider-Girl]] series. The [[Crimson Curse]] modeled her appearance on the older heroine.

===New X-Men vs. New Brotherhood===
In this comic, Wanda is an old member of the Brotherhood and joins the X-Men but falls off a cliff due to a teleporting spell. Her brother Pietro Quicksilver blames the X-men for the incident but is killed by Jean Grey

===Silver Sorceress===
In 1971, [[DC Comics]] introduced a group of superheros called the [[Champions of Angor]] who resembled the Avengers at the same time Marvel introduced [[Squadron Supreme]], which resembled the characters in the [[Justice League]].  The characters were reintroduced with a slightly different background in the [[Justice League International]] in 1987.  The [[Silver Sorceress]] is the DC Comics pastiche of the Scarlet Witch.  She possessed magical powers and served in the JLI and then the [[Justice League Europe|JLE]] until she died defeating [[Dreamslayer]] in 1991.

===Ultimate Scarlet Witch===

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Wanda Lensherr Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, is the daughter of Magneto and the sister of Quicksilver. She has the ability to alter probability fields with her hexes. Wanda was a member of Magneto's team, the Brotherhood of Mutants. Following her father's apparent death, she and Quicksilver helped lead the Brotherhood for a while, attempting to steer it away from her father's mutant supremacist ideals and keeping in touch with [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] to promote a more peaceful mutant-human integration. During this time, they participated in the rescue of the [[Ultimate X-Men]] from [[Weapon X]].

The twins even agreed to work for the [[Ultimates]] in exchange for the release of imprisoned Brotherhood members, although [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] kept them in the black ops division of the team because of their terrorist past. 

When Magneto returned and took back leadership of the Brotherhood, she and her brother fled to the [[Ultimates#headquarters|Triskelion]] (homebase of the Ultimates) although their father caught up to them. Magneto injured Quicksilver for "neutering" his Brotherhood, but left Wanda unhurt. Following that, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver  were finally elevated to public status on the Ultimates since there was now proof that the two were loyal to the government and not to their terrorist father.

She and her brother are often depicted touching each other very intimately and performing activities that couples usually do (e.g., a gondola ride where Pietro reads romantic poetry to Wanda); that scene and the fact that they often call each other "darling" has led to fan speculation that the two share an [[incest]]uous relationship (which is more or less confirmed by the first issue of Ultimates Vol. 3). In Issue #6 of Ultimates Volume 2, writer Mark Millar alludes to her relationship with Vision; [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] attempts to redeem himself by bringing two androids, named Ultron and Vision II, to the Ultimates.  Wanda takes notice of Vision to which Quicksilver asks  "Were you just flirting with that machine?"

In Issue #7 of Ultimates 2, Wanda exerts her power by stealing [[nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]] from Iran, as she did in Pakistan during a previous storyline in Ultimate X-Men. Later, in Issue #9, she is defeated after being overwhelmed by the massive numbers of the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]]' super-soldier army. At the end of that story arc in Issue #12, she is able to use her powers to summon a completely restored [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] to "kick [[Loki (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Universe|Loki]]'s ass". In issue 13, she asks Vision out for a date, when her brother Quicksilver is not around.

During the Issue #1 of Ultimates 3, Wanda dons a more revealing costume, (similar to the one she wore while in the Brotherhood). When Captain America suggests that she change her outfit, Quicksilver angrily threatens to kill him. In the closing moments of the issue, she is shot in the chest and seemingly killed by an unidentified assailant.

====Powers and abilities====
It has been indicated in ''The Ultimates 2'' series that the Ultimate Scarlet Witch actually has to "do the math" in order to use her powers--i.e., that she has to calculate the mathematical probability that the effect she intends to create will actually happen; the more unlikely the effect, the more complex the mathematic formula, and the more difficult and time-consuming it will be to make the effect happen{{issue}}.

Ultimate Scarlet Witch seems to be more powerful at a conscious level than her 616 counter-part. This may be due to training since she was raised in a terrorist environment and joined the super-human military afterwards. Unlike her 616 counterpart she can fly, change objects at will, create force fields, can transport any object apparently to anywhere she can think of ([[Ultimate X-Men]] #64). She has once turned [[Ultimate Longshot|Longshot]] into a cat ([[Ultimate X-Men]] #62).The downside seems to be that she needs to be consciously aware of what she needs/wants to affect. In the 616 universe her 'luck' powers seemed to emanate from her, while in this universe she needs to not only concentrate but also use her hands, since she was easily disabled by Colossus when he held her hands behind her back in Ultimate X-Men #64.

===''Ultimate Spider-Man'' cameo===
During the time ''House of M'' was released, [[Brian Michael Bendis]] referenced it in his Ultimate title, ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', by having a scene in its eighty-first issue where a woman dressed in the [[Earth-616|616]] Scarlet Witch's uniform is dragged away by police, screaming "I'm not crazy! I'm not craaaaaazzzzzy!", just as Wanda herself protested frequently to Charles Xavier near the beginning of [[House of M]].

=== ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:XMWanda.jpg|195px|left|thumb|Scarlet Witch - ''[[X-Men Evolution]]''.]] -->
Committed to an institution by her father Magneto when she was just a child due to his inability to take care of her, Wanda harbored a patricidal hatred for him; he claims it necessary because of her uncontrollable, dangerous powers (when asked about what specific event led to Magneto institutionalizing Wanda, ''X-Men: Evolution'''s head writer Greg Johnson stated that "There was no specific event. It was just years of him trying to handle a hostile, out of control child whose powers were promising to be very destructive if he didn't get her put away." [http://x-men.toonzone.net/qagreg2.php]).  Freed from the institution by Mystique, she joined the Brotherhood in return.  Wanda was more interested in revenge against her father than in fighting for the Brotherhood's cause.  During the days after, she trained with Agatha Harkness and gained control of her powers, which she demonstrated to great effect against the X-Men, handing them their first real loss to the Brotherhood.  It was in this episode that she was referred to as the Scarlet Witch for the only time in the series. 

Wanda then teamed up with the X-Men for the Day of Reckoning, nearly killing Magneto in revenge with a falling [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]].  She failed, and nearly fell to her death, but was saved by Nightcrawler.  Following this, she and Toad (who'd developed a crush on her) confirmed Magneto's survival. After the Brotherhood (sans the traitorous Quicksilver) returned home, Wanda left them to search for Magneto, even going to [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] of the Morlocks for help.  She failed to locate him until returning to her teammates, when she found her brother in charge.  Wanda managed to find her father, but Magneto used his latest recruit [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] to rewrite her memories, removing her hatred of him and causing her to forget having been committed.  Toad and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] rescued her from Magneto's base, and she returned to the Brotherhood.

When Magneto was "killed" by Apocalypse, Wanda took the news quite hard and blamed the X-Men for not helping her father.  After learning that he was in fact alive, having become one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen, she joined Shadowcat's team in Mexico to confront her father and destroy one of Apocalypse's [[Pyramid]]s; she was soon joined by the rest of the Brotherhood.  After the battle's end, she returned to the Brotherhood once more. 

In the future as seen by Charles Xavier while he was under Apocalypse's control, Wanda, along with [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], Toad, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], Quicksilver, and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]], has joined S.H.I.E.L.D. as a member of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

In ''X-Men Evolution'', Wanda's powers allow her to "Hex" anything and anyone in her path.  The "Hex" causes everything to do Wanda's bidding and also to turn against the victim, including objects becoming spontaneously animated and attacking the victim of the hex. She has also shown an ability to paralyze another mutant's powers or cause them to go haywire.  This could be an extension of her hex powers because she's in essence hexing a mutants powers.  Her powers in the Evolution universe made her a powerful and feared mutant.

She was voiced by [[Kelly Sheridan]].

===[[Reno 911!]]===
A recent episode of the comedy series Reno 911! featured two of the show's protaganists responding to a 911 call from a local brothel. A customer there called the police after he went to the brothel for an advertised room for men with superhero fetishes, only to find the women's costumes were not convincing. He points out that one of the prostitutes is supposed to be dressed like Scarlet Witch, and argues that Wanda wears a, "One piece with a slit at the belly, not a scarlet bikini".

===[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]===
It has been confirmed that the Scarlet Witch will appear and be voiced by [[Kate Higgins]].

==Film==
* In ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', the name "Maximoff" appears on a computer screen in list of mutant names.

==Video games==
===''X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse''===
She was also a playable character in the game ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' where she was voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. She is able to fire hexes with many effects, including turning her enemy into a box and combusting things around her into fire. It is implied throughout that she has a crush on [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], a mission briefing providing one example. Much like her 616 counterpart, she isn't particularly evil and doesn't have nearly as much of a bias against the X-Men or humans. Her reason for being in the Brotherhood is simply to keep an eye on her father.

==Toys==
The Scarlet Witch was part of a short-lived wave of Avengers action figures released by [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]] in 1996.

Another figure was scheduled to be released in 2005 by [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]] as part of Wave 11 of [[Marvel Legends]], this wave known as the Legendary Riders.  When it came time for productions, [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]] executives felt the figure was not up to quality and pulled it from the line.  However, some factories had already produced figures and packed them for shipment.  When the line originally showed up, only the odd box contained a Scarlet Witch figure and smaller retail stores and [[eBay]] sellers would sell the figure at much higher prices, making it for a short time the most valuable figure in the toy line.  Later though, the figure began showing up much more frequently in larger retails stores (such as [[Wal-Mart]]) and the value of the figure decreased.
