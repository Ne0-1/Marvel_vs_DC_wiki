The '''Scarlet Witch''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. Her first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. She is first depicted as a [[supervillain]] along with her twin brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], as a founding member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In most depictions, she is portrayed as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]], and, for much of the character's history, was considered the daughter of the mutant [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and the half-sister of [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. The Scarlet Witch possesses abilities to alter reality in unspecified ways and is a powerful sorceress. The Scarlet Witch is later depicted as a regular member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team. She also becomes the wife of fellow superhero and teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], with whom she has two sons, [[Speed (comics)|Thomas]] and [[Wiccan (comics)|William]].

The character's in-universe backstory and parentage have been changed more than once. Depicted in the 1970s as the children of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] superhero [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] in the 1980s revealed the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver to be the unknown offspring of supervillain [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Born to Magneto's estranged wife in [[Transia]], Scarlet Witch and her brother are left in the care of their adoptive [[Romani people|Romani]] parents and she is raised as '''Wanda Maximoff''' (later referred to as '''Wanda Frank''' while the Whizzer was considered to be her father). In another retcon in the 2010s, it is revealed that Quicksilver and she are not mutants but were kidnapped and used as subjects of genetic experimentation by the [[High Evolutionary]], then misled to believe Magneto was their father.

Along with starring in two self-titled limited series of her own, the character appears in animated films, television series, arcade and video games as well as other Marvel-related merchandise. [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch]] is portrayed by [[Elizabeth Olsen]] in the films ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Elizabeth Olsen will reprise the role in the upcoming [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2021) and the film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'' (2022).

==Publication history==

The Scarlet Witch debuted, together with her brother, Quicksilver, as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964).<ref name="DeFalco99">{{cite book|last1 = DeFalco|first1 = Tom|author-link = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 99|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Stan Lee and Jack Kirby decided to try their hands at a pair of reluctant super villains when they created Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in ''The X-Men'' #4.}}</ref> They were depicted as reluctant villains, uninterested in Magneto's ideologies.

Lee also wrote the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' comic book, composed by the most prominent heroes of the editorial. He eventually removed all of them, save for [[Captain America]], and replaced them with villains from other comics: the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver from the X-Men, and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from [[Iron Man]]'s adventures in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''. The team was known as "Cap's Kooky Quartet".<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 108: "[Stan Lee] replaced Thor, Iron Man, Giant-Man, and Wasp with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch."</ref> Although common in later years, such a change in the roster of a superhero group was completely unprecedented.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicbook.com/2015/03/29/all-different-avengers-10-most-questionable-roster-moves/|title= All-Different Avengers: 10 Most Questionable Roster Moves|author= Mark Ginocchio|date= March 31, 2015|publisher= Comic Book|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref> Lee and the following ''Avengers'' writer, [[Roy Thomas]], hinted to other Avengers being romantically interested in the Scarlet Witch.

[[Steve Englehart]] succeeded Thomas as the writer of the Avengers. He gave her a more assertive personality, removed Quicksilver, and expanded her powers by turning her into an apprentice of witchcraft.<ref name="back45"/> The Vision and the Scarlet Witch married in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975), and the end of the ''Celestial Madonna'' arc.<ref name=" Sanderson169">[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 169: "Writer Steve Englehart and veteran Avengers artist Don Heck presented the grand finale of the long-running 'Celestial Madonna' saga...

Englehart returned to the characters with penciller [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]] for a second limited series, in which the Scarlet Witch gets pregnant by magical means and delivers two sons.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3057|title= The Vision and the Scarlet Witch ''(1985 series)''}}</ref> Englehart would eventually introduce the Vision and the Scarlet Witch to the [[West Coast Avengers]], another title he was working with.

[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] replaced Englehart, and wrote the controversial "Vision Quest" storyline, where the Vision is dismantled and turned into an emotionless machine (thus annulling his marriage with the Scarlet Witch) and the kids are treated as an offshoot of the devil and erased.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.newsarama.com/17918-west-coast-avengers-looking-back-at-the-first-expansion-team.html|title= WEST COAST AVENGERS: Looking Back at the First Expansion Team|author= Chris Arrant|date= May 24, 2013|work= Newsarama|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> The website ''[[Women in Refrigerators]]'' interviewed Englehart about the change, who did not like it.<ref name="Steve Englehart">{{cite web |url= http://lby3.com/wir/c-sengl.html|title= STEVE ENGLEHART responds|author= Steve Englehart|publisher= Women in refrigerators|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref> The West Coast Avengers title was closed, and the team was renamed as ''[[Force Works]]'' in 1994, but the new title ran for only a couple of years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.visiontimes.com/2015/04/02/force-works-iron-mans-alternate-avengers-were-so-cool.html|title= 'Force Works': Iron Man's Alternate Avengers Were So Cool|author= Colin Fredericson|date= April 2, 2015|publisher= Vision Times|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> By this time the character starred its own comic book, written by [[Andy Lanning]] and [[Dan Abnett]], and pencilled by [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]], which lasted for only 4 issues.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://marvel.com/comics/issue/54974/scarlet_witch_1994_1|title= SCARLET WITCH (1994) #1|publisher= Marvel Comics|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> 

Marvel Comics was nearing bankruptcy in 1996. ''The Avengers'' and other titles were relaunched in a new continuity without mutants and outsourced to the studios of [[Image Comics]] artists. The project was named ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]''. [[Rob Liefeld]] worked with the relaunched ''Avengers'' title, and unexpectedly included the Scarlet Witch in the team. The character is not a mutant in the new continuity, only a sorcerer. Marvel renegotiated the terms of the deal, and Liefeld was replaced with writer [[Walter Simonson]] and penciller [[Michael Ryan (artist)|Michael Ryan]]. The project was a success, boosting the sales of the titles and bringing Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|title= Avengers: Heroes Reborn|author= Adrian Watts|publisher= White Rocket Entertainment|accessdate= June 16, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170626093707/http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|archive-date= June 26, 2017}}</ref> The project ended after a year, and the Avengers were returned to Marvel and relaunched again, by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[George Pérez]]. Pérez designed a new costume, with Romani influences and abundant curly hair. The design was unusually complicated; Pérez commented that he preferred it that way because it was more challenging to draw, but accepted that other artists would find it irksome.<ref name="Nolen-Weathington2003">{{cite book|author=Eric Nolen-Weathington|title=Modern Masters Volume 2: George Perez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bhOPZ2u7C_YC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&vq=%22more+fun+to+draw%22+%22a+pain+in+the+butt+for+other+people%22#v=onepage|year=2003|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn=978-1-893905-25-2|page=95|quote="Wonder Woman's hair is made into waves more fun to draw. A lot more fun for me, a pain in the butt for other people."}}</ref> [[Alan Davis]] stated that when he became the artist on ''The Avengers'', he asked to change the design because it didn't work well with his simpler, less detailed style.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Nolen-Weathington|first1= Eric|title= Modern Masters Volume 1: Alan Davis|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn= 1-893905-19-5 |page= 92}}</ref>

The character played a pivotal role in the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline and related limited series ''[[House of M]]'', and appeared in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

The Scarlet Witch is a regular character in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' (2012), beginning with issue #1. The [[AXIS (comics)|Axis]] crossover retconned the character's parentage again, revealing that Magneto was not her father after all, doing away with a relationship that had been canon for decades. It also revealed that she was not a mutant, but a common human that received powers with the experiments of the High Evolutionary. This plot twist was published when Marvel and Fox had a legal dispute over the film rights to the character, as Fox has a film license for the X-Men, mutants, and their related characters.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|title= Did Marvel Comics Just 'Solve' the MCU's Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver Father Problem?|first= Chris|last=  Arrant|date= December 10, 2014|work= Newsarama|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161019174634/http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|archive-date= October 19, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Magda, the wife of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], escapes from him while pregnant and takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]]. She gave birth to twins, Wanda and Pietro. The Elder God [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] altered Wanda at birth and gave her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities, planning to use her as a vessel when her powers reached maturity. Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and supposedly dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[Bova (comics)|Bova]], who soon assists the super-heroine [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America dies in the process. Bova tells the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] (Robert Frank) that the twins are his children, but he flees because of shock from the death of his wife.<ref name="Avengers' 1979">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]], [[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]], and [[David Michelinie|Michelinie, David]]| penciller= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| inker= [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]| story= The Yesterday Quest!| title= The Avengers|issue= 185| date= July 1979}}<br/>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= Nights of Wundagore!| title= The Avengers|issue= 186| date= August 1979}}<br/>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= The Call of the Mountain Thing!| title= The Avengers|issue= 187| date= September 1979}}</ref> The High Evolutionary places them instead in the care of the [[Romani people|Romani]] Django and Marya Maximoff, who raise the twins as their own, naming them Pietro and Wanda.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Seeking to find her place after all the revelations of her true past, Wanda finds herself working with the ghost of [[Agatha Harkness]] to investigate recent disruptions in magic, and briefly meets the spirit of her biological mother, Natalya Maximoff (Django Maximoff's sister), who was apparently the Scarlet Witch before Wanda.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the [[Civil War II|second superhero Civil War]] began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro disagreed on which side was right—Pietro not liking the idea of profiling people based on what they might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past. Past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could make the situation more dangerous (plus she distrusted Tony Stark), and she resented Pietro for trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. She invites Pietro to join her in learning more about Natalya Maximoff but he refuses and the two fight. Wanda bests her brother and coldly tells him she never wants to see him again.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wanda's search for answers leads her to Serbia where a priest reveals that Natalya, seeking to spare her children of her difficult life as a witch, gave baby Wanda and Pietro to her relatives, Marya and Django Maximoff. When the town came under attack by the [[High Evolutionary]] and his [[Knights of wundagore|Knights of Wundagore]], the priest told him the location of the twins, whom he proceeded to experiment on. Upon discovering this, Natalya pursued the High Evolutionary to [[Transia]] and died fighting to rescue her children. Touched by her sacrifice, the High Evolutionary returned Wanda and Pietro to Django and Marya to raise after he had concluded his experiments.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Discovering that Marya was still alive, Wanda is finally able to thank her aunt for looking after her and her brother when they were younger though she questions why she and Django never told them the truth about Natalya being their real mother. Marya also reveals that, like her mother, Wanda's grandfather was the Scarlet Warlock, leading Wanda to conclude that witches with strong magical bloodlines are associated with complex colors (as opposed to the Red Witch) to protect themselves.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wanda finally discovers that a manifestation of Chaos is responsible for destroying witchcraft and, joining forces with the spirits of Natalya and Agatha, are able to weaken it enough for Quicksilver (whom Natalya summons at the last moment) to destroy it. Wanda and Pietro reconcile but Natalya sacrifices herself to save magic. Before she dies, she reveals that it was not the High Evolutionary who killed her, but Wanda and Pietro's father.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> After this, Wanda re-dedicates herself to being an Avenger, declaring that while she has fixed witchcraft, she still must work on herself but that she is ready to do is alongside her teammates.{{issue|date=May 2019}}

During the "Last Days of Magic" arc, Scarlet Witch later helps Doctor Strange defeat the Empirikul, a science cult focused on destroying magic in every dimension.<ref>''Dr. Strange: Last Days of Magic'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Empire===
When Captain America, as a member of Hydra, made his move to take control over the United States as seen in the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Wanda was seen among the members of Hydra's Avengers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was eventually revealed that Wanda joined other superheroes in Washington, D.C. in trying to stop Hydra, but they ultimately failed, and Wanda was subjected to a power that caused her to lose control of her powers and her mind and was brainwashed into serving Hydra.<ref>''FCBD 2017 #Secret Empire''. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a "dinner" Ultron/Hank Pym was having with members of the Underground, Captain America, and Hydra's Avengers, he revealed that Scarlet Witch is possessed by Chthon.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Madame Hydra]] later mentioned to Captain America that Chthon's possession of Scarlet Witch has left her unhinged.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle in Washington DC, Scarlet Witch is knocked out by [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]], enabling Doctor Strange to make preparations to free her from Chthon's control.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dawn of X===
Following [[Krakoa]]'s transformation into a [[House of X and Powers of X| sovereign nation]] state for mutants, Wanda is now considered an [[enemy of the state]] of Krakoa. She is even referred to as "The Great Pretender" by mutantkind, due to the revelation that she is not a mutant, but a human that received powers with the experiments of the High Evolutionary, and listed as one of the most devastating assailants in mutant history. Considering the list of humans who have committed major mutant crimes, Wanda is ranked second, with her Decimation having killed 986,420 mutants. She ranks behind [[Bolivar Trask]], the creator of the mutant-hunting [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots responsible for 16,521,618 deaths in total. However, she ranks above such leaders of hate groups and/or mutant massacres as [[William Stryker]] (who is responsible for 414 deaths), [[Donald Pierce]] (who is responsible for 348 deaths), and the [[Leper Queen]] (who is responsible for 221 deaths).<ref>''House of X'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Empyre===
During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, it was discovered in flashbacks that against the advice of Doctor Strange, Wanda tried to atone for her past sins and mistakes by addressing another genocide, one of 16 million mutants at the hands of Cassandra Nova on Genosha. She spends a year gathering arcane artifacts to redeem herself, unaware that Xavier had helped in developing the Krakoan resurrection protocols, where he and five young mutants can combine their powers and skills to resurrect dead mutants as they were. When she tried to resurrect the millions of Genoshan mutants who were slaughtered by Sentinels, she passes out from her ill-fated attempt and as she wakes up, she discovers that something went wrong with the spell and her expression moves seamlessly from surprise to terror when she realized that she had raised them as undead and not as living, breathing mutants.<ref>''Empyre: X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She then left the island and went to Doctor Strange's aid. While he holds her accountable for her actions, he nevertheless creates a spell to counteract Wanda's and states that it will take 30 days for the spell to be fully undone. He also implemented an ethereal barrier around Genosha to prevent any resurrected flesh from leaving the island until the spell dissipated. However the barrier did not prevent the entrance on the island and during this period of time, the Cotati have set up a base on Genosha in their planned invasion on Wakanda and are immediately attacked by the zombies which somehow began affecting the gate of Krakoa located there. A team of X-Men was sent there to investigate and were overwhelmed by both parties until the spell worn off and the Genosha zombies turn to dust. The X-Men are left unaware it was the Scarlet Witch doing and she was later seen reading a book by a fireplace while shedding a tear.<ref>''Empyre: X-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Black Panther instructs [[Brother Voodoo]] to take Ka-Zar, [[Zabu]], Black Knight, and Scarlet Witch with him to investigate strange occurrences in the Savage Land.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:SteveEnglehart.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Steve Englehart]] first associated the Scarlet Witch's powers with [[witchcraft]].]]
When the Scarlet Witch was first created by Lee and Kirby, her powers were not well defined. She had "hex powers", that could cause random and  unlikely events to take place. This gave creative freedom to the writers, as it actually meant that her powers could be used for any purpose required by the plot.<ref name="tragic"/> Despite the character's name, she had those powers as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and not because of actual witchcraft. Later writers gave her an increased control over her power, so that she could cause specific events and not just random ones. Englehart also made the character explore witchcraft under the tutelage of [[Agatha Harkness]], a trait that was kept by later writers. The effects of her powers are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against the inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]| inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] and [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= To the Death!| title= The Avengers|issue= 118 | date= December 1973 | publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> forcing the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref name="Avengers_161">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]| penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]| inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]] | story= Beware the Ant-Man!| title= The Avengers|issue= 161 | date= July 1977}}</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]| penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]| inker= [[Armando Gil|Gil, Armando]]| story= By Friends--Betrayed!|title= The Avengers Annual|issue= 10|date= 1981}}</ref> Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' #1-4 (1994)</ref>

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined Scarlet Witch's powers and maintained that it was, in fact, an ability to manipulate [[chaos magic]], activated due to the demon Chthon changing her mutation at birth into an ability to wield and control magical energy. This was offered as an explanation for her various feats that seemed to go beyond probability alteration, as well as why her hexes almost always have an effect that is favorable to her goals.<ref name="AvengersVol3#10" /> During Busiek's run as well as the subsequent run by [[Geoff Johns]], she was shown to be capable of large-scale spells given enough concentration and time to shape the chaos magic to a specific goal, including the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]].<ref name="AvengersVol3#10"/>

Her powers were retconned in ''Avengers Disassembled'', removing chaos magic and turning them into reality warping. In ''House of M'', this new power was enough to change the whole universe.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Her powers were retconned back to their previous ones in ''The Children's Crusade'', and the previous events attributed to an outside force that had temporarily increased them.<ref name="Avengers: The Children's Crusade"/>

This was again seemingly changed during AvX when she is shown powerful enough to exhibit a degree of resistance to the Phoenix Force and can cause pain to its hosts, such as Cyclops when he tried to stop Hope from going with her.<ref>''A vs X'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> This becomes less effective as the Phoenix Force portions are divided among those who have not yet been defeated.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Scarlet Witch is so powerful, in fact, that she is the described as the only thing the Phoenix Five are still afraid of. ''A vs X'' #12 confirmed that her powers involve chaos magic, and stated that she has "Mutant Magic", and the "primal source of her chaos" magic is cosmic.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

In the 2016 ''Scarlet Witch'' comic series, it is confirmed that Wanda was born with the ability to utilize witchcraft and that this has been seen in other women within her family; Wanda also believes that The High Evolutionary genetically altered her, making her more receptive to magical energy.<ref name="SW08" />

==Reception==
Though later incarnations took on feminist overtones, the character of Scarlet Witch was not conceived with ideas of female empowerment in mind. At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be exclusively male, and the genre was male-dominated in terms of both artist-creators and the characters they invented. The Scarlet Witch was thus envisioned as a token female character with a passive power, and was used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer [[romance comics]].<ref>Zimmerman, pp. 69-71</ref> ''Avengers'' writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the [[Lady Liberators]], in order to mock [[Second-wave feminism]].<ref>Wright, p. 250</ref> In the 1980s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]] produced a limited Scarlet Witch series that offered a stronger, more independent character with enhanced powers and a family. He lamented that those changes did not stick, and the kids were killed shortly after he ceased writing the character.<ref name="Steve Englehart"/>

[[Don Markstein]]'s Toonpedia asserted: "The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a wimple. Her super power is unlike any other—she can alter probability so as to cause mishaps for her foes."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|title= The Scarlet Witch|last= Markstein|first= Don|work= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/64NTfJTNo?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|archive-date= January 1, 2012|url-status=live|accessdate= January 1, 2012}}</ref>

The Scarlet Witch was the second-highest-ranked female character (at #12) on [[IGN]]'s list of "The Top 50 Avengers",<ref>{{cite web|date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/12 |website=[[IGN]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150309103134/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/12|archive-date= March 9, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and was ranked 97th in ''[[Wizard Magazine|Wizard]]'s'' "200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time" list.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/23/list-famous-witches/|title= The List: Famous Witches Going on a Witch Hunt|date= September 23, 2010|location= Washington, D.C.|newspaper= [[The Washington Times]]|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/64NT3klLh?url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/23/list-famous-witches/|archive-date= January 1, 2012|url-status=live|accessdate= January 1, 2012}}</ref> She was #14 on ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| author-link = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] |date= 2011|location= Iola, Wisconsin| page = 18| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ikva_afQXWMC&q=Scarlet+Witch+%2314+Wanda+Maximoff&pg=PA18| isbn = 978-1-4402-2988-6}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' was a comic book event where reality was altered by a time travel, and the mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] wages a devastating war over the world. The Scarlet Witch appears in ''X-Men Chronicles'' #1, a comic set in the early days of the war. She is a member of the X-Men, led by her father Magneto. While the team fights Apocalypse in his first attack, she dies defending their base on Wundagore Mountain from [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Nemesis]]. As a last request, she asks the newly recruited [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] to stay close to her father.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (March 1995)</ref>

The event was quite popular, and many new comics set in it were published in later years. One of those comics was ''Uncanny X-Force'' #19.1. The long dead Scarlet Witch is cloned, so that Jean Grey can control her body and use her power to replicate the mass mutant depowering seen in the ''House of M'' event. The spell fails, and only works in a limited radius, depowering only Jean Grey and Sabretooth.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #19.1</ref>

===''Heroes Reborn''===
The Scarlet Witch is one of the Avengers participating in the defeat of the entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], and is subsequently trapped in the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe. In this artificial reality, with her mutant heritage non-existent, Wanda was raised by Agatha Harkness, with the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] sorceress the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] falsely claiming to be her mother.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Rob Liefeld|Liefeld, Rob]] and [[Jim Valentino|Valentino, Jim]] | penciller= Liefeld, Rob and [[Chap Yaep|Yaep, Chap]]| inker= [[Jon Sibal|Sibal, Jon]] and [[Mario Alquiza|Alquiza, Mario]]| story= Awaken the Thunder! | title= The Avengers| volume= 2| issue= 1| date= November 1996}}</ref>

===''Exiles''===
The title ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' features an alternate version from Earth-8823 with the call sign "Witch". The character joins the inter-dimensional superhero team<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 3, #1 (Apr. 2009)</ref> but is killed in action, and is replaced—without the knowledge of her teammates—by yet another alternate version of herself.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 3, #6 (Sept. 2009)</ref>

===''Marvel 1602''===
In ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Sister Wanda and her brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)#Marvel 1602|Petros]], are followers of [[Alternative versions of Magneto#1602|Enrique]], High Inquisitor of the Spanish Catholic Church.<ref>''Marvel 1602'' #1–8 (Nov. 2003 – June 2004)</ref>

===''Marvel Noir''===
In the limited series ''[[X-Men Noir#X-Men Noir|X-Men Noir]]'', Wanda Magnus is a wealthy socialite and the daughter of Chief of Detectives [[Alternative versions of Magneto#X-Men: Noir|Eric Magnus]].<ref>''X-Men Noir'' #1 (Feb. 2009)</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
In the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' storyline, an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Scarlet Witch helps [[Ash Williams|Ash]] find the [[Necronomicon|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]. Wanda is eventually attacked, hunted down and infected by zombified vigilante the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #1–6 (Dec. 2005 – Apr. 2006)</ref> She reappears, still "zombified" in the third instalment in the series, ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]''. She works with the [[Kingpin (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Kingpin]], using the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Marvel Zombies|Vision]]—who was still in love with her—to block enemy radio signals as necessary. She (along with the other zombies) was later confronted by Machine Man, and Jocasta, who decided to save the Vision and finally kill the zombie Kingpin. At yet one point, zombie Scarlet Witch is decapitated by Machine Man's temporary chainsaw limb and was ripped apart in the zombie pile where Machine Man and Jocasta are victorious.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #1–4 (Dec. 2008 – March 2009)</ref>

===MC2===
An older version of Scarlet Witch appears in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] title ''[[A-Next]]''. Having been placed in a coma during the original Avengers final battle (as part of an attempt to save Iron Man),<ref>''A-Next'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref> Scarlet Witch was captured, revived, and brainwashed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] as part of his plan to corrupt various heroes into punishing the Avengers. She eventually returned to her normal mindset,<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' #1–5</ref> and has made sporadic appearances in the MC2 universe since then.

===Ultimate Marvel===

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] title ''[[Ultimates]]'', Scarlet Witch and her brother [[Quicksilver (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Quicksilver]] defect from [[Ultimate Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto's]] [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]] to the Ultimates in exchange for the release of imprisoned Brotherhood members

In the third volume of ''Ultimates 3'', the Scarlet Witch is killed by a lovesick Ultron which is later revealed to have been orchestrated by Doctor Doom.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #5</ref> She is shown to be alive in Wundagore together with Teddy (Blob's other mutant child), Quicksilver and Mystique.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]]| penciller= [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Adams, Arthur]]| inker= [[Mark Roslan|Roslan, Mark]]| story= Origins Chapter Five: What Is Ultimate X?| title= Ultimate X| issue= 5| date= August 2011}}</ref> However this is revealed to be an illusion by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics X-Men'' #12</ref>

The Ultimate version's powers differ from the mainstream version's in that the character has to "do the math" in order to use her powers—she must calculate the mathematical probability that the effect she intends to create will actually happen; the more complex the effect, the more complex the mathematical formula.<ref>''Ultimates'' #1–13 (March 2002 – April 2004); ''Ultimates 2'' #1–13 (Feb. 2005 – Feb. 2007)</ref>

===Infinity Wars===
During [[Infinity Wars]], when the universe was folded in half, the Scarlet Witch was fused with [[X-23]] to create '''Weapon Hex'''. The Evolutionaries, an occult and scientific group, had been using mutants in order for one of them to become a vessel for Mephicton (fusion of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and Chthon). However, this process always resulted in the mutants death. Seeing that their plan was failing, the group's leaders, Sarah Kinney and Herbert Wyndham decided to conceive a flawed child to act as the perfect vessel for the demon. However, Sara raised Laura and told her about empathy and humanity, while Herbert wanted the girl to be a weapon. At the age of seventeen, Laura along with Hellhound (fusion of [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]) were sent on missions. Following her mother's death and discovering that she had a younger sister named Gavrill (fusion of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and Honey Badger), she decided to escape the Evolutionaries along with her sister, but was cut in pieces by Hellhound, while Herbert took Gavrill in order for her to become the new vessel for Mephicton. Laura eventually healed and killed both Hellhound and Herbert with the latter being attacked by the spirits who had died from his experiments. After that, Laura along with her sister left the place.<ref>''Infinity Wars: Weapon Hex'' #2. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Film===
{{main article|Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}
Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as mutants, to Fox. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused in the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers. The main core of this franchise were the Avengers, both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement so that both of them would use the characters.
