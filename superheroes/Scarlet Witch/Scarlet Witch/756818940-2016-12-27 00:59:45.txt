'''Scarlet Witch ''' ('''Wanda Maximoff''') is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character has since starred in two self-titled [[limited series]] with husband the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and appears as a regular team member in superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]''.

Scarlet Witch is initially depicted as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], born with the ability to alter reality in unspecific ways. Originally revealed to be the daughter of the Golden Age superhero [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]], it was later established she and her twin brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] were the children of X-Men villain [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] with his daughter [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] being their half-sister. This parentage was their status quo until 2014, when a further retcon revealed that she and Quicksilver were in fact non-mutants who had been kidnapped and experimented on by the [[High Evolutionary]], and then misled to believe that Magneto was their father.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/marvel-confirms-scarlet-witch-and-quicksilver-are-no-lo-1703112599|title= Marvel Confirms Scarlet Witch And Quicksilver Are No Longer Mutants|last= Whitbrook|first= James|date= May 8, 2015|publisher=[[io9]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151231032526/http://io9.gizmodo.com/marvel-confirms-scarlet-witch-and-quicksilver-are-no-lo-1703112599|archivedate= December 31, 2015|deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Publication history==
[[File:X-Men 4 March 1964.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first appearance of Scarlet Witch (center right), on the cover of ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964).]]
Scarlet Witch debuted, together with her brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964).<ref name="DeFalco99">{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 99|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Stan Lee and Jack Kirby decided to try their hands at a pair of reluctant super villains when they created Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in ''The X-Men'' #4.}}</ref> They were depicted as reluctant villains, uninterested in Magneto's ideologies. Scarlet Witch is depicted as a calm and submissive girl, as most female comic book characters of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8498521/avengers-age-of-ultron-scarlet-witch-explained|title= The tragic history of Scarlet Witch, who will make her film debut in ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''|last= Abad-Santos|first= Alex|date= April 28, 2015|publisher= [[Vox (website)|Vox]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160701020725/http://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8498521/avengers-age-of-ultron-scarlet-witch-explained|archivedate= July 1, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref> Her costume was mainly composed of a red bathing suit with straps, [[opera glove]]s, short boots, a leotard covering her body, a superhero cape, and a [[wimple]]; everything colored in shades of red.

After several appearances as a villain in issues #5 (May 1964); #6 (July 1964); #7 (September 1964); and #11 (May 1965), Wanda and her brother were added to the cast of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965).<ref name="DeFalco108">DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 108: "[Stan Lee] replaced Thor, Iron Man, Giant-Man, and Wasp with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch."</ref> Scarlet Witch was a semi-regular member of the team until issue #49 (February 1968), and then returned in issue #75 (April 1970) and was a perennial member of both the main team and several affiliated teams such as the [[West Coast Avengers]] and [[Force Works]] until Avengers #503 (December 2004), the final issue of the first volume. Upon her return to the Avengers she was given a long-running love interest in the form of fellow Avenger the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Writer [[Roy Thomas]] recounted, 

<blockquote>I felt that a romance of some sort would help the character development in ''The Avengers'', and the Vision was a prime candidate because he appeared only in that mag... as did Wanda, for that matter. So they became a pair, for just such practical considerations.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= December 2010|title= Shattered Dreams: Vision and the Scarlet Witch|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 59–65|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref></blockquote>

The two characters were married in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975).<ref name="Sanderson169">[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 169: "Writer Steve Englehart and veteran Avengers artist Don Heck presented the grand finale of the long-running 'Celestial Madonna' saga… Immortus presided over the double wedding of Mantis to the resurrected Swordsman, and the android Vision to the Scarlet Witch."</ref>

Thomas's successor on ''The Avengers'', [[Steve Englehart]], considerably expanded Scarlet Witch's powers, adding genuine sorcery to her mutant "hex" power. He later explained, "Having decided she would be a full-fledged player, she then naturally developed a more assertive personality, and I wanted to know more about her rather vaguely defined powers since she’d be using them more. I could certainly have pushed her more toward the mutant end of the spectrum, but the name 'Witch' seemed like it could be more than just a superhero [[nom de guerre]], so I went that way."<ref name="back45"/>

The character made occasional guest-appearances in other Marvel titles such as ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #41–44 (January–April 1976),<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 87|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema's multi-part time-traveling saga saw Spider-Man teaming up with a variety of heroes to fight Cotton Mather.}}</ref> and ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #6 (January 1983).<ref>Manning "1980s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 132: "Behind an impressive cover by artist P.

Artist [[George Pérez]] designed a new costume with a strong [[Romani people|Roma]] influence for the character in 1998.<ref>{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 2: George Pérez|last= Nolen-Weathington|first= Eric|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn= 1-893905-25-X |page= 95}}</ref> This design has rarely been used by artists other than Pérez.  [[Alan Davis]] stated that when he became the artist on ''The Avengers'', he "asked to change the Scarlet Witch just because I didn't feel the design George Pérez created worked with my drawing style. I tend to go for simpler, more open lines and don't do lots of detail in rendering."<ref>{{cite book |last1= Nolen-Weathington|first1= Eric|title= Modern Masters Volume 1: Alan Davis|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn= 1-893905-19-5 |page= 92}}</ref>

The character played a pivotal role in the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline and related limited series ''[[House of M]]'', and appeared in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

[[Don Markstein]] asserts that the character is unlike any other, stating, "The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a [[wimple]]. Her super power is unlike any other—she can alter probability so as to cause mishaps for her foes. In other words, she 'hexes' them."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|title= The Scarlet Witch|last= Markstein|first= Don|date= |work= ''[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]''|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/64NTfJTNo|archivedate= January 1, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= January 1, 2012|quote=  }}</ref>

Scarlet Witch is a regular character in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' (2012), beginning with issue #1. The [[AXIS (comics)|Axis]] crossover revealed that Magneto was not her father after all, doing away with a relation that has been canon for decades. It also revealed that she was not a mutant, but a common human that received powers with the experiments of the High Evolutionary. This plot twist was published when Marvel and Fox had a legal dispute over the film rights to the character, as Fox has a film license for the X-Men, mutants, and their related characters.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|title= Did Marvel Comics Just 'Solve' the MCU's Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver Father Problem?|first= Chris|last=  Arrant|date= December 10, 2014|publisher= Newsarama|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161019174634/http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|archivedate= October 19, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Magda, the wife of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], escapes from him while pregnant and takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]]. She gave birth to twins, Wanda and Pietro. The [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] altered Wanda at birth and gave her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities, planning to use her as a vessel when her powers reached maturity. Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and supposedly dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[Bova (comics)|Bova]]. Bova soon assists the super-heroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America dies in the process. Bova tells the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] (Robert Frank) that the twins are his children, but he flees because of shock from the death of his wife.<ref name="Avengers' 1979">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]], [[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]], and [[David Michelinie|Michelinie, David]]| penciller= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| inker= [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]| story= The Yesterday Quest!| title= The Avengers|issue= 185| date= July 1979}}<br/>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= Nights of Wundagore!| title= The Avengers|issue= 186| date= August 1979}}<br/>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= The Call of the Mountain Thing!| title= The Avengers|issue= 187| date= September 1979}}</ref> The High Evolutionary places them instead in the care of the [[Romani people|Romani]] Django and Marya Maximoff, who raise the twins as their own, naming them Pietro and Wanda.

Although she is initially reluctant, she accepts and follows them to Avengers Mansion. Despite both heroines pleading her case, the Vision angrily snaps at Wanda, blaming her again [[Avengers Disassembled|for having manipulated and killed him]], and telling her to leave. Ms. Marvel and [[Iron Man]] rush to Wanda's defense, the Avengers defer their decision to the Vision, who elects to stand by his point, even if obviously pained by the situation. Ms. Marvel carries away a crying Wanda.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0</ref> When the Avengers go to extract [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] from Utopia and are nearly defeated by a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]-empowered Cyclops, Scarlet Witch arrives and saves them. Hope agrees to go with Scarlet Witch. Wanda causes physical harm to Cyclops when he touches her arm when he tries to stop her from taking Hope.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #6</ref>

Though hunted by the Phoenix-powered X-Men, Wanda's return to the team provides the Avengers a much needed boost as many teammates are captured by the X-Men. Hawkeye ultimately is severely injured rescuing Wanda from being teleported away by Magik and White Queen, the former of which sees Wanda as a monster for depowering mutantkind. Wanda's power provides the X-Men with a threat that not even the Phoenix can face down as the Avengers employ magical illusions to trick the X-Men into thinking Wanda is with the various Avengers groups. Further investigation meanwhile links Wanda's powers to the Phoenix Force. When Cyclops goes Dark Phoenix, Wanda and Hope Summers, who is mimicking Wanda's powers, defeat him and cause the Phoenix Force to leave him. After Hope inherits the Phoenix Force, she and Wanda combine their powers to apparently destroy the Phoenix by saying "No more Phoenix". This results in the repowering of mutants, undoing Wanda's actions on M-Day.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #7</ref>

===Uncanny Avengers===
Following the war, Captain America selects Scarlet Witch to join the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]], a new team of Avengers composed of both classic Avengers and X-Men.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Rick Remender|Remender, Rick]]|penciller= [[John Cassaday|Cassaday, John]]|inker= Cassaday, John|story= New Union|title= [[Uncanny Avengers]]|issue= 1|date= December 2012}}</ref> After that, she asked her close friends [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]] and [[Wonder Man]] to join and sponsor the new team.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #5</ref> In ''Uncanny Avengers'' #14, she meets her apparent death at the hands of her teammate Rogue, who had absorbed Wolverine's powers.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #14</ref> This death is eventually undone when the surviving Unity Squad are projected back in time, having learned that Rogue was manipulated by the Apocalypse Twins into killing Wanda, allowing the Avengers to band together and defeat an approaching Celestial.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

When the Red Skull mounts a new attack,{{issue|date=February 2015}} Wanda attempts to work with Doctor Strange to cast a spell of moral inversion to draw out the part of Xavier in the Red Skull and put him in control of the body,<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> but this spell backfires when Doctor Doom is forced to take Strange's place,<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #3</ref> resulting in the moral inversion of all heroes and villains in the vicinity.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4</ref> When Quicksilver and Magneto try to talk the inverted Wanda down, Wanda attacks them with a curse designed to punish her blood, but when only Quicksilver reacts, Wanda realizes that Magneto is not their father.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #7</ref> Before she can pursue this further, Doom appears with the resurrected [[Brother Voodoo]] and the spirit of his brother Daniel, Daniel possessing Wanda,<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #8</ref> so that she and Doom can undo the spell and restore the heroes' and villains' moralities to normal.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref>

===Identity crisis===
Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver later take a trip to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]].<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 2 #1-2</ref> After being tracked down and defeated by Luminous (a female who was created by the genetic material of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver), Wanda and Pietro were brought to the High Evolutionary himself. He revealed to them that Django and Marya Maximoff were their true parents, implying that the twins are actually the lost Ana and Mateo Maximoff. He also told them the truth where they were supposedly not mutants, but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary. After escaping from the High Evolutionary's experimentations, Pietro and Wanda located the Avengers Unity Division (who had travelled to Counter-Earth looking for the twins) and helped the inhabitants of Lowtown (a refuge for the High Evolutionary's rejects) from their creator's assault.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> After the High Evolutionary is defeated and he escapes into a portal with Luminous, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver return to Earth with the Avengers Unity Division.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 2 #5</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Seeking to find her place after all the revelations of her true past, Wanda finds herself investigating a recent disruption in magic, as well as meeting the spirit of her biological mother Natalya, who was apparently the Scarlet Witch before Wanda.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol.2 #3</ref> When the [[Civil War II|second superhero Civil War]] began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro disagreed on which side was right - Pietro not liking the idea of profiling people based on what they might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past - past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could be more dangerous than the existing situation (plus her distrust of Tony Stark), and she resented Pietro still trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol.2 #9</ref>

She later helps Dr. Strange defeat the Empirikul, a science cult focused on destroying magic in every dimension.<ref> Dr. Strange: Last Days of Magic Issue #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Scarlet Witch is able to manipulate probability via her "hexes" (often manifesting physically as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts"). These hexes are relatively short range, being limited to her line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration. Despite this precision, the hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if Wanda is tired or using her powers excessively. If overextended, Wanda's hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or even undo previous hexes. Early in her career, Wanda's hexes were subconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent. These hexes would only manifest "bad luck" effects. She later gained enough control over her powers so they only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects. She can use her hexes to light flammable objects, contain or remove air from a particular volume, deflect objects, stop the momentum of projectiles, open doors, explode objects, create force fields, deflect magical attacks etc. The effects are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artefact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against the inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]| inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] and [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= To the Death!| title= The Avengers|issue= 118 | date= December 1973 | publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> forcing the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref name="Avengers_161">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]| penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]| inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]] | story= Beware the Ant-Man!| title= The Avengers|issue= 161 | date= July 1977}}</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]| penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]| inker= [[Armando Gil|Gil, Armando]]| story= By Friends--Betrayed!|title= The Avengers Annual|issue= 10|date= 1981}}</ref> Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' #1-4 (1994)</ref>

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined Scarlet Witch's powers, and maintained that it was in fact an ability to manipulate chaos magic, activated due to the demon Chthon changing her mutation at birth into an ability to wield and control magical energy. This was offered as an explanation for her various feats that seemed to go beyond probability alteration, as well as why her hexes almost always have an effect that is favorable to her goals.<ref name="AvengersVol3#10" /> During Busiek's run as well as the subsequent run by [[Geoff Johns]], she was shown to be capable of large-scale spells given enough concentration and time to shape the chaos magic to a specific goal, including the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]].<ref name="AvengersVol3#10"/>

In ''House of M'', her power was depicted as sufficient to rewrite her entire universe,<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> and cause multiverse-threatening ripples.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462 - 465</ref> In ''The Children's Crusade'' it was revealed that this omnipotence was not part of her natural power level, but the result of a cosmic magical source that increased a magic user's powers to god-like levels.<ref name="Crusade7" /> By the end of the event she had returned to her previous power level, able to alter probability and work magic, but not able to change reality at will.<ref name="Avengers: The Children's Crusade"/>

She also has a degree of resistance to the Phoenix Force and can also cause pain to its hosts, such as Cyclops when he tried to stop Hope from going with her.<ref>''A vs X'' #6</ref> However, this becomes less effective as the Phoenix Force portions are divided among those who have not yet been defeated.{{issue|date=September 2012}} ''A vs X'' #12 confirmed that her powers involve chaos magic, and stated that she has "Mutant Magic", and the "primal source of her chaos" magic is cosmic.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

Wanda is also an expert combatant, having been trained by [[Captain America]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and Wonder Man, as well as being an adept tactician due to her years of experience as an Avenger and her involvement in a variety of combat situations.

In the new ''Scarlet Witch'' series (2016), it is confirmed that Wanda was born with the ability to utilize witchcraft and that this has been seen in other women within her family.{{issue|date=August 2016}} Wanda believes that The High Evolutionary genetically altered her, making her more receptive to magical energy.{{issue|date=August 2016}}

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
During the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline, Scarlet Witch is a member of Magneto's version of the X-Men, dying to defend the X-Men's base on Wundagore Mountain and the students within it from an attack by [[Holocaust (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Nemesis]] while the rest of the team was busy thwarting Apocalypse's attempts to take control of a nuclear missile stockpile, her last words being to ask the newly arrived [[Rogue (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Rogue]] to take care of her father.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (March 1995)</ref> To Magneto's horror, it was revealed that Wanda was briefly cloned in order to repeat the "no more mutants" spell and end the war between humans and the Akkaba forces. But the spell does not go well as it was only successful within a radius of 12 feet, so Jean Grey and Sabretooth are both left depowered while Weapon X and his forces remained powered as all Wanda's clones died.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #19.1</ref>

===''Heroes Reborn''===
Scarlet Witch is one of the Avengers participating in the defeat of the entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], and is subsequently trapped in the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe. In this artificial reality, with her mutant heritage non-existent, Wanda was raised by Agatha Harkness, with the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] sorceress the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] falsely claiming to be her mother.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Rob Liefeld|Liefeld, Rob]] and [[Jim Valentino|Valentino, Jim]] | penciller= Liefeld, Rob and [[Chap Yaep|Yaep, Chap]]| inker= [[Jon Sibal|Sibal, Jon]] and [[Mario Alquiza|Alquiza, Mario]]| story= Awaken the Thunder! | title= The Avengers| volume= 2| issue= 1| date= November 1996}}</ref>

===''Exiles''===
The title ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' features an alternate version from Earth-8823 with the call sign "Witch".

===Film===

Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as mutants, to Fox. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused in the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers. The main core of this franchise were the Avengers, both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films; and Marvel would also claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement, so that both of them would use the characters. It was made on the condition that the plots do not make reference to the other studio's properties: the Fox films can not mention them as members of the Avengers, and the Marvel films can not mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title= Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies|first= Kirsten|last= Acuna|date= April 30, 2015|work= [[Business Insider]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|archivedate= August 17, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref>
