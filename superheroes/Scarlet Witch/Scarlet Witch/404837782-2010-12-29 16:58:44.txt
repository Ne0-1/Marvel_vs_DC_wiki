==Publication history==
The Scarlet Witch debuted, together with her brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964). After several brief appearances as a villain in issues #5 (May 1964); #6 (July 1964); #7 (Sept. 1964); & #11 (May 1965), Wanda and her brother were added to the cast of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965).  The Scarlet Witch was a semi-regular member of the team until issue #49 (Feb. 1968), and then returned in issue #75 (April 1970) and was a perennial member of both the main team and several affiliated teams (such as the [[West Coast Avengers]] and [[Force Works]]) until Avengers #503 (Dec. 2004), the final issue of the first volume.

The Scarlet Witch also starred in two [[limited series]] with husband and fellow Avenger the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]: ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #1 - 4 (Nov. 1982 - Feb. 1983), by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciller]] [[Rick Leonardi]], and a second volume of the same title numbered #1 - 12 (Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986), written by [[Steve Englehart]] and penciled by Richard Howell.  A solo limited series, titled simply ''Scarlet Witch'', ran four issues in 1994.

The character played a pivotal role in the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline and related limited series ''[[House of M]]'', and is currently appearing in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

[[Don Markstein]] asserted that the character was unlike another, and stated that "...The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a [[wimple]]. Her super power is unlike any other — she can alter probability so as to cause mishaps for her foes. In other words, she "hexes" them." <ref>{{Cite web|last= Markstein|first= Don D.|title= The Scarlet Witch|publisher= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|url= http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|accessdate= 10 July 2010}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Magda — pregnant with the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]], after seeing her husband [[Magneto (comics)|Magnus]] use his magnetic powers for the first time.  The twins are born, and as Mt. Wundagore is the prison of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], his residual energies alter Wanda and will later give her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities. Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bova]]. Bova soon assists the [[World War II]] superheroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America loses her own life in the process.  These complications are thought to be due to [[radiation poisoning]] deliberately caused by the villain [[Isbisa]], the enemy of Miss America's husband Robert Frank, AKA [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]]. Bova hides the truth from Frank and claims that only the mother has died, and that he now has twin children. Frank is shocked at the death of his wife and flees at super speed.<ref name="Avengers' 1979">''Avengers'' #185 - 187 (July - Sept. 1979)</ref> As Wundagore was no place for human infants, the High Evolutionary places them in the care of the [[Romani people|gypsies]] Django and Marya Maximoff, who raise the twins as their own children. The twins are forced to flee a mob when Wanda uses her powers to protect herself and accidentally causes a fire that kills their adoptive gypsy mother.<ref>Recounted in ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #1 - 12 (Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986)</ref>

Once Pietro (Quicksilver) and Wanda (The Scarlet Witch) reach adolescence, they discover that they are in fact mutants. Pietro possesses [[superhuman]] speed, while Wanda learns that she can control probability. When the pair display their powers in public, and are again attacked by a superstitious crowd, they are saved by their father — now the supervillain Magneto — although neither Magneto nor his children are aware of their connection. Magneto then recruits the pair for the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Brotherhood battles the [[X-Men]] on several occasions,<ref>''X-Men'' #5 (May 1964); #6 (July 1964) & #7 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and the twins become reluctant members of the Brotherhood and only remain because of their obligation to Magneto.  When Magneto and his lackey [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] are abducted by the cosmic entity [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], the Brotherhood dissolves and the twins declare that their debt to Magneto has been paid.<ref>''X-Men'' #11 (May 1965)</ref>

===Avengers===
Soon after Magneto's abduction, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch are recruited by the hero [[Iron Man]] to join The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Along with [[Captain America]] as leader, and former villain [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the four become the second generation of The Avengers and are later dubbed as "Cap's Kooky Quartet".<ref>"Avengers #16 (May 1965)</ref>

Wanda becomes close friends with Hawkeye and a loyal member of the team until she is accidentally shot on a mission against Magneto. Quicksilver then flees from the Avengers with his wounded sister.<ref>''Avengers'' #49 (Feb. 1968)</ref> The pair accompany Magneto back to his mid-Atlantic base,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #43 (Apr. 1968)</ref> and Wanda spends the next few weeks recovering from her wound. She watches as Magneto captures the X-Men<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #44 (May 1968)</ref> and Pietro skirmishes with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], one of the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #45 (Jun. 1968)</ref> and later [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' #71 (Apr. 1969)</ref> After these encounters, the twins finally realize that Magneto is the true villain. Wanda and Pietro are then kidnapped along with several other mutants by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but are subsequently freed by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #59 - 60 (Aug - Sept. 1969)</ref>

Quicksilver later returns to the Avengers and advises them that Wanda has been kidnapped and taken to another dimension by the warlord [[Arkon]].<ref>''Avengers'' #75 - 76 (April - May 1970)</ref> After being rescued, Wanda — together with Pietro — rejoins the team. The Scarlet Witch then falls in love with teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], an android originally created as a weapon by Avenger's foe [[Ultron]]. Before long, the two develop a romantic relationship.<ref name="Avengers #109 March 1973">''Avengers'' #109 (March 1973)</ref> Their relationship has a tumultuous start as both Quicksilver and Hawkeye object — Quicksilver cannot accept the idea that his sister loves a robot while Hawkeye loves Wanda himself.<ref name="Avengers #109 March 1973">''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)</ref> Despite this, the pair eventually marry with the blessing of the entire team.<ref name="Giant-Size Avengers' 1975">''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975)</ref>

The Scarlet Witch begins to become frustrated with the fluctuating level of her mutant ability, and is tutored by a true witch, [[Agatha Harkness]]. The training allows Wanda even greater control over her hexes<ref>''Avengers'' #128 - 137 (Oct. 1974 - July 1975)</ref> and this proves invaluable in battle against foes such as Ultron.<ref>''Avengers'' #161 (Jul. 1977)</ref> Wanda and Pietro also met Robert Frank, who briefly joins the Avengers, believing them to be his children.<ref>Whizzer joins unofficially as of ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (1974)</ref> This is later disproved when Wanda and Pietro are abducted by Django Maximoff and taken to Wundagore. Wanda is temporarily possessed by the [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], but after being released is advised by Bova that neither Frank nor Maximoff is their biological father.<ref name="Avengers' 1979"/> Soon after, while trying to track down Magda one last time, Magneto would learn that he was the father of the twins. He immediately informed them of their relationship shortly after the birth of Pietro's daughter Luna.<ref>''Vision and Scarlet Witch #4 ()</ref> The Scarlet Witch and Vision take a leave of absence from the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)</ref> and courtesy of Wanda's enhanced power conceive twin boys named Thomas and William.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #3 (Dec. 1985)</ref> Wanda gives birth,<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #12 (Sept. 1986)</ref> and, with Vision, eventually joins the [[West Coast Avengers]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #34 (Aug. 1988)</ref> needing some time away from the main team after Vision becomes unbalanced and tries to take over the world's computers.<ref>Climaxed in ''Avengers'' #254 (April 1985)</ref>

Their relationship is almost ended when Vision is abducted by a coalition of the world governments and dismantled to ensure that he is no longer a threat. Although rebuilt, Vision is recreated as a colorless, emotionless synthezoid.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #42 - 45 (March - June 1989)</ref> Wanda's agitation is increased when [[Wonder Man]] - whose brain patterns were the model for the Vision - refuses to repeat the process and "humanize" Vision, as he is secretly in  love with the Scarlet Witch and sees an opportunity for himself.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #45 (Jun. 1989)</ref> Now desperate, the Scarlet Witch consults a Dean of Robotics in the state of Texas, who secretly manages a mutant research facility. The Scarlet Witch is bonded with a sentient symbiotic substance, with the Dean intending to use Wanda as a prototype to replace mankind. Wanda is, however, rescued by her teammates with the assistance of Captain America and [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #47 - 49 (Aug. - Sept. 1989)</ref>

Another personal setback follows when it is revealed that Wanda's children are in fact two missing shards of the soul of the demonic entity [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. In an act of kindness, Agatha Harkness then erases all trace of the children from Wanda's memory.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #51-52 (Nov. - Dec. 1989)</ref> Despite this, the Scarlet Witch retreats from reality and falls into a catatonic state. Vision, now guided by cold logic, decides in the wake of recent developments on the East coast to return to the main team, and is apparently oblivious to the condition of his wife.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #53 (Mid Dec. 1989)</ref> Wanda's weakened state over the loss of her children and changes in her husband makes her susceptible to the mental commands of Magneto, who is also apparently being aided by Quicksilver. Adopting a new evil persona, Wanda turns against the Avengers as she and her family battle the Avengers West Coast team,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #55 - 57 (Feb. - Apr. 1990)</ref> until it is revealed that Pietro was only waiting for the right moment to stop his father and helps drive Magneto off. During the battle, Wanda again reverts back to a catatonic state, with this being caused by the time entity [[Immortus]]; although he is later defeated and Wanda is rescued by the Avengers and restored to sanity.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #60 - 63 (July - Sept. 1990)</ref>

Despite Vision's absence, the Scarlet Witch remains with the team. When the West Coast team is dissolved by the main team due to internal disputes and mistakes in the field,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #102 (Jan. 1994)</ref> Wanda goes on to lead a breakaway team called [[Force Works]].<ref>''Force Works'' #1 (July 1994)</ref> The team suffers several setbacks, including the death of Wonder Man on the first mission.<ref>''Force Works'' #2 (Aug. 1994)</ref> When the team splinters after the last mission involving [[Kang the Conqueror]],<ref>''Force Works'' #22 (April 1996)</ref> the Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye return to the main team.<ref>''Avengers'' #397 (April 1996)</ref> Vision and Scarlet Witch reconcile shortly before sacrificing themselves with the other Avengers and the [[Fantastic Four]] to stop the mutant villain [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>''Onslaught: Marvel Universe'' (1996)</ref> Due to the intervention of [[Franklin Richards]], Scarlet Witch and her teammates exist in a parallel universe for a year,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 - 13 (Nov. 1996 - Dec. 1997)</ref> until being returned to the mainstream universe by Franklin.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' #1 - 4 (Sept. - Dec. 1997)</ref>

Shortly after the heroes return, Scarlet Witch is kidnapped by the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], with the intention of using Wanda's powers to warp reality in le Fay's image. Although successful, Wanda retaliates by restoring Captain America's memories, who in turn is able to restore several Avengers' memories. Wanda also accidentally resurrects Wonder Man, who assists in her escape. Although the Avengers defeat le Fay, Vision is damaged in the final battle when Le Fay destroys the lower half of his body. Vision is placed in a surgical repair device, and via [[holography|hologram]] communicates with Wanda and asks her not to visit him while he heals.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 - 4 (Feb. - April 1998)</ref>

An upset Wanda visits Agatha Harkness and learns that she is now able to channel [[chaos magic]], which will allow her to change reality.

===Avengers Disassembled===
{{Main|Avengers Disassembled}}
''Avengers Disassembled'' is a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event between several [[Marvel Comics]] series.  The active members of the Avengers team during the event included the Scarlet Witch. The Avengers are depicted returning from events in England, and Janet Van Dyne, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], enters into a romantic tryst with the wounded, but recovering, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. While discussing the affair with Wanda, a slightly tipsy Wasp confesses to a pregnancy scare and inadvertently mentions Wanda's own children.<ref>''Avengers'' #503 (Dec. 2004)</ref> This causes Wanda to suffer a mental breakdown, and she starts rewriting reality, causing a series of threats and incidents to inexplicably occur one after the other, including the deaths of [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]], and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. She also proceeds to recreate her children. The Avengers confront her and [[Doctor Strange]] shuts down her mind. Wanda is then retrieved by her father Magneto, and taken to [[Genosha]].<ref name="Avengers' 2004">''Avengers'' #500 - 503 (Sept. - Dec. 2004); ''Avengers Finale'' (Jan. 2005)</ref>

[[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has masqueraded as Scarlet Witch to form and subsequently manipulate a new team of Avengers.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21-23 (March - April 2009)</ref>

===Return===
It was announced at the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo that the Scarlet Witch will resurface in "Avengers: The Children's Crusade," a nine issue, bi-monthly miniseries from the same creative team who first introduced the Young Avengers to the world, writer Allan Heinberg and artist Jim Cheung.<ref>{{Cite web|title= C2E2: Heinberg & Cheung Launch "Children's Crusade"|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|date= 18 April 2010|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25813|accessdate= 10 July 2010}}</ref>

In the series, the [[Young Avengers]], accompanied by Magneto, search for the Scarlet Witch in hopes of restoring her sanity and undoing the damage she caused. They are followed by Quicksilver and the Avengers, and it is revealed that the Wanda they find is a robot created by [[Doctor Doom]], who is apparently keeping the real Scarlet Witch prisoner.<ref>''Avengers: the Children's Crusade'' #2</ref> Despite the advice of his [[Magneto (comics)|grandfather]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|uncle]], [[Hulkling|boyfriend]] and teammates, Wiccan attempts to break into Latveria and Castle Doom alone, only to discover that his mother is not only amnesic, but also apparently engaged to be married to Doom the next day.<ref>''Avengers: the Children's Crusade'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Scarlet Witch is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who had the ability to manipulate probability via her "hexes" (often manifesting physically as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts"). These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration and despite this precision, the hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if Wanda is tired or using her powers excessively. If overextended, Wanda's hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes. Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent. These hexes would only manifest "bad luck" effects. She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects. She can use her hexes to light flammable objects, contain or remove air from a particular volume, deflect objects, stop the momentum of projectiles, open doors, explode objects, create force fields and deflect magical attacks etc. The effects are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>''Avengers'' #118 (Dec. 1973)</ref> the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Jul. 1977)</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #10 (1981)</ref> Wanda is an expert combatant having been trained by both [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], as well as being an adept tactician due to her years of experience working as an Avenger and her experience in a variety of combat situations. The Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined the Scarlet Witch's powers, and maintained that it was in fact an ability to manipulate chaos magic, activated when she was born. Busiek's redefinition upgraded Wanda's powers substantially, and she is shown as being capable of feats such as the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]]. She was here described as the "nexus being" of the Marvel Universe, capable of birthing children with power enough to challenge [[Incarnation|avatar]]s of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1-12 (1997)</ref>

Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] revamped Wanda's powers yet again, with [[Doctor Strange]] stating that there was in fact no such thing as chaos magic, and that Wanda had been altering reality all along. Her power was here depicted as sufficient to rewrite her entire universe,<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> and cause multiverse-threatening ripples.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462 - 465</ref>

===Marvel 1602===
In [[Marvel 1602]], Sister Wanda and her brother, [[Quicksilver_(comics)#Marvel_1602|Petros]], are followers of [[Alternate_versions_of_Magneto#1602|Enrique]], High Inquisitor of the Spanish Catholic Church.<ref>''Marvel 1602'' #1 - 8 (Nov. 2003 - June 2004)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' storyline, an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of the Scarlet Witch helps [[Ash Williams|Ash]] find the [[Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]. Wanda is eventually attacked and infected by zombified [[vigilante]] the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #1 - 6 (Dec. 2005 - Apr. 2006)</ref> The character reappears, still "zombified" in the third installment in the series, ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]''.

===MC2===
An older version of the Scarlet Witch appears in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] title ''[[A-Next]]'', having been placed in a [[coma]] during the original Avengers final battle.<ref>''A-Next'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref> She was captured, revived, and brainwashed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], but eventually returned to her normal mindset.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' #1-5</ref> She has made sporadic appearances in the MC2 universe since then.

The siblings also share an incestuous relationship. In the third volume of Ultimates 3, Scarlet Witch is killed by a lovesick Ultron which later turned out to be orchestrated by Doctor Doom.

The Ultimate version's powers differ from the mainstream version in that the character has to "do the math" in order to use her powers — she must calculate the mathematical probability that the effect she intends to create will actually happen, with the more unlikely the effect, the more complex the mathematical formula.<ref>''Ultimates'' #1 - 13 (March 2002 - April 2004); ''Ultimates 2'' #1 - 13 (Feb. 2005 - Feb. 2007)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Scarlet Witch appeared as a part of the Avengers in select episodes of the Captain America portion of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* The Scarlet Witch appears in the 1994 animated television series ''[[Iron Man (1994 TV series)|Iron Man]]'' voiced by Katherine Moffat in Season One and [[Jennifer Darling]] in Season Two.<ref name="imdb.com">[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001123/]</ref> The cartoon's Scarlet Witch owes next to nothing to the comic book character: here, she is a mystical, tarot-reading spiritualist identified in the closing credits as "Wanda Frank" (an alias by her in the comics, in which her real name is "Wanda Maximoff"), who speaks with a thick Eastern-European (or according to the [[closed captioning]], German) accent and refers to other characters as "pumpkin" and "cupcake". Her power is identified as a "hex sense," but what that ''means'' is never explained, and seems to allow her to do anything, from shape-changing to matter manipulation. In a sub-plot crafted solely for the cartoon, Spider-Woman and the Scarlet Witch vie for the affections of Iron Man.
* Scarlet Witch made both a guest and a cameo appearance in the 1990s [[X-Men (1992 TV series)|X-Men animated series]] voiced by [[Susan Roman]]. In "Family Ties," she and Quicksilver arrive on Mount Wundagore to learn of their past and ended up learning that Magneto was their father.
* Scarlet Witch appears in the 1999 animated television series ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand|Avengers]]'' voiced by [[Stavroula Logothettis]].<ref name="imdb.com"/> Here little to no mention is made regarding her familiar ties to Magneto or Quicksilver, or even that she is a mutant.  Her relationship with Wonder Man remains, as well as hints to feelings towards Vision.  In the series, in order to active her hex powers she must utter the phrase "Winds of Destiny, Change!"  She has a heavy combination of a German and Russian accent.
* In ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' '''Wanda''' is voiced by [[Kelly Sheridan]].<ref name="imdb.com"/> She was locked away in an asylum at a young age by her father, Magneto. With the help of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] she was able to breakout in order to get revenge on her father and joined the Brotherhood in an attempt to take down the X-Men on behalf of Mystique (even though she has tense feelings toward her brother, Quicksilver). Eventually, Magneto used [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] to change Wanda's memories of her father to show him in a new light, and she began seeing him as a loving father as a result. She and her brother, Quicksilver participated in the battle against [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], and saved their father. Eventually they along with the rest of the Brotherhood became members of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]
