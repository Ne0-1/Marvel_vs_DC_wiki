==Biography==
Magda — pregnant with the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]], after seeing her husband [[Magneto (comics)|Magnus]] use his magnetic powers for the first time.  The twins are born, and as Mt. Wundagore is the prison of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], his residual energies alter Wanda and will later give her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities. Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bova]]. Bova soon assists the [[World War II]] superheroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America loses her own life in the process.  These complications are thought to be due to [[radiation poisoning]] deliberately caused by the villain [[Isbisa]], the enemy of Miss America's husband Robert Frank, AKA [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]]. Bova hides the truth from Frank and claims that only the mother has died, and that he now has twin children. Frank is shocked at the death of his wife and flees at super speed.<ref>''Avengers'' #185 - 187 (Jul. - Sep. 1979)</ref> As Wundagore was no place for human infants, the High Evolutionary places them in the care of the [[Romani people|gypsies]] Django and Marya Maximoff, who raise the twins as their own children. The twins are forced to flee a mob when Wanda uses her powers to protect herself and accidentally causes a fire that kills their adoptive gypsy mother.<ref>Recounted in ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #1 - 12 (Oct. 1985 - Sep. 1986)</ref>

Once Pietro (Quicksilver) and Wanda (The Scarlet Witch) reach adolescence, they discover that they are in fact mutants. Pietro possesses [[superhuman]] speed, while Wanda learns that she can control probability. When the pair display their powers in public, and are again attacked by a superstitious crowd, they are saved by their father — now the supervillain Magneto — although neither Magneto nor his children are aware of their connection. Magneto then recruits the pair for the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Brotherhood battles the [[X-Men]] on several occasions,<ref>''X-Men'' #5 (May 1964); #6 (July 1964) & #7 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and the twins become reluctant members of the Brotherhood and only remain because of their obligation to Magneto.  When Magneto and his lackey [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] are abducted by the cosmic entity [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], the Brotherhood dissolves and the twins declare that their debt to Magneto has been paid.<ref>''X-Men'' #11 (May 1965)</ref>

===Avengers===
Soon after Magneto's abduction, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch are recruited by the hero [[Iron Man]] to join The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Along with [[Captain America]] as leader, and former villain [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the four become the second generation of The Avengers and are later dubbed as "Cap's Kooky Quartet".<ref>"Avengers #16 (May 1965)</ref>
[[Image:A-104.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover of ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #104 (Oct. 1972), featuring the Scarlet Witch and the Avengers. Art by Rick Buckler.]]
Wanda becomes close friends with Hawkeye and a loyal member of the team until she is accidentally shot on a mission against Magneto. Quicksilver then flees from the Avengers with his wounded sister.<ref>''Avengers'' #49 (Feb. 1968)</ref> The pair accompany Magneto back to his mid-Atlantic base,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #43 (Apr. 1968)</ref> and Wanda spends the next few weeks recovering from her wound. She watches as Magneto captures the X-Men<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #44 (May 1968)</ref> and Pietro skirmishes with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], one of the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #45 (Jun. 1968)</ref> and later [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' #71 (Apr. 1969)</ref> After these encounters, the twins finally realize that Magneto is the true villain. Wanda and Pietro are then kidnapped along with several other mutants by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but are subsequently freed by the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #59 - 60 (Aug - Sep. 1969)</ref>

Quicksilver later returns to the Avengers and advises them that Wanda has been kidnapped and taken to another dimension by the warlord [[Arkon]].<ref>''Avengers'' #75 - 76 (Apr. - May 1970)</ref> After being rescued, Wanda — together with Pietro — rejoins the team. The Scarlet Witch then falls in love with teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], an android originally created as a weapon by Avenger's foe [[Ultron]]. Before long, the two develop a romantic relationship.<ref name="Avengers #109 Mar. 1973">''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)</ref> Their relationship has a tumultuous start as both Quicksilver and Hawkeye object — Quicksilver cannot accept the idea that his sister loves a robot while Hawkeye loves Wanda himself.<ref name="Avengers #109 Mar. 1973"/> Despite this, the pair eventually marry with the blessing of the entire team.<ref name="Giant-Size Avengers' 1975">''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975)</ref> 

The Scarlet Witch begins to become frustrated with the fluctuating level of her mutant ability, and is tutored by a true witch, [[Agatha Harkness]]. The training allows Wanda even greater control over her hexes<ref>''Avengers'' #128 - 137 (Oct. 1974 - Jul. 1975)</ref> and this proves invaluable in battle against foes such as Ultron.<ref>''Avengers'' #161 (Jul. 1977)</ref> Wanda and Pietro also met Robert Frank, who briefly joins the Avengers, believing them to be his children.<ref>Whizzer joins unofficially as of ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (1974)</ref> This is later disproved when Wanda and Pietro are abducted by Django Maximoff and taken to Wundagore. Wanda is temporarily possessed by the [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], but after being released is advised by Bova that neither Frank nor Maximoff is their biological father.<ref>''Avengers'' #185 - 187 (July - Sep. 1979)</ref> Soon after, while trying to track down Magda one last time, Magneto would learn that he was the father of the twins. He immediately informed them of their relationship shortly after the birth of Pietro's daughter Luna.<ref>''Vision and Scarlet Witch #4 ()</ref> The Scarlet Witch and Vision take a leave of absence from the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)</ref> and courtesy of Wanda's enhanced power conceive twin boys named Thomas and William.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #3 (Dec. 1985)</ref> Wanda gives birth,<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #12 (Sep. 1986)</ref> and, with Vision, eventually joins the [[West Coast Avengers]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #34 (Aug. 1988)</ref> needing some time away from the main team after Vision becomes unbalanced and tries to take over the world's computers.<ref>Climaxed in ''Avengers'' #254 (Apr. 1985)</ref> 

Their relationship is almost ended when Vision is abducted by a coalition of the world governments and dismantled to ensure that he is no longer a threat. Although rebuilt, Vision is recreated as a colorless, emotionless synthezoid.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #42 - 45 (Mar. - Jun. 1989)</ref> Wanda's agitation is increased when [[Wonder Man]] - whose brain patterns were the model for the Vision - refuses to repeat the process and "humanize" Vision, as he is secretly in  love with the Scarlet Witch and sees an opportunity for himself.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #45 (Jun. 1989)</ref> Now desperate, the Scarlet Witch consults a Dean of Robotics in the state of Texas, who secretly manages a mutant research facility. The Scarlet Witch is bonded with a sentient symbiotic substance, with the Dean intending to use Wanda as a prototype to replace mankind. Wanda is, however, rescued by her teammates with the assistance of Captain America and [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #47 - 49 (Aug. - Sep. 1989)</ref>

Another personal setback follows when it is revealed that Wanda's children are in fact two missing shards of the soul of the demonic entity [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. In an act of kindness, Agatha Harkness then erases all trace of the children from Wanda's memory.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #51-52 (Nov. - Dec. 1989)</ref> Despite this, the Scarlet Witch retreats from reality and falls into a catatonic state. Vision, now guided by cold logic, decides in the wake of recent developments on the East coast to return to the main team, and is apparently oblivious to the condition of his wife.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #53 (Mid Dec. 1989)</ref> Wanda's weakened state over the loss of her children and changes in her husband makes her susceptible to the mental commands of Magneto, who is also apparently being aided by Quicksilver. Adopting a new evil persona, Wanda turns against the Avengers as she and her family battle the Avengers West Coast team,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #55 - 57 (Feb. - Apr. 1990)</ref> until it is revealed that Pietro was only waiting for the right moment to stop his father and helps drive Magneto off. During the battle, Wanda again reverts back to a catatonic state, with this being caused by the time entity [[Immortus]]; although he is later defeated and Wanda is rescued by the Avengers and restored to sanity.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #60 - 63 (Jul. - Sep. 1990)</ref>

Despite Vision's absence, the Scarlet Witch remains with the team. When the West Coast team is dissolved by the main team due to internal disputes and mistakes in the field,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #102 (Jan. 1994)</ref> Wanda goes on to lead a breakaway team called [[Force Works]].<ref>''Force Works'' #1 (Jul. 1994)</ref> The team suffers several setbacks, including the death of Wonder Man on the first mission.<ref>''Force Works'' #2 (Aug. 1994)</ref> When the team splinters after the last mission involving [[Kang the Conqueror]],<ref>''Force Works'' #22 (Apr. 1996)</ref> the Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye return to the main team.<ref>''Avengers'' #397 (Apr. 1996)</ref> Vision and Scarlet Witch reconcile shortly before sacrificing themselves with the other Avengers and the [[Fantastic Four]] to stop the mutant villain [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>''Onslaught: Marvel Universe'' (1996)</ref> Due to the intervention of [[Franklin Richards]], Scarlet Witch and her teammates exist in a parallel universe for a year,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 - 13 (Nov. 1996 - Dec. 1997)</ref> until being returned to the mainstream universe by Franklin.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 1997)</ref>

Shortly after the heroes return, Scarlet Witch is kidnapped by the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], with the intention of using Wanda's powers to warp reality in le Fay's image. Although successful, Wanda retaliates by restoring Captain America's memories, who in turn is able to restore several Avengers' memories. Wanda also accidentally resurrects Wonder Man, who assists in her escape. Although the Avengers defeat le Fay, Vision is damaged in the final battle when Le Fay destroys the lower half of his body. Vision is placed in a surgical repair device, and via [[holography|hologram]] communicates with Wanda and asks her not to visit him while he heals.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 - 4 (Feb. - Apr. 1998)</ref>

An upset Wanda visits Agatha Harkness and learns that she is now able to channel [[chaos magic]], which will allow her to change reality. After much deliberation and still hurting from Vision's rejection, Wanda resurrects Wonder Man and the two become lovers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #10 (Nov. 1997)</ref> Vision is eventually repaired and has a confrontation with Wonder Man, though they part on amicable terms.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #23 (Dec. 1998)</ref> During the war against Kang, Wanda and Wonder Man separate, as they realize that theirs is a relationship of passion with no interest in a normal future.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #51 (Apr. 2002)</ref> Wanda later reconciles with Vision, and becomes energized with chaos magic when the villain  [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] splits the cosmic entity the [[In-Betweener]] into his separate order and chaos personas.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #58 - 60 (Jun. - Aug. 2002)</ref>

===Avengers Disassembled===
{{Main|Avengers Disassembled}}
''Avengers Disassembled'' is a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event between several [[Marvel Comics]] series.  The active members of the Avengers team during the event included the Scarlet Witch. The Avengers are depicted returning from events in England, and Janet Van Dyne, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], enters into a romantic tryst with the wounded, but recovering, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. While discussing the affair with Wanda, a slightly tipsy Wasp confesses to a pregnancy scare and inadvertently mentions Wanda's own children.<ref>''Avengers'' #503 (Dec. 2004)</ref> This causes Wanda to suffer a mental breakdown, and she starts rewriting reality, causing a series of threats and incidents to inexplicably occur one after the other, including the deaths of [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]], and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. She also procedes to recreate her children. The Avengers confront her and [[Doctor Strange]] shuts down her mind. Wanda is then retrieved by her father Magneto, and taken to [[Genosha]].<ref name="Avengers' 2004">''Avengers'' #500 - 503 (Sept. - Dec. 2004); ''Avengers Finale'' (Jan. 2005)</ref>

===House of M and Decimation===
{{Main|House of M|Decimation (comics)}}
[[Image:Houseofm1.jpg|225px|Variant cover to ''House of M'' #1 (June 2005)<br>Art by [[Joe Quesada]] and Danny Miki.|right|thumb]]

After the events of the House of M, a newly resurrected Hawkeye seeks out and becomes intimate with Wanda, who is now living a normal life with no apparent mutant abilities and no memory of her past.<ref>''New Avengers'' #26 (Jan. 2007)</ref> The mutant [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] later finds Wanda and seeks her help to deal with the aftermath of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], but she has no memory of him.<ref>''X-Men: Endangered Species'' (Oct. 2007)</ref> [[Young Avengers]] members [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Speed (comics)|Speed]] attempt - unsuccessfully - to find her, though the issue depicts her continuing to lead a normal and secluded life in Wundagore.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents'' #3 (2008)</ref>

[[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has masqueraded as Scarlet Witch to form and subsequently manipulate a new team of Avengers in ''[[Mighty Avengers]]''.<ref name="chaos magic2">''Mighty Avengers'' #21-23 (2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, the Scarlet Witch had the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to manipulate [[probability]] via "hexes". Visually, these hexes could manifest as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts" and increased the probability of various unlikely phenomena, including spontaneous combustion of inflammable objects, rapid rust or decay of organic or inorganic materials, deflection of objects and powers in flight, and disruption of energy transmissions or fields. These hexes were relatively short range and limited to line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration. Despite this precision, the hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if Wanda is tired or using her powers excessively. If overextended, Wanda's hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes. The effects are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>''Avengers'' #118 (Dec. 1973)</ref> the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Jul. 1977)</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #10 (1981)</ref> Wanda is an expert combatant having been trained by both [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], as well as being an adept tactician due to her years of experience working as an Avenger and her experience in a variety of combat situations.

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined the Scarlet Witch's powers, and maintained that it was in fact an ability to manipulate chaos magic, activated when she was born. Busiek's redefinition upgraded Wanda's powers substantially, and she is shown as being capable of feats such as the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]]. She was here described as the "nexus being" of the Marvel Universe, capable of birthing children with power enough to challenge [[avatar]]s of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1-12 (1997)</ref> 

Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] revamped Wanda's powers yet again, with [[Doctor Strange]] stating that there was in fact no such thing as chaos magic, and that Wanda had been altering reality all along. Her power was here depicted as sufficient to rewrite her entire universe,<ref>''House of M'' #1-8 (2005)</ref> and cause multiverse-threatening ripples.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462-465</ref>

==Other versions==

===Heroes Reborn===
The Scarlet Witch is one of the Avengers participating in the defeat of the entity [[Onslaught]], and is subsequently trapped in the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe. In this artificial reality, Wanda was raised by Agatha Harkness, with the Asgardian sorceress the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] falsely claiming to be her mother.<ref>''Avengers Reborn'' #1  vol. 2, (Nov. 1996)</ref>

[[Image:Scarlet Witch Ultimate.jpg‎|150px|right|thumb|The Ultimate Scarlet Witch on the cover of ''Ultimate Power'' #6 (Sep. 2007). Art by [[Greg Land]].]]

The siblings also share an incestuous relationship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Ultimate version's powers differ from the mainstream version in that the character has to "do the math" in order to use her powers — she must calculate the mathematical probability that the effect she intends to create will actually happen, with the more unlikely the effect, the more complex the mathematical formula. In the limited series ''[[Ultimates 3]]'', the Scarlet Witch is killed via a seeking bullet fired by the robot [[Ultron#Ultimate Ultron|Ultron]].<ref>''Ultimates 3'' </ref>

===Age of Apocalypse===
During the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline, the Scarlet Witch is a member of Magneto's version of the X-Men, dying to defend the X-Men's base on Wundagore Mountain from an attack by [[Holocaust (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Nemesis]].<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (March 1995)</ref>
