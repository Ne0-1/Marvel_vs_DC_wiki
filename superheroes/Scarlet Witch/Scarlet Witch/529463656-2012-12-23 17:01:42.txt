==Publication history==
The Scarlet Witch debuted, together with her brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964). After several brief appearances as a villain in issues #5 (May 1964); #6 (July 1964); #7 (Sept. 1964); and #11 (May 1965), Wanda and her brother were added to the cast of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965).  The Scarlet Witch was a semi-regular member of the team until issue #49 (Feb. 1968), and then returned in issue #75 (April 1970) and was a perennial member of both the main team and several affiliated teams (such as the [[West Coast Avengers]] and [[Force Works]]) until Avengers #503 (Dec. 2004), the final issue of the first volume.

The Scarlet Witch starred in two [[limited series]] with husband and fellow Avenger the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]: ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #1 - 4 (Nov. 1982 - Feb. 1983), by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciller]] [[Rick Leonardi]],<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2669/ ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (1982 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> and a second volume of the same title numbered #1 - 12 (Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986), written by [[Steve Englehart]] and penciled by [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/3057/ ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (1985 series)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>  A solo limited series, titled ''Scarlet Witch'', ran four issues in 1994.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/5039/ ''Scarlet Witch''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> A [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] titled ''Mystic Arcana Scarlet Witch'' was published in October 2007<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/38843/ ''Mystic Arcana Scarlet Witch''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> and an ''Avengers Origins: The Scarlet Witch & Quicksilver'' one-shot followed in January 2012.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/62147/ ''Avengers Origins: The Scarlet Witch & Quicksilver''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

Artist [[George Pérez]] designed a new costume with a strong [[Romani people|Roma]] influence for the character in 1998.<ref>{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 2: George Pérez|last= Nolen-Weathington|first= Eric|year= 2003|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn= 1-893905-25-X |page= 95|quote = |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=bhOPZ2u7C_YC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=George+Perez+Scarlet+Witch+gypsy+costume&source=bl&ots=Bs8isOQat3&sig=r_db7XEbAwcZ-l_Gb735iAsSvGI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XAYFT_jSH-b22AWI2MCBAg&sqi=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate= January 4, 2012}}</ref> This design has rarely been used by artists other than Pérez.  [[Alan Davis]] stated that when he became the artist on ''The Avengers'', he "asked to change the Scarlet Witch just because I didn't feel the design George Pérez created worked with my drawing style.  I tend to go for simpler, more open lines and don't do lots of detail in rendering."<ref>{{cite book |last1= Nolen-Weathington|first1= Eric|title= Modern Masters Volume 1: Alan Davis|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=f7dsTZKkk78C&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=Alan+Davis+Scarlet+Witch+costume&source=bl&ots=c1mjhw3Ewu&sig=w36-lbmYGKaCHajeo9gc-BBFjVg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QgcFT83eBMvoggeJ4uG1Ag&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|year= 2003|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn= 1-893905-19-5 |page= 92 |quote=   }}</ref>

The character played a pivotal role in the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline and related limited series ''[[House of M]]'', and appeared in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

[[Don Markstein]] asserted that the character was unlike another, and stated that "The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a [[wimple]]. Her super power is unlike any other — she can alter probability so as to cause mishaps for her foes. In other words, she "hexes" them." <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|title= The Scarlet Witch|last= Markstein|first= Don|date= |work= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/64NTfJTNo|archivedate= January 1, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= January 1, 2012|quote=  }}</ref>

The Scarlet Witch is a regular character in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' (2012), beginning with issue #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Magda — pregnant with the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]], after seeing her husband [[Magneto (comics)|Magnus]] use his magnetic powers for the first time.  The twins are born during a battle between the Knights of Wundagore and the Other, "the elemental host of Cthon"; Mt. Wundagore is the prison of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], and Magda had come to the mountain in the midst of a plot of his to escape the prison.  Cthon altered Wanda and will later give her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities; Cthon had planned to use her as a vessel for his own [[demonic possession]] when she reached maturity, a vessel with both mutant and magical powers.  Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bova]]. Bova soon assists the [[World War II]] superheroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America loses her own life in the process.  These complications are thought to be due to [[radiation poisoning]] deliberately caused by the villain [[Isbisa]], the enemy of Miss America's husband Robert Frank, [[wikt:AKA|a.k.a]] [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]]. Bova hides the truth from Frank and claims that only the mother has died, and that he now has twin children. Frank is shocked at the death of his wife and flees at super speed.<ref name="Avengers' 1979">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]], [[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]], and [[David Michelinie|Michelinie, David]]| penciller= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| inker= [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]| story= The Yesterday Quest!| title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 185| date= July 1979}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= Nights of Wundagore!| title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 186| date= August 1979}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= The Call of the Mountain Thing!| title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 187| date= September 1979}}</ref> As Wundagore was no place for human infants, the High Evolutionary places them in the care of the [[Romani people|Romani]] Django and Marya Maximoff, who raise the twins as their own children. The twins are forced to flee a mob when Wanda uses her powers to protect herself and accidentally causes a fire that kills their adoptive Roma mother.<ref>Recounted in ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #1 - 12 (Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986)</ref>

===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
Once Pietro (Quicksilver) and Wanda (The Scarlet Witch) reach adolescence, they discover that they are in fact mutants. Pietro possesses [[superhuman]] speed, while Wanda learns that she can control probability. When the pair display their powers in public, and are again attacked by a superstitious crowd, they are saved by their father — now the supervillain Magneto — although neither Magneto nor his children are aware of their connection. Magneto then recruits the pair for the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Brotherhood battles the [[X-Men]] on several occasions,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]| penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]| inker= [[Paul Reinman|Reinman, Paul]]| story= The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants!| title= [[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]| issue= 4| date= March 1964}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= Reinman, Paul| story= Trapped: One X-Man!| title= X-Men| issue= 5| date= May 1964}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= [[Chic Stone|Stone, Chic]]| story= Sub-Mariner!

When Magneto and his lackey [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] are abducted by the cosmic entity [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], the Brotherhood dissolves and the twins declare that their debt to Magneto has been paid.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= Stone, Chic| story= The Triumph of Magneto!| title= X-Men| volume= | issue= 11 | date= May 1965}}</ref>

===The Avengers===
Soon after Magneto's abduction, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch are recruited by the hero [[Iron Man]] to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Along with [[Captain America]] as leader, and former villain [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the four become the second generation of the Avengers and are later dubbed as "Cap's Kooky Quartet".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]| penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]| inker= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]| story= The Old Order Changeth| title= [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]| volume= | issue= 16| date= May 1965| publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref>

Wanda becomes close friends with Hawkeye and a loyal member of the team until she is accidentally shot on a mission against Magneto. Quicksilver then flees from the Avengers with his wounded sister.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]]| penciller= [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]| inker= Buscema, John| story= Mine is the Power| title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 49 | date= February 1968| publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> The pair accompany Magneto back to his mid-Atlantic base,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy| penciller= [[George Tuska|Tuska, George]]|inker= [[John Tartaglione|Tartaglione, John]]|story= The Torch Is Passed...! |title= X-Men| issue= 43|date= April 1968}}</ref> and Wanda spends the next few weeks recovering from her wound.

Quicksilver later returns to the Avengers and advises them that Wanda has been kidnapped and taken to another dimension by the warlord [[Arkon]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy| penciller= Buscema, John| inker= Palmer, Tom| story= The Warlord and the Witch! | title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 75| date= April 1970| publisher=| page=|panel= }}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy| penciller= Buscema, John| inker= Palmer, Tom| story= The Blaze of Battle... the Flames of Love| title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 76| date= May 1970| publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> After being rescued, Wanda — together with Pietro — rejoins the team.

The Scarlet Witch begins to become frustrated with the fluctuating level of her mutant ability, and is tutored by a true witch, [[Agatha Harkness]]. The training allows Wanda even greater control over her hexes<ref>''Avengers'' #128 - 137 (Oct. 1974 - July 1975)</ref> and this proves invaluable in battle against foes such as Ultron.<ref name="Avengers_161">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]| penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]| inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]] | story= Beware the Ant-Man!| title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 161 | date= July 1977 | publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> Wanda and Pietro also met Robert Frank, who briefly joins the Avengers, believing them to be his children.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy| penciller= [[Rich Buckler|Buckler, Rich]]| inker= [[Dan Adkins|Adkins, Dan]]| story= Nuklo--the Invader That Time Forgot!| title= Giant-Size Avengers| volume= | issue= 1| date= August 1974}}</ref> This is later disproved when Wanda and Pietro are abducted by Django Maximoff and taken to Wundagore.

Their relationship is almost ended when fellow Avenger [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] unwittingly betrays the team and helps a coalition of the world governments kidnap and dismantled Vision, having viewed him as a threat to humanity. Although rebuilt, Vision is recreated as a colorless, emotionless synthezoid. Wanda's agitation is increased when [[Wonder Man]] - whose brain patterns were the model for the Vision - refuses to repeat the process and "humanize" Vision, as he is secretly in  love with the Scarlet Witch and sees an opportunity for himself.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John | penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= One of Our Androids is Missing!| title= West Coast Avengers| volume= 2| issue= 42| date= March 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John | penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= VisionQuest| title= West Coast Avengers| volume= 2| issue= 43| date= April 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John | penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= Better a Widow...| title= West Coast Avengers| volume= 2| issue= 44| date= May 1989}} <br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John | penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= New Faces| title= West Coast Avengers| volume= 2| issue= 45| date= June 1989}}</ref> Now desperate, the Scarlet Witch consults a Dean of Robotics in the state of Texas, who secretly manages a mutant research facility.

Another personal setback follows when it is revealed that Wanda's children are in fact two (of five) missing shards of the soul of the demonic entity [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that were previously scattered in an ill-fated encounter with the powerful mutant child, [[Franklin Richards]].<ref name="Fantastic Four No. 277 Apr. 1985">''Fantastic Four'' No. 277 (Apr. 1985)</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  I Sing of Arms and Heroes...| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 51| date= Mid-November 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  Fragments of a Greater Darkness| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 52| date= December 1989}}</ref> Absorbed back into Mephisto, Wanda's mentor Agatha Harkness temporarily erases Wanda's memories of her children from her mind in order to ensure that she can temporarily disrupt Mephisto's physical form.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  I Sing of Arms and Heroes...| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 51| date= Mid-November 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  Fragments of a Greater Darkness| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 52| date= December 1989}}</ref>  Combined with Wanda being captured and mind controlled as a bride of the serpent god [[Father Set|Set]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Michael Higgins (comics)|Higgins, Michael]]| penciller= [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Wilson, Ron]]| inker= [[Mike Gustovich|Gustovich, Mike]]| story= Avengers Assembled| title= The Avengers Annual| issue= 18| date= 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= [[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]]| story= Gather Now Ye 7 Brides!| title= Avengers West Coast Annual| issue= 4| date= 1989}}</ref>  Vision announcing his intent to relocate to the East Coast Avengers,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #53 (Mid Dec. 1989)</ref> and Magneto seeking to recruit Wanda into a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #55 - 57, #60 (Feb. - Apr. 1990)</ref> Wanda begins to go into and out of various catatonic states.

The Avengers ultimately rescue Wanda, who regains her memories of her children in the process (Avengers West Coast #61-#62).

As Wanda attempts to reconcile with Vision, the Scarlet Witch sought out help from Doctor Doom to see if he can help her restore her children to life. To do so, they summon a mysterious cosmic entity which merges with Scarlet Witch and resurrects her children into new bodies. However, the entity opts to hide the children from Wanda as it hides within her body. <ref name="Avengers Children Crusade #7">Avengers Children Crusade #7</ref>

Shortly after the heroes return, Scarlet Witch is kidnapped by the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], with the intention of using Wanda's powers to warp reality in le Fay's image. Although successful, Wanda retaliates by restoring Captain America's memories, who in turn is able to restore several Avengers' memories.

===Return===

====The Children's Crusade====
The Scarlet Witch resurfaced in the 2010-2012 miniseries ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''. In the series, it is revealed that the Scarlet Witch that has been seen was actually a Doombot, which prompted the [[Young Avengers]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to journey to [[Latveria]] with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] following behind him. [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] eventually finds the real Wanda, apparently devoid of her powers, amnesiac and engaged to be married to [[Doctor Doom]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

With Wolverine and the Avengers behind them in pursuit, the Young Avenger Iron Lad rescues the team and Wanda, teleporting them into the past where Wanda slowly regains her memory as she witnesses the corpse of Jack Of Hearts (who she reanimated into becoming a suicide bomber) approach [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]], ultimately distracting the creature long enough for her children and their teammates to rescue Lang and bring him into the future. When the group returns to the present, Scarlet Witch is shown in a depression where she thinks that she killed her father, her brother, and the Avengers. She vows to kill herself with Kree ships and Ultron clones which the Young Avengers destroy.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

During that time, Beast and X-Factor Investigations arrive, and Beast learns that the Scarlet Witch he previously encountered was actually a Doombot. Wiccan tells her that her father, her brother, and her "sons" are still alive. Wanda acknowledges Wiccan and Speed as her children as she recruits them to undo the damage she caused to the mutant community.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Beast asks her if she can reverse the "No more mutants spell". She is unsure a reverse spell would work. They meet up with X-Factor Investigations, who have many clients who are depowered mutants. Rictor volunteers and has his powers restored. The X-Men show up and Wanda tells X-Factor Investigations that she will give the X-Men whatever they want.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Allan Heinberg|Heinberg, Allan]]| penciller= [[Jim Cheung|Cheung, Jim]]| inker= [[Mark Morales (comics)|Morales, Mark]]; [[John Livesay|Livesay, John]]; [[Dave Meikis|Meikis, Dave]]| story= | title= [[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]| issue= 6| date= August 2011}}</ref> However, a battle ensues between the X-Men and the Avengers over what to do with Wanda, forcing her and the Young Avengers to flee back to Doctor Doom.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

It is revealed that Wanda's enhanced powers were a result of her and Doctor Doom's combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children. This proves to be too much for Wanda to contain and it overtook her. With Wiccan and Doctor Doom's help, they seek to use the entity that is possessing Wanda to restore mutantkinds' powers.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

This is stopped by the Young Avengers (who are concerned at the fall-out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly repowered) only to find out Doctor Doom's real plan: to transfer the entity into his own body and gain Wanda's god-like powers for himself.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Heinberg, Allan| penciller= Cheung, Jim| inker= Morales, Mark; Livesay, John; [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]]; Cheung, Jim| story= | title= Avengers: The Children's Crusade| issue= 7| date= November 2011}}</ref> Doctor Doom becomes omnipotent with powers surpassing those of beings such as the [[Beyonder]] or the [[Cosmic Cube]].

With the immediate crisis resolved, and the Young Avengers having convinced the other heroes that further blaming Wanda will accomplish nothing, Cyclops agrees to leave her alone, but states that he will kill Wanda if she turns against the heroes again. Rejecting the offer to rejoin the Avengers or her family, Wanda departs stating that after years of defining herself as Magneto's daughter, Pietro's sister, or the Vision's wife, she wants to find out who she is on her own before she decides what to do with her life.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Heinberg, Allan| penciller= Cheung, Jim| inker= Morales, Mark| story= How did this happen?| title= Avengers: The Children's Crusade| issue= 9| date= May 2012}}</ref>

However, despite both heroines pleading her case, the Vision angrily snaps at Wanda, blaming her again [[Avengers Disassembled|for having manipulated and killed him]], and telling her to leave. Despite both Ms. Marvel and [[Iron Man]] rushing to Wanda's defense, the Avengers ultimately defer every decision to the Vision, who elects to stand by his point, even if obviously pained by the situation: thus, Ms. Marvel has to carry away a crying Wanda.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0</ref> When the Avengers go to extract [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] from Utopia and are nearly defeated by a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]-powered Cyclops, Scarlet Witch arrives and saves them. Hope agrees to go with the Scarlet Witch, and Wanda causes physical harm to Cyclops when he touches Wanda's arm when he tries to stop her from taking Hope.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #6</ref>

Though hunted by the Phoenix-powered X-Men, Wanda's return to the team provides the Avengers a much needed boost as many teammates are captured by the X-Men. Hawkeye ultimately is severely injured rescuing Wanda from being teleported away by Magik and White Queen, the former of which sees Wanda as a monster for depowering mutantkind. However, Wanda's power provides the X-Men with a threat that not even the Phoenix can face down as the Avengers employ magical illusions to trick the X-Men into thinking Wanda is with the various Avengers groups. Further investigation meanwhile links Wanda's powers to the Phoenix Force.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #7</ref>

It has been revealed that Wanda will join Captain America's Uncanny Avengers in October.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
The Scarlet Witch is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who had the ability to manipulate probability via her "hexes" (often manifesting physically as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts"). These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration and despite this precision, the hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if Wanda is tired or using her powers excessively. If overextended, Wanda's hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes. Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent. These hexes would only manifest "bad luck" effects. She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects. She can use her hexes to light flammable objects, contain or remove air from a particular volume, deflect objects, stop the momentum of projectiles, open doors, explode objects, create force fields and deflect magical attacks, etc. The effects are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]| inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] and [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= To the Death!| title= The Avengers| volume= | issue= 118 | date= December 1973 | publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref name="Avengers_161" /> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]| penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]| inker= [[Armando Gil|Gil, Armando]]| story= By Friends--Betrayed!|title= The Avengers Annual|issue= 10|date= 1981}}</ref> Wanda is an expert combatant having been trained by both [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], as well as being an adept tactician due to her years of experience working as an Avenger and her experience in a variety of combat situations. The Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined the Scarlet Witch's powers, and maintained that it was in fact an ability to manipulate chaos magic, activated when she was born. Busiek's redefinition upgraded Wanda's powers substantially, and she is shown as being capable of feats such as the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]]. She was here described as the "nexus being" of the Marvel Universe, capable of birthing children powerful enough to challenge [[Incarnation|avatar]]s of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1-12 (1997)</ref>

Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] revamped Wanda's powers yet again, with [[Doctor Strange]] stating that there was in fact no such thing as chaos magic, and that Wanda had been altering reality all along. Her power was here depicted as sufficient to rewrite her entire universe,<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> and cause multiverse-threatening ripples.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462 - 465</ref>

When the Elder god and primeval demon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] was summoned to Earth Dimension by the power of the [[Darkhold]] and took Quicksilver as his host, he revealed that there is in fact Chaos Magic, a form of magic so dreaded and horrific that all of Earth's sorcerers made a pact to end Chthon's reign with a lie, that there is no God of Chaos and no Chaos Magic which is the basis for Chthon's unholy might. Later on after Chthon was exorcised from Quicksilver, he mentioned that he found in the Darkhold a leading text on Chaos Magic, the power which he believes is the source for his sister's insanity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]]| penciller= [[Khoi Pham|Pham, Khoi]]| inker= [[Allen Martinez (comics)|Martinez, Allen]] and  [[Danny Miki|Miki, Danny]]| story= Earth's Mightiest Part 3 of 3: Three Words| title= [[The Mighty Avengers]]| issue= 23 | date= May 2009}}</ref>

Wanda's power to alter reality was spawned from the combination of her natural mutant abilities to affect probability and Chaos Magic. Because of the nature of her powers, she does not possess certain limitations like other reality warpers such as [[Mad Jim Jaspers]] who needs existing reality to use his powers. Her powers which stemmed out from the ability to manipulate probabilities suggest that she does not need existing matter to warp reality, only possibilities which are endless. It must also be noted that the Scarlet Witch is responsible for the resurrection of Mad Jim Jaspers which happened when her powers altered reality.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

She also has a degree of resistance to the Phoenix Force and can also cause pain to its hosts, such as Cyclops when he tried to stop Hope from going with her.<ref>''A vs X'' #6</ref> Although this becomes less effective as the Phoenix Force portions are divided among those who have not yet been defeated.{{issue|date=September 2012}} ''A vs X'' #12 confirmed that her powers involve chaos magic, and stated that she has "Mutant Magic", and the "primal source of her chaos" magic is cosmic.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

However, the character somehow reappears, still "zombified" in the third installment in the series, ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]''. She works with the [[Kingpin (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Kingpin]], using the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Marvel Zombies|Vision]] - who was still in love with her - to block any type of enemy radio signals as nessecary. She (and the other zombies) was later confronted by Ultron, Machine Man, and Jocasta, who decided to save the Vision and finally kill the zombie Kingpin.
