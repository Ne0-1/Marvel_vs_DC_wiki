The '''Scarlet Witch''' (Wanda Maximoff) is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]]ine in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #4 ([[1963]]).  In her latest incarnation, she has used her hex powers to reshape the entire Marvel Universe in the House of M storyline.

==History==
===Birth===
[[Image:Avengers234.jpg|left|150px|thumbnail|Cover to '''Avengers #234'''. Art by Allen Milgrom.]]
The Scarlet Witch is the twin sister of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (Pietro Maximoff); the twins are the children of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his late wife Magda. Magda fled from Magneto before either learned that she was pregnant. The twins were born in the [[fictional country]] of Transia on the equally-fictitious Wundagore Mountain, the prison of the [[Elder God]] [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]].  Chthon's residual energies altered Wanda, giving her the ability to use magic, in addition to her mutant power.  Magda survived giving birth to the twins but days after left the refuge of the [[High Evolutionary]]. She feared that Magneto would locate her and force her to surrender the children to him. She instead fled, and is believed to have chosen to commit [[suicide]] by exposing herself to the frozen wasteland surrounding the refuge.

Bova, a genetically-engineered humanoid cow who served as their nursemaid, decided to find foster parents for the apparent orphans. Nearby [[World War II]] superheroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] was giving birth to her own twins. Her husband the [[Whizzer]] asked for Bova to assist the birth. Mother and children died due to [[radiation poisoning]] deliberately caused by her former enemy [[Isbisa]]. Bova only reported the death of the mother but presented the alive set of twins to Whizzer as his own. He was however shocked by the death of his wife and chose to flee as far away from Wundagore Mountain as possible.

Bova returned the children to Wundagore. She later found a suitable pair of foster parents in the [[Roma (people)|Rom]] couple Django and Marya Maximoff. Their own children Ana and Mateo had recently died and the couple saw little Wanda and Pietro as suitable replacements. They would raise them as their own. Both siblings manifested powers due to mutation in early [[adolescence]]. The Rom were however victims of [[prejudice]] by the mainstream population of Transia who considered them [[immoral]].
===Orphaned===
Django was a [[doll]]-maker but had increasing difficulty in finding customers as Transians did not allow their children to approach the Rom. He eventually resorted to stealing food in order to save his family from starvation. Pietro took the initiative to also start stealing food. Wanda was also introduced to prejudice when a Transian boy her age attempted to molest her against her consent. She used her powers to return to safety but was accused of attempting to seduce the boy. Eventually angry Transian villagers attacked the Rom and burned their wagons. Marya Maximoff was trapped in their wagon and burned alive. Django was clubbed to unconsciousness but Pietro and Wanda managed to flee. The twins were now on their own.

Wanda and Pietro considered at this point that they were the only family left to each other. Pietro was in fact especially protective of his sister. However they were mistaken in their belief. They had lost three different mothers: Magda, Miss America and Marya Maximoff. But both their natural father Magneto and their adoptive fathers Whizzer and Django Maximoff were alive. Eventually all three would try to contact their children again. 

In their early adulthood, both Wanda and Pietro were among the first members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], though neither Magneto nor his children were aware at the time that he was their father.  After Magneto's abduction by the alien [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], the twins were recruited into the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by [[Captain America]].  The Scarlet Witch has become one of the team's mainstays since then.

===Marriage===
Wanda married the [[android]] [[Vision (comics)|Vision]]; her hex powers allowed the couple to have children.  However, it was later revealed that the "children" were not actual children; rather, they were fragments of the soul of the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who had previously been discorporated by [[Franklin Richards]].  The children were restored to their natural forms as parts of Mephisto; also during this time period, the Vision was disassembled by the government, then subsequently rebuilt without the ability to feel emotions.  The emotional damage incurred upon Wanda during this time frame, combined with her powers being enhanced by [[Immortus]], drove her temporarily insane, leading her to a brief alliance with her father, Magneto.  However, she recovered, and remained a member of the Avengers, though she and the Vision were separated, working on different branches of the team.  In order to keep Wanda's grief from overwhelming her, [[Agatha Harkness]] placed a spell on Wanda to erase her conscious memory of her "children", although she later removed this spell .

After the dissolution of the West Coast branch of the Avengers with which she served, she was a founding member and field leader of the short-lived superhero team [[Force Works]]. [[Wonder Man]] died during Force Works' first adventure, and it was years before he returned.  When he did return, it was Wanda's hexes that drew his energy-based body back together, as a kind of "ionic ghost".  She restored him to true life (with the assistance of Agatha Harkness), and the pair openly had an affair for several months.  Around this time, an encounter with Morgan le Fey left Wanda's magic powers drastically altered and increased.  She was told by Agatha Harkness that this "chaos magic" was her true power, but [[Doctor Strange]] has since confirmed that "chaos magic" does not exist. The Scarlet Witch has remained a frequent member of the Avengers since the reformation of the team, and she began a slow move towards a reconciliation with the Vision.

===House of M===
[[image:Houseofm1.jpg|left|Variant cover to ''House of M'' #1. Art by [[Joe Quesada]].|thumb]]
In the recent "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]], grief over the loss of the twins again drove the Scarlet Witch insane. She tried to rewrite reality to recreate them, inadvertently causing a series of threats and incidents to inexplicably occur one after the other. The attacks killed Hawkeye, Scott Lang, and the Vision. 

When the Avengers later confronted the Scarlet Witch, she had created an illusion where she was having dinner with the Vision and their children.  Believing the Avengers were trying to take away her children, she attacked them before falling into a [[coma]] due to [[Doctor Strange]]'s magics. Magneto arrived, and before anyone could stop him carried his daughter away back to [[Genosha]].

At Genosha, Magneto asked [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], an extremely powerful telepath, to help Wanda. Xavier agreed, but after several months of trying, he was unsuccessful. Doctor Strange was asked to try to help, but he too had no idea on how to help her.  Xavier called for a joint meeting of the Avengers and the X-Men to decide Wanda's fate. While most of the members were against killing her, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Emma Frost]] believed that her mental instability and her extreme powers left her too dangerous to be left alive. The teams ultimately agreed to hold judgement until they could travel to Genosha to survey how Wanda was doing.

Fearing the worse, Quicksilver rushed to Magneto and told him that the two groups were planning on killing Wanda. When an ashamed Magneto admitted that he didn't know what to do anymore, and that the groups may be right, Quicksilver convinced Wanda that she could undo her wrongs by using her powers to turn the world into a world of peace. Using her powers, Wanda warped reality into the [[House of M]], a world where mutants were the majority, humans the minority, and Magneto the ruler. In this reality, Wanda was believed to be a human, due to an alternate body she created to represent her in public while she cared for her children.

A young mutant named Layla Miller was able to use her mutant abilities to restore several of the heroes' memories. They headed over to Genosha to attack Magneto, believing him to be the one responsible for the change. During the battle between Magneto's forces and the others, Layla was able to restore Magneto's memories as well.

Enraged, Magneto confronted Quicksilver, angry that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name. Quicksilver told Magneto that he would have let Wanda die, but Magneto replied that Quicksilver had only used him and Wanda, killing his son.

Wanda revived her brother, telling Magneto that Quicksilver had only wanted him to be happy, and that Magneto had ruined them, choosing the mutants over his own children. Saying "No more mutants," Wanda changed the world back to its original form and caused ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers, leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction.

After the fallout, she was seen in a small, unknown European village, happy and apparently oblivious to all the carnage she had caused.

==Other versions of the Scarlet Witch==
===X-Men Evolution===
Commited to an institution by her father Magneto when she was just a child, Wanda harbored a great anger and hatred for him. Freed from the institution by Mystique, she joined the Brotherhood in return, but only to exact her revenge on Magneto. As one of the most powerful mutants, Wanda is feared by the X-Men, Brotherhood and Magneto. Knowing that Wanda would never stop until she gained her vengeance, Magneto has used the mutant known as MasterMind to rewrite Wanda's memories. She no longer remembers being commited to the institution and has lost her hatred for her father. She has since decided to remain with the Brotherhood. With Magneto's recent "death", Wanda has taken the news quite hard and blamed the X-Men for not helping her father in his fight with Apocalypse.  When her father was discovered, not only alive, but now one of Apocalypse's 'Four Horsemen', Wanda joined Shadowcat's team in Mexico to confront Magneto and destroy one of Apocalypse's [[Pyramid]]s.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, is the daughter of Magneto and the sister of Quicksilver. She has the ability to alter probability fields with her hex-spheres. 

Wanda was a passive member of Magneto's team and after her father's apparent death began working with the Brotherhood and even participated in the rescue of the X-Men from Weapon X. She helped lead the Brotherhood for a while, all the while keeping in touch with Charles Xavier to promote a more peaceful mutant-human integration. 

When Magneto returned, she and her brother fled although he caught them. He injured Quicksilver, but left Wanda unhurt. She began working with the Ultimates. 

Unlike the original mainstream versions of these characters, they have not abandoned their ties to Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants; they still believe in mutant supremacy. Because of their mutant status, they remain a part of the black ops section of the Ultimates.

*On Ultimates Volume 2 - 6, Millar alludes to the Scarlet Witch, Vision relationship. Hank Pym attempts to redeem himself by bringing Ultron and Vision to the Ultimates. Quicksilver asks Wanda, "Were you just flirting with that android?"

==Powers==
She has displayed the ability to cancel [[Longshot]] and [[Domino_(comics)|Domino]]'s powers of probability and has also once turned Longshot into a cat.

Initially, the Scarlet Witch had the ability to manipulate [[probability]] via her "hexes" (often manifesting physically as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts"). These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration. Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent. These hexes would only manifest "[[bad luck]]" effects. She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects. Despite this enhanced precision, her hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if she has been straining herself or using her powers excessively. If overextended, her hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes.

Her hexes have a wide, almost limitless variety of recorded and possible effects, though they often boil down to a kind of [[Deus Ex Machina]] superpower. They have been known to alter the molecular composition and physical state of physical objects, negate or distort physical laws, and to cause various forms of energy to spontaneously appear or disappear. She has a natural affinity with natural elements and phenomena, stemming largely from her magical training and origins, and has trained often at using her hexes to deflect projectiles or to cause enemies to stumble or otherwise suffer the effects of "bad luck". Writers often confuse her hex powers with [[psychokinesis]], and have occasionally depicted them as able to generate energy blasts and to grant Wanda the power of flight. Although her hexes can cause objects to suddenly move or change course, they do not have the ability to "hold on" to objects as a telekinetic might. Ultimately, the hexes are not under the Witch's direct control, although she can influence the nature of their effects with great concentration and effort.

Currently, the Scarlet Witch's powers have been redefined as the ability to [[Reality warper|manipulate reality]], and her probability-manipulating hexes have been redefined as the conscious manifestation of this subconscious power. The idea that Wanda possessed this level of power was first suggested by [[Immortus]] during his conflict with the Avengers West Coast, although Immortus specifically claimed that Wanda could manipulate the past to influence the present. Her powers were used by [[Morgan (comics)|Morgan Le Fey]] to alter reality in ''Avengers'' volume 3 #1-3, although this was only accomplished with magical amplification. The true extent of Wanda's reality manipulation power was finally confirmed by Doctor Strange during the events of ''Avengers Disassembled''. ''Avengers Disassembled'' also revealed that Wanda has been subconsciously altering the [[Marvel Universe]] to an unknown degree for a number of years, including the reanimation of the deceased Agatha Harkness without consciously realizing it to be the case. This aspect of her power is not under her conscious control, and continues even after Dr. Strange shut down her mind. The limits of this power are unknown, although she was capable of altering the entire Earth and the memories of all of its inhabitants during the ''House of M'' crossover.

Wanda is also a practictioner of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Although she is capable of using rudimentary ritualistic magic, complex and spontaneous spells of the sort cast by [[Doctor Strange]] are beyond her reach. Her magical ability comes into play most often when used to supplement her mutant hex power or the mystical abilities of other magic-users, such as her mystic mentor, [[Agatha Harkness]]. It has been suggested that Wanda's powers have been influenced by the demonic magician [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]]: in particular, that Chthon's own chaos magic redefined Wanda's power to have a similar function.

In ''X-Men Evolution'', Wanda's powers allow her to "Hex" anyone in her path. The "Hex" causes everything to turn against the victim and in Wanda's favor.
