The '''Scarlet Witch''' ('''Wanda Maximoff''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] who began as a super-villainess before reforming and becoming a [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]].  She has once again become evil due to a mental breakdown.  Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #4 ([[1964]]), her powers involve the ability to alter probability to various degrees of success, causing random effects that are called "hexes".  She is also a trained magician who can channel and use a highly dangerous form of magic known as "Chaos Magic" to augment her powers.

==Fictional character biography==
===Birth===
The Scarlet Witch is the twin sister of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (Pietro Maximoff); the twins are the children of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his late wife Magda.  Since both of her parents have been identified as Jewish, this makes her Jewish by birth.  The X-man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] has recently been revealed as a third offspring of Magneto, making her Wanda and Pietro's half-sister if true. Magda fled from Magneto before either learned that she was pregnant.  The twins were born on Mt. Wundagore of  [[Transia]], the prison of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]].  Chthon's residual energies altered Wanda, giving her the ability to use magic, in addition to her mutant power.  Magda survived giving birth to the twins but days after left the refuge of the [[High Evolutionary]].  She feared that Magneto would locate her and force her to surrender the children to him.  She instead fled, and is believed to have chosen to commit [[suicide]] by exposing herself to the frozen wasteland surrounding the refuge.

[[New Men (Marvel comics)|Bova]], a genetically-engineered humanoid cow who served as their [[nursemaid]], decided to find foster parents for the apparent orphans. Nearby, [[World War II]] superheroine [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] was giving birth to her own twins.  Her husband the [[Whizzer]] asked for Bova to assist the birth.  Mother and children died due to [[radiation poisoning]] deliberately caused by her former enemy [[Isbisa]].  Bova only reported the death of the mother, but presented the living set of twins to Whizzer as his own.  He was however shocked by the death of his wife and chose to flee as far away from Wundagore Mountain as possible.

Bova returned the children to Wundagore.  She later found a suitable pair of foster parents in the [[Roma (people)|Roma]] couple Django and Marya Maximoff.  Their own children Ana and Mateo had recently died and the couple saw little Wanda and Pietro as suitable replacements.  They would raise them as their own.  Both siblings manifested powers due to mutation in early [[adolescence]].  The Roma were however victims of [[prejudice]] by the mainstream population of Transia who considered them [[immoral]].

====Orphaned====
Django was a [[doll]]-maker but had increasing difficulty in finding customers as Transians did not allow their children to approach the Roma.  He eventually resorted to stealing food in order to save his family from starvation.  Pietro took the initiative to also start stealing food.  Wanda was also introduced to prejudice when a Transian boy her age attempted to sexually molest her.  She used her powers to return to safety but was accused of attempting to seduce the boy.  Eventually, angry Transian villagers attacked the Roma and burned their wagons.  Marya Maximoff was trapped in their wagon and burned alive.  Django was clubbed to unconsciousness, but Pietro and Wanda managed to flee.  The twins were now on their own.

Wanda and Pietro considered at this point that they were the only family left to each other.  Pietro was in fact especially protective of his sister.  However, they were mistaken in their belief.  They had lost three different mothers: Magda, Miss America and Marya Maximoff.  But their natural father, Magneto, and their adoptive fathers, Whizzer and Django Maximoff, were alive.  Eventually, all three would try to contact their children again.

====The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants====
In their early adulthood, both Wanda and Pietro were among the first members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], though neither Magneto nor his children were aware at the time that he was their father.  Not true villains, they were saved from an angry mob by Magneto and felt they owed him.

[[Image:ScarletXmen7.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mastermind putting the moves on a dismissive Wanda while she's still in the Brotherhood in Uncanny X-Men #7.  Art by [[Jack Kirby]], inks by [[Chick Stone]].]]

Wanda's tenure in the Brotherhood would not be a pleasant time.  Her fellow teammates Mastermind and Toad would repeatedly make sexual advances towards Wanda, but she felt she owed an unpleasant debt of loyalty to Magneto for saving their lives.  While Magneto would often protect Wanda from Mastermind and Toad's advances, Magneto would also often resort to using his magnetic powers to inflict physical pain at the slightest sign of Wanda attempting to leave the Brotherhood. 

Wanda aided the Brotherhood on many missions, always failing, and often found herself in the humiliating position of being used as a barter chip by Magneto to recruit new members, most notably Namor the Sub-Mariner (Namor would ultimately quit the Brotherhood after a single mission when he saw Wanda being abused by Magneto for "disloyalty").  Ultimately an encounter with the X-Men and the enigmatic Stranger would result in Wanda and Pietro decisively breaking with the Brotherhood at last.

===The Avengers===
After Magneto's abduction by the alien [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] effectively broke up the Brotherhood, the twins relocated back to Europe but quickly returned to America with the intention of becoming Avengers and redeeming themselves for their actions while part of the Brotherhood.  They were accepted by [[Captain America]] and became part of the team alongside [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], who would become Wanda's closest friend inside the team.

[[Image:Vsw3.png|The Vision and the Scarlet Witch, as a couple.  Cover to ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (vol. 2) #3.  Art by Richard Howell.|thumb]]

The Scarlet Witch has become one of the team's mainstays since then and one of the most popular Avengers in the title's run.  When Roy Thomas took over the book in the late 1960s, Wanda's courtship with the synthoid [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] would become one of the book's main plotlines and become one of the most beloved romance stories of the book's franchise.  The relationship was filled with turmoil though, from Vision's feelings that Wanda deserved a lover who was human and not an android to both Quicksilver and Hawkeye's objections to the relationship (Quicksilver's due to his disdain for his sister loving a robot while Hawkeye's objections came due to his own feelings of love for Wanda).  While Hawkeye quickly got over his jealousy and gave Wanda and Vision his blessing, Quicksilver disowned his sister for her love and only relented when the telepath [[Moondragon]] telepathically erased Quicksilver's disdain for Vision from his mind, after Moondragon walked into a room and caught Quicksilver's bigotry in full display during an argument between Quicksilver and Hawkeye.

At one point during her career as an Avenger, the Scarlet Witch underwent training in sorcery under the tutelage of a true witch, [[Agatha Harkness]].  The mental discipline of sorcery aided Wanda's powers of concentration, enabling her to exercise much greater control over her mutant "hexes" than ever before.  She also learned that she had been blessed with an affinity for chaos magic. 

Wanda would ultimately marry [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] - unbeknownst to either party, the pairing had been arranged by [[Immortus]] in hopes of preventing the Scarlet Witch from ever having children, as he knew that any offspring she bore would be monumentally powerful. For a time, Wanda believed herself the daughter of the golden age super-hero, the [[Whizzer]], before learning the truth about her paternity.  The revelation that Magneto was her biological father has been a source of much anger for Wanda, as she still harbors anger and fear towards him from their time together in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Ultimately while attempting to avenge the apparent death of Agatha Harkness, Wanda received an infusion of magic power that allowed her to became pregnant with twins, Thomas and William.  She and the Vision retired from their careers as super-heroes to raise their children, but came out of retirement to join the Avengers West Coast team after several members quit the group.

===The West Coast Avengers===

At this time, Wanda's happiness would be tragically destroyed: Vision was kidnapped, vivisected, and his mind erased by a multi-national coalition of countries who were angry at the way Vision attempted to take over the world several years earlier, while under outside influences.  Vision was rebuilt, but his memory was blank, his body a ghostly white, and his human personality and emotions utterly erased.

Wanda sought the one man who could restore her husband's mind, even partially, his "brother" [[Wonder Man]].  While "dead", a copy of Wonder Man's memories were used to create Vision's mind.  And while the two considered themselves "brothers" at times, Wonder Man was forever jealous of Vision's relationship with Wanda and felt that Wanda should be his wife, since Vision's mind was a copy of his own.  Wonder Man was supported by Wasp in this notion, as the childless Wasp had grave doubts about Wanda's desire for children.  She counseled Wonder Man not to allow his brainwave patterns to be used to use to restore Vision, advice he took.  Meanwhile, Wanda's children began to blink in and out of existence, frightening the various nannies Wanda hired to help her watch her twins, leading quickly to the reappearance of Agatha Harkness.  Agatha had survived being burned alive but was in hiding, coming out to reveal the true nature of Wanda's children. 

Agatha revealed that the energies used by Wanda to conjure her children into existence were fragmented portions of soul of the demon [[Mephisto_(comics)|Mephisto]].  Mephisto, through his minion Master Pandemonium, kidnapped Wanda's children and reabsorbed them into his being.  With Thomas and William having effectively ceased to exist (inasmuch as they had ever truly existed in the first place) Agatha made a controversial move that would bear bitter fruit years later when she erased all of Wanda's memories of the twins in order to give her peace and allow the Avengers to escape from Mephisto's realm. 

At this time, a guilt-ridden Wonder Man attempted to give his brainwave patterns to Vision but was rejected by the synthezoid.  Enough time had passed since his reconstruction to allow a cold, emotionless, logic-driven personality to emerge and this personality had no emotional connection whatsoever with Wanda, even after Wanda was kidnapped as part of the Atlantis Attacks crossover. 

After rescuing her, Vision showed little concern for his mentally fragile wife upon revealing that he was leaving the Avengers West Coast team to join the group's East Coast branch.  Vision coldly rejected Wanda's pleas to stay with her by stating that the East Coast team, which had lost several major members at the time, needed Vision more than his wife.  This led to Wanda having a complete nervous breakdown, leading her to join up with Magneto in reforming the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants alongside Quicksilver. 

The family reunion would be short-lived though, as Quicksilver quickly revealed that he joined his father to rescue his emotionally damaged sister from Magneto's clutches.  As the Avengers West Coast branch launched a rescue mission, Wanda fell into a trance and was kidnapped by [[Immortus]].  He revealed that he manipulated Wanda's entire relationship with Vision, so he could destroy Vision and make Wanda emotionally vulnerable enough to become estranged from her friends, so that he might easily use her as a vessel for a large amount of "Nexus" energy. Her probability powers make her a conduit for multiple parallel timelines. She was ultimately rescued and returned to the Avengers West Coast with help from Agatha Harkness, free once again from the clutches of either Magneto or Immortus. 

Wanda remained on the Avengers West Coast, her friendship with Hawkeye helping her deal with the destruction of her marriage and the loss of her children (Wanda's memories of the twins were shown to be restored in ''[[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]] Annual'' #7).  Adventures as a hero and a team player augmented her leadership skills. She also worked with her powers, which began to fluctuate due to a spike in the chaos magic energies of the Marvel Universe.

Wanda would eventually recover and become the leader of the West Coast Avengers, just as her estranged husband Vision arranged for the group's dissolution.  Wanda went on to become a founding member and field leader of the short-lived superhero team [[Force Works]].  Her relationship with Wonder Man remained on very tense terms but came to an abrupt end when [[Wonder Man]] died during Force Works' first adventure. 

When Force Works disbanded, Wanda and Hawkeye rejoined the main Avengers.  Both Wanda and Vision (now having regained his emotions and memories of their marriage) attempted to reconcile, but the two were forced to "sacrifice" their lives to stop the evil that was Onslaught.  They were exiled instead alongside their fellow Avengers and Fantastic Four members into an alternate reality for a year before returning to Earth.   

When she did return, Wanda was promptly kidnapped again by the sorceress Morgan LeFey and to escape her clutches, Wanda accidentally resurrected Wonder Man, now in an energy-based ghost form. However, during the final battle, Wanda was helpless to watch as Vision was mortally wounded yet again as LeFey destroyed the lower half of his body.  Vision was still functional but put into a surgical repair device designed to fix his body.  Communicating with his wife via hologram, the two had a tense confrontation where a distraught Vision begged Wanda to not visit him while he was in his damaged state.  Vision would later state that he didn't want to put Wanda through any additional trauma caused by his injuries, but his actions would spell the end of their marriage.

Around this time, Wanda visited Agatha Harkness and learned that her mutant powers were evolving to the point that she was able to channel Chaos Magic, a feat that was generally considered dangerous by most magicians.  According to Agatha, Wanda could do just about anything with this magic, including raising the dead.  After much deliberation and still hurt from Vision rejecting her, she gave Wonder Man her love and restored him to life. 

The two became lovers, flaunting their passionate affair in front of a restored to health Vision, who fled the Avengers briefly after a confrontation in which Wonder Man selfishly declared himself "the victim" in the three-way love triangle.  Wanda began to impatiantly wait for Simon to take their relationship to the next level.  Unfortunately, while held prisoner by Kang, Wanda was dumped by Wonder Man, whose dreams of the future did not include marriage and children.

When writer Geoff Johns took over the Avengers book in 2002, he had Vision and Scarlet Witch reconcile off-panel and attempt once again to rebuild their relationship.  Meanwhile, Wanda's use of Chaos Magic began to heavily affect her when she became consumed with chaos energy as a side effect of the mysterious Scorpio splitting the cosmic being the Inbetweener into the two aspects of his order- and chaos-related powers.  Wanda being consumed by Chaos Magic was further explored in the much-anticipated ''Avengers/JLA'' crossover, which had Wanda tap into the highly dangerous (and powerful) chaos magic of the DC Universe and barely being able to control the magic.

Scarlet Witch was also reluctantly drawn into a battle between Captain America and an evil, government-sponsored doppelganger.  During their team-up, Captain America found himself attracted to Wanda, but didn't act upon his feelings.

===Avengers Disassembled===
By this point, things were about to take a tragic and highly controversial turn for the Scarlet Witch.
  
When the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] entered into a ''very'' brief romantic tryst with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the pair were discovered in the act by the Wasp's ex-husband, [[Hank Pym]]. Conflicted by what had occurred, the Wasp broke off the relationship with Hawkeye, and tried drowning her sorrows in margaritas instead. Unfortunately, while discussing the details of the whole affair with Wanda, a slightly tipsy Wasp also wound up mentioning Wanda's previously-forgotten children. This unfortunate slip triggered a deep anger in Wanda that threatened to consume her and led her to confront [[Agatha Harkness]] about why Agatha had erased the memories of her children. She could not understand how the Avengers had let them be taken by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] without a fight. What happened next was never shown, but Wanda apparently murdered her teacher and, urged on either by the spirits of her two children or her own delusions, she launched a clandestine shock-and-awe attack of escalating worst-case-scenario disasters against the Avengers with all the magical and mutant power at her disposal. This violent sequence left Wasp wounded and several of Wanda's closest friends (Vision, Ant Man II and Hawkeye) dead. 

Events were further complicated by a controversial confrontation with the astral form of Dr. Strange, who denounced Wanda as being "born insane" due to her unprecedented reality-altering powers. He also declared that there was no such thing as "chaos magic" (despite several storylines showing that such magic existed and that Strange himself had used it), and chided the Avengers for believing Wanda's own version of events in her life without consulting him for verification. He used his strongest spells to immobilize an hysterically ranting Scarlet Witch. When Magneto arrived, her former friends and allies stood passively by, virtually handing her over to her estranged father, who had been alerted to Wanda's actions by Professor Xavier. Magneto wondered if Wanda had been responsible for his own recent strings of deaths and rebirths. In fact, the newly unclassifiable scope of her powers rendered several recent events in the Marvel Universe uncertain.

===House of M===
{{main|House of M}}
In Genosha, Magneto asked his longtime friend and nemesis [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] to help Wanda. Unfortunately, Xavier refused to do so as Wanda attempted to restore her husband to life and undo the damage she had caused. Keeping Wanda in a comatose state, Xavier ultimately called a meeting between the Avengers and X-Men to decide whether or not Wanda should be killed. Quicksilver was horrified at the fact that Xavier seriously considered killing Wanda and convinced Wanda to take desperate action to keep this from happening: By using her powers, Wanda warped reality into the [[House of M]], a world where mutants were the majority, humans the minority and Magneto the ruler (simultaneously giving various other heroes what they wanted most, hoping this would prevent them rebelling). In this reality, Wanda was believed to be a human, due to an alternate body she created to represent her in public while she cared for her children in private.

A young mutant named [[Layla Miller]] (whom Dr. Strange believed was actually an aspect of Wanda's psyche, but later revealed to be a deformed mutant who was given a normal body thanks to Wanda's reality warp) was able to use her mutant abilities to restore several of the heroes' memories. Meanwhile [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and a resurrected [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Cloak (comics)|Cloak]] gathered these heroes into an assault force to try to restore reality. This rag-tag army headed to Genosha to attack Magneto, believing him to be the one responsible for the change. During the battle between Magneto's forces and the others, Layla was able to restore Magneto's memories; as well, Wanda confessed to Dr. Strange that it was Quicksilver, not Magneto, who had initiated the reality warp. 

Enraged, Magneto confronted Quicksilver, angry that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name. Quicksilver told Magneto that he would have let Wanda die, but Magneto replied that Quicksilver had only used him and Wanda; Magneto then killed Quicksilver.

===="No more mutants."====
[[Image:Zsig.jpg|thumb|300px|The three words said by Scarlet Witch that caused [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].]]
Wanda revived her brother, telling Magneto that Quicksilver had only wanted him to be happy and that Magneto had ruined them, choosing the mutants over his own children. She further denounced Xavier and in three words ("No more mutants") Wanda changed the world back to its original form minus the mass depowering of 90% of the entire mutant population, thus being responsible for many deaths as shown in the ''[[Generation M (comics)|Generation M]]'' mini-series. Surviving mutants and ex-mutants now refer to this as "M-Day: The worst day in mutant history."

After the fallout, Wanda was missing and was last seen in a small, unknown European village, happy and in a state of peace after being consumed by anger at past slights inflicted upon her.


===Post-House of M===

{{Spoiler}}

The resurrected Hawkeye tracks Wanda to a small city near Wundagore Mountain, where he unknowingly saves her from a thief.  Wanda has been living in a small apartment with her only relative, her "Aunt Agatha" (who is never seen). She appears to be powerless and believes that she has lived her entire life in the city, and does not recognize Hawkeye, nor does she remember being a part of the Avengers or other events. As Hawkeye prepares to leave the next morning, the room subtly changes around him, presumably by Wanda, who remains sleeping.

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, the Scarlet Witch had the ability to manipulate [[probability]] via her "hexes" (often manifesting physically as "hex spheres" or "hex bolts").  These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight.  Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration.  Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent.  These hexes would only manifest "[[bad luck]]" effects.  She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects.  Despite this enhanced precision, her hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if she has been straining herself or using her powers excessively.  If overextended, her hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes.

[[Image:ScarletAvengers149.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Scarlet Witch in action, employing magic to augment her mutant hex, art by [[George Perez]] and [[Sam Grainger]].]]

Her hexes have a wide, almost limitless variety of recorded and possible effects, though they often boil down to a kind of ''[[Deus Ex Machina]]'' superpower.  They have been known to alter the molecular composition and physical state of physical objects, negate or distort physical laws, and to cause various forms of energy to spontaneously appear or disappear.  She has an affinity with natural elements and phenomena, stemming largely from her magical training under [[Agatha Harkness]], and has trained often at using her hexes to deflect projectiles or to cause enemies to stumble or otherwise suffer the effects of "bad luck".  Writers often confuse her hex powers with [[psychokinesis]], and have occasionally depicted them as able to generate energy blasts and to grant Wanda the power of flight.  Although her hexes can cause objects to suddenly move or change course, they do not have the ability to "hold on" to objects as a telekinetic might.  Ultimately, the hexes are not under the Witch's direct control, although she can influence the nature of their effects with great concentration and effort.  This makes her one of the few Avengers that [[Ultron]] fears; his [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] shell cannot repel magic.  She has displayed the ability to cancel [[Longshot]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]'s powers of probability and has also once turned Longshot into a cat.

The first major reclassification of Wanda's fairly-indistinct hex powers came during Kurt Busiek's run on ''Avengers'', where her mutant power was claimed by Agatha Harkness to be an ability to manipulate chaos magic, given to her by the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]] (imprisoned within Wundagore Mountain) when she was born.  Her hexes were, by extension, simple, indirect manifestations of this magic, destabilising probabilities by inducing chaos.  Across Busiek's run, Wanda's powers grew continuously, as she gained the ability to manipulate organic matter and summon [[Wonder Man]] back to life.  While in the [[DC Universe]], she displayed the ability to access that universe's chaos magic, but had great difficulty in doing so at first, since it was more powerful there and she had no previous experience in wielding it.

The second and most controversial redefinition of Wanda's powers came under the writing of Brian Michael Bendis, whose final Avengers story [[Avengers Disassembled]] declared all previous explanations about Wanda's powers to be lies or mistakes and recast her as an insane reality warping mutant whose powers work on an unconscious level.  While it was implied by [[Immortus]] that Wanda possessed the potential for such, when he turned Wanda into a "Nexus Battery", Immortus specifically claimed that Wanda could only manipulate the past to influence the present.  Her powers were used by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fey]] to alter reality in ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1-3, although this was only accomplished through a much more complicated spell that involved a slew of artifacts that actually brought about the warping of reality with Wanda simply used as a power source.

Under Bendis's definition, the Scarlet Witch's powers are not fully under her conscious control, and their effects persist even after Dr. Strange shut down her mind.  There seem to be no limits to her powers during House of M, as she was easily able to alter the entire [[Earth-616]] reality at will, and is also altering reality on a multiversal scale without even realizing what she had done, though certain of her victims have claimed to be able to discern the difference between reality and her spells.

Wanda's ability to channel and wield magical energy was brought about by the demonic sorcerer [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]].  On the day that Wanda was born, the ghostly spectre of Chthon visited the newborn Wanda and "blessed" Wanda so that Wanda could channel the dangerous Chaos Magic that was the basis for Chthon's unholy might.  Chthon's intentions were to create a vessel that he could possess one day, when Wanda was a full-grown adult, though his schemes to do so were foiled by the Avengers.

As such, due to Chthon's "blessing", Wanda is also vulnerable to having all of her powers disabled if Chthon is ever disrupted.  During the period in which pages from Chthon's sacred tome, the [[Darkhold]], were scattered across the globe, Wanda's powers were periodically disabled -- with her being left powerless in several dangerous battles against various super-villains -- until several of the missing pages were restored to the book. Although this particular plot thread was stated by Agatha Harkness who was reanimated by Wanda. How much of it is true and how much of it is more unconscious manifestations of the Scarlet Witch's reality manipulation is up to the reader's preference  

Wanda has also been trained in hand-to-hand combat by both Captain America and Hawkeye, and has, when sane, the experience and leadership skills that come from years of active duty as an Avenger.

====Magical progeny====
In the [[Young Avengers]] series, the characters Thomas Shepherd ([[Speed (comics)|Speed]]) and Billy Kaplan ([[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]])  look almost exactly alike.  Wiccan has abilities similar to the Scarlet Witch, while Tommy has Quicksilver's superspeed.  Their names, Thomas and William, are the same names of the Scarlet Witch's twins.  The Super Skrull, upon meeting the two, assumed they were her children.  Although it is not public knowledge that the Scarlet Witch had any children, the Super Skrull claimed, through Skrull Intelligence, that he knew they existed.

The new Vision used the previous Vision's memory files to explain that the Scarlet Witch created her children from two lost souls.  When Mephisto claimed those souls as his own, the power that the Scarlet Witch had placed in the souls caused Mephisto to be destroyed when he absorbed them, setting the souls free.  Wiccan theorized that when the souls were set free they formed into the people that became Speed and himself.  This remains Billy's theory, however [[Allan Heinberg]]'s plans for the new 'season' involved the two searching for Wanda and the true source of their powers [http://www.prismcomics.org/display.php?id=1233].

Wanda Lensherr Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, is the daughter of Magneto and the sister of Quicksilver. She has the ability to alter probability fields with her hex-spheres. 

Wanda was a passive member of Magneto's team and after her father's apparent death began working with the Brotherhood, participating in the rescue of the X-Men from Weapon X.  She helped lead the Brotherhood for a while, all the while keeping in touch with Charles Xavier to promote a more peaceful mutant-human integration. 

When Magneto returned, she and her brother fled, although he caught them.  Magneto injured Quicksilver, but left Wanda unhurt.  Eventually, both Wanda and her brother joined the Ultimates. 

Unlike the original mainstream versions of these characters, they have not abandoned their ties to Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants; they still believe in mutant supremacy.  Because of their mutant status, they remain a part of the black ops section of the Ultimates.  She and her brother are often depicted touching each other very intimately and performing activities that couples usually do (e.g., a gondola ride where Pietro reads romantic poetry to Wanda); that scene and the fact that they often call each other "darling" has led to fan speculation that the two share an [[Incest|incestuous]] relationship.

In Issue #6 of Ultimates Volume 2, Millar alludes to her relationship with Vision; Hank Pym attempts to redeem himself by bringing two androids, named Ultron and Vision II, to the Ultimates.  Wanda takes notice of Vision to which Quicksilver asks  "Were you just flirting with that machine?"

====Powers and abilities====
It has been indicated in ''The Ultimates 2'' series that the Ultimate Scarlet Witch actually has to "do the math" in order to use her powers--i.e., that she has to calculate the mathematical probability that the effect she intends to create will actually happen; the more unlikely the effect, the more complex the mathematic formula, and the more difficult and time-consuming it will be to make the effect happen.

===Heroes Reborn Scarlet Witch===
Scarlet Witch was one of the Avengers in the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, in which she was raised by Agatha Harkness. The Asgardian sorceress [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] falsely claimed to be her mother.

===1602 Scarlet Witch===
In ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', the Scarlet Witch character was Sister Wanda, a [[nun]] working for [[Inquisition|Inquisitor]] Enrique (Magneto). The full extent of her powers was unrevealed but she was able to sense and banish the astral form of [[Stephen Strange]]. 

After they were revealed as Witchbreed, the Inquisitor left her and her brother Petros in the care of Carlos Javier (Professor X), on condition he never revealed that Enrique was their father.

===MC2 Scarlet Witch===
An older version of the Scarlet Witch first appeared in the [[MC2]] universe, during the short-lived [[A-Next]] series.  The original team of Avengers disbanded following a disastrous battle with their evil counterparts in an alternate universe. For several years afterward, Scarlet Witch remained in suspended animation beneath Avengers Mansion powering a gate to this world. Eventually, she was freed by the next generation of Avengers, although she remained in a coma for some time afterward. 

When the mad god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], the evil half-brother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], chose to avenge his earlier defeats, he took Wanda out of her coma to act as one of his "puppets".  Wanda was eventually released from said spell, and later chose to return into action as part of [[A-Next]].  No mentioning of Quicksilver has been made so far in the MC2 universe, and Wanda currently appears sporadically in the [[Spider-Girl]] series. The [[Crimson Curse]] modelled her appearance on the older heroine.

===The Silver Sorceress===
In 1971, DC comics introduced a group of superheros called the [[Champions of Angor]] who resembled the Avengers at the same time Marvel introduced [[Squadron Supreme]] which resembled the characters in the Justice League.  The characters were reintroduced with a slightly different backgrounds in the Justice League International in 1987.  The [[Silver Sorceress]] is the DC Comics pastiche of the Scarlet Witch.  She possessed magical powers and served in the JLI and then the JLE until she died defeating Dreamslayer in 1991.

Committed to an institution by her father Magneto when she was just a child due to his inability to take care of her, Wanda harbored a homicidal hatred for him; he claims it necessary because of her uncontrollable, dangerous powers.  Freed from the institution by Mystique, she joined the Brotherhood in return.  Wanda was more interested in revenge against her father than in fighting for the Brotherhood's cause.  During the days after, she trained with Agatha Harkness and gained control of her powers, which she demonstrated to great effect against the X-Men, handing them their first real loss to the Brotherhood.  It was in this episode that she was referred to as the Scarlet Witch for the only time in the series. 

Wanda then teamed up with the X-Men for the Day of Reckoning, nearly killing Magneto in revenge with a falling [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]].  She failed, and nearly fell to her death, but was saved by Nightcrawler.  Following this, she and Toad (who'd developed a crush on her) confirmed Magneto's survival.  

After the Brotherhood (sans the traitorous Quicksilver) returned home, Wanda left them to search for Magneto, even going to [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] of the Morlocks for help.  She failed to locate him until returning to her teammates, when she found her brother in charge.  Wanda managed to find her father, but Magneto used his latest recruit Mastermind to rewrite her memories, removing her hatred of him and causing her to forget having been committed.  Toad and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] rescued her from Magneto's base, and she returned to the Brotherhood.

When Magneto was "killed" by Apocalypse, Wanda took the news quite hard and blamed the X-Men for not helping her father.  After learning that he was in fact alive, having become one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen, she joined Shadowcat's team in Mexico to confront her father and destroy one of Apocalypse's [[Pyramid]]s, and was soon joined by the rest of the Brotherhood.  After the battle's end, she returned to the Brotherhood once more. 

In the future as seen by Charles Xavier while he was under Apocalypse's control, Wanda, along with [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], Toad, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], Quicksilver and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]], has joined S.H.I.E.L.D. as a member of Freedom Force.

In ''X-Men Evolution'', Wanda's powers allow her to "Hex" anyone in her path.  The "Hex" causes everything to turn against the victim and in Wanda's favor. She has also shown an ability to paralyze another mutant's powers or cause them to go haywire.

She was voiced by [[Kelly Sheridan]].
