'''Doctor Manhattan''' is a fictional character who appears in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].  He debuted in the [[graphic novel]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Watchmen]]'', published in 1986 and 1987. Doctor Manhattan was created by writer [[Alan Moore]] with artist [[Dave Gibbons]].

He was originally '''Dr. Jonathan Osterman''', a [[nuclear physicist]] who in 1959 was transformed into probably the Most Supreme Being of DC Comics, after initially being disintegrated in an Intrinsic Field Subtractor and later reconstructing himself. Following his reanimation, he was immediately pressed into service by the [[United States government]], who gave him the name Doctor Manhattan, after the [[Manhattan Project]]. He is the only character in the story that possesses actual [[superpower (ability)|superpowers]].

The ''Watchmen'' series has been noted for addressing [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] issues and questions, Doctor Manhattan being the primary recipient. He is often used as an example of a [[Posthuman#Posthuman god|posthuman god]]. Reception towards the character is positive, and he has appeared and has been mentioned in various forms of media. [[Billy Crudup]] portrays Doctor Manhattan in the 2009 [[Watchmen (film)|film adaptation]] directed by [[Zack Snyder]]. Doctor Manhattan later appears in the ''[[Before Watchmen]]'' comic book prequel, with his own individual issue miniseries.

In 2016, Doctor Manhattan became the first ''Watchmen'' character to be included in the main DC continuity, during the [[DC Rebirth]] event, serving as an antagonist.

==Publication history==
[[File:Dr Manhattan symbol.svg|left|thumb|Dr. Manhattan's chosen symbol]]
Doctor Manhattan was partly based on [[DC Comics]]' [[Captain Atom]] who in Moore's original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat. However, the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a "a supreme super-hero" than he ever could have with Captain Atom. Moore sought to delve into [[nuclear physics]] and [[quantum physics]] in constructing the character of Dr. Manhattan. The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective, which would influence the character's perception of human affairs. Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like [[Spock]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain "human habits" and to grow away from them and humanity in general. Gibbons had created the blue character [[Rogue Trooper]], and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it resembles skin tonally, but has a different hue. Moore incorporated the color into the story, and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic's color scheme made Manhattan unique.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watchmen Secrets Revealed - WatchmenComicMovie.com|url = http://www.watchmencomicmovie.com/110308-watchmen-movie-dave-gibbons.php|website = www.watchmencomicmovie.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}</ref> Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude, which partially influenced how they portrayed the character.<ref name="TCJ116">"A Portal to Another Dimension".

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
Jonathan Osterman was born in 1929. His father was a watchmaker, and Jon planned to follow in his footsteps. When the US drops the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Hiroshima]], Jon is sixteen. His father, confronted with the undeniable facts of the [[theory of relativity]], declares his profession outdated and throws his son's watch-making parts out the windows, urging him to instead pursue a career studying [[nuclear physics]]. The incident represents the turning point in Jon's potential future from watchmaker to nuclear physicist and foreshadows Doctor Manhattan's 'exterior' perception of time as predetermined and all things within it as so determined, including Doctor Manhattan's own reactions and emotions.

Jon Osterman attends [[Princeton University]] from 1948–58 and graduates with a [[Ph.D.]] in atomic physics. In early 1959, he moves to a research base at Gila Flats, where experiments are being performed concerning the 'intrinsic fields' of physical objects which, if tampered with, result in their disintegration. Here he meets Janey Slater, a fellow researcher; they eventually become lovers.

During a trip to [[New Jersey]] in July 1959, Jon and Janey visit an [[amusement park]]. Janey's watchband breaks, and the watch is damaged when a fat man steps on it. Jon decides that he can repair the watch, and tells Janey so. That night they sleep together.

One month later, in August, 1959, shortly after his thirtieth birthday, Jon plans to give Janey the repaired watch, only to discover he has left it in his lab coat which is inside the intrinsic field experiment test chamber. While Jon is inside the test chamber retrieving his coat the door closes, automatically locking as a safety feature. Unable to open the door or override the countdown, Osterman's colleagues—save for Janey, who cannot bear to see the last moment and flees the room—can only watch, horrified, as the [[countdown]] for the current experiment shortly reaches zero, and Jon has his 'intrinsic field' removed. Bathed in the radiant light, he is torn to pieces from the force of the generator, instantly vaporized and officially declared dead.

The following months see a series of strange events and apparitions at the research base, leading residents to speculate the area is now [[Haunted house|haunted]]. It becomes plain that Jon has been progressively reforming himself during this time. This progression is indicated by a series of partial bodily reappearances: first as a disembodied nervous system, including the brain and eyes; then as a circulatory system (November 10); then a partially muscled skeleton (November 14). Each time, the appearance only lasts for a few seconds. Jon fully reappears on November 22 as a tall, hairless, naked, blue-skinned man.

===Before ''Watchmen''===
Jon gradually becomes a pawn of the [[United States government]], though the means by which his loyalty is secured are never revealed; he is given the code name 'Doctor Manhattan', a reference to the [[Manhattan Project]] that, it is hoped, will discourage America's enemies. He is also provided with a costume which he grudgingly accepts, though he refuses to accept the icon design which is provided for him (this being a stylized orbital model of the atom). Instead, Jon chooses as his emblem a representation of a hydrogen atom, whose simplicity he declares to be something that kindles his respect; accordingly, he painlessly burns the mark into his forehead. This preference for material mechanisms marks the beginning of Jon's declining humanity, which is progressively mirrored by his gradual shedding of the uniform; by the end of the 1970s, he refuses to wear anything at all except for mandatory public appearances.

However, Jon's presence still succeeds in tipping the balance of the [[Cold War]] in the West's favor, and the United States consequently becomes more aggressive and adventurist during this period. His abilities also radically alter the world economy, as he can, for example, synthesize the massive amounts of lithium required for all motor vehicles to become electric. At President [[Richard Nixon]]'s request, he brings America victory in the [[Vietnam war]] within three months. This victory distorts the American political process, as the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] is repealed and Nixon is then repeatedly re-elected (and is still serving as of 1985, the year in which ''Watchmen'' is set, having begun his fifth term). Moreover, indications in the story line suggest that, far from solving the problems underlying the international tension, Doctor Manhattan's presence in fact exacerbates them while stifling their expression, which inevitably builds towards disaster; the entire plot of ''Watchmen'' occurs during the countdown to a potential [[nuclear holocaust]].

Since he works for the U.S. government, he is exempt from the provisions of the [[Keene Act]], but spends much of his time doing advanced technology research and development, and physics research. He is single-handedly responsible for the shift to electric-powered vehicles (by synthesizing the needed elements and chemicals himself) and [[Adrian Veidt]] credits him with causing a huge leap forward in myriad areas of science and technology. As a result, the technology of the [[alternate history|alternative 1985]] of the ''Watchmen'' universe is far more advanced. After the death of his father in 1969, he does not conceal his birth name and is referenced as "Jon" or "Dr. Osterman".

During the first meeting of the Crimebusters superhero group, [[Laurie Juspeczyk]], the second Silk Spectre, catches his eye. His relationship with Janey Slater ends acrimoniously shortly after, and he begins dating Laurie.

===Events of ''Watchmen''===
At the start of Watchmen, Doctor Manhattan is working in the Rockefeller Military Research Center for the U.S. government. He is living with the former Silk Spectre II, Laurie Juspeczyk.

It was there that Rorschach came to warn him and Laurie that the Comedian was dead, and all former costumed adventurers should watch out. Jon dismissed Rorschach by teleporting him out, and allowed Laurie to go out with Dan.

Jon attended the Comedian's funeral and reflected on their association in the Vietnam War. He sensed [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]]'s presence.

He appeared in Benny Anger's show where he would be interviewed. Agent Forbes briefed him on the politics of the Cold War that he might be asked upon. However it was not what Manhattan was there for. After Doug Roth's allegations that Manhattan causes cancer to humans, a fray erupted and the journalists came towards him asking for details concerning his relationship to Janey Slater. Forbes attempted to guide Manhattan outside and hold off the journalists. Eventually Manhattan teleported everyone away.

He leaves [[Earth]] for [[Mars]] when he is accused of causing cancer in his close associates over the years. However, this was a frame arranged by Veidt to induce Osterman to leave, to remove his interference in his scheme to save the world. Eventually, he brings Laurie to Mars to discuss why he should do anything to aid humanity, an argument Laurie inadvertently wins when she goes through her life and realizes to her shock that her father is the Comedian, a man whom she despised for sexually assaulting her mother. From that revelation, Doctor Manhattan is amazed by the improbable chances that occurred to result in the birth of Laurie, which he sees as a stunning "thermodynamic miracle". By extension, this miracle can apply to any living thing on Earth, and so Doctor Manhattan decides to return to Earth to protect humanity rather than disregarding it as insignificant.

Although they return too late to stop Veidt's plan, they teleport to [[Antarctica]] to confront him. Veidt hinders Doctor Manhattan with a tachyon generator that interferes with Doctor Manhattan's ability to see the future, and then disintegrates him by subtracting his intrinsic field. To Veidt's surprise, Doctor Manhattan restores himself much more quickly this time (due to the fact that reassembling himself was the first trick he figured out) and many times larger than his usual size, but when Veidt reveals that his scheme, in which he used the reactors he built to kill a large number of people in a few large cities, appears to have averted the looming nuclear war by frightening the world's governments into cooperation, Doctor Manhattan realizes that to expose the scheme would be too dangerous for all life on Earth. Doctor Manhattan and the other superheroes except for Rorschach agree to keep quiet to preserve Veidt's results. Rorschach leaves on his own. Outside the compound, Jon confronts Rorschach, telling him that he cannot let him reveal the truth. In tears, Rorschach removes his mask, screaming for Jon to "do it". After a moment's hesitation he obliges, vaporizing Rorschach. Returning to Karnak, he sees Dan and Laurie together, apparently happy that they have begun a relationship.

At the end of ''Watchmen'', Doctor Manhattan decides to depart Earth again, but he might return one day. Veidt is surprised by his decision, pointing out the apparent contradiction with Doctor Manhattan's renewed interest in human life, to which Doctor Manhattan suggests that he may "create some" life in another galaxy. When Veidt asks if his plan worked out in the end, Jon Osterman smiles and enigmatically replies "In the end? Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends."

=== Events of [[DC Rebirth]] ===
After the events of Flashpoint, when [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], a superhero known in this new world as "the Flash", attempted to revert his universe back to normal, Jon, who was able to somehow oversee these other-worldly events, interfered with this process by erasing ten years from that would-be, reverted universe, creating the [[New 52|Prime Earth]] as a side-effect. By doing this, Jon caused all the residents of Barry's world to be de-aged ten years, and lose some of their most important relationships with one another, leaving [[Wally West]] stuck within the Speed Force, only to end up being saved by the Flash himself, initiating [[DC Rebirth|DC Universe Rebirth]].<ref>''DC Universe Rebirth'' Issue #1</ref>

==Characterization==

===Appearance===
Doctor Manhattan's body is humanoid and its composition is similar to that of a normal human, with a build similar to a tall muscular male with basically the Perfect Physical Physique. His height and relative size vary depending on his needs, but generally remains above 6 feet. He is completely blue (altering his shade and luminosity at will) and has no hair. On his forehead he has etched an image of a hydrogen atom. He did this when he was prepared by the military for unveiling to the general public. They presented him with a hat as a part of his uniform that had a group of crossing ellipses on it, intended to look like an atom (Jon did not see the resemblance). He told them that if he were to have a symbol it should at least be one that he respects.

As Doctor Manhattan his costume started out as a sort of black leotard, which presumably he created. As time progressed the costume shrank progressively to a pair of shorts, then a speedo, then a thong, them completely naked. He would eventually go on to wear nothing at all because he could not comprehend the need for clothing. His original costume was only created because it made those around him (including the general public) more comfortable.

Before the experiment Jon Osterman is human, of average height. He has brown hair and brown eyes. He is a professional physicist and is seen often wearing a suit, which was then the norm for such a profession.

===Personality===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dr manhatten on mars.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Doctor Manhattan on [[Mars]].]] -->
Dr. Manhattan, though supremely powerful, suffers from a decreasing ability to relate to normal humans. Perhaps due to his perception of time and realisation of the deterministic universe, he begins to show symptoms of apathy. From his radically altered perspective, almost all human concerns appear pointless and without obvious merit.

He describes Laurie as his 'only remaining link to humanity'.This is demonstrated when the relationship ends, and Doctor Manhattan leaves Earth. This is also due to evidence coming to light that a number of those who were once close to him, including his former girlfriend Janey Slater, have come down with terminal cancer. Manhattan feels that he poses a threat to others, and he exiles himself to Mars, stating "I am tired of Earth, these people. I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives." His interest in humanity is revived after he witnesses Laurie's epiphany that she is the daughter of the Comedian, reflecting on the sheer chance involved in life coming to being in any form, but after the Watchmen fail to prevent Ozymandis's destruction of New York, he departs Earth, reflecting that he may explore new life in other parts of the galaxy.

In ''DC Rebirth'' #1, Pandora accuses her killer- later identified as Doctor Manhattan- of believing in skepticism, doubt and corruption, proclaiming that he cannot understand the hope personified in the heroes of the DC Universe, and that they will "prove [him] wrong".

===Powers and abilities===
Jon is the only character in ''Watchmen'' to possess superpowers. Throughout Watchmen, he is shown to be absolutely powerful and invulnerable to all harm; even when his body is disintegrated, he can reconstruct it in a matter of seconds at a sub-atomic level and remains unharmed.  He is capable of altering his size depending on his needs, for example, he reconstructed himself, albeit in a much bigger form. He is capable of hurling huge objects effortlessly with his hands alone. He is also unable to exhaust himself in any way imaginable and unimaginable. Jon has complete awareness of and control over atomic and subatomic particles. He is also an omnikinetic. He does not need air, water, food or sleep and is immortal. He can teleport himself and others over limitless distances. He is also capable of true flight, although he merely levitates around in most of his appearances. Due to his perception of time, he sees his past, present and future simultaneously. Jon can see events so tiny and so fast, that they can be said to have never occurred at all.

Although Veidt is obviously the second-most dangerous person, as Jon himself observes, "...the world's smartest man poses no more of a threat to me than does its smartest termite." In addition to these powers, Jon is able to phase any part of his body through solid objects without damaging them, produce multiple copies of himself which function independently of each other, project destructive energy, disintegrate people, create force fields, transmute, create and destroy matter, move objects without physically touching them (telekinesis), reverse entropy, repair anything no matter how severe the damage is, and, he suggests, create life and has walked on the surface of the sun. He is even capable of bypassing one's durability regardless of the type of durability used. At one point it is stated that, in the event of a nuclear war, he would be capable of destroying Soviet nuclear missiles while at the same time 'destroying' large areas of Russia. As a result of these capabilities, Jon becomes central to the United States' Cold War strategy of deterrence.

He even managed to effortlessly overpower and disintegrate [[Pandora (DC Comics)|Pandora]], who managed to overpower the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] with ease, with each Sin being capable of effortlessly destroying a multiverse the size of DC Comics.<ref>''DC Universe Rebirth'' Issue #1</ref>

He is also capable of manipulating reality as he sees fit, as seen when he erased ten years from the DC Universe, when [[The Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] tried to bring his [[New Earth (DC Comics)|original universe]] back to normal. The intervention of Jon caused the [[New 52]] timeline to be formed, within which most superheroes are younger, less experienced and most of them lose their most important relationships before they even begin.
====Scientific accuracy====
Characteristics such as his withdrawal from humanity due to his [[superintelligence]] have been praised and even his powers have been noted for almost always remaining within the laws of physics{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}, a characteristic that most other superheroes do not have, however, this does not deny the fact that Jon can also break the laws of physics, as seen in [[DC Rebirth]], where he removes ten years from the DC Universe and causes the most important relationships of some superheroes to be lost.

[[File:Advanced Test Reactor.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Real life: [[Cherenkov radiation]] glowing in the [[Advanced Test Reactor]].]]

In the 2009 film adaptation ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', physics professor [[James Kakalios]] of the [[University of Minnesota]] was used as a scientific consultant, and shed light on the potential scientific explanations of Doctor Manhattan's powers both in the [[Watchmen (film)|film]] and the [[Watchmen|comic]].

Kakalios explained that the intrinsic field has basis in reality in that it is a representation of a collection of the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], and [[Strong force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s. Kakalios explained that if a being were able to manipulate matter, such a being would have complete control over these three forces; hence, the 'intrinsic field' would exist. Kakalios also explained while it is unlikely, Doctor Manhattan's teleportation abilities could seemingly be achieved through [[quantum tunnelling]], should Doctor Manhattan have control over his probability wave functions.

===Philosophical implications===
The character of Doctor Manhattan is one that invokes thought on metaphysical philosophy. There are various themes addressed throughout the ''Watchmen'' series from [[philosophy of time]] and [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]], to [[determinism]] and its relationship to [[ethics]], to addressing questions such as "What does it mean to be human?" and "Do the ends justify the means?".

The character is primarily cited as the representation of the potential side effects and dangers of a [[superintelligence]], which include detachment from the rest of humanity and potentially characteristics of [[apathy]].<ref name="io9.com">{{Cite web|title = Is human super-intelligence a bad idea?|url = http://io9.com/is-human-super-intelligence-a-bad-idea-733655691|website = io9|accessdate = 2015-11-11|language = en-US}}</ref>

*In 2009, a film adaptation titled ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' was released, starring [[Billy Crudup]] as Jon Osterman/Doctor Manhattan and directed by [[Zack Snyder]]. The movie received a polarized reaction from both audiences and critics. Some critics gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews for the dark and unique style on the superhero genre, the cast and the visual effects; while others derided it for the same reasons, as well as the R-rating (for "strong graphic violence, sexuality, nudity, and language"), the running time, and the much-publicized fidelity to the graphic novel. In the film, Doctor Manhattan is a CGI character modeled after [[Greg Plitt]] with voice, motion capture, and facial performance provided by [[Billy Crudup]]. At the end of the film, Doctor Manhattan received blame for the destruction of Earth's major cities through Adrian Veidt's machination with exploding energy reactors he helped Doctor Manhattan create under the pretense of providing free energy for the world, allowing the [[United States]] and the [[U.S.S.R.]] to ally against Manhattan, their "common enemy", in the film, unlike his comic book counterpart, he establishes that he is not omnipresent.

*In ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' #4, a white-skinned lookalike of Doctor Manhattan was one of the alternate versions of Monarch summoned to the multiverse arena. Like all the others, this version was killed and his power added to Monarch's.
*In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #2, the exiled Monitor [[Monitors (comics)|Nix Uotan]] sketches a character resembling Doctor Manhattan.  [[Grant Morrison]] stated in an [http://comics.ign.com/articles/876/876418p4.html interview] that the ''Final Crisis'' two-part series ''Superman: Beyond'' will feature "''[[Captain Atom]] from [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth 4]], which is kind of a weird amalgam of the original [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]] universe and this kind of [[Watchmen]] parallel world.''"  This character is named 'Captain Adam', and appears in ''Superman Beyond'' #1.  He is blue-skinned and has the hydrogen atom mark of Doctor Manhattan, and is addicted to drugs which keep his "quantum senses" in check. When he is off the drugs, he becomes very similar to Doctor Manhattan in demeanor and powers, duplicating himself hundreds of times over to repair the Bleed Starship and allow the various Supermen to pilot the Thought-Robot Armor, which itself is confirmed to grant one powers capable of beating Captain Adam. However, even when he is using his full potential without the aid of drugs, Captain Adam has difficulty controlling his powers, something Doctor Manhattan never had a problem with.
*In ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' #1594 [[Nikolai Dante]] meets an American resistance movement whose look is strongly based on the Watchmen characters; one strongly resembles Doctor Manhattan.
*[[Seth (Street Fighter)|Seth]], a humanoid creature from ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', heavily resembles Dr. Manhattan in both appearance and personality.
