[[Dr Manhattan]] is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] who is a central character in the classic [[comic]] book series, [[Watchmen]] by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] and published by [[DC Comics]]. He is a modified version of the character [[Captain Atom]] created by [[Steve Ditko]] for [[Charlton Comics]].

'''Dr Manhattan''' was born Jon Osterman in 1929.  His father is a watchmaker, and Jon plans to follow in his footsteps.  When the US drops the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Jon is sixteen.  His father, confronted with the undeniable reality of quantum physics, declares his profession outdated and throws Jon's watch-making parts out the windows.  Not only is this the turning point in Jon's career choice, from watchmaker to nuclear physicist, it foreshadows Dr. Manhattan's 'quantum' perception of time.

Osterman attends Princeton University from 1948-58 and graduates with a PhD in Atomic Physics. In 1959, he moves to the research base at Gila Flats.  Here he meets Janey Slater, and they eventually become lovers.  During this period it is established that Jon is somewhat weak-willed.  His father largely determined his path in life, and Janey is clearly the dominant parter in their relationship.  

During a trip to New Jersey in July 1959, Jon and Janey visit the Amusement park.  Janey's watchband breaks, and the watch is damaged when a fat man steps on it.  The previous panel includes a crying little boy in the foreground.  Jon decides to repair the watch.

In August, 1959, Jon goes to give Janey the repaired watch, only to discover he has left it in his jacket inside the Intrinsic Field experiment test chamber.  Going to recover it, he is accidentally locked inside and has his "intrinsic field" removed, resulting in his apparent death.  He is vaporised, only to reappear over the following months; first as a brain, then a circulatory system (November 10) then a partially muscled skeleton (November 14). Eventually, Jon reappears on the 22nd November as a tall, bald, blue man.

He is the only hero in the Watchmen world to explicitly possess supernatural abilities.  He has complete control over matter, including his own body's size, coloration and density.  Part of Watchmen's background information states he would be capable of destroying upwards of 60% of all Soviet nuclear missles while at the same time decimating large areas of Russia.  

Jon becomes a pawn of the United States government.  They give him the code name Dr. Manhattan in order to scare America's enemies.  He is also provided with a fairly ridiculous costume, which he slowly abandons as his detachment from humanity grows.  His presence unbalances the [[cold war]], and the United States becomes more aggressive and adventurist during this period.  At president Nixon's request, he brings America victory in the Vietnam war in three months.

His presence radically alters the North American economy, providing the massive amounts of lithium required for cars to become electric.  

During the first meeting of the Crimebusters superhero group, he catches the eye of Laurie Juspeczyk, the Silk Spectre II.  His relationship with Janey Slater ends acrimoniously shortly after, and he begins dating Laurie.  

After his transformation, Jon begins to experience time in a non-linear, "quantum" fashion.  His already weak will becomes sublimated further during this time.  It is implied that he does not so much perceive the past or future as directly experience them.  He increasingly has difficulty acting in what those around him consider the present moment.  This leads to many accusations and even the public perception that he is emotionless.  However, during the course of Watchmen he displays powerful emotion several times.  His apparent lack of sentiment is more a matter of radically altered priorities.

His knowledge of the future does not allow him to change events.  He believes he has no choices for the large part of Watchmen.  His total determinism of action and the implied amorality of such a position is strongly contrasted with his apparent ability to do anything.  In some sense, unlimited power has come at the cost of the total absence of responsibility.  During the period where he fights crime, because the government told him to, he states the morality of the action escapes him.  From his radically altered perspective, almost all human concerns appear pointless to him.  This growing sense of disconnection is marked by his use of clothing which over the years eventually shrinks until he is naked by the [[1980s]].

Dr. Manhattan serves the role of foil to Adrian Veidt, code name Ozymandias.  Dr. Manhattan is the technological superman: deterministic, incredibly powerful, extremely remote from daily concerns and apparently possessing no sentiment.  Veidt is the more traditional ubermensch, having achieved his success from discipline, reason and will power.  

At the start of the Watchmen series, Dr Manhattan is working in Rockefeller Military Research Center for the Government. He is living with the [[Silk Spectre]], Laurel Juspeczyk.  

However, Dr. Manhattan leaves Earth for Mars when he is accused of causing [[cancer]] in close associates over the years.  However, this was a [[frame up]] arranged by Veidt to induce Jon to leave to remove his interference in his scheme to save the world.  Eventually, he brings Laurel to Mars to discuss why he should do anything to aid humanity, an arguement Laurel inadvertantly wins when she goes through her life and realizes to her shock that her father is [[The Comedian]], a man whom she despised for [[Sexual_assault|sexually assault]]ing her mother.  From that revelation, Dr. Manhattan is amazed by the improbable variables that occurred to result in the birth of Laurel, which he sees as a stunning thermodynamic miracle.  By extension, this miracle can apply to any living thing on Earth, and so Dr. Manhattan decides to return to Earth protect this wonder called life.

While they returne too late to stop Veidt's masterstroke of his plan, they teleport to [[Antarctica]] to confront him. Veidt hinders Dr. Manhattan with a [[tachyon]] generator that interferes with Dr. Manhattan's ability to see the future and then disintegrates him by neutralizing his intrinsic field. Dr. Manhattan restores himself much more quickly this time, but when Veidt reveals that his scheme appears to have averted a looming [[nuclear war]] Dr. Manhattan realizes that to expose the scheme would be too dangerous for all life on Earth. Dr. Manhattan and the other superheroes except for Rorscharch agree to keep quiet to preserve Veidt's results, and Dr. Manhattan is forced to kill the dissenter to silence him.

At the end of the graphic novel Dr. Manhattan decides to depart Earth for good. Veidt is surprised by his decision, pointing out the apparent contradiction with Dr. Manhattan's renewed interest in  organic life. Dr. Manhattan responds, "Yes. perhaps I will make some."
