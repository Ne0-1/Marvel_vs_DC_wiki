'''Darkseid''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics Universe]] created by [[Jack Kirby]] as part of the [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] series of [[comic books]] in the early [[1970s]]. He first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #134 ([[November]] [[1970]]). Darkseid has risen in popularity, and become one of the most powerful and well-known villains of [[DC Comics]].

According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], [[Jack Kirby]] modeled Darkseid on actor [[Jack Palance]] [http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_11_10.html#012391].

==Fictional character history==
Son of [[Yuga Khan]] and [[Heggra]], Darkseid is the ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]], a post he obtained after assassinating his mother. He is obsessed with finding the [[Anti-Life Equation]] in order to use it to rule the universe; this goal also includes conquering his rival planet, [[New Genesis]], ruled by the [[Highfather]]. A destructive war between the two worlds was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of the sons of [[Highfather]] and Darkseid. Darkseid's son [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] is surrendered to the [[Highfather]] while Darkseid receives Scott Free, who later becomes the master escape artist [[Mister Miracle]]. This turns out to be a setback for Darkseid with his biological son growing up to value and defend the ideals of [[New Genesis]] in opposition to his father.

Darkseid was one of the featured villains in the (non-continuity) crossover of the [[Teen Titans]] and [[Marvel Comics]]' [[X-Men]]. Like most crossovers between [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]], there was a [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] villain in addition to the [[DC Comics|DC]] villain - in this case, [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Dark Phoenix]] and (something unusual) another [[DC Comics|DC]] villain also appeared: [[Deathstroke the Terminator]] (since Darkseid was not a well-known villain for the heroes at the time the comic was launched). In the [[DC Comics|DC]]/[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] crossover, Darkseid's counterpart in the [[Marvel Comics Universe|Marvel Universe]] was shown to be [[Thanos]].

===Recent history===
Darkseid's latest attempt to attack [[Earth]] was through the kidnapping of [[Supergirl]]. He had hoped that he was able to use [[Kryptonite|Black Kryptonite]] to brainwash [[Supergirl]], thus providing him with a leader for his [[Female Furies]], as well as a warrior on par with [[Superman]]. However, this plan backfired as [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] were able to save [[Supergirl]]. This set forward a plan of revenge by Darkseid to destroy [[Supergirl]]; this plan also fails as [[Supergirl]] is teleported out at the last minute. [[Superman]] is set into an unparalleled fit of rage as he hurls Darkseid into the [[Sun]] where they attempted to destroy each other. [[Superman]] beats Darkseid unconscious enough to throw him into the [[Source Wall]], where [[Superman]] declares that, "For years and years, you've tried to learn the secrets of ultimate power from the other side. But you will never get the answersâ€”just like the others who are entombed here. This is where you belong. Along with all the other failures in the universe." The mysterious appearance of the [[Maximums]] has been linked to Darkseid.

To pay a debt incurred to an alternate reality Darkseid and in order to realign the timeline, [[Superman]] recently freed Darkseid from his entombment.

==Powers and abilities==
Darkseid is an incredibly powerful being with many [[god]]-like abilities. His main power is the '''Omega Effect''', a form of energy that he fires from his eyes. This effect is not only a relentless attack, but it is capable of teleporting the target to any location Darkseid chooses and recall them later or erase the target from the universe and similarly reform them. Darkseid has pinpoint control over his Omega Beams, and his unerring aim allows it to travel in straight lines or bend, twist, or curve around corners. The Omega Effect can also pass through nearly any known barrier. In the third part of the ''Hunter/Prey'' storyline, he claimed that no being had yet withstood the full force of the Omega Effect, but [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] nonetheless survived the attack. [[Superman]] has also withstood a blast from the Omega Beams, but with severe pain and damage as a result.  In the Justice League Unlimited finale, ''Destroyer'', Batman became the only being, at least in the [[DCAU]], that has ever evaded the Omega Beams.

Darkseid possesses superhuman strength, stamina, and durability that at least rival those possessed by [[Superman]]. He has proven capable of overpowering the mighty demon [[Etrigan]], and [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]] once hurt his hand when he landed a punch on Darkseid. Additionally, Darkseid possesses a regenerative [[healing factor]] as well as immortality, which are common among the more advanced beings of the [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]].

Darkseid is also a master of [[manipulation]], and possesses incredible [[psionic]] abilities. He once mentally dominated nearly three billion [[Daxamite|Daxamites]] simultaneously. Darkseid can transmute matter, as he demonstrated by turning the [[Daxamite]] warrior Ol-Vir into dust, and Slo-bo into a statue. He is also able to dissipate and disperse the molecules of any object or organism, effectively erasing them from existence. Darkseid has the ability to generate mental avatars, and is able to levitate himself and others [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] with ease.

As a god-like being, Darkseid has several powers that surpass most other beings in the known universe. He can seemingly create life and matter from nothing, as he did when he created the being known as Strayne, and can travel through time and between dimensions as easily as any [[New Gods|New God]].

Darkseid also possesses a great intellect. His genius surpasses that of most other known beings in the universe. He is a master planner and strategist, and his armies are nearly unbeatable under his leadership.

==Personality==
[[Image:Darkseidgenesis.PNG|259px|thumb|Cover to ''Genesis'' #3, by [[Alan Davis]]]]Darkseid's personality can vaguely be described as [[evil]] incarnate. He is not merely content to control but seeks to dominate those under him into totally obedient and morally corrupt caricatures of individuals. The planet [[Apokolips]] is a world that resembles [[Hell]] because of Darkseid's need to be worshipped as a [[deity|god]] and the need to nurture the most horrible aspects of the human spirit. On [[Apokolips]], Darkseid's subjects are raised in a [[cult of personality|personality cult]] to venerate him and to sacrifice themselves gladly in his name.

Darkseid practices great emotional restraint, always maintaining a calm and disciplined composure despite the furious rage that often boils within him (his son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], has inherited this rage but cannot control it as well as his father, relying on his [[Mother Box]] to keep his emotions in check). He seems to possess a twisted form of honor, but this code is 'flexible' depending on his mood; it seems he desires to be thought of as an honorable being, but never lets this stand in the way of his gaining power or revenge.

Darkseid especially takes delight in seeing the mighty brought low, whether in strength or moral conviction. His primary weakness may be his obsession to get even with people who have gotten the better of him, especially [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batman]], the [[New Gods]], and now possibly the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. During the latest ''Batman/Superman'' story arc (Issue #25 "With a Vengeance"), the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] attempted to control Darkseid when the Clown Prince of Crime gained powers similar to [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]. It was later revealed that [[Bat-Mite]] was inside the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] the whole time. ([[Bat-Mite]] literally crawled out of his mouth). Darkseid actually attempted to vaporize the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] with his Omega Beam at one point, but seemed to miss on purpose.

==Darkseid's agenda==
[[Image:Newgods1.png|160px|thumb|left|Cover to ''New Gods'' (v2) #1, by Jack Kirby]]Darkseid's greatest ambition is to eliminate all [[freewill]] from the universe and re-shape it into his own image. To this end, he seeks to unravel the mysterious [[Anti-Life Equation]], which will allow him to control completely the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. The [[Anti-Life Equation]] has often been portrayed as a quasi-mystical power that forces a listener to agree with whatever the wielder says, while other times, it is portrayed as a comprehensive scientific theory on how to dominate any living mind, whatever its nature may be.

While he has yet to obtain a complete working copy of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], Darkseid has tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods. He has a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believes [[humans]] possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. If he should conquer [[Earth]], Darkseid will probe the mind of every human to piece together the Equation.

==Destiny==
As with gods in other mythologies, Darkseid is incredibly powerful, but cannot escape his ultimate destiny. It has been foretold that Darkseid will meet his final defeat at the hands of his son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of [[Apokolips]]. Presumably this outcome would occur at the climax of the ''New Gods'' series, but the title's unforeseen cancellation instead brought Darkseid's [[story arc]] to an unceremonious end, and both he and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] were brought into the mainstream [[DC Comics Universe|DC Universe]], while [[Jack Kirby]] moved on to other projects.

While this changeover kept Darkseid alive as a character, some fans feel it is to his detriment. No writers appear willing to write the ultimate resolution to the character, either out of respect for Kirby or because they are not about to kill off one of [[DC Comics|DC]]'s most popular villains. As well, the idea of reversing or annulling the prophecy has been turned down, also out of respect to Kirby. At the present time, Darkseid and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] will not have their final battle in the foreseeable future, and thus both characters, while still active, are in a story arc "limbo."

Outside of the mainstream [[DC Comics]] canon, Darkseid's ultimate fate has been described several times:
* In the [[DC Animated Universe]], Darkseid died off-screen in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Twilight," was reconstituted in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Alive!" and finally disappeared upon discovering the [[Anti-Life Equation]] in the following episode (also the series finale), "Destroyer."
* In the miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'', [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] has now deposed Darkseid, fulfilling the prophecy, and is ruler of [[Apokolips]]. However, the changes that he wished to make (democracy, freedom) quickly failed, making him bitter and cynical. [[Superman]] is disappointed in [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]'s progress and says his new demeanor is more like Darkseid than ever.
* In the ''[[Great Darkness Saga]]'', Darkseid survived into the 30th century. Having been forgotten by almost everyone, he defeated the era's two most powerful villains ([[Mordru]] and the [[Time Trapper]]) and absorbed their powers, subsequently using those abilities to enslave the entire population of the planet [[Daxam]]. Commanding an army of billions (each with the same powers as [[Superman]]), he launched a full-scale assault on the [[United Planets]]. Only the efforts of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and its allies were able to prevent him from conquering the entire known universe (Once a part of mainstream [[DC Comics]] continuity, this story was erased -- along with 36 years of Legion continuity -- as a direct consequence of the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' crossover event in 1994).
* A very distant possible future of the [[DC Comics Universe|DC Universe]] was shown in [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[1998]] line-wide crossover event [[DC One Million]]. Here, in the one-shot ''[[Martian Manhunter]] #1,000,000'', it is shown that by the year 85,271, Darkseid had long since died in a final battle with [[Martian Manhunter]] (which cost the Martian his physical form, causing him to be merged with Mars).
* A much closer alternate future was seen during ''Rock of Ages'', a ''[[JLA]]'' story written by [[Grant Morrison]]. Here, in a story roughly fifteen years from the "present day," Darkseid has found the [[Anti-Life Equation]] and become absolute ruler of [[Earth]]. Darkseid is rendered into a vegetative state at hands of [[Connor Hawke|Green Arrow]] and the [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]], before the whole [[Earth]] is blown up by [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] in order to kill Darkseid for good. This possible future has been averted.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #25, [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] revealed that Darkseid's destiny was yet to be written and that their futures were tied together via the cryptic statement "From the fourth world into the fifth dimension. Kinda like the ring tone of that, Big D."

==Recent characterizations==
[[Image:darkseid_7s.gif|thumb|150px|Darkseid as "Dark Side" in 'Seven Soldiers' [[Mr. Miracle]]]]Although Darkseid had previously been written as a near-unbeatable and omnipotent foe, his recent characterizations have shown him to be somewhat powered down as a result of the more personal enmity his animated version has for [[Superman]]. While he still outstrips his animated counterpart in strength, speed, and stamina, the level to which he has been reduced places him at comparable tier of power to the comic version of [[Superman]]. In one instance, his Omega Effect is deflected by [[Wonder Woman]]'s bracelets, a feat that normally would have been impossible according to previous continuity. This power reduction may be due to events occurred during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' storyline. It is explained that during these events [[Wonder Woman]] gained her revenge against Darkseid for killing half of [[Themyscira]]'s population by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid.

In [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[2005]] ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that Darkseid finally discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he then used to destroy the [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] altogether. The [[New Gods]] fled to [[Earth]], where they hid: [[Highfather]] and his followers are now a group of homeless people, [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] is an epileptic, the [[Black Racer]] is an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad]] is an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] is a pimp for the [[Female Furies]], and Darkseid himself is now an evil businessman who is referred to only as "Dark Side." It is revealed in <i>Seven Soldiers #1</i> that Darkseid actually gave the [[Sheeda]] North America in return for Auracles, [[Earth]]'s first superhero. This is, in turn, purely in order for Darkseid to get [[Shilo Norman]], whom he considers the "Avatar of Freedom," in his clutches so that he can eventually destroy the [[New Gods]]. How much of this change is actual, or how much a re-imagining of the [[New Gods]] as archetypes of the real world is unclear. As it stands though, the series (which is in [[DC Comics Universe|DCU]] continuity) ended with Darkseid in his current form as "Dark Side" claming the beginning of the "Dark Era."

==Other appearances==
Darkseid appeared in [[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]] and [[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]. He would frequently combine the villainous agenda of the episode with the scheme of forcing [[Wonder Woman]] to marry him. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]], with the same throaty growl that Welker had given [[Inspector Gadget]] villain [[Dr. Claw]]. [[Jack Kirby]] said that the network executives tried to go behind his back and call the character "Darkside" for the ''Super Powers'' TV show, but Kirby was adamant about the name staying the same.

[[Image:Animated Darkseid.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Darkseid from ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'']]In addition, he appears in [[Bruce Timm]]'s [[DC Animated Universe]], where he is voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]. Timm explained that Darkseid was brought into the series in an effort to boost [[Superman]]'s [[rogues gallery]] and give him a more powerful villain to contend with. In this animated version, Darkseid possesses speed, strength, and stamina on par with [[Superman]] (in addition to his Omega Beams), although he is frequently shown to be on the losing end of any hand-to-hand battles with the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]].

After making a series of brief "teaser" appearances throughout ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Darkseid was featured prominently in a pair of popular two-part episodes. "Apokolips...Now!" shows Darkseid leading his forces in an invasion of [[Earth]]. Darkseid confronts [[Superman]] and offers him a place at his side, but [[Superman]] rejects the offer, leading Darkseid to declare: "If you will not be my knight, you will be my pawn." Darkseid's plan is foiled by the appearance of armies from [[New Genesis]], the leaders of which declare [[Earth]] to be under [[Highfather]]'s protection. Just as Darkseid leaves, in one of the most shocking moments of the series, he tells [[Superman]] that no victory comes without a price, and before he steps through the portal to [[Apokolips]], uses his [[Omega Beams]] to vaporize [[Dan Turpin]], a hard-boiled police officer who had been [[Superman]]'s friend, whom [[Bruce Timm]] had based on Darkseid's creator [[Jack Kirby]]. In the audio commentary for this episode, Timm explains that Turpin's funeral was intended as a tribute to The King, going so far as to hire a real-life [[rabbi]] to deliver the fictional flatfoot's eulogy.

Later, in "Legacy," the two-part series finale for ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Darkseid makes good on his promise of making [[Superman]] his pawn. He captures the Man of Steel and brainwashes him into thinking that he is Darkseid's adopted son. Darkseid sends [[Superman]] on several conquests throughout the galaxy before sending him to invade [[Earth]]. When [[Superman]] regains his memory, he finds that he has destroyed parts of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], nearly killed [[Supergirl]], and lost the world's trust. Traveling to [[Apokolips]], [[Superman]] seeks revenge on Darkseid and engages him in a brutal fistfight. This is the only time Darkseid engages in a direct fight throughout the show, ending with [[Superman]] managing to turn Darkseid's Omega Beams back on him. [[Superman]] then tosses Darkseid's battered self down to his slaves, telling them that they are now free to do what they want. To his shock and disgust, the slaves pick up Darkseid and carry him away, promising to help him. Darkseid tells [[Superman]] that "I am many things, Kal-El...but here, I am [[God]]."

Darkseid later returned in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Twilight," where he teamed up with [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] to destroy the [[Justice League]]. Now harboring a severe hatred towards Darkseid, [[Superman]] initially attacked Darkseid when he arrived in the Watchtower and refused to aid him against [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], justifying his behavior by claiming that Darkseid was only setting up the League to betray them. Ultimately proven correct, [[Superman]] had to be dragged away from a fight with Darkseid by [[Batman]], who had actually goaded [[Superman]] into helping Darkseid in the first place; following an explosion at [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s headquarters, Darkseid disappeared for a time, and in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', a civil war broke out on [[Apokolips]] between [[Granny Goodness]] and [[Virman Vunderbarr]] during his disappearance.

{{spoilers}}

In the two-part series finale of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', [[Lex Luthor]] tries to resurrect [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] by having the [[Legion of Doom]] transform their base into a spacecraft to find lost pieces of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s last base; but with [[Tala (comics)|Tala's]] help, [[Gorilla Grodd]] attempts a coup to retake control of the Legion, leading to a battle between members loyal to Grodd and Luthor. In the end, Luthor defeats Grodd and disposes of those loyal to Grodd. When the Legion reaches the location, Luthor uses [[Tala (comics)|Tala]]'s magic to restore [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], but instead resurrects Darkseid, who is now infused with the essence of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

Darkseid rewards Luthor for his help by giving him and the Legion a quick death. The remnants of the Legion soon appear alive and well back on [[Earth]], having been saved by a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] created by [[Sinestro]] and [[Star Sapphire]], and go to the [[Justice League]] to warn them of Darkseid.

Darkseid makes his way to [[Earth]], sending his forces around the globe with drilling machines to make it like [[Apokolips]]. Darkseid himself eventually engages [[Superman]] in a lengthy battle across the city. The battle at first leans towards Darkseid's favor until [[Superman]] finally decides to "cut loose" with everything he has after witnessing [[Batman]]'s valiant attempt to fight Darkseid himself. From this point, [[Superman]] dominates the battle until Darkseid manages to use the Agony Matrix, a pain induction weapon, against him.

Darkseid is about to cut out [[Superman]]'s heart with a [[Kryptonite]] knife when [[Lex Luthor]] appears and shows him the recently acquired [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he attained with the aid of the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. Although Luthor seemingly perishes with Darkseid in an explosion of light, [[Batman]] remarks that they will likely see the two again.

==Other appearances==

Darkseid appears as the primary villian in the video game [[Justice League Heroes]]    .

In [[Superman: Red Son]], a statue of Darkseid is visible within Superman's Fortress of Solitude.
