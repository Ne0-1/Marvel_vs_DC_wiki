'''Darkseid''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] created by [[Jack Kirby]], originally as part of [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|The Fourth World]] series of [[comic books]] in the early 1970s. He first appeared in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #134 (November 1970). 

==Character history==
He is the ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]], a post he obtained after assassinating his mother. He is obsessed with finding the Anti-Life Equation in order to use it to rule the universe. This goal also included conquering his rival planet, [[New Genesis]], ruled by the [[Highfather]], formerly Izaya the Inheritor. The resulting destructive war was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of infant sons. Darkseid's [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] was surrendered to the Highfather while Darkseid received Scott Free, who would later become the master escape artist, Mister Miracle. This turned out to be a setback for Darkseid with his biological son growing up to fiercely value and defend the ideals of New Genesis in opposition to his father.

==Powers and abilities==
Darkseid has become a major DC Comics villain who is an enemy to the [[DC Universe]] [[superhero|superheroes]].

In addition to the considerable military forces at his command, he is himself formidable. His main power, the '''Omega Beams''' or '''Omega Effect''', which he fires from his eyes, not only is a powerful attack, but can follow any target, can teleport the target anywhere he chooses or can erase the target from existence instantly and can restore the target if he chooses. The ability is not limited to traveling in straight lines, and can bend or twist as needed. It can traverse time and different universes, and go through some barriers such as Orion's body. Being considered vital to the Source has not proven to be protection against it. No one questioned it when Darkseid's Omega Effect appeared to work on himself in Orion #5, but he is considered vital to the universe enough that a higher power than Spectre resurrected him when Spectre killed him.

Darkseid also possesses strength, speed, and stamina rivalling that of [[Superman]], as they have often fought each other to virtual stand-still. He has overpowered the demon Etrigan, and Lobo hurt his hand by punching Darkseid's face.

Darkseid has the power of transmutation. He turned Ol-Vir, a Daxamite, into dust, soap into dirt, and Slo-bo into a statue. He can teleport. He also has mind control greater than that of Sleez. According to Orion, he can travel through time as easily as any god. He can create life, as he did when he created Stayne.

==Darkseid's personality==
[[Image:Darkseidgenesis.PNG|Cover to ''Genesis'' #3. Art by Alan Davis.|thumb]]
Darkseid is a character whose personality can vaguely be described as evil incarnate.  Darkseid is not merely content to control but to dominate those individuals under him into totally obedient and morally corrupt caricatures of individuals.  Apokolips is a world that resembles [[Hell]] because of his need to be worshipped as a [[god]] and the need to nurture the most horrible aspects of the human spirit.  In a personality cult reminiscent of [[Stalinism]], his subjects are raised to venerate him, to gladly sacrifice themselves in his name.

Darkseid practices great emotional restraint, always maintaing a calm and disciplined composure despite the furious rage that often boils within him (his son, Orion, has inherited this rage but cannot control it as well as his father, relying on his mother box to keep his emotions in check). Darkseid seems to possess a twisted form of honor but this code is 'flexible' depending on his mood.  It seems he desires to be thought of as an honorable being but never lets this stand in the way of his gaining power or revenge.  He especially takes delight in seeing the mighty brought low whether in strength or moral conviction.  Darkseid's primary weakness may be his obsession to get even with people who have gotten the better of him, especially Superman, Wonder Woman, and the New Gods.  He may also begin to develop a grudge against [[Batman]], who robbed him of his most powerful apprentice, [[Supergirl]].

==Darkseid's agenda==

Darkseid's great ambition is to wipe out free will from the universe and reshape it in his own image.  To this end, he seeks to unravel the mysterious 'Anti-Life Equation', which will allow him to completely control the thoughts and emotions of living beings.  The Anti-Life Equation has often been portrayed as a quasi-mystical power that forces a listener to agree with whatever the wielder says.  Other times, it is portrayed as a comprehensive scientific theory on how to dominate any living mind, whatever its nature.

Whilst he has yet to obtain a complete working copy of the Anti-Life Equation, he has tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods.  Darkseid has a special interest in Earth, as he believes humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation.  Were he to conquer Earth, he would probe the mind of every human to piece together the Equation.

[[Orion (comics)|Orion]] possesses significant fragments of the Anti-Life Equation, while Scott Free (Better known as [[Mister Miracle|Mister Miracle]]) is the only being in existence who knows the entire code.

==Destiny==
As with gods in other mythologies, Darkseid is incredibly powerful, but cannot escape his ultimate destiny. It has been fortold that Darkseid will meet his final defeat at the hands of his son Orion, in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery pits of Apokolips. Presumably this outcome would occur at the climax of the ''New Gods'' series, but the title's unforseen cancellation instead brought Darkseid's story arc to an unceremonious end, and both he and Orion were brought into the mainstream DC universe, while Kirby moved on to other projects. 

While this changeover kept Darkseid alive as a character, some fans feel it is to his detriment. No writers appear willing to write the ultimate resolution to the character, either out of respect for Kirby or because they are not about to kill off one of DC's most popular villains. As well, the idea of reversing or annulling the prophesy has been turned down, also out of respect to Kirby. At the present time Darkseid and Orion will not have their final battle in the forseeable future, and thus both characters, while still active, are in a story arc "limbo", unless his presumed death in the Justice League animation series holds in the comic world.

==Recent Characterizations==
[[Image:darkseidsupes.png|thumb|170px|Darkseid's Omega Beams blast [[Superman]].]]
Although Darkseid had previously been written as a nigh-unbeatable and omnipotent foe, his recent characterizations have shown him to be massively powered down as a result of the more personal enmity his animated version has for Superman. While he still far outstrips his animated counterpart in strength, speed and stamina, the level he has been reduced to places him at comparable tier of power to the comic version of Superman. In one instance, his Omega Effect is deflected by Superman's heat vision, and more recently Wonder Woman's bracelets, feats that normally would have been impossible according to previous continuity. Superman himself is no match for Darkseid's Omega Effect, should it ever hit his body at full power. Neither is [[Wonder Woman]], as the Omega Effect, when properly portrayed, would go through her enchantment and hit her directly.

In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2005 [[Mister Miracle]] miniseries, it was revealed that Darkseid finally discovered the Anti-Life Equation, which he then used to destroyed the [[Fourth World]] altogether. The New Gods fled to Earth, where they hid: [[Highfather]] and his followers are now a group of homeless people, [[Metron]] is an epileptic, the Black Racer is an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad]] is an evil pscyhiatrist, [[Granny Goodness]] is a pimp for the Female Furies, and Darkseid himself is now an evil businessman who is referred to only as 'Dark Side'.

==Other appearances==

He has appeared in the later seasons of ''The [[Super Friends]]'' [[animated television series]], perhaps to fulfill the producers' request for a villain similar to [[Star Wars]]' [[Darth Vader]].  He often would combine whatever villanous agenda of the episode with the scheme of forcing [[Wonder Woman]] to marry him. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. 

In addition, he appears in the current DC Animated Universe continuity, produced by [[Bruce Timm]], where he is voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]. First tormenting Superman to join him in Superman: The Animated Series, and then in ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' where he teamed up with [[Brainiac]] to destroy the Justice League. Orion went a couple rounds with him before getting his back broken and Superman got the upper hand over him and destroyed his Boom Tube where Brainiac's Asteroid Base blew up. Until now, it's unknown what happened to Darkseid. But in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', a civil war sprang on Apokolips between [[Granny Goodness]] and [[Vermin Vundebarr]].

In this current animated version of Darkseid possess speed, strength and stamina slightly above Superman's level in addition to his Omega Effect, but he once lost in "hand to hand" combat (but not without using laser vision and omega effect respectively, of course) with Superman, during one of the last episodes of Superman: the Animated Series.
