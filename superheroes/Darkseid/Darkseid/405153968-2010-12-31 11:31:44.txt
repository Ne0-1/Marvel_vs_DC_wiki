Darkseid is one of the most powerful characters in the [[DC Universe]]. Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], he has appeared in four decades of DC Comics publications, featuring prominently in the ''[[New Gods]]'' titles and [[limited series]] as the recurring [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of the New Gods and [[Superman]]. The character has also appeared in associated DC Comics merchandise including [[Animation|animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, [[trading card]]s, and [[video game]]s.

==Fictional character biography==
The son of [[Yuga Khan]] and Queen [[Heggra]], Prince Uxas, second in line to the throne of [[Apokolips]], plotted to seize power over the planet. When his brother, [[Infinity-Man|Drax]], attempted to claim the fabled Omega Force, Uxas murdered him and took the power for himself; transforming him into a rock-like creature, and taking a new name: Darkseid.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''Jack Kirby's Fourth World'' #2-5</ref> At some point, he fell in love with an Apokoliptian scientist named Suli, with whom he had a son, [[Kalibak]]; however, Suli was poisoned by [[Desaad]] on Heggra's behalf, who believed that Suli was corrupting her son. Following Suli's death, Darkseid's heart grew even colder, and he had Desaad poison Heggra, finally becoming the supreme [[monarch]] of Apokolips. Darkseid had briefly been forced by his mother to marry [[Tigra (DC Comics)|Tigra]], with whom he also had a son. After murdering his mother, Darkseid had both Tigra and their son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], banished from Apokolips.<ref>''New Gods'' (vol. 1) #7</ref>

The destructive war with the rival planet, [[New Genesis]], was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of the sons of [[Highfather]] and Darkseid. Darkseid's second born son was surrendered to Highfather, while Darkseid received Scott Free, who later became the master escape artist [[Mister Miracle]]. This eventually turned out to be a setback for Darkseid, with his biological son growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis in opposition to his father; the prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of his son in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Seeing other gods as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of [[Themyscira]] in order to discover the secret location of the [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian Gods]], planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power. Refusing to aid Darkseid in his mad quest, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] battled his [[parademon]] troops, causing half of the Amazon population's death.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #102-104</ref> [[Wonder Woman]] was able to gain her revenge against Darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid. This supposedly weakened the god's power as he lost a portion of his dark edge.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #173, #188</ref>

Darkseid's goal was to eliminate all [[free will]] from the universe and reshape it into his own image. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious [[Anti-Life Equation]], which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion [[Glorious Godfrey]], who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation. Darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many [[superhero]]es of the DC Universe, notably, the [[Kryptonian]] [[Superman]]. Darkseid worked behind-the-scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through [[Intergang]], a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the God of Evil.

===Seven Soldiers and "Boss Dark Side"===
[[Image:Darkseid 7s.png|right|150px|thumb|Darkseid as "Dark Side" in ''[[Seven Soldiers]]''.]]
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2005 ''Mister Miracle'' limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he then used to destroy the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] altogether. The [[New Gods]] fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] used a wheelchair, the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] was an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad]] was an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] was a pimp for the [[Female Furies]], and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as "Boss Dark Side". It is revealed that Darkseid actually gave the [[Sheeda]] [[North America]] in return for [[Aurakles]], Earth's first superhero.<ref>''Seven Soldiers'' #1</ref> This was, in turn, purely in order for Darkseid to get [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], whom he considers the "Avatar of Freedom", in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the New Gods.

===Final Crisis===
{{Main|Final Crisis}}
[[Image:Fc-04 darkseid.jpg|left|200x|thumb|Darkseid as he appeared in ''[[Final Crisis]]''.]]
As prophesied, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] returns to Earth via Boom Tube for his final battle with Darkseid. During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, creating a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having "won" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as "Boss Dark Side". Aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].

Now, once again bound to the form of a human, "Boss Dark Side" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to ''[[Final Crisis]]''. In ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the "spoken form" of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], to kidnap the [[Tornado Twins]]. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by [[Bernadeth]]. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #59, it was revealed that he had employed the [[Terror Titans]] to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.

In ''Final Crisis'', Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and [[antichrist]]-like figure who soon converts much of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to his cause with the aid of the [[Crime Bible]] and the [[Holy Lance]]. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as [[Mary Marvel]].

Using [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]'s abandoned Mobius Chair, Darkseid assassinates his son Orion via a "time travel" bullet fired into the past. He also arranges for detective [[Dan Turpin]] to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's "final host", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest "rebirth", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], the "Embodiment of Freedom" is shot by [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#S|S.H.A.D.E.]] operatives, thus signaling the "Victory of Evil". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his "fall" having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth.

After escaping from captivity, [[Batman]] shoots Darkseid with the same Radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Sanction, "infecting" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into prehistoric times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he is dragging all of time and space in the entire multiverse into a Doomsday singularity with him. While Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid is beyond physical attack, as he now almost entirely controls reality itself. With his body dying of Radion poisoning, his physical form is then killed when [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]] lead the Black Racer to him after he fires the bullet which will go back in time and slay Orion. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the [[Miracle Machine]] Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan falls when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman (Dick Grayson), Red Robin (Tim Drake), Robin (Damian Wayne) and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time-stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with Mister Miracle, to escape the inescapable Omega Sanction.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:TheomegaeffectNG11.jpg|left|thumb|Darkseid vaporizes [[Desaad]] with his Omega Beams in ''[[New Gods]]'' (vol. 1) #11 (November 1972). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Darkseid is among the most powerful New Gods, sometimes depicted with a variety of god-like abilities at his disposal. His main power, the Omega Effect, is a form of energy that he fires from his eyes as either concussive force or beams of disintegration, capable of transmuting or erasing most living objects and organisms from existence as well as to reform or resurrect them. Anything Darkseid disintegrates with the Omega Effect can be brought back at any time by him, and he often uses this as a form of punishment. Darkseid has pinpoint control over his Omega Beams, and his unerring aim allows them to travel in straight lines, bend, twist, or curve around corners, and can pass through matter and energy. The Omega Effect can also be used to teleport Darkseid or others through time and space.<ref>''Martian Manhunter'' #34</ref> Darkseid can also project the Omega Effect as energy blasts from his hands. Another type of Omega Effect is the Omega Sanction, that traps the organism in a series of alternate realities, each worse than the previous one.

In addition, Darkseid possesses superhuman strength, stamina, and durability equivalent to the corresponding traits of Superman<ref name="The Death of the New Gods">''The Death of the New Gods''</ref> and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]].<ref>''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' (vol. 1) #6</ref> He also, despite his great size, possesses great speed, agility, and reflexes as he has been able to startle Superman with his speed<ref>''Superman'' #3</ref> and it has been stated he can react in microseconds.<ref>''Cosmic Odyssey'' #4</ref> He sometimes possesses the ability to increase his size.<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #2</ref> Darkseid possesses the powers of [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], and has also shown the ability to create psionic avatars. He is even able to open [[boom tube]]s under his own power, and can travel through time, space, and even other dimensions with ease. Darkseid is also, being a god, virtually immortal. He has lived for several hundred thousand years at the very least.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual">''Doomsday: Year One Annual''</ref> Like all New Gods, however, he is vulnerable to a substance called Radion.

Darkseid generally does not rely on physical combat, despite his great might and being a highly trained Apokoliptian warrior;<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual"/> he is a master schemer and strategist possessing a superhuman intellect. Darkseid has also shown some form of godly sense, capable of sensing the death of his son Orion<ref name="The Death of the New Gods"/> and the fluctuations of the energy of the "Godwave".<ref>''Genesis'' #4</ref> Darkseid commands all the vast military and technological resources of Apokolips.

According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], Jack Kirby modeled Darkseid physically on actor [[Jack Palance]], while "the style and substance of this master antagonist were based on just about every power-mad tyrant Kirby had ever met or observed, with a special emphasis on [[Richard Nixon|Richard Milhous Nixon]]."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_11_10.html#012391 | title=The Palance-Darkseid Connection | work=News From Me | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>

==Other versions==
*Darkseid appears in the [[intercompany crossover]]s, ''[[The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans]]'' (where he attempts to recreate [[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]] to help him convert Earth into a new Apokolips), ''Darkseid/Galactus: The Hunger'' (where he fights [[Galactus]] when the Devourer of Worlds attempts to consume Apokolips),<ref>''Darkseid/Galactus: The Hunger'' #1</ref> and ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' (where he fights [[Thanos]], his Marvel equivalent, until the fight is interrupted by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], and the [[Silver Surfer]]). He also makes a brief appearance in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', where he briefly holds the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] before discarding it as the [[Infinity Gems]] do not work in his universe.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref>

*In the [[alternate future]] story, "Rock of Ages", Darkseid has found the Anti-Life Equation and rules Earth, although he is killed when [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]] and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] manage to bypass his protective force-field when Atom shrinks down to the size of a speck of light (reasoning that light must penetrate the force-field, otherwise Darkseid could not see) and detonates a bomb inside Darkseid's head.

*In [[Amalgam Comics]], Darkseid and [[Thanos]] are merged together into "[[Thanoseid]]".

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animated series====
Darkseid first appears in the [[animation|animated]] series ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (1985), voiced by [[Frank Welker]].

[[Image:DarkseidsupermanTAS.jpg||right|thumb|Darkseid as depicted in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
Darkseid would also later appear in several animated series set in the [[DC animated universe|DC Animated Universe]], namely ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (1996), ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001), and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2005); voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]. In ''Superman: The Animated Series'', Darkseid is resentful of his second born son Kalibak and only somewhat jokingly acknowledges that Orion is his true son (mainly trying to egg on Orion to be like him). After his first invasion of Earth in the two-part episode "Apokolips...Now!", Darkseid promises that Apokolips will not attack again, as part of a truce with the planet New Genesis. To bypass his promise, Darkseid develops various schemes to destroy Earth indirectly, such as through manipulation of Intergang and even Superman. In the concluding two-part episode "Legacy", Darkseid attempts one final invasion of Earth which involves brainwashing Superman. He is stopped by Superman and pursued to Apokolips where he is defeated. To Superman's disgust, Darkseid's slaves willingly come to his aid.

In the ''Justice League'' episodes, Darkseid allies himself with [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] in an attempt to defeat Superman, but he is killed when Brainiac explodes. [[Lex Luthor]] later unwillingly resurrects Darkseid in an attempt to bring back Brainiac. He invades Earth once more, but is defeated by the combined forces of the Justice League and the Legion of Doom, with Luthor apparently sacrificing himself to destroy Darkseid once and for all.

Darkseid appears in an episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' titled "Darkseid Descending!" voiced by [[Michael-Leon Wooley]].<ref>http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1010/30/index.htm</ref> In the episode, Darkseid leads the forces of Apokolips in an invasion of Earth, only to be challenged by [[Batman]] and his new [[Justice League International|Justice League]]. After soundly defeating the League, Darkseid is goaded into a fist fight with Batman after the hero implies that he is simply a coward who hides behind his god-like abilities. Though Darkseid subsequently wins this fight, he and his army are sent back to Apokolips by the [[Question (comics)|Question]], who had infiltrated Darkseid's cadre of minions and reversed the Boom Tubes that had brought them to Earth.

====''Smallville''====
Darkseid appears as the main antagonist for the tenth and final season of ''[[Smallville]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1107100p1.html | title=SDCC 10: Smallville - Darkseid, Blue Beetle, and More Are Coming!}}</ref> Producers of the series mentioned that the character will not be fully revealed at the beginning and will be a force that is going to be felt throughout the season and eventually materialize as the episodes progress.<ref>http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/07/26/smallville-season-10-spoilers-comic-con/</ref> Both Jor-El and the spirit of Jonathan Kent warned [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] of a dark force that is coming to Earth to corrupt it. It heard of Clark's power and the doubts and fears in his heart and wants to turn him into a weapon. The dark force gathers on a rooftop in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and forms into the shape of a rock-like creature, Darkseid. Later, Clark's cousin Kara tells him that the darkness came to Earth after a rip in the universe was created. Clark concludes that when he opened a portal to another world, it must have allowed the darkness to come to Earth. Darkseid went on to possess the radio jockey [[Glorious Godfrey|Gordon Godfrey]]. Using him as his vessel, Darkseid created a backlash against the superheroes in Metropolis. It left Godfrey's body after a confrontation with Clark and Kara. Later, [[Granny Goodness]], [[Desaad]], and Godfrey discuss their plans for paving the way for the coming of their dark lord. In the episode "Patriot", it is revealed that [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]] is one of the people whom Darkseid is influencing, as he bears the Omega symbol on his skull.

====Other shows====
Darkseid makes a [[cameo appearance]] in [[Imaginationland Episode III|part 3]] of the ''[[South Park]]'' "Imaginationland" trilogy as one of the villains visible.
