'''Darkseid''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] created by [[Jack Kirby]], originally as part of [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|The Fourth World]] series of [[comic books]] in the early [[1970s]].

He is the ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]], a post he obtained after assassinating his mother. He is obssessed with finding the Anti-Life Equation to use to rule the universe. This goal also included conquering his rival planet, New Genesis, ruled by the High Father, formerly Izaya The Inheritor. The resulting destructive war was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of infant sons. Darkseid's [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] was surrendered to The Highfather while Darkseid received Scott Free. This turned out to be a setback for Darkseid with his biological son growing up to fiercely value and defend the ideals of New Genesis in opposition to his father. Meanwhile, Scott Free refused to be corrupted by his abuse on Apokolips and eventually escaped along with his lover, [[Big Barda]] of the [[Female Furies]] to Earth to become the [[escape artist]] and [[superhero]] [[Mister Miracle]].

In addition to the considerable forces at his command, he is himself formidable. His main power, The Omega Effect, which he fires from his eyes, not only is a powerful attack, but can follow any target, can teleport the target anywhere he chooses or can disintegrate the target instantly and can just as quickly reassemble the target if he chooses.

After the premature cancellation of the series, Darkseid has become a major DC Comics villain who is an enemy to the [[DC Universe]] [[superhero]]es.  

He has appeared in the later versions of ''The [[Super Friends]]'' [[animated television series]], perhaps to fulfill the producers' request for a villain similar to [[Star Wars]]' [[Darth Vader]].  In addition, he appears in the current series of DC Comics animated adaptations produced by [[Warner Brothers]] Television.  He is voiced by [[Michael Ironside]].
