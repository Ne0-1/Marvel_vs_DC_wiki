The character was ranked as the 6th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time by [[IGN]] and as the 23rd Greatest Villain of All Time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/6.html|title=Darkseid is number 6|publisher=[[IGN]]|access-date=April 5, 2016}}</ref> Darkseid has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, most notably being voiced by [[Michael Ironside]] within the [[DC animated universe]], [[Andre Braugher]] in ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]'', and [[Tony Todd]] in the [[DC Animated Movie Universe]]. After being referenced multiple times in the [[DC Extended Universe]], he will make his feature film debut in ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'', portrayed by [[Ray Porter]] through voice and [[motion capture]].

==Publication history==
[[Jack Kirby]] returned to DC Comics with ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #133 and immediately began establishing characters that would lay the foundation for his newly conceived [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] epic. The chief antagonist would be the villain Darkseid who had a cameo in ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #134 (November 1970) with a full first appearance in ''[[Forever People]]'' #1 (February 1971) . The character was originally designed to be the chief antagonist of the titles ''Forever People'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' and ''New Gods'', but after the cancellation of these titles, he continued to appear as a major villain in many DC Universe comic books, fighting both Superman and Batman. According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby modelled Darkseid's face on actor [[Jack Palance]], while the villain's personality was inspired by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2006/11/10/the-palance-darkseid-connection/ | title=The Palance-Darkseid Connection | last=Evanier | first= Mark | work=News From Me | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-comic-book-villains-real-life-inspiration/|title=Real Life Inspirations Behind Some of the Best Comic Book Villains|date=Mar 30, 2014|website=ScreenRant|access-date=Oct 12, 2020}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The son of King Yuga Khan and Queen [[Heggra]], Prince Uxas, second in line to the throne of [[Apokolips]], plotted to seize power over the planet.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=76}}</ref> When his brother, [[Infinity-Man|Drax]], attempted to claim the fabled Omega Force, Uxas murdered him, and took the power for himself. The power transformed him into a rock-like creature, upon which he took the name Darkseid.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Apokolips Then|title=Jack Kirby's Fourth World|volume=1|issue=2|date=April 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Mothers & Sons|title=Jack Kirby's Fourth World|volume=1|issue=3|date=May 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Alpha and Omega|title=Jack Kirby's Fourth World|volume=1|issue=4|date=June 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=O, Deadly Darkseid|title=Jack Kirby's Fourth World|volume=1|issue=5|date=July 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> At some point in time, he fell in love with an Apokoliptian scientist and sorceress named Suli, with whom he had a son, [[Kalibak]]; however, Suli was poisoned by [[Desaad]] on Heggra's behalf, as she believed that Suli was corrupting her son.

Following Suli's death, Darkseid's heart grew even colder, and he ordered Desaad to poison Heggra, and as soon as he did, Darkseid finally became the supreme [[monarch]] of Apokolips. Darkseid had briefly been forced by his mother to marry Tigra, with whom he also had a son. After murdering his mother, Darkseid ordered Tigra to eliminate their son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], who was switched with the Highfather's son, [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]], so as to keep peace between New Genesis and Apokolips.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|penciller=Kirby, Jack|inker=[[Mike Royer|Royer, Mike]]|story=The Pact|title=[[New Gods]]|volume=1|issue=7|date=February 1972|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

The destructive war with the rival planet, [[New Genesis]], was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of the sons of [[Highfather]] and Darkseid. Darkseid's second born son was surrendered to Highfather, while Darkseid received Scott Free. This eventually turned out to be a setback for Darkseid, with his biological son growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis as a powerful champion in opposition to his father. The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of his son in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips. Likewise, Darkseid and his training minion, [[Granny Goodness]], were unable to break Scott Free's spirit after years of torturous upbringing and the New God was able to escape Apokolips, taking with him the mightiest of the [[Female Furies]], [[Big Barda]], as his wife and came to Earth to become the master escape artist and superhero foe of Darkseid, [[Mister Miracle]]. Regardless, Darkseid anticipated that Scott would make such a move and used its occurrence as a pretext to declare the treaty with New Genesis abrogated and resume armed conflict.

Seeing other deities as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in order to discover the secret location of the Olympian deities, planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power. Refusing to aid Darkseid in his mad quest, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] battled his [[Parademon]] troops, causing half of the Amazon population's death.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Second Genesis: Part Two |title=Wonder Woman|volume=2|issue=102|date=October 1995|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Second Genesis: Part Three |title=Wonder Woman|volume=2|issue=103|date=November 1995|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=Byrne, John|story=Second Genesis: Part Four |title=Wonder Woman|volume=2|issue=104|date=December 1995|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> [[Wonder Woman]] was able to gain her revenge against Darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid.

Darkseid's goal was to eliminate all [[free will]] from the universe and reshape it into his own image. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious [[Anti-Life Equation]], which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion [[Glorious Godfrey]], who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation.

Darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many [[superhero]]es of the DC Universe, most notably the Kryptonian [[Superman]]. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through [[Intergang]], a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of evil.

===The Great Darkness Saga===
{{Main|The Great Darkness Saga}}
One thousand years in the future, Darkseid has been absent for centuries and is almost completely forgotten. He returns and comes into conflict with that era's champions, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and [[Daxam]]—which places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants Kryptonian-like superpowers equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe. However, he is eventually defeated by the Legion and many of its allies.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]]|penciller=[[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|inker=Mahlstedt, Larry|story=Great Darkness Saga, Chapter One: And the Servant Shall be a Sign...|title=Legion of Super-Heroes|volume=2|issue=290|date=August 1982|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]]|penciller=[[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|inker=Mahlstedt, Larry|story=Great Darkness Saga, Chapter Two: ...

However, the tale has been restored to continuity in recent years. In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 6, #4 (October 2010), explicit reference is made to the events of "The Great Darkness Saga", mentioning (among other things) Darkseid's victory over [[Mordru]] on the planet Avalon. Similarly in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 7, #3 (January 2012), a Daxamite official remarked that the people of his world "still mourn how Darkseid used us for violence".</ref>

===The Seven Soldiers and "Boss Dark Side"===
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2005 ''Mister Miracle'' limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he then used to destroy the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] altogether. The [[New Gods]] fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] used a wheelchair, the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] was an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad|DeSaad]] was an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] was a pimp (or "madam") for the [[Female Furies]] and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as "Boss Dark Side". It is revealed that Darkseid actually gave the [[Sheeda]] [[North America]] in return for [[Aurakles]], Earth's first superhero.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|penciller=[[J. H. Williams III|Williams III, J. H.]]|inker=Williams III, J. H.|story=The Miser's Coat|title=[[Seven Soldiers]]|volume=1|issue=1|date=December 2006|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> This was, in turn, purely in order for Darkseid to get [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], whom he considers the "Avatar of Freedom", in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the New Gods.

===Final Crisis===
{{Main|Final Crisis}}
As prophesied, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] returns to Earth via [[boom tube]] for his final battle with Darkseid. During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, which created a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having "won" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as "Boss Dark Side", aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].

Once again bound to the form of a human, "Boss Dark Side" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to ''[[Final Crisis]]''. In ''[[Flash (DC Comics character)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the "spoken form" of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], to kidnap the [[Tornado Twins]]. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by [[Bernadeth]]. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #59, it was revealed that he had employed the [[Terror Titans]] to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.

In ''Final Crisis'', Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and [[antichrist]]-like figure who soon converts much of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to his cause with the aid of the [[Crime Bible]] and the [[Holy Lance]]. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as [[Mary Marvel]].

Darkseid also arranges for detective [[Dan Turpin]] to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's "final host", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest "rebirth", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], the "Embodiment of Freedom" is shot by [[S.H.A.D.E.]] operatives, thus signalling the "Victory of Evil". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his "fall" having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth.

After escaping from captivity, [[Batman]] shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Beam, sending back in time and then "infecting" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into [[prehistoric]] times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death).

Before Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]] lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and making contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid's control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid's minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid's spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the [[Miracle Machine]] Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan fails when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman ([[Dick Grayson]]), Red Robin ([[Tim Drake]]), Robin ([[Damian Wayne]]), and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time-stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with [[Mister Miracle]], to escape the Omega Sanction.

[[Doctor Impossible]] later manipulates the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] itself. The resurrection backfires, and instead creates a new being known as the Omega Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Mark Bagley|Begley, Mark]]|inker=Hunter, Rob|coinkers=[[Norm Rapmund|Rapmund, Norm]]|story=Omega, Part 1: Worlds Collide|title=[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]|volume=2|issue=50|date=December 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

[[File:Justice League New 52 23.1 Darkseid.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Justice League'' vol 2 #23.1 (November 2013). Art by [[Ivan Reis]], and Joe Prado.]]
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Darkseid's name is first invoked by a Parademon in ''Justice League'' #1.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]|inker=[[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]]|story=Justice League: Part One|title=[[Justice League]]|volume=2|issue=1|date=November 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> He is later mentioned again in ''Justice League'' #2,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]|inker=[[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]]|story=Justice League: Part Two|title=[[Justice League]]|volume=2|issue=2|date=December 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> and in ''Justice League'' #3 Darkseid makes his first appearance in the series, seen in a vision by [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] after he is injured by an exploding Mother Box.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]|inker=[[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]]|story=Justice League: Part Three|title=[[Justice League]]|volume=2|issue=3|date=January 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> In the final pages of ''Justice League'' #4, Darkseid himself appears.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]|inker=[[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]]|story=Justice League: Part Four|title=[[Justice League]]|volume=2|issue=4|date=February 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> In ''Justice League'' #5, the League confronts him but they are overpowered by him, when he severely hurts Superman with his Omega Beams and breaks Green Lantern's arm.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]|inker=[[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]]|coinkers=Hope, Sandra, Irwin, Mark, Weems, Joe|story=Justice League: Part Five|title=[[Justice League]]|volume=2|issue=5|date=March 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> Finally, in ''Justice League'' #6, Darkseid is driven out when Cyborg activates the invaders' Mother Boxes and Superman forces him through a [[boom tube]].

In the New 52 continuity, there is only one set of New Gods across the 52 Multiverse. So as Darkseid invades Prime Earth in ''Justice League'', he sends his lieutenant [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] to do the same, with greater success, on [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]], resulting in the deaths of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and stranding Helena Wayne and Kara Zor-L on Prime Earth. Five years later, Darkseid once again invades Earth 2, which never fully recovered from his armies' earlier assault, and it is revealed that he and [[Highfather (comics)|Highfather]] of New Genesis struck a deal allowing him the unchallenged right to invade Earth 2.

In ''Darkseid'' #1, his background story was revealed. Formerly a farmer named Uxas, he hated the deities of his world. So he traveled up to their mountain while they slept and tricked them all into fighting each other. As they were all weakened from the war, he killed them one by one with his scythe (similar to [[Cronus|Kronos]] of [[Greek mythology]]) and stole their power, before destroying his world and creating Apokolips.

In ''Justice League: The Darkseid War'' (after the retirement of the "New 52" imprint), Darkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor. Darkseid's daughter Grail leads the [[Anti-Monitor]], who is revealed to be a scientist named Mobius, to Darkseid for the former to kill the latter. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] with Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Later, Lex Luthor would be merged with the Omega Sanction, becoming the new ruler of Apokolips.

After killing the Anti-Monitor using an Anti-Life Equation-powered [[Steve Trevor]], Grail would later resurrect Darkseid through the [[Alexander Luthor Jr.|newborn child]] of [[Superwoman]]. The child has the same powers as his father Mazahs, with the ability to steal the powers of others. Stealing the new "God" abilities of the Justice League, Grail fuses them with the child and brings Darkseid back to life. However, he is under her complete control. Grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing Darkseid with the Anti-Life Equation. However, it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently.

===DC Rebirth===
Darkseid (as a baby) appears in ''DC Universe: Rebirth'' #1 where Grail tells him of Wonder Woman's long lost brother, Jason.

Baby Darkseid reappears in ''Dark Nights: Metal'' where it is shown that Batman stole him from Grail and intends to use the Omega Beams to send himself back in time. This never comes to fruition and Darkseid is either returned to or retrieved by Grail.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Greg Capullo|Capullo, Greg]]|inker=Glapion, Jonathan|story=Metal|title=[[Dark Nights: Metal]]|volume=1|issue=2|date=November 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

Sometime afterwards, Darkseid matured into a toddler, and using telepathy, demanded that he needed to feast on Old Gods to return to his former self. After killing A.R.G.U.S. agents that were hunting them down, Darkseid and Grail began hunting down and taking the life force of Zeus' demi-god children, killing several including Perseus and Hercules, and growing into the size of a child. After recruiting Jason and luring Wonder Woman to him, Darkseid ages once again into a young man. He fights Wonder Woman himself and as he starts to drain her life force, he is betrayed by Jason. When Zeus appears and transforms into his true form, Darkseid fights the Olympian God, destroying their surroundings in their brawl. When they take a Boom Tube to [[Manila]], Philippines, Zeus grabs onto Darkseid and unleashes bolts of lightning on him. However, Darkseid reveals that he planned for this and that his true target was Zeus himself, and he begins to drain and kill him, restoring Darkseid back to his original self. When the rest of the Justice League arrive, Darkseid decides it is best not to fight them as he does not want to risk revealing his greater plans, and promptly leaves through a Boom Tube with Grail.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker=Parsons, Sean|coinkers=Paz, Jason, Hanna, Scott|story=Children of the Gods, Part 1|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=31|date=November 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Davila, Sergio|inker=Hanna, Scott|coinkers=Morales, Mark|story=Children of the Gods, Part 2|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=32|date=December 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Lupacchino, Emanuela|inker=McCarthy, Ray|story=Times Past: Grail|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=33|date=December 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Davila, Sergio|inker=Hanna, Scott|coinkers=Gray, Mick, Ferreira, Eber|story=Children of the Gods, Part 3|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=34|date=January 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Luppacchino, Emanuela|inker=McCarthy, Ray|story=Times Past: Jason|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=35|date=January 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker=Paz, Jason|coinkers=Parsons, Sean|story=Children of the Gods, Part 4|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=36|date=February 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref name="Wonder Woman Vol 5 37">{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|copencillers=Segovia, Stephen|inker=Paz, Jason|coinkers=[[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]], Fernández, Raúl|story=Children of the Gods, Conclusion|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=37|date=February 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:TheomegaeffectNG11.jpg|right|thumb|Darkseid disintegrates [[Desaad]] with his Omega Beams in ''[[New Gods]]'' (vol. 1) #11 (November 1972). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Darkseid is among the most powerful beings of the DC Universe from the race known as New Gods. His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that he fires from his eyes or hands as either a concussive force or a disintegrating energy which is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Some super-beings, such as [[Superman]] and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], have proven to be resistant to the beams, although in the case of Superman, with a great deal of pain. Also, Orion and [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] were able to deflect them, Firestorm once used his powers to redirect them and in a crossover story, [[Galactus]] was unaffected by them. These beams stem from a cosmic energy source called the "Omega Effect". The Omega Beams can also resurrect fallen beings previously killed by them. He will sometimes use this as punishment upon those who fail him but are too valuable to kill outright. Darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy, and his unerring aim allows the beam to travel in straight lines, bend, or curve around corners and even pass through matter or other forms of energy. He can also teleport himself or others through time and space.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Ostrander|Ostrander, John]]|penciller=[[Eduardo Barreto|Barreto, Eduardo]]|inker=Kryssing, Ray|story=In My Life (Part Two)|title=Martian Manhunter|volume=2|issue=34|date=September 2001|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> His Omega Sanction traps organisms in a series of alternate realities, each one worse than the previous. During the Final Crisis, Darkseid used his Omega Beams to grant power to Mary Marvel, and her powers afterwards were based on Anti-Life rather than magic.

Darkseid's strength is depicted as immensely high, effortlessly breaking a [[Green Lantern|Green Lantern Ring]] with his bare hands. He has easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and the entire Justice League. He can also move with great speed, as he has been able to catch Superman off guard,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=Byrne, John|inker=[[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]]|story=Legends From the Darkside|title=Superman|volume=2|issue=3|date=March 1987|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> and he is known to be able to react in nanoseconds.<ref name="Genesis #4">{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller=[[Ron Wagner|Wagner, Ron]]|inker=[[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Joe]]|story=Last God Standing|title=[[Genesis (DC Comics)|Genesis]]|volume=1|issue=4|date=October 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> Even without Darkseid's full power and strength, he is still able to hold out his own against an Olympian God such as Zeus.

While Darkseid is a deity and immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years, he is not invincible and has been killed on several occasions.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual">''Doomsday: Year One Annual''</ref>

In "The Great Darkness Saga", Darkseid displayed a range of deity-like powers, such as transposing the positions of two planets in different solar systems, taking mental control of the entire population of a planet, instantly absorbing all the information from another being's mind, manifesting the worst fears of other beings as realities, easily defeating incredibly powerful beings such as [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], [[Mordru]], and the [[Time Trapper]], and pronouncing a curse.

Despite Darkseid's extraordinary physical powers, he rarely engages himself personally in confrontations, as he prefers to use his superhuman intellect to manipulate or control others to his ends.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual"/> Darkseid has displayed his godly abilities by sensing the death of his son Orion<ref name="The Death of the New Gods">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jim Starlin|Starlin, Jim]]|penciller=Starlin, Jim|inker=[[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]]|story=Sacrifice|title=[[Death of the New Gods|The Death of the New Gods]]|volume=1|issue=6|date=April 2008|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> and fluctuations of the energy of the "Godwave".<ref name="Genesis #4"/> As the ruler of Apokolips, Darkseid has access to all of its military and technological resources.

Darkseid is able to drain the life force of other godly beings in order to rejuvenate himself and/or return to his full power. Demi-gods are capable of slowly rejuvenating Darkseid but a god (such as Zeus) can return Darkseid back to his original form by draining them.<ref name="Wonder Woman Vol 5 37"/>{{vague|date=March 2018}}

==Other versions==
Darkseid makes his first official appearance in Chapter 22 of the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic on Apokolips. He is seen overseeing the torture of an unseen figure as his son [[Kalibak]] approaches him. Kalibak informs his father of [[Superman]]'s worldwide ceasefire on Earth. Darkseid muses if Superman has begun to soften before Kalibak asks to take a war party to personally investigate. When Kalibak sees just who it is Darkseid is torturing, the lord of Apokolips confirms the man's identity before saying, "He made a mistake." When Kalibak asks if he can be killed, Darkseid chides his son, "Of course not. Who would come for him?" He then allows Kalibak to go, bidding him to kill the Kryptonian and take the Earth. Darkseid grins to himself as he asks to be left alone with his prisoner: [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]], death himself, as Darkseid resumes his torture. In the Injustice Annual, Darkseid hires the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to go to Earth and kill Superman in retaliation for the death of Kalibak at the Man of Steel's hands. However, Lobo returns some time later after a 'therapy' session with [[Harley Quinn]], and brazenly challenges the Dread Lord to a battle. Later, under Darkseid's command, [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] manipulates the Justice League into battle with the Greek Gods. The attempt, while initially successful, is defused by Batman and [[Highfather]]'s intervention. The Greek Gods depart with no further conflict and Superman brings Ares to Darkseid to torture in exchange for Darkseid, Ares and their underlings to "never step foot on Earth."

But each time it looked like the world was about to be consumed by hatred and darkness, another force arose to send the darkness back. His disciple Granny Goodness once claimed that [[Kali]], [[Hades]] and [[Lucifer]] are all names that Darkseid's been known as on Earth. However, as Hades is an existing and separate entity, the accuracy of these claims is unknown. What is known is that Darkseid had a son, named Orion. However, the boy was raised by another being, who was as devoted to the light, as Darkseid was to the darkness. This made Orion into a powerful enemy against his father. At least once, Orion banished Darkseid from Earth. In the episode "Supergirl", Darkseid awakened from a rift in the universe, taking over radio jockey Gordon Godfrey, Darkseid made himself the center of the rising anti-vigilante movement including possessing [[Slade Wilson|General Slade Wilson]] (branding them with the invisible Omega symbol). For months, Darkseid corrupted countless humans, until it was enough to pull Apokolips through space and towards Earth. Knowing that [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] was the only one who could stop him, Darkseid possessed [[Green Arrow (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]] after a fight with another disciple Desaad who had kidnaped [[Chloe Sullivan]]. A possessed Oliver managed to find [[Gold kryptonite|Gold Kryptonite]] planned to strip Clark of his powers at his wedding to [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois]] but was defeated. In the finale, Oliver as Green Arrow fired arrows at the disciples, turning them into black smoke and leaving their fates unknown. Also in the two-part [[Finale (Smallville)|series finale]], Darkseid is seemingly destroyed by Clark while possessing the [[Earth Two|Earth-2]]'s [[Lionel Luthor]], having made a deal to resurrect [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] in exchange for Lionel's body. <ref>{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|credits=Al Septien, Turi Meyers, Brian Peterson, & Kelly Souders (writers) Kevin G.

[[File:STAS_Darkseid.jpg|thumb|right|Darkseid as he appears in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
Darkseid is featured in various animated series set within the [[DC animated universe]], voiced by [[Michael Ironside]].
* The character is introduced in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. He is first seen as the shadowy benefactor manipulating the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] crime syndicate [[Intergang]], supplying them with alien weaponry to prepare for his invasion of Earth only for [[Superman]] to foil his plans. Superman later learns that the planets [[Apokolips]] and [[New Genesis]] have been at war for aeons until a peace treaty was formed by trading their respective ruler's sons; Darkseid's son [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] with [[Highfather]]'s son [[Mister Miracle]]. Despite this truce, Darkseid searches for the elusive [[Anti-Life Equation]] to destroy New Genesis and remake the universe in his image. Following the repeated failures of his underlings, Darkseid personally defeats Superman and nearly succeeds in conquering Earth until New Genesis' forces declare the planet under their protection. In the series finale, Darkseid bypasses this deal by brainwashing Superman into thinking he is his adopted son and manipulating the Man of Steel into invading Earth for him. Superman ultimately breaks free of Darkseid's influence and confronts him on Apokolips. Darkseid pummels and prepares to kill Superman with his Omega Beams, but the latter covers the Lord of Apokolips' eyes and causes a massive explosion which results in Darkseid's defeat. To Superman's shock, Darkseid's slaves willingly come to their master's aid by carrying him away to recover with the tyrant explaining, "''I am many things, Kal-El, but here, I am God.''"
* Darkseid returns in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''. In the two-part episode "Twilight", he seeks the [[Justice League]]'s help in preventing [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] from assimilating Apokolips' information before destroying it. It is later revealed that Darkseid and Brainiac are working together; in exchange for luring Superman to Brainiac, Darkseid's planet would be spared. However, Darkseid betrays Brainiac by overriding his circuitry to find the Anti-Life Equation. As Brainiac's base begins to self-destruct due to the League and Orion's interference, an enraged Superman defeats Darkseid but is prevented from killing him when [[Batman]] [[boom tube]]s them to safety. Buried under the rubble, Darkseid nonchalantly mutters "Loser" before the base explodes.
* Darkseid makes his final appearance in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the penultimate episode "Alive!", [[Lex Luthor]] travels to the ruins of Brainiac's asteroid base and attempts to draw his essence from the debris to reconstitute him. However, Darkseid is resurrected instead and he returns to Apokolips to reunite his forces to seek revenge against Superman by conquering Earth. In the series finale "Destroyer", the Justice League and Luthor's [[Legion of Doom|Secret Society]] work together to stop Darkseid's invading army of [[Parademon|Parademons]]. Darkseid defeats Superman and prepares to kill him but Luthor, having visited the [[Source Wall]] and found the Anti-Life Equation, intervenes and offers Darkseid the object of his greatest desire. The two then disappear in a flash of light.
