'''Darkseid''' (pronounced "Darkside") is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character made a cameo appearance in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #134 (December [[1970 in comics|1970]]) before making his full first appearance in ''[[Forever People]]'' #1 (Feb. [[1971 in comics|1971]]).<ref name="Official DC Website">{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/characters/darkseid|title=Darkseid |website=www.DCcomics.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}</ref>

As the tyrannical ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]], Darkseid's ultimate goal is to conquer the universe and eliminate all free will. One of the most powerful beings in the [[DC Universe]], the character became a staple [[Superman]] villain and is considered the [[archenemy]] of the [[Justice League]]. Darkseid was ranked number 6 on IGN's top 100 comic book villains of all time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/6.html|title=Darkseid is number 6 - IGN|website=www.ign.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> and number 23 on Wizard's 100 greatest villains of all time.

Darkseid was voiced by [[Frank Welker]] in the animated series ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', which became his first appearance in media other than comic books. The character was subsequently portrayed by [[Michael Ironside]] in the [[DC animated universe]], [[Andre Braugher]] in ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]'', [[Steven Blum]] in ''[[Justice League: War]]'', and [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] in an episode of ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''.

==Publication history==
[[Jack Kirby]] debuted at DC Comics with ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #133 and immediately began establishing characters that would lay the foundation for his newly conceived [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] epic. The chief antagonist would be the villain Darkseid who had a cameo in ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #134 (November 1970) with a full first appearance in ''[[Forever People]]'' #1 (February [[1971 in comics|1971]]) . The character was originally designed to be the chief antagonist of the titles ''Forever People'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' and ''New Gods'', but after the cancellation of these titles, the characters along with Darkseid were incorporated back into the DC Universe.

==Character inspiration==
According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], Jack Kirby modelled Darkseid's face on actor [[Jack Palance]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2006/11/10/the-palance-darkseid-connection/ | title=The Palance-Darkseid Connection | work=News From Me | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> Kirby modelled Darkseid's character on that of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the world of Apokolips on [[Nazi Germany]].  Like Hitler, Darkseid is a [[jackboot]]-wearing [[megalomaniac]] and warmonger who, in [[fascist]] style, sees every citizen as an extension of the state and himself.  His society is highly militant, with children being indoctrinated from a young age to be warlike and utterly loyal to him. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a source.|date=June 2013}}

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Darksied (Chris Burnham's art).png|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Darkseid Special'' #1 (2017). Art by [[Chris Burnham]].]]
The son of King [[Yuga Khan]] and Queen [[Heggra]], Prince Uxas, second in line to the throne of [[Apokolips]], plotted to seize power over the planet. When his brother, [[Infinity-Man|Drax]], attempted to claim the fabled Omega Force, Uxas murdered him, and took the power for himself. The power transformed him into a stone-like creature, upon which he took the name Darkseid.<ref>''Jack Kirby's Fourth World'' #2-5</ref> At some point in time, he fell in love with an Apokoliptian scientist and sorceress named Suli, with whom he had a son, [[Kalibak]]; however, Suli was poisoned by [[Desaad]] on Heggra's behalf, who believed that Suli was corrupting her son.

Following Suli's death, Darkseid's heart grew even colder, and he ordered Desaad to poison Heggra, and as soon as he did, Darkseid finally became the supreme [[monarch]] of Apokolips. Darkseid had briefly been forced by his mother to marry [[Tigra (DC Comics)|Tigra]], with whom he also had a son. After murdering his mother, Darkseid ordered Tigra to eliminate their son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], who was switched with the Highfather's son, [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]], so as to keep peace.<ref>''New Gods'' (vol. 1) #7</ref>

The destructive war with the rival planet, [[New Genesis]], was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of the sons of [[Highfather]] and Darkseid. Darkseid's second born son was surrendered to Highfather, while Darkseid received Scott Free, who later became the master escape artist [[Mister Miracle]]. This eventually turned out to be a setback for Darkseid, with his biological son growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis in opposition to his father. The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of his son in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips.

Seeing other deities as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in order to discover the secret location of the Olympian deities, planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power. Refusing to aid Darkseid in his mad quest, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] battled his [[Parademon]] troops, causing half of the Amazon population's death.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #102-104</ref> [[Wonder Woman]] was able to gain her revenge against Darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid. This supposedly weakened the god's power as he lost a portion of his dark edge.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2, #173, #188</ref>

Darkseid's goal was to eliminate all [[free will]] from the universe and reshape it into his own image. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious [[Anti-Life Equation]], which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion [[Glorious Godfrey]], who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation.

Darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many [[superhero]]es of the DC Universe, most notably the Kryptonian [[Superman]]. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through [[Intergang]], a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of evil.

===The Great Darkness Saga===
{{Main article|The Great Darkness Saga}}
One thousand years in the future, Darkseid has been absent for centuries and is almost completely forgotten. He returns and comes into conflict with that era's champions, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and [[Daxam]]—which places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants [[Powers and abilities of Superman|Kryptonian-like superpowers]] equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe. However, he is eventually defeated by the Legion and many of its allies.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 2, #290-294 (1982)</ref><ref>''The Great Darkness Saga'' was removed from mainstream DC continuity in 1994, following the events of the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' limited series.  However, the tale has been restored to continuity in recent years. In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 6, #4 (October 2010), explicit reference is made to the events of "The Great Darkness Saga", mentioning (among other things) Darkseid's victory over [[Mordru]] on the planet Avalon.  Similarly in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 7, #3 (January 2012), a Daxamite official remarked that the people of his world "still mourn how Darkseid used us for violence".</ref>

===The Seven Soldiers and "Boss Dark Side"===
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2005 ''Mister Miracle'' limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he then used to destroy the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] altogether. The [[New Gods]] fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] used a wheelchair, the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] was an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad|DeSaad]] was an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] was a pimp (or "madam") for the [[Female Furies]] and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as "Boss Dark Side". It is revealed that Darkseid actually gave the [[Sheeda]] [[North America]] in return for [[Aurakles]], Earth's first superhero.<ref>''Seven Soldiers'' #1</ref> This was, in turn, purely in order for Darkseid to get [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], whom he considers the "Avatar of Freedom", in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the New Gods.

===Final Crisis===
{{Main article|Final Crisis}}
As prophesied, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] returns to Earth via [[boom tube]] for his final battle with Darkseid. During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, which created a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having "won" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as "Boss Dark Side", aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].

Once again bound to the form of a human, "Boss Dark Side" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to ''[[Final Crisis]]''. In ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the "spoken form" of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], to kidnap the [[Tornado Twins]]. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by [[Bernadeth]]. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #59, it was revealed that he had employed the [[Terror Titans]] to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.

In ''Final Crisis'', Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and [[antichrist]]-like figure who soon converts much of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to his cause with the aid of the [[Crime Bible]] and the [[Holy Lance]]. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as [[Mary Marvel]].

[[File:Fc-04 darkseid.jpg|thumb|upright|Darkseid on the cover of ''Final Crisis'' #4 (November 2008). Art by J.G. Jones.]]
Darkseid also arranges for detective [[Dan Turpin]] to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's "final host", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest "rebirth", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], the "Embodiment of Freedom" is shot by [[S.H.A.D.E.]] operatives, thus signalling the "Victory of Evil". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his "fall" having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth.

After escaping from captivity, [[Batman]] shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Beam, sending back in time and then "infecting" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into prehistoric times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death).

Before Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]] lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and making contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid's control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid's minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid's spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the [[Miracle Machine]] Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan fails when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman (Dick Grayson), Red Robin (Tim Drake), Robin (Damian Wayne), and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time-stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with [[Mister Miracle]], to escape the Omega Sanction.

[[Doctor Impossible]] later manipulates the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] itself. The resurrection backfires, and instead creates a new being known as the Omega Man.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #50</ref>

===The New 52===
In ''Justice League'' #1, Darkseid's name is invoked by a Parademon.<ref>''Justice League'' #1</ref> He is later mentioned again in ''Justice League'' #2,<ref>''Justice League'' #2</ref> and in ''Justice League'' #3 Darkseid makes his first appearance in the series, seen in a vision by [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] after he is injured by an exploding Mother Box.<ref>''Justice League'' #3</ref> In the final pages of ''Justice League'' #4, Darkseid himself appears.<ref>''Justice League'' #4</ref> In ''Justice League'' #5, the League confronts him but they are overpowered by him, when he severely hurts Superman with his Omega Beams and breaks Green Lantern's arm.<ref>''Justice League'' #5</ref> Finally, in ''Justice League'' #6, Darkseid is driven out when Cyborg activates the invaders' Mother Boxes and Superman forces him through a [[boom tube]]. The incidents that occur in these issues make Darkseid the very first foe the newly formed League faces as a team. The issue also reveals DeSaad and Steppenwolf, referring to Darkseid's daughter and their ceaseless search for her across countless worlds.<ref>''Justice League'' #6</ref> Darkseid's daughter escapes containment in ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #7 after the dampeners on her cage are temporarily disabled.<ref>''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #7</ref>

In DC's [[The New 52]] continuity, there is only one set of New Gods across the 52 Multiverse. So as Darkseid invades Prime Earth in ''Justice League'', he sends his lieutenant [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] to do the same, with greater success, on [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]], resulting in the deaths of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and stranding Helena Wayne and Kara Zor-L on Prime Earth. Five years later, Darkseid once again invades Earth 2, which never fully recovered from his armies' earlier assault, and it is revealed that he and [[Highfather (comics)|Highfather]] of New Genesis struck a deal allowing him the unchallenged right to invade Earth 2.

In ''Darkseid'' #1, his background story was revealed. Formerly a farmer named Uxas, he hated the deities of his world. So he traveled up to their mountain while they slept and tricked them all into fighting each other, and as they were all weakened from the war, he killed them one by one with his scythe (similar to Kronos of Greek mythology) and stole their power, before destroying his world and creating Apokolips.

In ''Justice League: The Darkseid War'' (after the retirement of the "New 52" imprint), Darkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor. Darkseid's daughter, Grail,  leads the [[Anti-Monitor]], who is revealed to be a scientist named Mobius, to Darkseid for the former to kill the latter. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] with Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Later, Lex Luthor would be merged with the Omega Sanction, becoming the new ruler of Apokolips.

After killing the Anti-Monitor using an Anti-Life Equation-powered [[Steve Trevor]], Grail would later resurrect Darkseid through the [[Alexander Luthor Jr.|newborn child]] of [[Superwoman]]. The child has the same powers as his father Mazahs, with the ability to steal the powers of others. Stealing the new "God" abilities of the Justice League, Grail fuses them with the child and brings Darkseid back to life. However, he is under her complete control. Grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing Darkseid with the Anti-Life Equation. However, it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:TheomegaeffectNG11.jpg|right|thumb|Darkseid vaporizes [[Desaad]] with his Omega Beams in ''[[New Gods]]'' (vol. 1) #11 (November 1972). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Darkseid is among the most powerful beings of the DC Universe from the race known as New Gods. His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that he fires from his eyes or hands as either a concussive force or a disintegrating energy which is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Some super-beings, such as [[Superman]] and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], have proven to be resistant to the beams, although in the case of Superman, with a great deal of pain. Also, Orion was able to deflect them, and in a crossover story, [[Galactus]] was unaffected by them. These beams stem from a cosmic energy source called the "Omega Effect". The Omega Beams can also resurrect fallen beings previously killed by them, depending on the Dark Lord's will. Darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy, and his unerring aim allows the beam to travel in straight lines, bend, or curve around corners and even pass through matter or other forms of energy. He can also teleport himself or others through time and space.<ref>''Martian Manhunter'' #34</ref> His Omega Sanction traps organisms in a series of alternate realities, each one worse than the previous. During the Final Crisis, Darkseid used his Omega Beams to grant power to Mary Marvel, and her powers afterwards were based on Anti-Life rather than magic.

Darkseid's strength is depicted as immensely powerful, able to easily overpower anything, breaking a lantern ring with his bare hands. He has easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and the entire Justice League. He can also move with great speed, as he has been able to catch Superman off guard,<ref>''Superman'' #3</ref> and he is known to be able to react in nanoseconds.<ref name="Genesis #4">''Genesis'' #4</ref> He also can increase his physical size.<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #2</ref> Darkseid also has additional powers of [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], and he can create psionic avatars. Since Darkseid is a deity, he is also immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual">''Doomsday: Year One Annual''</ref> It was shown in Infinite Crisis that an avatar was the one who was a threat to the Justice League, and that there was only one Darkseid in existence of so much power that his mere existence in the [[multiverse]] can lead to the destruction of it entirely.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://imgur.com/ev8M4I7|title=Imgur: The most awesome images on the Internet|newspaper=Imgur|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> He can regenerate from complete disintegration instantly, making him impossible to kill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://images.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search;_ylt=A0LEViosnFBY3nsAgGMPxQt.?p=darkseid+vs+the+spectre&fr=yhs-iry-fullyhosted_003&fr2=piv-web&hspart=iry&hsimp=yhs-fullyhosted_003&type=wncy_omxmedia_16_25#id=3&iurl=http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/3388/398619-thespectre_19_10_super.jpg&action=click|title=darkseid vs the spectre - Yahoo Search Results Yahoo Image Search Results|website=images.search.yahoo.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>

In "The Great Darkness Saga," Darkseid displayed a range of deity-like powers, such as transposing the positions of two planets in different solar systems, taking mental control of the entire population of a planet, instantly absorbing all the information from another being's mind, manifesting the worst fears of other beings as realities, easily defeating incredibly powerful beings such as [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], [[Mordru]], and the [[Time Trapper]], and pronouncing a curse.

Despite his extraordinary physical powers, Darkseid rarely engages himself personally in confrontations, as he prefers to use his superhuman intellect to manipulate or control others to his ends.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual"/> Darkseid has displayed his godly abilities by sensing the death of his son Orion<ref name="The Death of the New Gods">''The Death of the New Gods''</ref> and fluctuations of the energy of the "Godwave".<ref name="Genesis #4"/> Darkseid also commands all of the military and technological resources of Apokolips.

==Other versions==
Darkseid makes his first official appearance in Chapter Twenty-Two of the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' Comic on Apokolips. He is seen overseeing the torture of an unseen figure as his son [[Kalibak]] approaches him. Kalibak informs his father of [[Superman]]'s worldwide ceasefire on Earth. Darkseid muses if Superman has begun to soften before Kalibak asks to take a war party to personally investigate. When Kalibak sees just who it is Darkseid is torturing, the lord of Apokolips confirms the man's identity before saying, "He made a mistake." When Kalibak asks if he can be killed, Darkseid chides his son, "Of course not. Who would come for him?" He then allows Kalibak to go, bidding him to kill the Kryptonian and take the Earth. Darkseid grins to himself as he asks to be left alone with his prisoner: [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]], death himself, as Darkseid resumes his torture. In the Injustice Annual, Darkseid hires the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to go to Earth and kill Superman in retaliation for the death of Kalibak at the Man of Steel's hands. However, Lobo returns some time later after a 'therapy' session with [[Harley Quinn]], and brazenly challenges the Dread  Lord to a battle.

* Darkseid will appear in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode "The Fatal Fare", voiced by [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]].<ref>[http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/justice-league-action-the-fatal-fare/EP025471720032?aid=zap2it]</ref> He contacts [[Space Cabbie]] to take him to one of the moons of a planet. When they arrive, Darkseid pays Space Cabbie in Omega Coins. While trying to give Darkseid his receipt, Space Cabbie stumbles onto Darkseid, Desaad, and Kanto torturing Superman on what virus he used on the Mother Box. Before Space Cabbie could take off to warn the Justice League, he is stopped by Darkseid who wanted him to take Kanto home. Though Kanto had a secret mission to dispose of Space Cabbie at an acid lake planet. After being saved by Hawkman and Swamp Thing, Space Cabbie takes them to save Superman who manages to throw Darkseid through the Boom Tube to the acid lake planet. He later contacts [[Roxy Rocket]] to take him home unaware that Space Cabbie is also riding with her. In the episode "Superman's Pal, Sid Sharp," Darkseid is displeased that the criminals that were sold weapons from Apokolips only used them to rob banks and were defeated by Superman. Sending the Parademons to the Daily Planet to find Superman, Darkseid was displeased that they mistook reporter Sid Sharp in a mock Superman outfit as Superman and decides to use him as bait for Superman. After Superman is caught in a Kryptonite trap, Darkseid arrives when Sid Sharp tricks Desaad, Granny Goodness, Kalibak, and Kanto into competing to tell Darkseid about the trap. This enabled Superman to break free where he and Sid Sharp steal Desaad's Mother Box to get back to Earth. Before Darkseid can punish Desaad for his failure, Kalibak asks if he is still not getting a hug.

====[[DC Animated Universe]]====
Darkseid appears in various animated shows set in the [[DC animated universe]], voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]:

* Darkseid first appears in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', where he is depicted as the absolute ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]] who will stop at nothing to find the elusive Anti-Life Equation, which he plans to use to reshape the universe in his image. For aeons, Apokolips and its sister planet, [[New Genesis]], have been at war with each other. They eventually formed a peace treaty by trading Darkseid's son (Orion) with Highfather's (Mister Miracle), whom Darkseid has shown great resent towards. During his first invasion of Earth (in the two-part episode "Apokolips...Now!"), Darkseid is confronted by the citizens of New Genesis, who deem Earth under their protection; if Darkseid ever attacked again, it would be a violation of their truce. To bypass his promise, Darkseid develops various schemes to destroy Earth indirectly, such as through manipulation of Metropolis' criminal syndicate, [[Intergang]]. In the concluding two-part finale "Legacy", Darkseid attempts one final invasion of Earth which involves brainwashing [[Superman]] into thinking he is his adopted son. After causing much devastation on Earth, Superman manages to break free from Darkseid's control, and confronts him on Apokolips. During their final battle, Darkseid beats and pummels Superman. But just as Darkseid attempts to use his Omega Beams to deliver the final blow, Superman covers the tyrant's eyes, causing a massive explosion which results in Darkseid's defeat. To Superman's shock, however, Darkseid's slaves willingly come to his aid after the battle by carrying his injured body away to recover. As he leaves, Darkseid explains to Superman that "I am many things, Kal-El, but here, I am God."
* Darkseid returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, where he is given a stylistic revamp, now featuring a more streamlined build. In the two-part episode "Twilight", Darkseid seeks the [[Justice League]]'s help in stopping [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] from downloading all of Apokolips' information before destroying it. Superman opposes helping his nemesis, but the rest of the League agrees in order to take down Brainiac once and for all. But after defeating Brainiac's forces and following the android back to his base, the League discover that Darkseid and Brainiac have been working together all along. As part of their arrangement, Darkseid would bring Superman to Brainiac, and in exchange the supercomputer would spare Apokolips. However, Darkseid later betrays Brainiac by hacking his circuitry, rendering all of Brainiac's machinery under his control to find the Anti-Life Equation. But Superman is freed with [[Batman]]'s help while Orion battles Darkseid. After Darkseid defeats his son, his exit blocked by Superman, intent to finish Darkseid once and for all. This time, the angered Man of Steel actually manages to defeat Darkseid, but is prevented from killing him as base begins to collapse, forcing Batman to bring Superman and Orion to safety via a [[boom tube]]. Buried under the rubble, Darkseid looks on and nonchalantly says "Loser" before being killed in the explosion of the base.
* Darkseid makes his final appearance in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. When the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]] travel into deep space to the location of Brainiac's destroyed base from "Twilight", [[Lex Luthor]] sacrifices both the ship's power and [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] to fuel a device that will mystically draw Brainiac's essence from the debris in an attempt to resurrect the android. However, Darkseid was resurrected instead, now more powerful than ever due to merging with Brainiac's technology. After destroying the Legion's ship, Darkseid returns to Apokolips and reunifies his warring minions to claim revenge against Superman, and launches an assault on Earth. This forces the Justice League and the Legion to work together to stop the Parademons' invasion. Superman then confronts Darkseid once again, and is ultimately defeated when Darkseid paralyzes him with the agony matrix. But before Darkseid can kill his nemesis, Luthor, having visited the Source Wall and found the Anti-Life Equation, steps in and sacrifices himself to stop Darkseid. Both Darkseid and Luthor then touch the Equation, and disappear in a flash of light. Though several heroes speculate that they may not have seen the last of them, series writer Dwayne McDuffie confirmed that Darkseid and Luthor now form part of the Source Wall, as do all who solve the Anti-Life Equation.

===Film===

* Darkseid appears as the main antagonist in the [[direct-to-video]] [[Animation|animated film]] ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]'', voiced by [[Andre Braugher]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26912 | title=Conroy, Daly Return In ''Superman/Batman: Apocalypse'' | work=Comic Book Resources | date=June 29, 2010 | accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> When Darkseid learns of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]]'s presence on Earth, he orders his minions to have her brought to Apokolips as a possible candidate to lead the [[Female Furies]] after Big Barda's departure. After using a horde of Doomsday clones to distract Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, Darkseid's forces manage to capture Kara and bring her to Apokolips, where Darkseid brainwashes her into becoming his personal agent. When Superman arrives, Darkseid unleashes the corrupted Kara in hopes of using her to kill the Man of Steel. However, Batman activates all of the Hell Spores and threatens to destroy Apokolips, issuing Darkseid an ultimatum: free Kara and promise to leave her alone in exchange for deactivating the Spores. Darkseid then relents, releasing Kara from his control. However, Darkseid later ambushes them at the Kent Farm (he had promised to leave Kara alone, but not Superman or Earth). After using his Omega Beams to blast Superman into orbit, Darkseid overpowers Kara. He also overpowers Superman again. Darkseid manages to restrain Superman and then blast and unleash the power of his Omega Beams nearly killing him. Kara then uses Darkseid's Mother Box to activate a Boom Tube, transporting the villain to an unknown part of space where he ends up frozen.
* Darkseid appears as the main antagonist in the animated film ''[[Justice League: War]]'', voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. This iteration is based on his [[New 52]] portrayal, conquering world after world after each one has run out of resources, and he has the natives turned into Parademons for his army. Attempting to invade the Earth, Darkseid and his forces begin terraforming the planet. Per Green Lantern's idea, Flash and Wonder Woman gouge Darkseid's eyes out to prevent him from using his Omega Beams. Cyborg and Shazam get the [[boom tube]]s open to send all of the Parademons back with Darkseid. After receiving a massive beating from Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, and Wonder Woman, Darkseid is finally thrown back into the portal and returned to Apokolips. His fate is unknown after that.
* Darkseid appears as in the animated film ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League]]'', voiced by [[Tony Todd]]. He takes advantage of Bizarro's new [[Bizarro League]].
* An alternate universe version of Darkseid appeared in a flashback scene of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[André Sogliuzzo]]. [[Bekka]] was supposed to be wed to his son, Orion as part of a truce between New Genesis and Apokolips only for Highfather and his army to kill him and his followers. Unlike the comics and any incarnations, this version of Darkseid is shown to be a good parent to Orion and possibly Kalibak, as seen by Orion when he saw his father killed by Highfather and Orion is shocked to see his father dead in front of him.
* Darkseid appears in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom]]'', with Tony Todd reprising the role. After Lex Luthor and the [[Legion of Doom (DC Comics)|Legion of Doom]] fail, Darkseid decides to take matters into his own hands by allying himself with [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

Using the power of the Mother Box and the sensory field matrix that served as his prison, Darkseid is able to escape - saying that he has fulfilled his bargain to help Brainiac unleash great power, with the great knowledge being that one should never trust Darkseid - and remake Earth into a new Apokolips. He subsequently attempted to destroy the League with his Omega Beams, but Mother Box was able to save the League by altering the Omega Effect to send them to another dimension filled with a strange ambient energy that renders the Omega Beams useless. Now protected from Darkseid, the League return to Earth and defeat him, Wonder Woman subsequently using her Lasso of Truth to learn that only the hypercube that imprisoned Darkseid originally can imprison him again. The league activates the cube and Superman defeats Darkseid, imprisoning him once again. With Darkseid defeated, Mother Box restores Earth to normal, with Green Lantern promising to take Darkseid's hypercube somewhere where it can never be discovered and Darkseid released again.

Unknown to both of them at the same time, [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] is blasting [[Dark Kahn|Shao Kahn]] with lighting as the villain attempted to flee in a portal. These two events link together, merging both villains into an entity known as Dark Kahn. This results in both realities beginning to merge. The creature spreads its will through both realities, increasing the Rage of every fighter to the point that they become delusional and mistake friends with enemies. Confronted by both Raiden and Superman, Dark Kahn explodes and both realities separate. Darkseid ends up in the Mortal Kombat universe by accident, being imprisoned in Nether Realm.
