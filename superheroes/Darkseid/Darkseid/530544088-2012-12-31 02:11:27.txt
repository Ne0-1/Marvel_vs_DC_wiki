'''Darkseid''' (pronounced {{Respell|DARK|side}}) is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #134 (November 1970) and was created by writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Darkseid | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=95 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>

Darkseid is one of the most powerful characters in the [[DC Universe]]. Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], he has appeared in four decades of DC Comics publications, featuring prominently in the ''[[New Gods]]'' titles and [[limited series]] as the recurring [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of the New Gods and [[Superman]] (and by extension the [[Justice League]]). The character has also been associated with DC Comics merchandise including [[Animation|animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, [[trading card]]s, and [[video game]]s.

Darkseid was ranked number 6 on [[IGN]]'s top 100 comic book villains of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/6.html |title=Darkseid is Number 6 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

==Character inspiration==
According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], Jack Kirby modeled Darkseid's face on actor [[Jack Palance]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_11_10.html#012391 | title=The Palance-Darkseid Connection | work=News From Me | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>  Kirby modeled Darkseid on [[Adolf Hitler]] and the world of Apokolips on Nazi Germany.  Like Hitler, Darkseid is a jackboot-wearing megalomaniac and warmongerer who, in fascist style, sees every citizen as an extension of the state and himself.  His society is highly militant, with children being indoctrinated from a young age (à la Hitler Youth) to be warlike and utterly loyal to him.

Darkseid's first appearance is a brief cameo in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #134 (Nov 1970).

==Fictional character biography==
The son of  King [[Yuga Khan]] and Queen [[Heggra]], Prince Uxas, second in line to the throne of [[Apokolips]], plotted to seize power over the planet. When his brother, [[Infinity-Man|Drax]], attempted to claim the fabled Omega Force, Uxas murdered him and took the power for himself; transforming him into a rock-like creature, and taking a new name: Darkseid.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''Jack Kirby's Fourth World'' #2-5</ref> At some point, he fell in love with an Apokoliptian scientist named Suli, with whom he had a son, [[Kalibak]]; however, Suli was poisoned by [[Desaad]] on Heggra's behalf, who believed that Suli was corrupting her son. Following Suli's death, Darkseid's heart grew even colder, and he had Desaad poison Heggra, finally becoming the supreme [[monarch]] of Apokolips. Darkseid had briefly been forced by his mother to marry [[Tigra (DC Comics)|Tigra]], with whom he also had a son. After murdering his mother, Darkseid had both Tigra and their son, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], banished from Apokolips.<ref>''New Gods'' (vol. 1) #7</ref>

The destructive war with the rival planet, [[New Genesis]], was stopped only with a diplomatic exchange of the sons of [[Highfather]] and Darkseid. Darkseid's second born son was surrendered to Highfather, while Darkseid received Scott Free, who later became the master escape artist [[Mister Miracle]]. This eventually turned out to be a setback for Darkseid, with his biological son growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis in opposition to his father. The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of his son in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armageddon of Apokolips.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Seeing other gods as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of [[Themyscira]] in order to discover the secret location of the [[Olympian gods (DC Comics)|Olympian gods]], planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power. Refusing to aid Darkseid in his mad quest, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] battled his [[parademon]] troops, causing half of the Amazon population's death.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #102-104</ref> [[Wonder Woman]] was able to gain her revenge against Darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into Darkseid. This supposedly weakened the god's power as he lost a portion of his dark edge.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #173, #188</ref>

Darkseid's goal was to eliminate all [[free will]] from the universe and reshape it into his own image. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious [[Anti-Life Equation]], which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion [[Glorious Godfrey]], who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation. Darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many [[superhero]]es of the DC Universe, notably, the [[Kryptonian]] [[Superman]]. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through [[Intergang]], a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of Evil.

===The Great Darkness Saga===
{{Main|The Great Darkness Saga}}
One thousand years in the future, Darkseid has been absent for centuries and is almost completely forgotten. He returns and comes into conflict with that era's champions, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and [[Daxam]] -- which places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants [[Powers and abilities of Superman|Kryptonian-like superpowers]] equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe. However, he is eventually defeated by the Legion and many of its allies.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 2, #290-294 (1982)</ref><ref>''The Great Darkness Saga'' was removed from mainstream DC continuity in 1994, following the events of the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' limited series.  However, the tale has been restored to continuity in recent years. In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 6, #4 (October 2010), explicit reference is made to the events of "The Great Darkness Saga", mentioning (among other things) Darkseid's victory over [[Mordru]] on the planet Avalon.  Similarly in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 7, #3 (January 2012), a Daxamite official remarked that the people of his world "still mourn how Darkseid used us for violence".</ref>

===Seven Soldiers and "Boss Dark Side"===
[[Image:Darkseid 7s.png|right|150px|thumb|Darkseid as "Boss Dark Side" in ''[[Seven Soldiers]]''.]]
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2005 ''Mister Miracle'' limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he then used to destroy the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] altogether. The [[New Gods]] fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] used a wheelchair, the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] was an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad]] was an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] was a pimp (or "madam") for the [[Female Furies]], and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as "Boss Dark Side". It is revealed that Darkseid actually gave the [[Sheeda]] [[North America]] in return for [[Aurakles]], Earth's first superhero.<ref>''Seven Soldiers'' #1</ref> This was, in turn, purely in order for Darkseid to get [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], whom he considers the "Avatar of Freedom", in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the New Gods.

===Final Crisis===
{{Main|Final Crisis}}
[[Image:Fc-04 darkseid.jpg|left|200x|thumb|Darkseid as he appeared in ''[[Final Crisis]]''.]]
As prophesied, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] returns to Earth via Boom Tube for his final battle with Darkseid. During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, creating a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having "won" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as "Boss Dark Side", aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].

Now, once again bound to the form of a human, "Boss Dark Side" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to ''[[Final Crisis]]''. In ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the "spoken form" of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], to kidnap the [[Tornado Twins]]. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by [[Bernadeth]]. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #59, it was revealed that he had employed the [[Terror Titans]] to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.

In ''Final Crisis'', Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and [[antichrist]]-like figure who soon converts much of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to his cause with the aid of the [[Crime Bible]] and the [[Holy Lance]]. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as [[Mary Marvel]].

Darkseid also arranges for detective [[Dan Turpin]] to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's "final host", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest "rebirth", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], the "Embodiment of Freedom" is shot by [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#S|S.H.A.D.E.]] operatives, thus signaling the "Victory of Evil". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his "fall" having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth.

After escaping from captivity, [[Batman]] shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Sanction, sending back in time and then "infecting" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into prehistoric times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death).  

Before Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]] lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid's control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid's minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid's spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the [[Miracle Machine]] Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan fails when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman (Dick Grayson), Red Robin (Tim Drake), Robin (Damian Wayne) and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time-stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with Mister Miracle, to escape the Omega Sanction.

[[Doctor Impossible]] later manipulates the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] itself. The resurrection backfires, and instead creates a new being known as the Omega Man.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #50</ref>

===The New 52===
In ''Justice League'' #1, Darkseid's name is invoked by a Parademon. He is later mentioned again in ''Justice League'' #2, and in ''Justice League'' #3 Darkseid makes his first appearance in the series, seen in a vision by [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] after he is injured by an exploding Mother Box. In the final pages of ''Justice League'' #4, Darkseid himself appears. In ''Justice League'' #5, the League confronts him but they are overpowered by him, when he severely hurts Superman with his Omega Beams and breaks Green Lantern's arm. Finally, in ''Justice League'' #6, Darkseid is driven out when Cyborg activates the invaders' Mother Boxes and Superman forces him through a Boom Tube. The incidents that occur in these issues make Darkseid the very first foe the newly-formed League faces as a team. The issue also reveals Desaad and Steppenwolf, referring to Darkseid's daughter and their ceaseless search for her across countless worlds.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:TheomegaeffectNG11.jpg|left|thumb|Darkseid vaporizes [[Desaad]] with his Omega Beams in ''[[New Gods]]'' (vol. 1) #11 (November 1972). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Darkseid is among the most powerful New Gods. His main power, the Omega Beam, is a form of energy that he fires from his eyes as either a concussive force or disintegrating energy, capable of transmuting or erasing living objects and organisms from existence as well as resurrecting them, depending on the dark lord's will. These beams stem from a cosmic energy source called the "Omega Effect." Darkseid has pinpoint control and his unerring aim allows the beam to travel in straight lines, bend, or curve around corners and can pass through matter and energy. He can teleport himself or others through time and space.<ref>''Martian Manhunter'' #34</ref> Darkseid can also shoot energy blasts from his hands. His Omega Sanction traps the organism in a series of alternate realities, each one worse than the previous. During the Final Crisis, Darkseid used his Omega Beams to grant power to Mary Marvel, with her powers then being based on Anti-Life rather than magic. Darkseid has also shown the powers of flight,<ref>''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]''</ref> shape-shifting,<ref>''Smallville (TV series)''</ref> and [[Spirit possession|possession]] of other living beings.<ref>''[[Smallville (TV series)]]''</ref>

Darkseid is a being whose unparalleled strength and invulnerability can only be challenged by the likes of Superman, [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]<ref name="The Death of the New Gods">''The Death of the New Gods''</ref> and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]].<ref>''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' (vol. 1) #6</ref> He can also move with great speed, as he has been able to catch Superman off guard,<ref>''Superman'' #3</ref> he is known to be able to react in nanoseconds.<ref name="Genesis #4">''Genesis'' #4</ref> He also can increase his size.<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #2</ref> Darkseid has the powers of [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]] and can create psionic avatars. Since Darkseid is considered a "god" he is immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual">''Doomsday: Year One Annual''</ref>

Despite his extraordinary physical power, Darkseid rarely engages himself personally in confrontations, as he prefers to use his superhuman intellect and genius to manipulate or control others to his ends.<ref name="Doomsday: Year One Annual"/> Darkseid has displayed his godly abilities by sensing the death of his son Orion<ref name="The Death of the New Gods"/> and fluctuations of the energy of the "godwave".<ref name="Genesis #4"/> Darkseid commands all the military and technological resources of Apokolips. He is almost omnipotent and can bring forth and manipulate the darkness within a person's heart, allowing him to turn any that are not "pure" to the path of evil.<ref>''[[Smallville (TV series)]]''</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
===''Super Friends''===
Darkseid first appears in the [[animation|animated]] series ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (1985), voiced by [[Frank Welker]], using a deep gravelly voice similar to the one he would later used for [[Dr. Claw]] in Inspector Gadget.

===DC animated universe===
[[Image:DarkseidsupermanTAS.jpg||right|thumb|Darkseid as depicted in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
Darkseid would also later appear in several animated series set in the [[DC animated universe]], namely ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (1996), ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001), and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004); voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]. In ''Superman: The Animated Series'', Darkseid is resentful of his second born son Kalibak and only somewhat jokingly acknowledges that Orion is his true son (mainly trying to egg on Orion to be like him). After his first invasion of Earth in the two-part episode "Apokolips...Now!", Darkseid promises that Apokolips will not attack again, as part of a truce with the planet New Genesis. To bypass his promise, Darkseid develops various schemes to destroy Earth indirectly, such as through manipulation of Intergang and even Superman. In the concluding two-part episode "Legacy", Darkseid attempts one final invasion of Earth which involves brainwashing Superman. He is stopped by Superman and pursued to Apokolips where he is defeated. To Superman's shock, Darkseid's slaves willingly come to his aid after the battle, carrying his broken body away to recover. As Darkseid leaves, he explains to Superman that on Apokolips, "I am many things, Kal-El. Here I am God".

A few years later, on ''Justice League'', Darkseid seeks the help of the League in order to defeat a common enemy [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], who has come to Apokolips to download all knowledge of the planet, then destroy it. Superman opposes helping Darkseid, but the rest of the League agrees in order to take down Brainiac once and for all. Unfortunately, after defeating Brainiac's forces and following him back to his base, the League discovers that Darkseid was playing them all along. In return for sparing Apokolips, Darkseid delivered Superman and his allies to Brainiac, allowing him revenge against the Kryptonian, and no opposition for the acquisition of Earth Knowledge, then its destruction. Superman is freed with the help of Batman while Orion battles Darkseid. Rather than flee with the rest of the League, Superman goes back to finish Darkseid once and for all. Darkseid defeats his son only to have his exit blocked by Superman and the two engage in fierce combat. But just as Darkseid is near defeat, the base begins to collapse, at which point Batman forcibly brings Superman to safety into Orion's boom tube. Darkseid looks on, buried under rubble, and nonchalantly says "Loser", then is killed in the explosion of the base.

Some time afterwards, near the end of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]] traveled into deep space, to the location where Brainiac's base once was. After reaching the destination, Luthor sacrifices both the ship's power and Tala to fuel a device that will mystically draw Brainiac's essence from the debris of his asteroid base. But before the machine kills her, [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] channels a different sort of energy through the machine. As a final act of revenge against Luthor, she has Darkseid resurrected instead, but with at least some of Brainiac's powers. He thanks the group of villains by offering them a quick and painless death, then destroys their base with his Omega beams. Lex Luthor and his band of villains survive thanks to Sinestro and Star Sapphire. They steal a mother-box and return to Earth. Darkseid returns to Apokolips claiming revenge against Superman and launches an assault on Earth, in which the Justice League and the Legion work together to stop the Parademon's invasion. Superman, Batman and Lex Luthor battle against Darkseid, and most notably, Batman becomes, according to Darkseid, the first ever being to avoid Darkseid's Omega beam, and on the final match Superman was almost defeated by Darkseid's Agony Matrix and a kryptonite knife, but then Lex Luthor, who went to the Source Wall aided by Metron, returned and offered him the Anti-Life Equation, Darkseid's most wanted possession. Then Darkseid stopped the battle and touched Luthor's hand which held the equation, then he and Luthor disappeared, although Superman, Batman and the other founding members of the League doubt they've seen the last of them.

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
Darkseid appears in an episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' titled "Darkseid Descending!" voiced by [[Michael-Leon Wooley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1010/30/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, October 30, 2010 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> In the episode, Darkseid leads the forces of Apokolips in an invasion of Earth, only to be challenged by [[Batman]] and his new [[Justice League International|Justice League]]. After soundly defeating the League, Darkseid is goaded into a fist fight with Batman after the hero implies that he is simply a coward who hides behind his god-like abilities. Though Darkseid subsequently wins this fight, he and his army are sent back to Apokolips by the [[Question (comics)|Question]], who had infiltrated Darkseid's cadre of minions and reversed the Boom Tubes that had brought them to Earth.

===''Young Justice''===
Darkseid is alluded to in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Disordered" though he is never explicitly named. Beautiful Dreamer of the [[Forever People]] refers to him as Desaad's master, while Desaad simply calls him "Unspeakable".

===''Smallville''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Darkseidsv.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Darkseid appears before Lionel Luthor.]] -->
Darkseid is the main antagonist for the tenth and final season of ''[[Smallville]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1107100p1.html | title=SDCC 10: Smallville - Darkseid, Blue Beetle, and More Are Coming!}}</ref> Producers of the series mentioned that the character will not be fully revealed at the beginning and will be a force that is going to be felt throughout the season and eventually materialize as the episodes progress. In the series version, he mostly appears as an non-corporeal being.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ausiello |first=Michael |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/07/26/smallville-season-10-spoilers-comic-con/ |title=Exclusive video: 'Smallville' execs, Erica Durance drop major S10 intel and weigh in on an 11th &#124; Inside TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Ausiellofiles.ew.com |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> In the season premiere "Lazarus", both [[Jor-El]] ([[Terence Stamp]]) and the spirit of [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]] ([[John Schneider (television actor)|John Schneider]]) warned [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] ([[Tom Welling]]) of a dark force that is coming to Earth to corrupt it. It heard of Clark's power and the doubts and fears in his heart and wants to turn him into a weapon. The dark force gathers on a rooftop in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and forms into the shape of a rock-like creature. In "[[Supergirl]]", [[Kara Zor-El|Kara]] ([[Laura Vandervoort]]) tells Clark that the darkness came to Earth after a rip in the universe was created. Clark concludes that when he opened a portal to another world (used to send the Kandorians to a world that would become New Krypton), it must have allowed the darkness to come to Earth. Darkseid went on to possess the radio jockey [[Glorious Godfrey|Gordon Godfrey]] (Michael Daingerfield). Using him as his vessel, Darkseid created a backlash against the superheroes in Metropolis but left Godfrey's body after a confrontation with Clark and Kara. 

In "Abandoned", Darkseid's minions [[Granny Goodness]] ([[Christine Willes]]), [[Desaad]] ([[Steve Byers]]), and Godfrey (who was now corrupted by Darkseid's darkness although no longer directly possessed by him) discuss their plans for paving the way for the coming of their dark lord. The episode "Patriot" revealed that [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]] ([[Michael Hogan]]) is one of the people whom Darkseid is influencing, as he bears the Omega symbol on his skull. In "Masquerade", it's shown that Darkseid through Desaad is bringing more under his control bearing the Omega symbol, attracting the attention of the FBI. It is shown that the influence gains control by exploiting a person's weakness, thematically one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It fails to ensnare [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]]) but succeeds in capturing [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]). In "Scion", Darkseid is revealed taking shape from a mass of black smoke before alternate-universe [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]) in front of his [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|son]]'s tombstone as the episode ends. In "Dominion", Clark and Oliver discover that Darkseid has indeed been to other worlds and that [[Zod|General Zod/Major Zod]] ([[Callum Blue]]) made a deal with Darkseid to get rid of Clark in exchange for Zod to rule over the [[Phantom Zone]]. Darkseid manipulates Oliver into finding the Bow of Orion - the weapon that his son [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] used to defeat him the previous time Darkseid attempted to conquer Earth. After Oliver finds the Bow of Orion in "Prophecy", Granny Goodness subsequently destroyed the bow so that it cannot be used against her master again and brings Oliver completely under Darkseid's control and is later seen digging a gold kryptonite rock so he can permanently remove Clark's powers according to his master's will. 

During the two part series finale, Granny Goodness tells [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) that Darkseid was known in Earth's history by many names such as [[Hades]] and [[Lucifer]] and was also connected to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Kali]]. During Clark's wedding with [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]), Oliver (still possessed) tries to force a gold kryptonite ring on him but Clark saved Oliver from the darkness. Darkseid appeared before Lionel and offered Lionel to bring back [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]) to which Darkseid takes out Lionel's heart to resurrect Lex. Darkseid then possesses Lionel's body and confronts Clark in his barn. Darkseid (Glover) realizes that the Kryptonian is a threat after he saved Oliver from his spell, and tries to kill him. However, Clark is now at the pinnacle of his Kryptonian abilities, finally mastering the power of flight after Darkseid threw him into the air while they fought in the Kent barn, Clark regaining control mid-air and flying directly at Darkseid to strike him hard in the chest, defeating him and blasting him out of Lionel's body, seemingly destroying him (although he may have simply defeated the host). Clark then becomes [[Superman]] and stops the arriving planet Apokolips from destroying Earth by pushing it into outer space, thus foiling the demonic deity's plans.

====Other shows====
Darkseid makes a [[cameo appearance]] in [[Imaginationland Episode III|part 3]] of the ''[[South Park]]'' "Imaginationland" trilogy as one of the villains visible.

===Film===
Darkseid is the main antagonist in the [[direct-to-video]] [[Animation|animated film]] ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26912 | title=Conroy, Daly Return In ''Superman/Batman: Apocalypse'' | work=Comic Book Resources | date=June 29, 2010 | accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> He is voiced by actor [[Andre Braugher]]. In the film, when he learns about [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]'s presence on Earth, he manages to control her mind and attempts to make her the new captain of his [[Female Furies|furies]] after [[Big Barda|Barda]]'s defection. He had hopes of using her to kill Superman once and for all, but fails and later attacks both [[Kryptonian|kryptonians]] at the Kent Farm. In the end, he is pummeled by Superman and sent by Supergirl, using a boom tube, to another part of space, where he ends up frozen.

In December 2012, it was reported that Darkseid will be the main villain of the upcoming live action Justice League movie, set for release in Summer 2015. Later, it was rumored that the film's storyline will be inspired by Justice League Of America #183-185, which sees the League teaming up with the Justice Society Of America.
