'''Garokk''', also known as the '''Petrified Man''', is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He has been both an ally and an enemy of [[Ka-Zar]] and of the [[X-Men]]. He first appeared in ''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1 #2 and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Garokk was originally a sailor from [[Great Britain]], whose ship crashed on the shores of [[Antarctica]] during the [[15th century]]. The sailor was swept overboard and taken by a warm stream to the [[Savage Land]]. Wandering the Savage Land, the sailor entered the lands of the [[Savage Land Races#Sun People|Sun People]], who worshipped the Sun god Garokk. The sailor found a statue of Garokk with a cup beneath it. Thirsty, the sailor drank from the cup, but was chased off by the Sun People. The sailor escaped and managed to return to the [[Kingdom of England]], but found that he had become immortal after drinking the potion. Over time, the sailor's body became a living, organic, stone-like substance until he looked identical to the statue of Garokk. Nearly five centuries after he had left, the sailor returned to the Savage Land and discovered that the Sun People believed that their god would return and their high priestess [[Zaladane|Zala]] waged war as a form of worship to him. The sailor, now known as the Petrified Man allied himself with [[Ka-Zar]] to prevent any further bloodshed. The Petrified Man and Ka-Zar managed to stop Zala and her people, but the Petrified Man went mad and believed himself to be Garokk himself. Garokk and Ka-Zar fought and on Zala's instructions, Ka-Zar lured him inside a pool which turned Garokk human and mortal again. His age caught up with him and he died shortly afterwards<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1 #2-5</ref>

Zala later captured an adventurer called Kirk Marston and turned him into Garokk with the ashes of the recently deceased Petrified Man. Garokk and Zala fought the [[X-Men]] and Ka-Zar, but Garokk was defeated and fell down a large crevice. The X-Men believed Garokk to be dead. The X-Men's enemy [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] found Garokk, who had transformed: he was larger and half his body had turned into crystal while the other half became like molten rock. Magneto set Garokk as guardian of his base. In this role, he fought the X-Man [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], but again fell in a deep pit<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #115-116, 149</ref>

Again Garokk survived and he returned to his normal appearance. When the Savage Land was destroyed by the alien [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], Terminus was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], his armor ruptured and Terminus himself left to die, but it turned out that this Terminus was just an impostor. Garokk found another Terminus armor and under mental control (presumably by the real Terminus) entered it and started destroying the remainder of the Savage Land. The X-Men fought "Terminus" and destroyed the armor to reveal Garokk. Garokk regained his free will and together with a machine made by the [[High Evolutionary]], he restored the Savage Land at the cost of his own life<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #12</ref>

Garokk returned years later as an enemy of Ka-Zar, but Ka-Zar defeated him<ref>''Ka-Zar'' '97</ref><ref>''Ka-Zar'' vol. 2 #20</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Garokk is immortal: he does not age and even when killed, he can be returned to life. His petrified body also makes him difficult to injure. Garokk can fire beams of energy from his eyes. These beams can be heat, light, concussive force or can even open dimensional portals, capable of transporting an entire city. He can also turn his entire body into energy. Garokk has some mental connection to his followers. Garrok can also manipulate matter on a sub-atomic scale; he could rearrange the very fabric of the Savage Land.
