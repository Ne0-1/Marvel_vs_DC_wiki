The '''Prowler''' is a [[fictional character]], a superhero that appears in comics published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]], and made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #78. 

The first version developed a high-tech battle suit in order to start a life of crime until [[Spider-Man]] convinces him to turn his life around. Several other characters have also taken up the character's identity.

==Fictional character biography==
===Hobie Brown===
'''Hobie Brown''' was born in the [[Bronx, New York]]. He was a bright but angry teenage [[African-American]] who got fired from his window washer job. Intending to use his engineering skills for personal profit, he devised a plan to steal items while disguised as a supervillain and then return them as Hobie. 

Donning his green and purple "Prowler" costume for the first time, Hobie set out to rob the payroll office of The Daily Bugle, figuring that that would garner him quick publicity. However he was caught in the act by [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], and while struggling with him, drew the attention of editor J. Jonah Jameson. Parker, with no way to defeat the Prowler without giving away his secret identity, contrived to get thrown through a window during the struggle, and used his spider-powers to save himself once outside. Traumatized by the events, a shaken Hobie made his escape to the roof of the building, only to be confronted by Spider-Man. Spider-Man vanquished and unmasked Hobie, but realizing he was just a misunderstood kid (much like himself), he gave him advice not to throw his life away as a criminal and to redeem himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #78-79 (1969)</ref> Hobie took this advice to heart and has since become a model citizen. Hobie later impersonated Spider-Man at the hero's request - Spider-Man wearing a webbing mask - to convince Peter Parker's friends that he was not Spider-Man after Peter 'confessed' the truth while suffering delirium due to the flu, thus creating the impression that Peter had merely been confused.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #87</ref> Hobie became convinced that Spider-Man was involved somehow in police Captain [[George Stacy]]'s death, and unsuccessfully tried to bring Spider-Man to justice.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #93</ref> Hobie eventually married his love, Mindy S. McPherson, and settled down into a career as a construction worker.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Brown began to look after his 'little brother' Manuel "Manny" Lopez as a part of the Big Brother Program. When Manny was murdered, Prowler believed the original [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Hector Ayala) was responsible and attempted to bring White Tiger to justice.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #21</ref> Prowler attempted to join the super-hero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] only to be tossed into the harbor by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] at which point he decided to retire his identity.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-64</ref> However, Brown's Prowler equipment are later stolen by the "Cat Burglar" to commit crimes for fashion criminal Bella Donna. Brown was eager to join the search for the thieves but Spider-Man insisted that he stay home so he would not get into trouble since the second Prowler had committed a [[felony murder]]. When the second Prowler was subsequently defeated by Spider-Man, the stolen equipment was returned to Brown.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47-48</ref>

Prowler later appeared in California during Peter's "Webs" book deal.<ref>story-arc around ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #304, 1988</ref> He is first seen attacking the [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]] (Raul Chalmers) for possession of a chalice, to keep his wife Mindy out of prison. Mindy accepted a bookkeeping job at Transcorp New York. The company was caught in some shady stock deals and Mindy was set up and blamed for the crimes. Seeing only way to clear her name, Hobie re-donned his Prowler costume and found the books which Mindy had been blamed for stealing. He hid the books on an information chip and put the information chip on the chalice, where no one would look for it. Prowler and Spider-Man team up to take on the Black Fox in order to re-gain possession of the chalice. Hobie vindicated his wife of stock fraud charges with the help of Spider-Man and the Black Fox.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #305</ref>

Prowler later attempted to vindicate Spider-Man of a crime, and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and [[The Outlaws (comics)|the Outlaws]] (including rehabilitated villains like [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rocket Racer]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]).<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> His safety designs were stolen by [[Justin Hammer]]. Hobie proved the designs flaws during an encounter with Hammer's hirelings.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #9</ref> Hobie fought his brother [[Abe Brown (Marvel Comics)|Abe Brown]] (member of the [[Sons of the Tiger]]) as an initiation test for Silver Sable.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> Prowler joined with Spider-Man and the Outlaws against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Space Phantom]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47</ref> Prowler was hired along with the Outlaws to retrieve a Symkarian nuclear device in England.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36</ref> Prowler then formally joined the Outlaws to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25, ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11, ''Web of Spider-Man'' #7</ref>

His costume and equipment were stolen by Nightcreeper, and Prowler then battled Nightcreeper and the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] (Adrian Toomes).<ref>''Prowler'' [[limited series]] #1-4, 1995</ref>

Later, Hobie was paralyzed during the Great Game.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #16</ref> In follow-up appearances,<ref>''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #16-18 (1997)</ref> he began regaining movement of his paralyzed limbs- evidence suggests that his paralysis was more a result of mental rather than physical damage, as he was feeling frustrated over the recent theft of his costume, eventually regaining full mobility.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #25 (1997)</ref> While recovering, Brown provided Spidey with a jetpack used when assuming the new [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] identity during the ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' storyline,{{issue|date=October 2011}} and later appeared in Prowler costume at a poker game hosted by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''[[The Thing (comic)|The Thing]]'' #8 (2005)</ref>
 
Prowler was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] tie-in.<ref>''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #6 (2006)</ref>

Escaping incarceration, he attended the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for [[Stilt-Man]], along with many other villains and former villains. Prowler narrowly escaped injury as Spider-Man and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] escorted him from the wake shortly before it was bombed by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #4 (2006)</ref>

===Unnamed cat burglar===
[[Bella Donna (comics)#Belladonna (Narda Ravanna)|Bella Donna]] (Narda Ravanna) stole Hobie Brown's costume and equipment and hired the cat burglar whom Spider-Man originally fought in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #30 to be the Prowler's second incarnation. The criminal, wearing a simpler Prowler costume, accidentally killed a guard during one of his crimes. The second Prowler's silhouetted profile confused witnesses enough to have Spider-Man implicated in the murder. Eventually, Spider-Man captured both Bella Donna and her accomplice, cleared the original Prowler's name, and returned the stolen equipment to Brown.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47-48</ref><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/catprowl.htm|Cat}}</ref>

This Prowler was later seen at the "[[Bar With No Name]]" attending Stilt-Man's wake, identifying himself as the "Cat Burglar". He had a brief fight with the original Prowler at Stilt-Man's funeral. Sometime after the original Prowler left, Punisher poisoned the guests' drinks and blew the place up.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #4</ref> It was later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]”.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' Vol. 2 #17</ref>

===Rick Lawson===
The Prowler's third incarnation '''Rick Lawson''' is a medical intern that stole a Prowler costume when Hobie Brown was brought in with a back injury. When he was brought into hospital, his costume was partly cut away to conceal his superhero identity, but his friends were unwilling to risk moving him due to his back injury and so a portion of the costume was left that tipped Rick off. With this costume, the third Prowler both robbed patients in the ICU and get revenge on those who had "wronged" him in the past such as a [[construction foreman]] who fired him when he needed the job to complete medical school. He ran into the Vulture rejuvenated and attempting to kill all who knew him as an old man. Vulture mistook this Prowler for the original and was unconcerned about the mistake. He managed to badly injure Prowler by slashing him across the chest with his wings, but was unable to kill him when Spider-Man interrupted the fight. As Spider-Man defeated Vulture, Rick was taken to the hospital and the Prowler costume was returned to Hobie (recovering from his paralysis).<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #16-18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Prowler has no superhuman powers, but is naturally inventive, especially in the field of pneumatics, although he has no formal education in that science. He relies on a suite of technical gimmicks that he has created. Prowler wears modified coveralls interwoven with denim and stretch fabric, equipped with gas cartridge bracelets and anklets capable of propelling projectiles at high velocity. His arsenal of projectiles include steel darts ("flechettes"), gas pellets, small explosives, magnesium flares and cleaning fluid. Prowler has been known to use hypnotic aids and conventional hand-held weapons. He wears steel-tipped gauntlets for scaling walls, and shock absorbent foam rubber insulated boots. He also wears a cape which contains a network of pneumatic filaments which expand with air to give it a rigid structure, allowing him to glide for short distances. 

A technological genius, Hobie Brown is also designed the cybernetically-controlled wing harness used by [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] (Peter Parker during ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'') although he himself was unable to use it due to the weight. He is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, possessing a green belt in [[taekwondo]].

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the altered timeline of the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Hobie Brown serves as a technician in [[Luke Cage]]'s resistance.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #1-5</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified version of Prowler is seen during the ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' story "Crossover". He is depicted in a scene standing near the side of [[Tigra]] on the two page layout of the zombies.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #25</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel=== 
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Prowler is '''Aaron Davis''', the uncle of the second [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] (Miles Morales). He and his brother Jefferson Davis used to be partners in crime. Whereas Jefferson becomes reformed by marrying Rio Morales and having [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], Aaron's criminal activities continue and becomes the cat burglar known as the "Prowler". Prowler breaks into an abandoned OsCorp lab to steal a small red box and other rare items from a safe but OsCorp's genetically altered spider crawled into his duffel bag without his knowledge. Miles later visits his uncle's apartment and is bitten by the spider. After Miles passes out and regains consciousness, Jefferson forbids Aaron to spend time with Miles on account of his criminal life.<ref>''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'' #1</ref> During a visit to Mexico City, Aaron fights off Mexican crime boss [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] (Maximus Gargan). After their deal goes bad, he is detained by Mexican authorities. Returning to New York, Prowler interrogates the [[Tinkerer]] (Elijah Stern) about the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn). Realizing his nephew was bitten by an OsCorp spider, Prowler kills Tinkerer to keep this a secret. He then claims Tinkerer's various tech for himself: an electric suit, a winged suit and electric gauntlets. Davis uses his winged suit in a vain attempt to kill Scorpion. The next day, Davis confronts his nephew about being the new Spider-Man.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a). ''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #6-8. Marvel Comics. March - June 2012.</ref> Davis initially convinces Miles to assist him. But after they defeat Scorpion, Miles comes to realize that his uncle is exploiting him.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #9-11</ref> When Miles decides to sever their relationship, Aaron threatens to tell Miles's parents. They later get into a fight that results in Aaron's gauntlets exploding, killing him but not before telling his nephew that he's just like him.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a), Marquez, David (p), Ponsor, Justin (i).

Roxxon]],<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #28</ref> and Jefferson actually blames Spider-Man for his brother's death.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand #3''</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Spidermanep52.jpg|thumb|right|Prowler on the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series.]]
* The Hobie Brown incarnation of Prowler appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Tim Russ]]. In the episode "The Prowler", Hobie Brown works for the crime lord Iceberg (voiced by [[Lawrence Mandley]]) and was feeling he was not earning his fair cut for the work he was doing. When Iceberg discovered that Hobie was stealing from him, Iceberg's boys attempt to kill Hobie. After narrowly escaping that fate and discovering that his girlfriend had fallen in love with someone else, he knew he needed to get out of town. He stole [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s purse in order to fund his trip while she was in the process of apartment hunting. Brown was stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and sent to jail for violating his parole. While in jail, he saves [[Richard Fisk]] from an attempt on his life. As payment, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] arranges for a hot shot lawyer to enable Brown's release and gives him a special battle-suit. He took the battle-suit on a trial run and had a run-in with Spider-Man whom he managed to evade. He used the battle-suit to get revenge on Iceberg and overthrow him. There are strings attached, however, as Brown finds that a shock occurs in his suit when Kingpin contacts him and says that he will fix the suit if Prowler keeps working for Kingpin. Prowler sought out Peter Parker and told him his story since Peter knows how to get through to Spider-Man. It was discovered by Spider-Man that Kingpin has wired the suit to shock him if he disobeys and the suit's belt will detonate if he tampers with it. He and Spider-Man team up against Kingpin and destroyed the controls to the belt so it would not detonate and Prowler's suit is recharged. Brown gave up crime so he can have a chance at returning to a normal 'good' life.

* Hobie Brown appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Charles Duckworth]].
