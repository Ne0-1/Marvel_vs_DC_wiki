'''Hobie Brown''' is the original iteration of Prowler. He was born in the [[Bronx, New York]]. He was a bright but angry teenage [[African-American]] who got fired from his window washer job. Intending to use his engineering skills for personal profit, he devised a plan to steal items while disguised as a supervillain and then return them as Hobie.

Donning his green and purple "Prowler" costume for the first time, Hobie set out to rob the payroll office of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', figuring that that would garner him quick publicity. However, he was caught in the act by Peter Parker. While struggling with Peter, he drew the attention of editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Parker, with no way to defeat Prowler without giving away his own secret identity, contrived to get thrown through a window during the struggle, and used spider-powers to save himself once outside. Traumatized by the events, the shaken Hobie made his escape to the roof of the building, only to be confronted by [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man vanquished and unmasked Hobie, but realizing he was just a misunderstood kid (much like the web-slinger himself), Spider-Man gave him advice not to throw his life away as a criminal and to redeem himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #78-79 (1969)</ref> Hobie took this advice to heart and has since become a model citizen. Hobie later impersonated Spider-Man at the hero's request - Spider-Man wearing a webbing mask - to convince Peter's friends that he was not Spider-Man after Peter 'confessed' the truth while suffering delirium due to the flu, thus creating the impression that Peter had merely been confused.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #87</ref> Hobie became convinced that Spider-Man was involved somehow in police Captain [[George Stacy]]'s death, and unsuccessfully tried to bring Spider-Man to justice.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #93</ref> Hobie eventually married his love [[List of Marvel Comics characters: M#Mindy McPherson|Mindy S. McPherson]], and settled down into a career as a construction worker.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Brown began to look after his 'little brother' Manuel "Manny" Lopez as a part of the Big Brother Program. When Manny was murdered, Prowler believed the original [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Hector Ayala) was responsible and attempted to bring White Tiger to justice.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #21</ref> Prowler attempted to join the super-hero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] only to be tossed into the harbor by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] at which point he decided to retire his identity.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-64</ref> However, Brown's Prowler equipment is later stolen by the "Cat Burglar" to commit crimes for fashion criminal Bella Donna. Brown was eager to join the search for the thieves but Spider-Man insisted that he stay home so he would not get into trouble since the second Prowler had committed a [[felony murder]]. When the second Prowler was subsequently defeated by Spider-Man, the stolen equipment was returned to Brown.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man #47-48">''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47-48</ref>

Prowler later appeared in California during Peter's "Webs" book deal.<ref>story-arc around ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #304, 1988</ref> He is first seen attacking the [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]] (Raul Chalmers) for possession of a chalice, to keep Mindy out of prison. Mindy accepted a bookkeeping job at Transcorp New York. The company was caught in some shady stock deals and Mindy was set up and blamed for the crimes. Seeing only way to clear Mindy's name, Hobie re-donned his Prowler costume and found the books which Mindy had been blamed for stealing. He hid the books on an information chip and put the information chip on the chalice, where no one would look for it. Prowler and Spider-Man team up to take on the Black Fox in order to re-gain possession of the chalice. Hobie vindicated his wife of stock fraud charges with the help of Spider-Man and the Black Fox.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #305</ref>

Prowler later attempted to vindicate Spider-Man of a crime, and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and [[The Outlaws (comics)|the Outlaws]] (including rehabilitated villains like [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rocket Racer]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]).<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> His safety designs were stolen by [[Justin Hammer]]. Hobie proved the designs flaws during an encounter with Hammer's hirelings.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #9</ref> Hobie fought his brother [[Abe Brown (Marvel Comics)|Abe Brown]] (of the [[Sons of the Tiger]]) as an initiation test for Silver Sable.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> Prowler joined with Spider-Man and the Outlaws against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Space Phantom]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47</ref> Prowler was hired along with the Outlaws to retrieve a Symkarian nuclear device in England.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36</ref> Prowler then formally joined the Outlaws to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25, ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11, ''Web of Spider-Man'' #7</ref>

His costume and equipment were stolen by Nightcreeper, and Prowler then battled Nightcreeper and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''Prowler'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] #1-4, 1995</ref>

Later, Hobie was paralyzed during the Great Game.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #16</ref> In follow-up appearances,<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #16-18 (1997)</ref> he began regaining movement of his paralyzed limbs- evidence suggests that his paralysis was more a result of mental rather than physical damage, as he was feeling frustrated over the recent theft of his costume, eventually regaining full mobility.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #25 (1997)</ref> While recovering, Brown provided Spidey with a jetpack used when assuming the new [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] identity during the ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' storyline.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #27</ref>
 
Prowler was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] tie-in.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #6 (2006)</ref>

Escaping incarceration, he attended the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for [[Stilt-Man]], along with many other villains and former villains. Prowler narrowly escaped injury as Spider-Man and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] escorted him from the wake shortly before it was bombed by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #4 (2006)</ref>

When Peter Parker elevated [[Parker Industries]] into a global franchise with Spider-Man officially acting as a "bodyguard" as part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Hobie Brown is hired to act as Spider-Man in situations where the public would expect to see Peter and Spider-Man in the same place. Following the fight against [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]'s Pisces Sect, Peter tells Hobie to change into his Prowler costume and that they'll retrieve the Webware together before Zodiac undoes his encryption.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #1</ref>

Before ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline and crossover, wanting to know more about New U Technologies, Peter sent Prowler to infiltrate it. He ended up encountering the late Maxwell Dillon's revived girlfriend Francine Frye who is now the new [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. Prowler was chased around by Electro and was accidentally killed.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #17">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #17</ref> In the aftermath, Doctor Rita Clarkson took Spider-Man to where some people that were subjected to the New U Technologies treatment were being held.

[[Bella Donna (comics)#Belladonna (Narda Ravanna)|Bella Donna]] (Narda Ravanna) stole Hobie Brown's costume and equipment and hired the cat burglar that Spider-Man had originally fought long ago. As the second incarnation of Prowler, the criminal wears a simpler Prowler costume. He accidentally killed a guard during one of his crimes. This Prowler's silhouetted profile confused witnesses enough to have Spider-Man implicated in the murder. Eventually, Spider-Man captured both Bella Donna and this Prowler, cleared the original Prowler's name, and returned the stolen equipment to Brown.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man #47-48"/><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/catprowl.htm|Cat}}</ref> An unknown cat burglar was later seen at the "[[Bar With No Name]]" attending Stilt-Man's wake, identifying himself as the "Second Prowler". He had a brief fight with the original Prowler at Stilt-Man's funeral. Sometime after the original Prowler left, Punisher poisoned the guests' drinks and blew the place up.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #4</ref> It was later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]”.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #17</ref>

'''Rick Lawson''' is the third incarnation of Prowler. A medical intern, he stole a Prowler costume when Hobie Brown was brought in with a back injury. When Brown was brought into hospital, the costume was partly cut away to conceal Hobie's superhero identity, but friends were unwilling to risk moving Brown due to the back injury and so a portion of the costume was left that tipped Rick off. Having found Hobie's address from the medical files, Lawson stole another Prowler costume, using his new tech to both rob patients in the ICU and get revenge on those who had "wronged" him in the past such as a [[construction foreman]] who fired him when he needed the job to complete medical school. He ran into the Vulture, rejuvenated and attempting to kill all who knew as an old man, mistaking this Prowler for the original and unconcerned about the mistake. The Vulture managed to badly injure Prowler by slashing him across the chest with the wings, but was unable to kill him when Spider-Man interrupted the fight. As Spider-Man defeated Vulture, Rick was taken to the hospital and the Prowler costume was returned to Hobie (recovering from paralysis).<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #16-18</ref>

The fourth iteration of Prowler is a clone of Hobie Brown. [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] apparently revived Prowler with his memories intact. While learning about Jackal's mission, Prowler ended up becoming loyal and started acting as a spy to find out what Parker Industries is up to.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #17"/> It is revealed that this Prowler is a clone that Jackal had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1</ref>

After stopping a bank robbery that a clone of [[Madame Web]] foresaw, Prowler returns to New U Technologies to stop a fight between reanimation clones of [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], [[Massacre (Marvel Comics)|Massacre]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Montana (comics)|Montana]], and [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. Jackal reminds Hobie that he brought Hobie back to keep the reanimated supervillains in line and that he wants Hobie to warn him when he leaves the building so his technology does not go out into the world. Knowing how annoying it is to be stuck in the same location, Jackal assigns Hobie to take care of a potential hacker in San Francisco. When Hobie goes to get more information on the hacker from Madame Web, she tells him that she sees buildings filled with agony that cannot escape. After confronting his killer Electro, Prowler figures out Madame Web's precognition and goes to [[Alcatraz]] where he sets off a trap and gets caught in the process.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Hobie wakes up in a cell in Alcatraz and discovers that the hacker is Julia Carpenter who has been using leftover technology from the Shroud to investigate New U Technologies. Hobie angers Julia by severing the connection to stop her from looking more into New U Technologies. Back at the company, the villains are getting out of control, so Jackal sends Electro to find Prowler to put them under check again. Julia senses that Cassandra's alive from telepathic feedback resulting from Electro's attack. Prowler tells Julia what New U Technologies has accomplished and tries to get her to join them, but she refuses and escapes in a puff of black smoke. Prowler's body then starts failing, due to not taking his New U Pills for an extended period of time, as he questions what he is doing with his life. He is then confronted by Electro.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2 #2</ref> Prowler tries to escape Electro's wrath in Alcatraz, which proves difficult with her powers and his dying body. Using his weapons, the gift shop, and his strategic thinking, Prowler manages to defeat the simple-minded Electro. When he makes it outside, he is found by Julia taking him on her boat and heads towards New U Technologies to get his New U Pills.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

When Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 are escaping from New U Technologies, Prowler helped them out by diverting the cloned villains to another part of the city.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3</ref>

Julia helps Prowler break into New U Technologies and takes Prowler to his room to get his pills.<ref name="Prowler #4">''Prowler'' vol. 2 #4</ref> When Jackal orders the villains in the "Haven" part of New U Technologies to kill Spider-Man, Prowler works with Spider-Man to fight them off.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4</ref> When the alarm goes off and all the clones start breaking down from clone degeneration, Prowler leaves Haven and tries to find [[Doctor Octopus|whoever]] set off the system that has been killing the clones. Prowler runs into Julia and accuses her of being the culprit. He tries to defeat her and Julia is left no choice but to fight back. She knocks him down as Prowler's body continues deteriorating.<ref name="Prowler #4"/>

The clone assists the Jean DeWolff clone in helping Spider-Man get away from the villains. [[Kaine Parker]] later told Spider-Man that the clones of Prowler and Jean died in battle against the villains.<ref name="The Clone Conspiracy #5"/>

During the final battle, Prowler and DeWolff battle the villains outside. Hobie's body is rapidly decaying, but the two receive assistance from Earth-65 Gwen and Kaine. Gwen leaves Hobie in an alley when he proves too weak to continue, and he's found by the murderous Electro. Julia arrives and fends Electro off as she tells Hobie that Spider-Man stabilized the human and clone cells. When Electro gets the upper hand on Julia, Prowler sacrifices himself to stop Electro and dies in Julia's arms.<ref name="Prowler #5"/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Prowler's various iteration have no superhuman powers, but is naturally inventive, especially in the field of pneumatics, although he has no formal education in that science. Each one relies on a suite of technical gimmicks that he has created. Prowler wears modified coveralls interwoven with denim and stretch fabric, equipped with gas cartridge bracelets and anklets capable of propelling projectiles at high velocity. Their arsenal of projectiles include steel darts ("flechettes"), gas pellets, small explosives, magnesium flares and cleaning fluid. Prowler has been known to use hypnotic aids and conventional hand-held weapons. Each wears steel-tipped gauntlets for scaling walls, and shock absorbent foam rubber insulated boots. They also wears a cape which contains a network of pneumatic filaments which expand with air to give it a rigid structure, allowing him to glide for short distances.

A technological genius, Hobie Brown has also designed the cybernetically-controlled wing harness used by [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] (Peter Parker during ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'') although he himself was unable to use it due to the weight. He is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, possessing a green belt in [[taekwondo]].

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the altered timeline of the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Hobie Brown serves as a technician in [[Luke Cage]]'s resistance.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #1-5</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified version of Prowler (Hobie Brown) is seen during the ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' story "Crossover". He is depicted in a scene standing near the side of [[Tigra]] on the two page layout of the zombies.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #25</ref>

The Ultimate incarnation of Prowler is '''Aaron Davis''', the uncle of [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] (Miles Morales). He and his brother [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]] used to commit various crimes in their youth. Whereas Jefferson reformed by marrying [[Rio Morales]], Aaron never came around and becomes the "Prowler" cat burglar. Prowler breaks into an abandoned [[Oscorp]] lab to steal a small red box and other rare items from a safe but Oscorp's genetically altered spider crawled into his duffel bag without his knowledge. Miles later visits his uncle's apartment and is bitten by the spider. After Miles passes out and regains consciousness, Jefferson forbids Aaron to spend time with Miles on account of his criminal life.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #1</ref> During a visit to Mexico City, Aaron fights off the Mexican crime boss [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. When his deal with Scorpion goes bad, he is detained by Mexican authorities. Returning to New York, Prowler interrogates [[Tinkerer]] (Elijah Stern) about [[Norman Osborn]]. Realizing his nephew was bitten by an Oscorp spider, Prowler kills Tinkerer to keep this a secret. He then claims Tinkerer's various tech for himself: an electric suit, a winged suit and electric gauntlets. Davis uses his winged suit in a vain attempt to kill Scorpion.

When Iceberg discovered that Hobie was stealing, Iceberg's boys attempt to kill Hobie, narrowly escaping that fate but gets in an argument with his girlfriend Angela about Hobie's criminal life. Brown steals [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s purse but is stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and sent to jail for violating his parole. While in jail, he saves [[Richard Fisk]] from an attempt on his life. As payment, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] arranges for a hot shot lawyer to enable Brown's release then gives him a special battle-suit. Taking his battle-suit on a trial run, Prowler has a run-in with Spider-Man whom he managed to evade, and then gets revenge on Iceberg. After making Iceberg a servant, Prowler finds out there are strings attached as his suit has to be 'recharged' if Prowler keeps working for Kingpin. He also discovered that Angela had fallen in love with someone else, believing Hobie would never change. In his self-titled episode "The Prowler", Prowler sought out Peter Parker and told his story since Peter knows how to get through to Spider-Man.

[[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz]] and [[Montana (comics)|Jackson Brice]] were in the middle of selling him [[Chitauri|advanced]] [[Ultron|technology]] which is interrupted by Spider-Man. Spider-Man later confronts Aaron during his grocery shopping and webs his hand to the car where Spider-Man asks him where the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]'s men are going to be. Davis gives information about Vulture's latest sale with [[Mac Gargan]] in order to keep these weapons off the streets and protect his nephew. After Spider-Man leaves while stating that the webbing he is in will dissolve in hours, Aaron is annoyed at the fact that the ice cream he bought will have finished melting by then. A deleted post-credits scene shows Aaron trying to use his keys to get the webbing off his hand. After failing, he calls his nephew on the phone to apologize that he's "not gonna make it".<ref>http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/direct-mention-of-mcu-miles-morales-in-spider-man-homecoming-deleted-scene</ref>
