The '''Prowler''' is the name of three fictional characters owned by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

The first Prowler was a criminal turned superhero by the name of '''Hobie Brown'''. He debuted in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #78 (November 1969). Hobie Brown was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[John Buscema]] and [[Jim Mooney]], following a "suggestion" by a young [[John Romita, Jr.]]<ref name="">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #79 - inside front cover</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Hobie Brown===
Hobie Brown was born in the [[Bronx, New York]].  He was a bright, but angry teenage [[African-American]] who got fired from his job as a window washer. Intending to use his engineering skills for personal profit, he devised a plan to steal stuff in the disguise of a supervillain and bring it back as Hobie Brown, thus hurting no one and still becoming a noteworthy hero. 

However, when he donned his green and purple "Prowler" costume for the first time, he crossed paths with [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man vanquished and unmasked the Prowler, but realizing he was just a misunderstood kid (much like himself), he gave him advice to not throw his life away as a criminal and to redeem himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man''  #78-79 (1969)</ref> Hobie took this advice to heart and has since become a model citizen. Hobie later impersonated Spider-Man at the hero's request to convince Peter Parker's friends that he was not Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #87</ref> Hobie became convinced that Spider-Man was involved somehow in the death of police Captain [[George Stacy]], and unsuccessfully tried to bring Spider-Man to justice.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #93</ref> Hobie eventually married his love, Mindy S. McPherson, and settled down into a career as a construction worker.

Hobie began to look after his "little brother", Manuel "Manny" Lopez, under the Big Brother Program. When Manny was murdered, Prowler believed that the original [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] was responsible, and attempted to bring the White Tiger to justice.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #21</ref> Prowler attempted to join the super-hero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], only to be tossed in the harbor by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>''Defenders'' #62-64</ref> The Prowler equipment was later stolen by the "Cat Burglar", who became the Prowler II to commit crimes for the fashion criminal [[Bella Donna#Belladonna (Narda Ravanna)|Belladona]]. This Prowler was subsequently defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47-48</ref>

Prowler later appeared in California during Peter Parker's "Webs" book deal.<ref>story-arc around ''The Amazing Spider-Man''  #304, 1988</ref> He is first seen attacking the [[Black Fox (comics)#Black Fox (Raul Chalmers)|Black Fox]] for possession of a chalice, to keep his wife, Mindy, out of prison. Mindy accepted a bookkeeping job at Transcorp New York. The company was caught in some shady stock deals and Mindy was set up and blamed for the crimes. The only way to clear her name, Hobie re-donned the Prowler costume and found the books that Mindy was blamed for stealing. He hid the books on an information chip and put the information chip on the chalice, where no one would look for it. Prowler and Spider-Man team up to take on the Black Fox to take the chalice back. Hobie vindicated his wife of stock fraud charges with the help of Spider-Man and the Black Fox.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #305</ref>

The Prowler later attempted to vindicate Spider-Man of a crime, and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and the [[Outlaws (comics)|Outlaws]] (including rehabilitated villains like [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rocket Racer]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]).<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> His safety designs were stolen by [[Justin Hammer]]; Hobie proved the flaws in the designs during an encounter with Hammer's hirelings.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #9</ref> Hobie fought his brother [[Abe Brown]] (member of the [[Sons of the Tiger]]) as an initiation test for Silver Sable.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> Prowler joined with Spider-Man and the Outlaws against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Space Phantom]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47</ref> Prowler was hired along with the Outlaws to retired a Symkarian nuclear device in England.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36</ref> Prowler then formally joined the Outlaws, to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #25; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #7</ref>

His costume and equipment were stolen by Nightcreeper, and the Prowler then battled Nightcreeper and the Vulture.<ref>''Prowler'' [[limited series]] #1-4, 1995</ref>

Later, Hobie was paralyzed during the Great Game.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #16</ref> In follow-up appearances,<ref>''[[Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #16-18 (1997)</ref> he began regaining movement of his paralyzed limbs- evidence suggests that his paralysis was more a result of mental rather than physical damage, as he was feeling frustrated over the recent theft of his costume-,<ref>Regaining full mobility by ''[[Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #25 (1997)</ref> and later appeared, in costume, at a poker game hosted by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''[[The Thing (comic)|The Thing]]'' #8 (2005)</ref>
 
The Prowler was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in [[Ms. Marvel]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] tie-in.<ref>''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #6 (2006)</ref>

Escaping incarceration, he attended the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for [[Stilt-Man]], along with many other villains and former villains.  The Prowler narrowly escaped injury as Spider-Man and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] escorted him from the wake shortly before it was bombed by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #4 (2006)</ref>

===Prowler II===
In a story-arc seen around ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''  #47 (1980), a villain named [[Bella Donna#Narda Ravanna|Bella Donna]] stole Brown's costume and equipment and hired the cat burglar whom Spider-Man originally fought in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #30 to become a ''new Prowler''. That criminal, who wore a simpler version of Brown's costume, accidentally killed a guard during one of his crimes. Unfortunately, that Prowler's similar silhouetted profile confused witnesses enough to have Spider-Man implicated in the murder.  Eventually, Spider-Man captured both Belladonna and her accomplice, cleared his name and returned the stolen equipment to Brown.<ref>http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/catprowl.htm</ref>

He appeared in ''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #4, where he was seen at the "[[Bar With No Name]]" attending [[Stilt-Man]]'s wake, identifying himself as the "Cat Burglar." He had a brief fight with the Prowler, who was also attending Stilt-Man's funeral, calling the Cat Burglar an impostor. Sometime after the Prowler had left, the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] poisoned the guests' drinks and blew the place up. It was later mentioned in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (volume 2) #17 that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]."

===Prowler III===
In ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #16-18, a medical intern named Rick Lawson stole the Prowler costume when Brown was brought in with a back injury; when he was brought into hospital, his costume was partly cut away to conceal his identity, but his friends were unwilling to risk moving him due to his back injury and so a portion of the costume was left that tipped Rick off. With this costume, Rick both robbed patients in the ICU and get revenge on those who had 'wronged' him in the past, such as a construction foreman who fired him when he needed the job to complete medical school. However, he eventually ran into the Vulture, who was at the time rejuvenated and attempting to kill all who knew him as an old man; he mistook Rick for Hobie and was unconcerned about the mistake. Eventually, he managed to badly injure Rick by slashing him across the chest with his razor-sharp wings, but was unable to kill Rick when Spider-Man interrupted the fight. As Spider-Man defeated the Vulture, Rick was taken to the hospital and the Prowler costume was returned to Hobie, who began to recover from his current paralysis. After this event, Rick Lawson's current location is unknown; presumably he was sent to prison once he had recovered enough to stand trial.

==Powers and abilities==
Prowler has no superhuman powers, but is naturally inventive, especially in the field of pneumatics, although he has no formal education in that science. He relies on a "grab bag" of technical gimmicks that he has created.  The Prowler wears modified coveralls interwoven with denim and stretch fabric, equipped with gas cartridge bracelets and anklets capable of propelling projectiles at high velocity. His arsenal of projectiles include steel darts ("flechettes"), gas pellets, small explosives, magnesium flares and cleaning fluid. Prowler has been known to use hypnotic aids and conventional hand-held weapons. He wears steel-tipped gauntlets for scaling walls, and shock absorbent foam rubber insulated boots. He also wears a cape which contains a network of pneumatic filaments which expand with air to give it a rigid structure, allowing him to glide for short distances.

A technological genius, he also designed the cybernetically-controlled wing harness used by Peter Parker in the alter ego of the [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] during ''[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis]]'', although he himself was unable to use it due to the weight.

Hobie is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, possessing a green belt in karate.

[[Image:Spidermanep52.jpg|thumb|right|Animated Prowler on the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|''Spider-Man'' animated seres]].]]
* Hobie Brown appeared in [[The Prowler (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|an episode]] on the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|''Spider-Man'' Animated Series]] voiced by [[Tim Russ]]. He first appeared working for a crimelord called Iceberg and was feeling he wasn't earning his fair cut for the work he was doing. When Iceberg discovered that Hobie was stealing from him, he had his boys attempt to kill Hobie. After narrowly escaping that fate, he knew he needed to get out of town. He stole a passerby's purse in order to fund his new trip. It turned out to be Mary Jane's purse when she and Peter Parker are in the process of apartment hunting. Brown was stopped by Spider-Man and sent to jail for violating his parole. While in jail, he saves [[Richard Fisk]] from an attempt on his life. As payment, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] arranges for a hot shot lawyer to enable Hobie's release and gives him a special suit. He used the costume to get back at his old boss Iceberg. There are strings attached, however, and Hobie finds that the Kingpin has wired the suit to shock him if he disobeys, and its belt will detonate if he tampers with it. He and Spider-Man team up against the Kingpin and destroyed the controls to the belt so it wouldn't detonate and Prowler's suit is recharged. Hobie gave up crime so he can have a chance at returning to a normal 'good' life.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

* Hobie Brown appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' series as one of Peter's classmates. He, along with Pete and [[Harry Osborn]] try out for the school's football team, and makes the cut. A recurring joke in the series has him not having a speaking role, and is usually interrupted when trying to speak. [[Charles Duckworth]] voices Hobie when he has his first speaking role in the episode "Opening Night". His Prowler alter-ego has yet to appear in the series.

===Video games===
* Prowler made his video game debut in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'' voiced by [[Chris Gardner]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}} He is one of the many characters to help Spider-Man in fighting the invasion. He is one of the featured characters (besides [[Silver Sable]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]) to join [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before Spider-Man. He does not have a cape, but still has canister barrages.
