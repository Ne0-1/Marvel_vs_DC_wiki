'''The Prowler''' is a fictional character, a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] called '''Hobie Brown'''. He debuted in ''Amazing Spider-Man #78'' (November, [[1969]]). He was co-created by writer [[Stan Lee]] with artists [[John Buscema]] and [[Jim Mooney]]. 

==Biography==
Hobie Brown was a bright, but angry teenage [[African-American]] who got fired from his job as a window cleaner. Intending to use his engineering skills for personal profit, he intends to steal stuff in the disguise of a supervillain and bring it back as Hobie Brown, thus hurting no one and still becoming a hero. 

However, when he donned his red-and-black "Prowler" costume for the first time, he crossed paths with [[Spider-Man]]. Spidey vanquished and demasked Prowler, but realizing he was just a misunderstood kid (just like himself), he gave him advice to not throw his life away as a criminal and to redeem himself. Hobie took this advice to heart and became a model citizen.

==Notes==
Hobie is a valuable friend to Spider-Man. Most notably, he once impersonated Spidey after a sick Peter Parker had foolishly told his identity to [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Flash Thompson]], [[Mary Jane Watson]] and [[Harry Osborn]].

==Powers==
Prowler has no superhuman powers. He relies on a grab bag of technical gimmicks, most notably:
*Pellets filled with sleeping gas
*Steel claws for climbing walls
