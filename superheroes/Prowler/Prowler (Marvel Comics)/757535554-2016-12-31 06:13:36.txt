==Fictional character biography==

===Hobie Brown===
[[File:Amazing Spider-Man (Vol. 1) -78.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Prowler's (Hobbie Brown) debut. {{Descript-cvr|Amazing Spider-Man|1|78|November, 1969|pub=Marvel|art=[[John Romita Sr.]]}}]]
'''Hobie Brown''' was born in the [[Bronx, New York]]. He was a bright but angry teenage [[African-American]] who got fired from his window washer job. Intending to use his engineering skills for personal profit, he devised a plan to steal items while disguised as a supervillain and then return them as Hobie.

Donning his green and purple "Prowler" costume for the first time, Hobie set out to rob the payroll office of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', figuring that that would garner him quick publicity. However, he was caught in the act by Peter Parker. While struggling with Peter, he drew the attention of editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Parker, with no way to defeat Prowler without giving away his own secret identity, contrived to get thrown through a window during the struggle, and used his spider-powers to save himself once outside. Traumatized by the events, a shaken Hobie made his escape to the roof of the building, only to be confronted by [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man vanquished and unmasked Hobie, but realizing he was just a misunderstood kid (much like the web-slinger himself), Spider-Man gave him advice not to throw his life away as a criminal and to redeem himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #78-79 (1969)</ref> Hobie took this advice to heart and has since become a model citizen. Hobie later impersonated Spider-Man at the hero's request - Spider-Man wearing a webbing mask - to convince Peter's friends that he was not Spider-Man after Peter 'confessed' the truth while suffering delirium due to the flu, thus creating the impression that Peter had merely been confused.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #87</ref> Hobie became convinced that Spider-Man was involved somehow in police Captain [[George Stacy]]'s death, and unsuccessfully tried to bring Spider-Man to justice.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #93</ref> Hobie eventually married his love, Mindy S. McPherson, and settled down into a career as a construction worker.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Brown began to look after his 'little brother' Manuel "Manny" Lopez as a part of the Big Brother Program. When Manny was murdered, Prowler believed the original [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Hector Ayala) was responsible and attempted to bring White Tiger to justice.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #21</ref> Prowler attempted to join the super-hero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] only to be tossed into the harbor by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] at which point he decided to retire his identity.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-64</ref> However, Brown's Prowler equipment is later stolen by the "Cat Burglar" to commit crimes for fashion criminal Bella Donna. Brown was eager to join the search for the thieves but Spider-Man insisted that he stay home so he would not get into trouble since the second Prowler had committed a [[felony murder]]. When the second Prowler was subsequently defeated by Spider-Man, the stolen equipment was returned to Brown.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man #47-48">''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47-48</ref>

Prowler later appeared in California during Peter's "Webs" book deal.<ref>story-arc around ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #304, 1988</ref> He is first seen attacking the [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]] (Raul Chalmers) for possession of a chalice, to keep his wife Mindy out of prison. Mindy accepted a bookkeeping job at Transcorp New York. The company was caught in some shady stock deals and Mindy was set up and blamed for the crimes. Seeing only way to clear her name, Hobie re-donned his Prowler costume and found the books which Mindy had been blamed for stealing. He hid the books on an information chip and put the information chip on the chalice, where no one would look for it. Prowler and Spider-Man team up to take on the Black Fox in order to re-gain possession of the chalice. Hobie vindicated his wife of stock fraud charges with the help of Spider-Man and the Black Fox.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #305</ref>

Prowler later attempted to vindicate Spider-Man of a crime, and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and [[The Outlaws (comics)|the Outlaws]] (including rehabilitated villains like [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rocket Racer]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]).<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> His safety designs were stolen by [[Justin Hammer]]. Hobie proved the designs flaws during an encounter with Hammer's hirelings.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #9</ref> Hobie fought his brother [[Abe Brown (Marvel Comics)|Abe Brown]] (member of the [[Sons of the Tiger]]) as an initiation test for Silver Sable.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> Prowler joined with Spider-Man and the Outlaws against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Space Phantom]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47</ref> Prowler was hired along with the Outlaws to retrieve a Symkarian nuclear device in England.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36</ref> Prowler then formally joined the Outlaws to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25, ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11, ''Web of Spider-Man'' #7</ref>

His costume and equipment were stolen by Nightcreeper, and Prowler then battled Nightcreeper and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (Adrian Toomes).<ref>''Prowler'' [[limited series]] #1-4, 1995</ref>

Later, Hobie was paralyzed during the Great Game.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #16</ref> In follow-up appearances,<ref>''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'' #16-18 (1997)</ref> he began regaining movement of his paralyzed limbs- evidence suggests that his paralysis was more a result of mental rather than physical damage, as he was feeling frustrated over the recent theft of his costume, eventually regaining full mobility.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #25 (1997)</ref> While recovering, Brown provided Spidey with a jetpack used when assuming the new [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] identity during the ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' storyline.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #27</ref>
 
Prowler was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] tie-in.<ref>''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #6 (2006)</ref>

Escaping incarceration, he attended the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for [[Stilt-Man]], along with many other villains and former villains. Prowler narrowly escaped injury as Spider-Man and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] escorted him from the wake shortly before it was bombed by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #4 (2006)</ref>

When Peter Parker elevated [[Parker Industries]] into a global franchise with Spider-Man officially acting as his "bodyguard" as part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, he hired Hobie Brown to act as Spider-Man in situations where the public would expect to see Peter and Spider-Man in the same place. Following the fight against [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]'s Pisces Sect, Peter tells Hobie to change into his Prowler costume and that they'll retrieve the Webware together before Zodiac undoes his encryption.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #1</ref>

====Death and clone replacement====
Before ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline and crossover, wanting to know more about New U Technologies, Peter Parker sent Prowler to infiltrate it. He ended up encountering the late Maxwell Dillon's revived girlfriend Francine Frye who is now the new Electro. Prowler was chased around by Electro and was accidentally killed. [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] apparently revived him with his memories intact. While learning about Jackal's mission, Prowler ended up becoming loyal to him and started acting as his spy to find out what Parker Industries is up to.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #17</ref> It is revealed that the revived Prowler is a clone that Jackal had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1</ref>

After stopping a bank robbery that a cloned [[Madame Web]] foresaw, Prowler returns to the New U Technologies to stop a fight between reanimation clones of [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], [[Massacre (Marvel Comics)|Massacre]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Montana (comics)|Montana]], and [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. Jackal reminds Hobie that he brought Hobie back to keep the reanimated supervillains in line and that he wants Hobie to warn him when he leaves the building so his technology doesn't go out into the world. Knowing how annoying it is to be stuck in the same location, Jackal assigns Hobie to take care of a potential hacker in San Francisco. When Hobie goes to get more information on the hacker from Madame Web, she tells him that she sees buildings filled with agony that cannot escape. After confronting his killer Electro, Prowler figures out Madame Web's precognition and goes to [[Alcatraz]] where he sets off a trap and gets caught in the process.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Hobie wakes up in a cell in Alcatraz and discovers that the hacker is the current Madame Web [[Julia Carpenter]] who is been using leftover technology from the Shroud to investigate New U Technologies. Hobie angers Julia by severing the connection to stop her from looking more into New U Technologies. Back at the company, the villains are getting out of control, so Jackal sends Electro to find Prowler to put them under check again. Julia senses that Cassandra's alive from telepathic feedback resulting from Electro's attack. Prowler tells Julia what New U Technologies has accomplished and tries to get her to join them, but she refuses and escapes in a puff of black smoke. Prowler's body then starts failing, due to not taking his New U Pills for an extended period of time, as he questions what he is doing with his life. He is then confronted by Electro.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2 #2</ref> Prowler tries to escape Electro's wrath in Alcatraz, which proves difficult with her powers and his dying body. Using his weapons, the gift shop, and his strategic thinking, Prowler manages to defeat the simple-minded Electro. When he makes it outside, he is found by Julia, who takes him on her boat and heads towards New U Technologies to get his New U Pills.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

When Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 are escaping from New U Technologies, Prowler helped them out by diverting the cloned villains to another part of the city.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3</ref>

===Unnamed cat burglar===
[[Bella Donna (comics)#Belladonna (Narda Ravanna)|Bella Donna]] (Narda Ravanna) stole Hobie Brown's costume and equipment and hired the cat burglar whom Spider-Man originally fought in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #30 to be the second incarnation of Prowler. The criminal, wearing a simpler Prowler costume, accidentally killed a guard during one of his crimes. The second Prowler's silhouetted profile confused witnesses enough to have Spider-Man implicated in the murder. Eventually, Spider-Man captured both Bella Donna and her accomplice, cleared the original Prowler's name, and returned the stolen equipment to Brown.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man #47-48"/><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/catprowl.htm|Cat}}</ref> This Prowler was later seen at the "[[Bar With No Name]]" attending Stilt-Man's wake, identifying himself as the "Cat Burglar". He had a brief fight with the original Prowler at Stilt-Man's funeral. Sometime after the original Prowler left, Punisher poisoned the guests' drinks and blew the place up.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #4</ref> It was later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]”.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' Vol. 2 #17</ref>

===Rick Lawson===
The third incarnation of Prowler was '''Rick Lawson''', a medical intern that stole a Prowler costume when Hobie Brown was brought in with a back injury. When he was brought into hospital, his costume was partly cut away to conceal his superhero identity, but his friends were unwilling to risk moving him due to his back injury and so a portion of the costume was left that tipped Rick off. Having found Hobie's address from the medical files, Lawson stole another Prowler costume, using his new tech to both rob patients in the ICU and get revenge on those who had "wronged" him in the past such as a [[construction foreman]] who fired him when he needed the job to complete medical school. He ran into the Vulture, rejuvenated and attempting to kill all who knew him as an old man, the Vulture mistaking this Prowler for the original and unconcerned about the mistake. The Vulture managed to badly injure Prowler by slashing him across the chest with his wings, but was unable to kill him when Spider-Man interrupted the fight. As Spider-Man defeated Vulture, Rick was taken to the hospital and the Prowler costume was returned to Hobie (recovering from his paralysis).<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #16-18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Prowler has no superhuman powers, but is naturally inventive, especially in the field of pneumatics, although he has no formal education in that science. He relies on a suite of technical gimmicks that he has created. Prowler wears modified coveralls interwoven with denim and stretch fabric, equipped with gas cartridge bracelets and anklets capable of propelling projectiles at high velocity. His arsenal of projectiles include steel darts ("flechettes"), gas pellets, small explosives, magnesium flares and cleaning fluid. Prowler has been known to use hypnotic aids and conventional hand-held weapons. He wears steel-tipped gauntlets for scaling walls, and shock absorbent foam rubber insulated boots. He also wears a cape which contains a network of pneumatic filaments which expand with air to give it a rigid structure, allowing him to glide for short distances.

A technological genius, Hobie Brown has also designed the cybernetically-controlled wing harness used by [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] (Peter Parker during ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'') although he himself was unable to use it due to the weight. He is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, possessing a green belt in [[taekwondo]].

Prowler breaks into an abandoned Oscorp lab to steal a small red box and other rare items from a safe but OsCorp's genetically altered spider crawled into his duffel bag without his knowledge. Miles later visits his uncle's apartment and is bitten by the spider. After Miles passes out and regains consciousness, Jefferson forbids Aaron to spend time with Miles on account of his criminal life.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #1</ref> During a visit to Mexico City, Aaron fights off the Mexican crime boss [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. When his deal with Scorpion goes bad, he is detained by Mexican authorities. Returning to New York, Prowler interrogates the [[Tinkerer]] about [[Norman Osborn]]. Realizing his nephew was bitten by an Oscorp spider, Prowler kills Tinkerer to keep this a secret. He then claims Tinkerer's various tech for himself: an electric suit, a winged suit and electric gauntlets. Davis uses his winged suit in a vain attempt to kill Scorpion. The next day, Davis confronts his nephew about being the new Spider-Man.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a). ''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #6-8. Marvel Comics.

He becomes the punk-rock inspired Spider-Man, leading the downtrodden people of New York against Osborn's [[Venom (comics)|V.E.N.O.M.]] troops.

===Television===
[[Image:Spidermanep52.jpg|thumb|right|Prowler on the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series.]]
* The Hobie Brown incarnation of Prowler appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Tim Russ]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} In the episode "The Prowler", Hobie Brown works for the crime lord Iceberg (voiced by [[Lawrence Mandley]]) and was feeling he was not earning his fair cut for the work he was doing. When Iceberg discovered that Hobie was stealing from the crime lord, Iceberg's boys attempt to kill Hobie. After narrowly escaping that fate and discovering that his girlfriend had fallen in love with someone else, he knew he needed to get out of town. He stole [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s purse in order to fund his trip while Mary Jane was in the process of apartment hunting. Brown was stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and sent to jail for violating his parole. While in jail, he saves [[Richard Fisk]] from an attempt on his life. As payment, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] arranges for a hot shot lawyer to enable Brown's release then gives him a special battle-suit. He took the battle-suit on a trial run and had a run-in with Spider-Man whom he managed to evade. He used the battle-suit to get revenge on Iceberg and overthrow the crime lord. There are strings attached, however, as Brown finds that a shock occurs in his suit when Kingpin contacts him and says that the suit will be fixed if Prowler keeps working for Kingpin. Prowler sought out Peter Parker and told him his story since Peter knows how to get through to Spider-Man. It was discovered by Spider-Man that Kingpin has wired the suit to shock him if he disobeys and the suit's belt will detonate if he tampers with it. He and Spider-Man team up against Kingpin and destroyed the controls to the belt so it would not detonate and Prowler's suit is recharged. Brown gave up crime so he can have a chance at returning to a normal 'good' life.
