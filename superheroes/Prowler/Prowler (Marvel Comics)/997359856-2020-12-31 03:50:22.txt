The '''Prowler''' is an alias used by several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. These characters are primarily depicted as adversaries or allies of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. All incarnations wear a green and purple battle suit with a cape and clawed gauntlets. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[John Buscema]] and [[Jim Mooney]], the character was introduced in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #78 (November 1969); a 13-year-old [[John Romita Jr.]] came up with the character's name and costume, although only the name was ultimately kept.<ref>{{cite book |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |author-link=Tom DeFalco |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura, ed. |chapter=1960s |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2008 |page=139 |isbn=978-0756641238 |quote=Future Marvel artist John Romita, Jr. - who was thirteen years old at the time- came up with a character called the Prowler and sent a drawing to Stan Lee.}}</ref>

In the [[Earth-616|mainstream]] [[Marvel Universe]], the first and most notable character to assume the Prowler alias was [[African Americans|African-American]] teenager '''Hobart "Hobie" Brown''' who created the technology and started off as a petty thief, coming into conflict with Peter Parker as Spider-Man. After getting caught, he became grateful that the hero did not turn him in to the police and advised him to rethink his life instead, which he did; eventually ending up as one of Spider-Man's most viable allies and a superhero himself. Within this continuity, the Prowler identity was also briefly assumed by an unnamed [[Burglary|cat burglar]] (referred to as the "'''Second Prowler'''") and medical intern '''Rick Lawson''', both of whom were supervillains. In the alternate [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the Prowler alias was used by career criminal '''Aaron Davis''' using stolen equipment and was a recurring adversary of his nephew Miles Morales as Spider-Man until his eventual redemption. 

Both Hobie Brown and Aaron Davis have appeared in several media adaptations such as video games, though the former has primarily appeared in animated series while the latter has conversely made appearances in film, portrayed by [[Donald Glover]] in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and voiced by [[Mahershala Ali]] in the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018).

==Publication history==

The original and most well-known iteration Hobie Brown debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #78 (November 1969), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[John Buscema]] and [[Jim Mooney]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Matthew K. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura, ed. |chapter=1960s |title=Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2012 |page=49 |isbn=978-0756692360 |quote=In this tale written by [Stan] Lee and drawn by the team of John Buscema and Jim Mooney, window washer Hobie Brown became fed up with his dead-end job and used his inventive mind to craft the identity and weapons of the Prowler.}}</ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #79 - inside front cover</ref> The character eventually appeared in his own solo comic titled ''The Prowler''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=139}}</ref> The character was inspired by Romita's 13-year-old son [[John Romita Jr.]] who sketched a villain called the Prowler.

Several other characters have taken up the Prowler identity as well. The second version first appeared in ''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47 (October 1980), and was created by Stan Lee and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. The third version Rick Lawson first appeared in ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #16 (May 1997), and was created by writer [[Todd DeZago]] and artist [[Mike Wieringo]].

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] iteration Aaron Davis first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'' #1 (November 2011), and was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Sara Pichelli]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Hobie Brown===
'''Hobie Brown''' is the original iteration of Prowler. Born in the [[Bronx, New York]], he was a bright but angry [[African-American]] teenager who got fired from his window washer job. Intending to use his engineering skills for personal profit, he devised a plan to steal items while disguised as a supervillain and then return said items as Hobie. Donning his green and purple Prowler costume for the first time, Hobie set out to rob the payroll office of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', figuring that would garner him quick publicity. However, he was caught in the act by [[Peter Parker]]. While struggling with Parker, he drew editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s attention. Parker, with no way to defeat Prowler without giving away his own secret identity, contrived to get thrown through a window during the struggle, and used spider-powers to save himself once outside. Traumatized by the events, the shaken Hobie made his escape to the building's roof, only to be confronted by Spider-Man. Spider-Man vanquished and unmasked Hobie, but realized he was just a misunderstood kid (just like Peter once was), so instead of handing him over to the police, he advised him to rethink his life.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #78-79 (1969). Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Hobie took Spider-Man's advice to heart and gave up his criminal ways. He later impersonated Spider-Man at the hero's request - Spider-Man wearing a webbing mask - to convince Peter's friends that Parker was not Spider-Man after Peter 'confessed' the truth while suffering delirium due to the flu, thus creating the impression that Parker had merely been confused.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #87. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hobie was convinced that Spider-Man was involved somehow in Police Captain [[George Stacy]]'s death, and unsuccessfully tried to bring Spider-Man to justice.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #93. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hobie eventually married his love Mindy S. McPherson, and settled down into a career as a construction worker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #93. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Rovin |first=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher=Facts on File |date=1987 |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-1356-X |page=278}}</ref>

Hobie began to look after his 'little brother' Manuel "Manny" Lopez as a part of the Big Brother Program. When Manny was murdered, Prowler believed the [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Hector Ayala) was responsible and attempted to bring White Tiger to justice.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> Prowler attempted to join the super-hero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], only to be tossed into the harbor by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], at which point he decided to retire his identity.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-64. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, his Prowler equipment is later stolen by a cat burglar to commit crimes for fashion criminal Bella Donna. Hobie was eager to join the search for the thieves, but Spider-Man insisted that he stay home so he would not get into trouble, since the second Prowler had committed a [[felony murder]]. When the second Prowler was subsequently defeated by Spider-Man, the stolen equipment was returned to Hobie.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man #47-48">''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47-48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Prowler later appeared in California during Peter's ''Webs'' book deal.<ref>story-arc around ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #304, 1988. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is first seen attacking the [[Black Fox (Raul Chalmers)|Black Fox]] (Raul Chalmers) for possession of a chalice in order to keep Mindy out of prison. Mindy accepted a bookkeeping job at Transcorp New York. The company was caught in some shady stock deals and Mindy was set up and blamed for the crimes. Seeing it as the only way to clear Mindy's name, Hobie re-donned his Prowler costume and found the books which Mindy had been blamed for stealing. He hid the books on an information chip and put the information chip on the chalice, where no one would look for it. Prowler and Spider-Man then teamed up to take on the Black Fox in order to regain possession of the chalice. Hobie vindicated his wife of stock fraud charges with the help of Spider-Man and the Black Fox.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #305. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Prowler later attempted to vindicate Spider-Man of a crime and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and [[The Outlaws (comics)|the Outlaws]] (including rehabilitated villains like [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rocket Racer]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]).<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> His safety designs were stolen by [[Justin Hammer]]. Hobie proved the design flaws during an encounter with Hammer's hirelings.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #9</ref> Hobie fought [[Black Tiger (comics)|Black Tiger]] (a.k.a. his brother Abraham Brown of the [[Sons of the Tiger]]) as an initiation test for Silver Sable.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Prowler joined with Spider-Man and the Outlaws against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Space Phantom]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47</ref> Prowler was hired along with the Outlaws to retrieve a Symkarian nuclear device in England.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> Prowler then formally joined the Outlaws to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25, ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11, ''Web of Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His costume and equipment were stolen by Nightcreeper and Prowler then battled him and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (Adrian Toomes). This story also revealed that his brother is Abraham.<ref>''Prowler'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] #1-4, 1995. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Hobie was paralyzed during the Great Game.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> In follow-up appearances,<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #16-18 (1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> he began regaining movement of his paralyzed limbs- evidence suggests that his paralysis was more a result of mental rather than physical damage, as he was feeling frustrated over the recent theft of his costume, eventually regaining full mobility.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #25 (1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> While recovering, Brown provided Spidey with a jetpack used when assuming the [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] identity during the ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' storyline.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>
 
Prowler was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] tie-in.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #6 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> Escaping incarceration, he attended the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for [[Stilt-Man]] (Wilbur Day), along with many other villains and former villains. Prowler narrowly escaped injury as Spider-Man and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] escorted him from the wake shortly before it was bombed by the Punisher.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #4 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Peter Parker elevated [[Parker Industries]] into a global franchise with Spider-Man officially acting as a "bodyguard" as part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Hobie Brown is hired to act as Spider-Man in situations where the public would expect to see Peter and Spider-Man in the same place. Following the fight against [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]'s Pisces Sect, Peter tells Hobie to change into his Prowler costume and that they'll retrieve the Webware together before Zodiac undoes his encryption.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4, #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Before ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline and crossover, wanting to know more about New U Technologies, Peter sent Prowler to infiltrate. He ended up encountering [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] (Francine Frye). Prowler was chased around by Electro and was accidentally killed.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #17">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4, #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the aftermath, Doctor Rita Clarkson took Spider-Man to where some people that were subjected to the New U Technologies treatment were being held. The Prowler was among those people, as it turned out that he was not killed by Electro.<ref name="The Clone Conspiracy #5">''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Julia Carpenter later talks to the real Prowler, who just emerged from cryo-sleep, and tells him about his clone's actions.<ref name="Prowler #5">''Prowler'' vol. 2, #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hobie is then seen talking to Peter about his future, wondering which direction he will take. He then heads home, where he is last seen conflicted about his own identity.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2, #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hobie next attacks the F.E.A.S.T. Center, which was re-established by [[Aunt May|May Parker]]. He tells Spider-Man that he was investigating a crowdfunding group called Fairgray Pay after he funneled some money to help a sick friend, which never reached him, and broke into the center since it's almost wholly funded by the group. He and Spider-Man break into the company's head office with help from Marnie, Peter's neighbor known also as The Rumor.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #7-8. Marvel Comics.</ref> After an intense battle, Spider-Man, Prowler and the Rumor escape, with help from [[Captain America]]. Prowler is left in his home after being knocked out from the fight. He later wakes up to find that Spider-Man managed to defeat the head of Fairgray Pay with help from [[Iron Man]] who bought the company and turned into a division of Stark Unlimited. During their conversation, Prowler is offered a job as the new head of Fairgray Pay, which he quickly accepts.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #9-10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Second Prowler===
At one point, [[Bella Donna (comics)|Bella Donna]] (Narda Ravanna) stole Hobie Brown's costume and equipment and hired a cat burglar that Spider-Man fought a long time to become the new Prowler. During one of his crimes, Prowler accidentally kills a guard. Furthermore, the witnesses see his silhouetted profile and believe Spider-Man to be implicated in the murder. Eventually, Spider-Man captures both Bella Donna and the Prowler, cleared both his and the original Prowler's name, and returns Hobie's stolen equipment.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man #47-48"/><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/catprowl.htm|Cat}}</ref> This Prowler is later seen at the "Bar With No Name" attending Stilt-Man's wake, and calls himself the "'''Second Prowler'''". He has a brief fight with the original Prowler at Stilt-Man's funeral. Sometime after the original Prowler leaves, the [[Punisher]] poisons the guests' drinks and blows the place up.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]".<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Rick Lawson===
'''Rick Lawson''' is the third incarnation of Prowler. A medical intern, he was present when Hobie Brown was brought into a hospital due to a back injury. The costume was partly cut away to conceal Hobie's superhero identity, but his friends were unwilling to risk moving him due to the back injury, leading to Lawson finding a portion of the costume that was left unattended and deducing Hobie's identity. After finding Hobie's address from his medical files, Lawson steals a replica of the Prowler costume, using new tech to both rob patients in the ICU and get revenge on those who had "wronged" him in the past, such as a [[construction foreman]] who fired him when needing the job to complete medical school. He has an encounter with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], who seeks revenge against the original Prowler and nearly kills him, but Spider-Man interferes and defeats Vulture. Afterwards, Lawson is taken to the hospital and the Prowler costume is returned to Hobie (who is still recovering from paralysis).<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #16-18. Marvel Comics.</ref>
{{-}}

===Hobie Brown (Clone)===
The fourth iteration of Prowler is a clone of Hobie Brown. The [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Jackal]] cloned Hobie, with all of his memories apparently intact. After learning about the Jackal's mission, Prowler became loyal to him and started acting as a spy to find out what Parker Industries was up to.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #17"/> It is revealed that this Prowler is a clone that Jackal had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After stopping a bank robbery that a clone of [[Madame Web]] foresaw, Prowler returns to New U Technologies to stop a fight between clones of [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], [[Massacre (Marvel Comics)|Massacre]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Montana (comics)|Montana]], and [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. Jackal reminds Hobie that Hobie was brought back to keep the reanimated supervillains in line and that Hobie is wanted to warn when he leaves the building so his technology does not go out into the world. Knowing how annoying it is to be stuck in the same location, Jackal assigns Hobie to take care of a potential hacker in San Francisco. When Hobie goes to get more information on the hacker from Madame Web, he is told that of seeing buildings filled with agony that cannot escape. After confronting his killer, Electro, Prowler figures out Madame Web's precognition and goes to [[Alcatraz]] where he sets off a trap and gets caught in the process.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2, #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hobie wakes up in a cell in Alcatraz and discovers that the hacker is [[Julia Carpenter]] who has been using the Shroud's leftover technology to investigate New U Technologies. Hobie angers Julia by severing a connection from looking more into New U Technologies. Back at the company, the villains are getting out of control, so Jackal sends Electro to find Prowler to put under check again. Julia senses that Madame Web is alive from telepathic feedback resulting from Electro's attack. Prowler tells Julia what New U Technologies has accomplished and tries to get Julia to join them but refuses and escapes in a puff of black smoke. Prowler's body then starts failing due to not taking his New U Pills for an extended period of time as he questions what he's doing with his life. He is then confronted by Electro.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2, #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Prowler tries to escape Electro's wrath in Alcatraz, which proves difficult with Electro's powers and his dying body. Using his weapons, the gift shop and his strategic thinking, Prowler manages to defeat the simple-minded Electro. When he makes it outside, he is found by Julia taking him on a boat and heads towards New U Technologies to get his New U Pills.<ref>''Prowler'' vol. 2, #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 are escaping from New U Technologies, Prowler helped the two out by diverting the cloned villains to another part of the city.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Julia helps Prowler break into New U Technologies and takes Prowler to his room to get his pills.<ref name="Prowler #4">''Prowler'' vol. 2, #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Jackal orders the villains in the "Haven" part of New U Technologies to kill Spider-Man, Prowler works with Spider-Man to fight the villains off.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the alarm goes off and all the clones start breaking down from clone degeneration, Prowler leaves Haven and tries to find the [[Doctor Octopus|individual]] set off the system that has been killing the clones. Prowler accuses Julia of being the culprit. He tries to fight and Julia is left with no choice but to fight back, knocking him down as Prowler's body continues deteriorating.<ref name="Prowler #4"/>

The clone assists [[Jean DeWolff]]'s clone in helping Spider-Man get away from the villains.<ref name="The Clone Conspiracy #5"/> During the final battle, Prowler and DeWolff battle the villains outside. Hobie's body is rapidly decaying, but the two receive assistance from Gwen Stacy of Earth-65 and [[Kaine Parker]]. Gwen leaves Hobie in an alley when he proves too weak to continue and he's found by the murderous Electro. Julia arrives and fends Electro off as Hobie is told that Spider-Man stabilized the human and clone cells. When Electro gets the upper hand on Julia, Prowler sacrifices himself to stop Electro and dies in Julia's arms.<ref name="Prowler #5"/> Kaine later tells Spider-Man that the clones of Prowler and Jean died while fighting the villains.<ref name="The Clone Conspiracy #5"/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Prowler's various iterations have no superhuman powers, although Hobie Brown is naturally inventive, especially in the field of pneumatics despite no formal education in that science. Each one relies on a suite of technical gimmicks. Prowler wears modified coveralls interwoven with denim and stretch fabric, equipped with gas cartridge bracelets and anklets capable of propelling projectiles at high velocity. Their arsenal of projectiles include steel darts ("flechettes"), gas pellets, small explosives, magnesium flares and cleaning fluid. Prowler has been known to use hypnotic aids and conventional hand-held weapons. Each wears steel-tipped gauntlets for scaling walls and shock absorbent foam rubber insulated boots. He also wears a cape which contains a network of pneumatic filaments which expand with air to give it a rigid structure, allowing him to glide for short distances.

A technological genius, Hobie Brown has also designed the cybernetically-controlled wing harness used by [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] (Peter Parker during ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''), although he himself was unable to use it due to the weight. He is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, possessing a green belt in [[taekwondo]].

====Aaron Davis====
The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Prowler is '''Aaron Davis''', the uncle of [[Miles Morales]] and the brother of [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]]. Whereas Jefferson reformed by marrying [[Rio Morales]], Aaron never came around and became the cat burglar "Prowler." In his first appearance, he broke into [[Oscorp]]'s abandoned lab to steal a small red box and other rare items from a safe but Oscorp's [[OZ (Ultimate Marvel)|genetically altered spider]] crawled into his duffel bag without his knowledge. Miles later visits his uncle's apartment and is bitten by Oscorp's spider. After Miles passes out and regains consciousness, Jefferson forbids Aaron to spend time with Miles on account of his criminal life.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During a visit to Mexico City, Aaron fights off the Mexican crime boss [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. When his deal with Scorpion goes bad, he is detained by Mexican authorities. Returning to New York, Prowler interrogates the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] about the [[Green Goblin (Ultimate Marvel character)|Green Goblin]]. Realizing his nephew is Spider-Man, Prowler kills the Tinkerer to keep this a secret. He then claims Tinkerer's various tech for himself: an electric suit, a winged suit and electric gauntlets. Davis uses his winged suit in a vain attempt to kill Scorpion. The next day, Aaron confronts his nephew about being Spider-Man.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a).

Originally known as the Prowler, Hobie attempted to take on the Spider-Man identity after his world's Peter Parker was killed by the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]].

===Television===
* The Hobie Brown incarnation of Prowler appeared in a self-titled episode in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Tim Russ]].<ref name="BTVA">https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Prowler/</ref> This version worked for the crime lord Iceberg, but felt he was not getting his fair share. Iceberg discovered that Hobie was stealing from him and ordered men to kill Hobie, who narrowly escaped. After getting into an argument with his girlfriend Angela over his criminal lifestyle, Hobie attempts to steal [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s purse, but is stopped by Spider-Man and sent to jail for violating his parole. While in jail, he saves [[Richard Fisk]] from an attempt on the latter's life. As a reward, Fisk's father the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] arranges for Hobie's release and provides him with the Prowler battlesuit. While taking it on a trial run, the Prowler encounters Spider-Man, whom he manages to evade before exacting revenge on Iceberg. However, he soon discovers his Prowler suit has to be "recharged" every so often and return to the Kingpin to do so, demanding that the Prowler begin working for him in return. To ensure the Prowler's loyalty, the crime boss modifies the Prowler suit to electrocute Hobie if he tries to disobey, and its belt to detonate if tampered with. Hobie seeks out Spider-Man's help through Peter Parker, and the two join forces to defeat the Kingpin and fix the Prowler's suit, allowing him to safely remove it. Afterwards, Hobie reconciles with Angela and gives up his life of crime.
