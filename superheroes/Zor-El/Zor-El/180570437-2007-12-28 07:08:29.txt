'''Zor-El''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].  He is the brother of [[Jor-El]], husband of Allura In-Zee, father of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and uncle of [[Superman]].   Zor-El first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #252 (May 1959). 

==Pre-Crisis==
===[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-One]]===

In pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] continuity, Zor-El was a [[Climatology|climatographer]] on Krypton, and one of the only scientists to believe his older brother [[Jor-El]]'s predictions about the impending destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].  When the planet exploded, [[Argo City]] was somehow blown safely into space with a life-giving bubble of air around it (a later version of the story in ''Action Comics'' #316 (September 1964) has the city saved by weather dome that Zor-El had constructed).  The explosion had turned the ground beneath Argo City into [[Kryptonite]], but Zor-El and the other survivors covered the surface with sheets of lead.  The Kryptonians managed to keep alive for many years, and Kara was born a short time after the destruction of Krypton.  The end for Argo City came when a meteor storm punched holes into the lead sheeting, exposing the survivors to the deadly kryptonite radiation.  Zor-El managed to build a rocket and use it to send his daughter Kara to Earth. Fearing that Superman would not recognize her because he had left Krypton as an infant, Kara's parents provided a costume based closely on the Man of Steel's own. 

It was later revealed to Supergirl through Zor-El induced dreams that her parents had teleported away into the Survival Zone (similar to the [[Phantom Zone]]) during Argo's final moments.  Supergirl was able to rescue them in ''Action Comics'' #310 (March 1964), and Zor-El and Alura went on to live in Kandor.  When the bottle city was enlarged, Zor-El and Allura resettled on New Krypton/Rokyn.

===[[Earth-Two]]===
In the alternate universe of Earth-Two, Zor-L (note different spelling) sent Kara to Earth Two where she became [[Power Girl]].  This Zor-L was expert in psychology, and created a virtual reality chamber for Kara inside her spacecraft.  As she aged inside the rocket on her way to Earth-Two, she experienced the type of life she would have had on Krypton.  Zor-L and Allura were killed when Krypton exploded, as this Argo City was not blasted into space.  Zor-L only made one appearance, in ''[[Showcase]]'' #98 (March 1978).

==Post-Crisis==
In "The Supergirl from Kypton" story-arc in ''Superman/Batman'' #8-13 (May-October 2004), Zor-El rocketed his daughter away from Krypton before Kal-El left. It was expected that she would reach Earth first and could help raise Kal from his infancy. However, she stayed in stasis and her ship did not reach Earth until years later, so the infant she expected to help raise was a grown man when she arrived still in her teens.

After [[Lex Luthor]] uses Black Kryptonite to split Kara into good and evil parts, the evil Kara claims that Zor-El actually sent his daughter to Earth to kill his nephew, since he resented his younger brother and hated the idea of [[Jor-El]]'s lineage continuing past Krypton's destruction. Regardless of the truth or falseness of this, Kara has rejected this aspect of herself.

In the new ''Supergirl'' series, new information on Zor-El's history and relations are ongoing.

Zor-El was featured in issue 16 as he explained what truly happened to Kara, and why she was sent to Earth to kill Kal-El in a dream sequence. Zor-El was against the use of the Phantom Zone as a prison because he felt that it would become abused, since no blood was shed, it became a clean way to deal with criminals. In the Argo City area he lived in, he was a very trusted scientist, like his brother, Jor-El, and was working at this time on Sun Stones. He fought with Jor-El over the use of the Phantom Zone and tried to stop him from supporting it. Zor-El began to see that each time someone went in, something was also coming out, in the form of Phantoms. Using his Sun Stones, he could stop a Phantom.

As the story ended, the reason for sending Kara to Earth to kill Kal-El was revealed. The house of El was cursed by the phantoms as they saw them as the Jailors. Wherever one of the El blood line went, the Phantoms would follow. To save Earth, he needed to send Kara to remove Kal and stop the El blood line from ever growing. At the end of this story arc it was revealed that the images of Zor-El and the phantoms were all a rouse to see if Supergirl belonged in the New Earth universe by the Monitors. Upon discovering she was truly that universe's Supergirl she was left to her own devices to reconcile with all the people she harmed in the wake of the "test"

==Other media==
===Supergirl film===
[[Image:Kara11.jpg|100px|right|thumb|As he appears in ''Smallville'']]
In the 1984 ''[[Supergirl (movie)|Supergirl]]'' movie, Zor-El was played by [[Simon Ward]].

===Smallville===
Zor-El first appeared in the seventh season episode of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', "Lara". A replicant (portrayed by [[Christopher Heyerdahl]]), with his sister in-law [[Lara Lor-Van]] (portrayed by former Supergirl actor [[Helen Slater]]) returned in "Blue" due to a crystal technology developed by Zor-El. In the Smallville mythology, Zor-El and Jor-El were bitter rivals who refused to speak, specifically due to the actions of Zor-El. Jor-El confronted by his son,[[Superman|Clark]], in "Kara" reveals that Zor-El was a corrupt and evil branch of the "El" line and there was no reason for Clark to know that he was a relative of such a person.

In the episode, it's revealed that Zor-El loved Lara Lor-Van and that he despised [[Jor-El]] for stealing her away from him.

Zor-El appeared in the 8th episode of the 7th season "Blue" as a replicant, created by a few strands left in crystal technology, when he tricked Clark in to setting a blue crystal sent with Kara into the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. 

Zor-El's pictures from the episode "Lara" can be seen [http://www.kryptonsite.com/laragallery1.htm here].

=== Last Days of Krypton ===
The Zor-El of [[Kevin J. Anderson|Kevin J. Anderson's]] novel, ''Last days of Krypton'', is one of Krypton’s most accomplished scientists, second only to his older brother Jor-El.  Zor-El is also the political leader of Argo City, a coastal metropolis on a narrow tropical peninsula off the main continent’s southeastern shore. 

While investigating tremors originating in Krypton’s uninhabited southern continent, Zor-El discovers a new volcano, an indication of rising core pressure that could lead to the planet’s doom.  After the theft of Kandor by Brainiac, Jor-El is able to convince Commissioner Zod to sanction the construction of the Rao beam, which Jor-El and Zor-El use to relieve the pressure at the core.

When Zor-El discovers that Zod is consolidating power by kidnapping his most vocal opponents, he leads the cities of Krypton in a coordinated revolt against the dictator.   Knowing that Zod plans to lay siege to Argo City, Zor-El commissions the construction of shield generators around the city’s perimeter.  These shields are later used to save the city from the destruction of Krypton (though Anderson does not reveal whether Zor-El’s plan to save Argo City is ultimately successful).
