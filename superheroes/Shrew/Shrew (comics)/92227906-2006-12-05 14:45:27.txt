'''Shrew (Marilyn Maycroft)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. Her first appearance was in ''X-Factor I #79''.

Shrew formerly worked as one of [[Hell's Belles]], trained by [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]], and employed by a drug cartel. Tiring of this existenc perhaps after being arrested she turned in evidence against her old allies in exchange for being given immunity from criminal trial. She was to enter the witness protection program after her testimony, but when her old allies came after her, the US government commissioned [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] to protect her.

While [[Havok]], [[Strong Guy]], and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] watched over Shrew at the Barclay Hotel in Virginia, Hell's Belles and Cyber came after her. While X-Factor was occupied against her former teammates, Shrew was left to face [[Tremolo (comics)|Tremolo]].

X-Factor managed to temporarily drive off Hell's Belles, but Cyber had poisoned Strong Guy and demanded Shrew in exchange for an antidote. The US government's toxicologist provided his own antidote, and X-Factor and the Shrew confronted Cyber and the Belles. X-Factor joined by [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] overpowered their attackers, and Shrew herself gathered the courage to knock Cyber into the path of an oncoming subway train.

Apparently, Shrew lost her mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].
