A woman named Magda—pregnant with twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro Maximoff]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]]—takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the High Evolutionary, after seeing her husband [[Magneto (comics)|Magnus]] use his magnetic powers for the first time.
