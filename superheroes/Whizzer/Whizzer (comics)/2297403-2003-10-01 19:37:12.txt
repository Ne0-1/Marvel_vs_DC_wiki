The '''Whizzer''' was a minor character created for [[Atlas comics]] in the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]].

Dr. Frank and his son Bob are on a trip to [[Africa]]. While there, in the deepest jungles, Bob is bitten by a deadly [[Cobra (snake)|cobra]]. As the cobra turns on the good Doctor, a mongoose lunges at it from the bushes, landing atop it and killing it. Knowing that his son will not survive if a blood transfusion is not performed soon, Dr. Frank has the brilliant idea of taking the blood of the furry little [[mongoose]] and giving it to Bob. As Bob awakes, the strain proves too much for his father, who suffers a [[heart attack]] and dies. The mongoose blood, however, has given Bob amazing speed. Donning a gaudy yellow outfit, complete with fin atop his head and green cape trailing behind (later to be changed to a yellow and blue bodysuit), Bob calls himself the Whizzer!

The Whizzer lasted few issues in his own stories, appearing again in the All Winner's Squad at the end of [[1945]], and later in the Avengers, where he was killed. He has been reconned into the recent Invaders stories, and remains a favorite among Golden Age fans, even if only for his insane origin.
