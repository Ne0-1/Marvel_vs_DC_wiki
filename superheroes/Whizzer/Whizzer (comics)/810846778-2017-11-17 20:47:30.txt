'''Whizzer''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first character debuted during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] in ''[[USA Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1941), and was reintroduced in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (Aug. 1974). A second villainous version debuts during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), and a second heroic version debuting in ''The Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971).

==Publication history==
The first character named the '''Whizzer''' first appeared during the Golden Age of comics, and later appeared briefly during the Silver Age. The second, villainous version appears in the final panel of ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), the first chapter of a three-issue storyline by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]]. The story arc introduced the [[supervillain]] team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]], with the Whizzer based on the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72 – 73</ref>

==Fictional character biographies==

===Golden Age===
{{main|Whizzer (Robert Frank)}}

===Silver Age===
{{main|Speed Demon (comics)}}
The Squadron Sinister are created by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who are the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]]. The Whizzer, James Sanders, battles Avenger [[Henry Pym|Goliath]], but the fight is interrupted by the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron, who are abandoned by the Grandmaster.<ref>''Avengers'' #69 - 71 (Oct. - Dec. 1969)</ref> The Squadron reappear in the title ''The Defenders'', reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]]. The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] to melt the [[polar ice caps]], thereby covering the entirety of the Earth's surface in water. The [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon); [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] humiliates the Whizzer.<ref>''Defenders'' #13 - 14 (May - July 1974)</ref>

Afterward the Whizzer and his two remaining teammates are teleported off world by Nebulon, returning with an energy-draining weapon. The Squadron Sinister plan to threaten the Earth again but are defeated once more by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref> The character has another brief encounter with several members of the Avengers, who seek a way to separate the Power Prism of [[Doctor Spectrum]] from fellow Avenger the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref> The Whizzer disassociates himself from the Squadron Sinister and adopts a new costume and alias, [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]].

===Bronze Age===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme}}
Roy Thomas and penciller [[John Buscema]] created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]], who debut in ''Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat.<ref>''Avengers'' #86 (Mar. 1971)</ref> The characters including the Whizzer, whose name is Stanley Stewart, were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) "cover-blurbed" appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues.

As a result of exposure to the [[mutagenic]] effects of a fogbank of unknown nature, Stanley Stewart possesses superhuman speed, stamina, and reflexes. When moving at subsonic speed, the Stewart Whizzer can create cyclones (by running in circles); run up walls and across water. The character has limited immunity to the effects of friction (Stewart wears [[goggles]] to protect his eyes), although still generates normal fatigue poisons. As a result, Stewart must consume large amounts of [[calories]] and rest after using his superhuman speed powers extensively.

The heroic Whizzer and the Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually team together and prevent the use of the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141 - 144 (Nov. 1975 - Feb. 1976) & #147 - 149 (May - July 1976)</ref>  The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (comics)#Zhib-Ran|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then Thunder God Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref> The Squadron are mind-controlled by the entities the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and [[Null, the Living Darkness|Null the Living Darkness]], but are freed by the Defenders and aid the heroes in defeating the villains.<ref>''Defenders'' #112 - 114 (Oct. - Dec. 1982)</ref>

The character features with the Squadron Supreme in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1 - 12 (Sep. 1985 - Aug. 1986)</ref> The series also explains why there are the Squadrons Sinister and Supreme are similar: the Grandmaster creates the Squadron Sinister modelled on the already-existing Squadron Supreme of the [[Earth-712]] universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (May 1986)</ref> 
Gruenwald, Ryan, and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]] created a [[graphic-novel]] sequel<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989)</ref> which [[marooning|maroons]] the team in the mainstream Marvel universe. The Whizzer and teammates encounter the hero [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]], and relocate to the government facility [[Project Pegasus]]. After another encounter with the Overmind and a visit to the [[laboratory]] world of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]];<ref>''Quasar'' #13 - 16 (Aug. - Nov. 1990)</ref> the Whizzer participates in a "speedster" race organized by [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]] <ref>''Quasar'' #17 (Dec. 1990)</ref> attempts (with the Squadron) to return to their universe <ref>''Quasar'' #19 (Feb. 1991)</ref> and with fellow members [[Hyperion (Marvel Comics)|Hyperion]] and [[Doctor Spectrum#Joe Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]] battle the entity [[Deathurge]].<ref>''Quasar'' #25 (Aug. 1991)</ref>

The entire Squadron Supreme appear in a two-part story with the Avengers that finally returns them to their home universe, where they disband for a time.<ref>''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'' and the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (both Sept. 1998)</ref> The Whizzer rejoins his teammates to aid the [[Interdimensional being|interdimensional]] team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2, #77 - 78 (Apr. - May 2006)</ref>

The mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Whizzer, '''the Atlanta Blur'''. Also named Stanley Stewart, the character is a young [[African-American]] man who develops super-speed as a result of exposure to an alien [[retrovirus]].<ref>''Supreme Power'' #12 (Oct. 2004)</ref> He initially hides his ability, with the "Atlanta Blur" regarded as an [[urban legend]],<ref>''Supreme Power'' #3 (Dec. 2003)</ref> but when Hyperion is publicly revealed Stewart also goes public,<ref>''Supreme Power'' #4 (Jan. 2004)</ref> becoming a celebrity with numerous endorsements.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The James Sanders version of '''[[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]]''' appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jason Spisak]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} He is first seen in the episode "The Dark Avengers" as a member of the Squadron Supreme. In the episode "Terminal Velocity", Speed Demon infiltrates [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] with a special speed belt where he gets the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] trapped in the same speed frequency as he is while the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] were fighting Hyperion. While evading Hulk, Speed Demon was able to download some specific information from the Avengers Tower computers. After [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] was able to detect Hulk's plight, [[Iron Man]] was able to help Hulk destroy the speed belt. While pursuing Speed Demon out into the ocean, Hulk was able to throw Speed Demon into Hyperion, freeing the other Avengers from his vortex breath. Speed Demon was able to grab Hyperion as he gets away. Upon meeting with Nighthawk, Speed Demon gives the information he gathered from the Stark Tower computers. In the episode "Avengers' Last Stand", Speed Demon joins the Squadron Supreme in enacting Nighthawk's plot against the Avengers. In the episode "Avengers Underground", Speed Demon's speed belt is taken from him as he ends up trapped in a cube cell as Hulk gets even with him from the previous incident. After the Squadron Supreme are defeated, Speed Demon and the rest of the Squadron Supreme are mentioned to have been remanded to a special section of the Vault.
