The '''Whizzer''' is the name of several unrelated [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] characters in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Multiverse|multiverse]].

==Publication history==
=== Golden Age ===
{{main|Whizzer (Robert Frank)}}
The original Whizzer (Robert Frank) [[first appearance|debuted]] in ''[[USA Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1941), published by [[Timely Comics]]. Roy Thomas reintroduced the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Whizzer in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (Aug. 1974).

===Modern-day===
The first "modern-day" appearance of a character named the '''Whizzer''' (though unrelated to the original), was a debut in the final panel of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), the first part of a three-issue story by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]]. The story arc introduced the [[supervillain]] team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]]. DC's super-speedster [[Barry Allen|Flash]] found its analog in the new Whizzer.<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72â€“73</ref>

Thomas and penciller [[John Buscema]] then created an [[alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]] in ''The Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971), using characters that shared names with those of the Squadron Sinister. This caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) cover-blurbed appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact the Squadron Supreme appeared in both issues. This Squadron Supreme starred in an eponymous, 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and successive pencillers Bob Hall, Buscema, and Paul Ryan. ''Squadron Supreme'' focused on the exploits of the team in its home reality. Gruenwald, Ryan, and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]] returned to the characters in the [[graphic-novel]] sequel ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989). The team later featured in a two-part story across ''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'' and the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (both Sept. 1998).

Five years later, under the mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint, the 18-issue series ''[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]'' (Oct. 2003 - Oct. 2005), set in a different alternate universe, incorporated a character based on the Whizzer, but called the [[Blur (comics)|Blur]].

==Fictional character biographies==
=== James Sanders ===
{{main|Speed Demon}}
The villainous version of the Whizzer first appears as a member of the [[Squadron Sinister]], a supervillain team assembled by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions selected by [[Kang (comics)|Kang]] - the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. It was revealed years later<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = Squadron Supreme| Issue = 8| Date = (April 1986)| Publisher = }}</ref> that the Grandmaster created the Squadron Sinister based on the already existing Squadron Supreme, resulting in The Avengers meeting the "copies" first. Later, the Whizzer assists the original members of the Squadron Sinister and the alien [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] in an attempt to flood the Earth. This and a second plot are thwarted by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = The Defenders| Issue = 13-14| Date = (May & July 1974)| Publisher = }}</ref>

The Whizzer later has another brief encounter with several members of the Avengers, who are seeking a way to separate the Power Prism of [[Doctor Spectrum]] from the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = Avengers Annual| Issue = 8| Date = (1978)| Publisher = }}</ref> The entire Squadron Sinister then disappear into obscurity for many years, although the Whizzer eventually decides to return to crime. Wishing to cut ties with his old team, he first adopts a new costume and the alias [[Speed Demon]].

=== Stanley Stewart ===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme}}

In a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|universe parallel]] to the mainstream [[Marvel universe]], Stanley Stewart passes through a luminescent fog while jogging. Over the following weeks he discovers that he can run fast enough to break the [[sound barrier]]. 
Later, as part of the team called the [[Squadron Supreme]], he encounters four members of the Avengers who have accidentally crossed over into his universe.<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = The Avengers| Volume = 1| Issue = 85| Date = (Feb. 1971)| Publisher = }}</ref> At first he and his teammates treat the Avengers as enemies. Realizing this mistake, the teams put aside their differences to combat a threat concerning the whole of Stewart's Earth before the Avengers return to their own universe.<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = The Avengers| Issue = 86| Date = (March 1971)| Publisher = }}</ref>

Some time later the [[Serpent Crown]], an ancient artifact that exists in multiple realities, exerts its influence to take over his world. He and his team are used as pawns to oppose the Avengers when they again cross over from their home reality. As in their previous encounter, his team eventually teams with the dimensional travelers to thwart the global threat. He and his team are left to clean up their world as the Avengers return to theirs, taking the aspect of the Crown that is native to the Stewart's world with them.<ref>{{Comic book reference| Story = The Serpent Crown| Title = The Avengers| Volume = 1| Issue = 141-144 (Nov. 1975 - Feb. 1976) & #147-149| Date = (May-July 1976)| Publisher = |ID = }}</ref>

Stewart remains one of the core members of the Squadron Supreme, having remained with the team through many adventures, both in his home reality and others.

The team later crosses over into the mainstream Marvel universe to assist the Avengers against the villain the [[Nth Man]], and afterward finds itself unable to return to its own Earth-712 universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989) Marvel Comics</ref> The Squadron Supreme resides at the government facility [[Project Pegasus]] for a time before assisting the Avengers against the villain Imus Champion and then finding the means to return to its own universe.<ref>''Quasar'' #13-16 (Aug.-Nov. 1990)</ref><ref>''Quasar'' #19 (Feb. 1991)</ref><ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #5-6 (June-July 1998)</ref><ref>''Avengers / Squadron Supreme '98'' (July 1998) Marvel Comics</ref> The team briefly disbands on returning home.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' #1 (Sept. 1998) Marvel Comics</ref> The Whizzer and the team then briefly aid the team the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2, #77-78 (April-May 2006) Marvel Comics</ref>-->
