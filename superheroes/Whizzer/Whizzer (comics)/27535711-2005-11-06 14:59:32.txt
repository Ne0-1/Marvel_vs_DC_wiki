Several [[fictional character]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] have been known as 
the '''Whizzer'''. The name has been used by both [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s.

==Bob Frank==
The first '''Whizzer''' was a [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[superhero]] created for [[Timely Comics]], the 1940s predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]].  The character debuted in ''USA Comics'' #1 (August, [[1941]]), in a six-page story drawn by [[Al Avison]] ([[penciler]]) and [[Al Gabriele]] ([[inker]]).  Other superheroes introduced in the issue included Defender, [[Jack Frost (comics)|Jack Frost]], Mr. Liberty, Rockman and Young Avenger.

Dr. Emil Frank and his teenage son Robert were on a trip to [[Africa]], where young Bob was bitten by a deadly [[cobra (snake)|cobra]]. As the cobra turned on his father, a [[mongoose]] lunged at it from the bushes and killed it. Knowing his son would not survive if a [[blood transfusion]] were not performed soon, a desperate Dr. Frank used the blood of the mongoose. As Bob awakened, the strain proved to be too much for his father, who suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. The mongoose blood, reacting to his already [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] physiology, gave Bob amazing speed. Donning a gaudy yellow outfit, complete with a fin atop his head and green cape trailing behind (later to be changed to a yellow and blue bodysuit), Bob called himself the Whizzer.

The Whizzer lasted few issues on his own, appearing again as part of the [[All-Winners Squad]] in the (non-hyphenated) ''All Winners Comics'' #19 & 21 (Fall & Winter [[1946]]; there was no issue #20). He was later seen in modern-day stories as an older hero who briefly served with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He erroneously believed himself to be the father of the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]]. He died in ''Vision and Scarlet Witch'' #3; the twins learned the identity of their actual father, ([[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]), in the following issue.

The Whizzer was also [[retcon]]ned into the 2004 ''[[Invaders (comics)|New Invaders]]'' series, and was featured in the [[Spider-Man:_The_Animated_Series|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]] arc, "Six Forgotten Warriors".

== Stanley Stewart ==

While running alone on a country road, Stanley Stewart passed through a dense, luminescent fogbank. When Stewart emerged from the fogbank, he discovered that he could alter his perception of time so that the world appeared to be in slow motion. Every day after that Stewart found that he could run faster and farther than the previous day. Six weeks after running through the fogbank, Stewart broke the [[sound barrier]] while on a 200 mile sprint. It was at that point that Stewart decided to become a costumed crimefighter.  

Stewart originally wanted to call himself the Boomer, but instead decided to call himself the Whizzer at his wife Madeline's suggestion. He works with the [[Squadron Supreme]], in an alternate universe in [[Marvel Universe|Marvel]]. He is one of the few members of the team to be married (a wife named Maddy) and to have children (a daughter named Tina).

== James Sanders ==

:''Main article: [[Speed Demon]]''

James Sanders was a pharmacist and chemist, when the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] appeared and offered him the power of superspeed in return for joining the Grandmaster's [[Squadron Sinister]], he would later change his name to Speed Demon and join the villainous team known as the Sinister Syndicate. Many of his criminal acts have been opposed by [[Spider-Man]]. Recently, he joined the newly-reformed [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].
