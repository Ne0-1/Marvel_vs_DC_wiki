In a 2013 interview with [[Chris Hardwick]] of [[Nerdist]], creator [[Stan Lee]] said that Diablo was his greatest regret because he cannot remember the character, who he is, and why he did what he did.

==Fictional character biography==
Esteban Corazón de Ablo was a powerful alchemist in 9th Century [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]], who sold his soul to the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to lengthen his life far beyond a human span. Years later, Diablo set up a base in Transylvania, but the villagers there turned against him and buried him within a stone crypt under his castle. Another century later, the Fantastic Four appeared in Transylvania on a vacation, when a local, Baron Hugo, told them the legend of Diablo. That night, Diablo whispered to The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to awake and free him from his prison by pulling out the stone plug on his crypt and smashing the stone slab that covered him. Freed, Diablo offered a potion to the Thing that would turn him halfway into a human, and in exchange for Ben's services for a year, he would give him the other potion that would finalize the change. 
When the rest of the Fantastic Four arrived, they found Ben working for Diablo. They fought with him and tried to convince him to leave his service, but Ben refused, and the three were forced to leave him behind. Diablo soon made his appearance known to the world, and sold his alchemic chemicals internationally, making him the richest man on the planet. Shortly before the rest of the world, [[Mister Fantastic]] discovered that Diablo's chemicals worked, but only for a short while, before failing. The world turned on Diablo, but he had already built up an army of loyal followers and was prepared to use his alchemic powers to conquer the planet.

But once Diablo had revealed his true intentions, the Fantastic Four were free to attack him. At the same time, the Thing had also discovered that the potion he was given wore off, and he turned on Diablo, but Diablo used one of his chemical pellets to knock him out and seal him in an unbreakable, glass capsule. The remaining three members of the Fantastic Four soon attacked Diablo's fortress, but after a struggle, Diablo managed to capture them with his chemical pellets. Diablo sealed up the last of the Fantastic Four in the same capsules, but Ben quickly escaped when his broke down. Angered, he chased Diablo through his own castle, until he crushed a suit of armor into a giant ball, and threw it after him. Diablo ran from it, hiding within the crypt that the villagers had sealed him in. The Thing followed behind him and reinserted the giant, stone plug, and then smashed it with both fists, causing the entire castle to come crumbling down upon the crypt. The Fantastic Four were later freed, and the Human Torch melted the stone into slag to harden Diablo's prison.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #30</ref>

But Diablo eventually used his potions to destroy his melted, stone prison, and escape to revenge himself upon the Fantastic Four. His next move was to travel to North America and New York's State University, where he helped Professor Gilbert to animate his android creation, [[Dragon Man]]. He turned the Dragon Man against the Fantastic Four, but it eventually turned on him and drove both of them underneath a frozen lake, where he was lost for a time.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #35</ref> Diablo later reactivated the Dragon Man, creating a whole army of Dragon Men.  He was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], however.<ref>''Avengers'' #41-42</ref>

Diablo later clashed with [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #20</ref> He next took the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], captive. He took control of Terra Verde, but was ultimately defeated by the [[Human Torch]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #117-118</ref> Diablo later recruited [[Darkoth]] as a pawn to battle Doctor Doom, but was betrayed by Darkoth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #193-194</ref> Diablo later sent elementals to battle the Fantastic Four,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #232</ref> and battled [[Iron Man]] after that.<ref>''Iron Man'' #159</ref>

It was later revealed that Diablo had a romantic relationship with the woman who became the criminal [[Gilded Lily]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #21</ref> Diablo was freed from prison by Gilded Lily, though he turned against her and was defeated by [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>''Alpha Flight Annual'' #1</ref> Diablo later attacked the Fantastic Four, again using elementals against them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #306-307</ref> Diablo conquered the country of Tierra del Maiz, and in another clash with Alpha Flight, he was apparently killed.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #102-103</ref>

However, Diablo survived and reappeared again later.  He was later responsible for the destruction of the Fantastic Four's penultimate headquarters, Pier 4. He aided the Fantastic Four in driving the chaos demon [[Shuma-Gorath]] back to its home dimension.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Diablo has also fought [[Spider-Man]]. After escaping Spider-Man, he is approached by [[Kraven the Hunter|Ana Kravinoff]] who states that her mother would like to speak with him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #607</ref>

Some time later, he has become a subject of the new [[Night Thrasher]]'s interest.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #10</ref>

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, Diablo is present with Electro, Ana Kravinoff, Sasha Kravinoff, and [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] when [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] is sacrificed as part of a ritual that resurrects [[Grim Hunter|Vladimir Kravinoff]] as a humanoid lion creature.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #634</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Diablo is invited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his supervillain team where he promises them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Ever since Lily Hollister's baby was stolen by the Chameleon, Spider-Man had been going on a rampage against any villains involved. The police recovered a web ball containing [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], Diablo, and [[Overdrive (comics)|Overdrive]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Diablo is a practitioner of alchemy, science based upon the transmutation of elements, and has attained mastery of the alchemical sciences with his genius intellect. He was educated by tutors in ninth century Spain, and is self-educated in alchemy and modern sciences.

Diablo has extended his life and youthfulness. He can render the flesh of his face and body pliable, enabling him to alter his appearance, and can temporarily change his form to "nerveless protoplasm," rendering him invulnerable to certain forms of harm.

Diablo employs a huge arsenal of alchemical potions he has discovered or concocted, that he can conceal in hidden pouches and pockets within his costume. His alchemy, which can transmute elements through means unknown to modern science, enables him to control his own body, the bodies of others, or inorganic matter. His mixtures include nerve gas pellets, sleeping potions, a potion that renders a person inert by rapidly lowering their body temperature, pellets that make a person susceptible to Diablo's hypnotic commands, other potions and pellets that enable him to transmute inorganic matter, create explosive blasts and create beings known as elementals that are composed of ancient alchemical "elements" of earth, fire, air, and water. With few exceptions, all of Diablo's potions and pellets have only temporary effect. He also has alchemical potions which grant him teleportation.
