'''Druig''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], an ancient and powerful race of superhumans.

==Publication history==
==Fictional character biography==
In modern times, Druig served as an agent of the [[KGB]] in [[Russia]], and found that he enjoyed [[torture|torturing]] people. When [[Ziran the Tester]] came through Polaria, Druig planned to slay him using "the Weapon", which he had learned of by torturing his cousin [[Ikaris]], but Ikaris disintegrated Druig before he could fire the Weapon.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

His body was then recovered by the Celestials, and put into everlasting containment at the Desecration Annex.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Eternals (2006)===

More recently, Druig has reappeared in the new Marvel mini-series ''The Eternals'' written by [[Neil Gaiman]].  He is now deputy Prime Minister of Vorozheika (a [[fictional country]] to the northeast of [[Chechnya]], formerly part of the [[USSR]]) and is currently using the name "Ivan Druig". Druig hires [[Sersi]] to organise a party at the Vorozheikan embassy, asking her to invite wealthy guests and prominent scientists. He then arranges for armed men to storm the party, kidnapping the scientists and manufacturing a hostage situation - however, his troops betrayed him and he swiftly lost control of the situation. 

At this point, like [[Makkari (comics)|Mark Curry]], Druig's powers inexplicably "kick in".  Unlike Mark Curry though, he immediately gains some control over his powers. He has displayed a limited form of [[telepathy]], allowing him to view a person's most traumatic memory - and then immobilise them by forcing them to face that memory again. However, he does not appear to be able to read other memories from a target's mind. Druig also seems able to conceal his presence, by influencing the minds of others so that they do not see him - so far, the limits of this ability are unclear. 

Returning to Vorozheika, Druig then seizes control of an army unit and then quickly rounds up all heads of the government.  He then has all the people involved in the betrayal at the embassy dragged before him and the government heads, and gives the heads a choice.  They either kill a betrayer, or kill themselves.  After one government head tries killing Druig, and is then forced to kill himself, the other heads all turn on the betrayers.

He then leaves to find the other Eternals, and help them prevent the [[Dreaming Celestial]] from destroying the Earth.  In the end of the series, he remains absolute ruler of Vorozheika.
