'''Druig''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], an ancient and powerful race of superhumans.

==Publication history==
Druig first appeared in ''[[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]]'' vol. 1 #11 (May 1977), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #17-19 (November 1977-January 1978), and ''Thor Annual'' #7 (1978). After disappearing for some time, the character returns in ''Captain Marvel'' #5 (April 1996) and later reappears in the mini-series ''The Eternals'' written by [[Neil Gaiman]], in ''Eternals'' Vol. 3 #3-4 (November-October 2006), and #6-7 (January-March 2007).

Druig received an entry in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update'' #4 (2007).

==Fictional character biography==
In modern times, Druig served as an agent of the [[KGB]] in [[Russia]], and found that he enjoyed [[torture|torturing]] people. When [[Ziran the Tester]] came through Polaria, Druig planned to slay him using "the Weapon", which he had learned of by torturing his cousin [[Ikaris]], but Ikaris disintegrated Druig before he could fire the Weapon.<ref>Eternals #11</ref>

His body was then recovered by the Celestials, and put into everlasting containment at the Desecration Annex.<ref>The Eternals #6</ref>

===Eternals (2006)===
Much later, Druig is now deputy Prime Minister of Vorozheika (a [[fictional country]] to the northeast of [[Chechnya]], formerly part of the [[USSR]]) and is currently using the name "Ivan Druig". Druig hires [[Sersi]] to organise a party at the Vorozheikan embassy, asking her to invite wealthy guests and prominent scientists. He then arranges for armed men to storm the party, kidnapping the scientists and manufacturing a hostage situation - however, his troops betrayed him and he swiftly lost control of the situation. 

At this point, like [[Makkari (comics)|Mark Curry]], Druig's powers inexplicably "kick in".  Unlike Mark Curry though, he immediately gains some control over his powers. He has displayed a limited form of [[telepathy]], allowing him to view a person's most traumatic memory - and then immobilise them by forcing them to face that memory again. However, he does not appear to be able to read other memories from a target's mind. Druig also seems able to conceal his presence, by influencing the minds of others so that they do not see him - so far, the limits of this ability are unclear. 

Returning to Vorozheika, Druig then seizes control of an army unit and then quickly rounds up all heads of the government.  He then has all the people involved in the betrayal at the embassy dragged before him and the government heads, and gives the heads a choice.  They either kill a betrayer, or kill themselves.  After one government head tries killing Druig, and is then forced to kill himself, the other heads all turn on the betrayers.

He then leaves to find the other Eternals, and help them prevent the [[Dreaming Celestial]] from destroying the Earth.  In the end of the series, he remains absolute ruler of Vorozheika.  While he in fact despises the people of Vorozheika, seeing them all as beneath him, he gladly uses his position to send out people in his intelligence services to find other "unawakened" Eternals before Thena and Ikaris, so as to mold their mind in their weakened sate into following him, and using their combined forces to become the leader of the Eternals.

==Powers and abilities==
Druig possesses the conventional abilities of an Eternal; he can manipulate all forms of matter and energy, including the atoms of his own body. He can teleport, manipulate gravitons in order to fly, control the minds of others, and project energy from his body, usually from the hands or eyes
