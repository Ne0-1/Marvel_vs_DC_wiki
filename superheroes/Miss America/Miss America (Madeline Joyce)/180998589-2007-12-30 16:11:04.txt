<!--[[Image:Timelymissamerica.jpg|l|thumb|200px]] this image does not exist-->'''Miss America''' ('''Madeline Joyce Frank''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[superhero]]ine from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She debuted in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #49 (Nov. 1943), and was created by [[writer]] [[Otto Binder]] and [[artist]] [[Al Gabriele]] for [[Timely Comics]], the 1940s precursor of Marvel. 

==Publication history==
As superheroes began to fade out of fashion in the post-war era, [[comic book]] [[publishers]] scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant superheroines since [[Wonder Woman]] (created for one of [[DC Comics]]' predecessors, [[All-American Publications]]). These new female leads would include Timely's [[Blonde Phantom]], [[Golden Girl]], [[Namora]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel comics)|Sun Girl]], and [[Venus (comics)|Venus]], and its [[teen]]-[[humor]] star [[Millie the Model]]; [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]]' revival of [[Quality Comics]]' [[Phantom Lady]]; and DC's [[Black Canary]].

Following two appearances in ''Marvel Mystery'', Miss America received her own book, ''Miss America Comics'' (no cover date) in early 1944. Some sources list [[Ken Bald]] as the cover and interior artist, though [[Vincent Fago]], Timely's interim editor for the [[conscription|drafted]] [[Stan Lee]], recalled, "I hired a friend from the [[animation]] business, [[Pauline Loth]], and she did the art for the first ''Miss America'' book".<ref>Daniels, Les, ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'' ([[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]] 1991), p. 54</ref>

The series, however, changed format with its second issue to become the larger, [[magazine]]-sized ''Miss America'', though with the conventional comic-book combination of glossy covers and newsprint interior. Initiating this format as vol. 1, #2 (Nov. 1944), the publication relegated its superheroine to a secondary role and began focusing on [[teen]]-[[romantic fiction|romance]] comics stories plus articles on such topics as [[cooking]], [[fashion]], and [[makeup]]. This second issue — which featured a photo-cover of an unknown model dressed in the Miss America costume — also introduced the long-running, teen-[[humor]] comics feature "[[Patsy Walker]]".

Together with the single superhero comic, ''Miss America'' ran 126 issues in a complicated numbering that continued through vol. 7, #50 (March 1953), the 83rd issue. It then reverted to comic-book format as ''Miss America'' vol. 1, #51-93 (April 1953 - Nov. 1958). The magazine format had used photo covers of everyday teens. In 1951, starting with vol. #7, #40, 41, or 42 (information uncertain), the logo changed to ''Patsy Walker Starring in Miss America'', with covers now depicting [[high-school]]er Patsy, boyfriend Buzz Baxter and romantic-rival Hedy Wolfe in cartoon art by, variously, [[Al Jaffee]] or [[Morris Weiss]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:AllWinners21_detail.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Cover detail, ''All Winners Comics'' #21 (Winter 1946-47): In a superhero rarity, Miss America wears glasses.]]
Socially aware teenaged heiress '''Madeline Joyce''' was born in [[Washington, D.C.]].  She was the niece and [[ward (legal)|ward]] of [[radio]] mogul James Bennet<!--sp OK-->, who was sponsoring a Professor Lawson, a [[scientist]] claiming to have gotten superpowers through a device that had been struck by [[lightning]]. Joyce, secretly tampering with the contraption during a thunderstorm that night, herself gained the ability to fly and great strength after lightning similarly struck, knocking her unconscious (she originally had ''super'' strength, as well as other powers, but after her few early appearances they were [[retconned]] out). The panicky scientist, seeing the apparently dead young woman, destroyed the device and then killed himself. Joyce survived to fight [[crime]] as the [[patriotism|patriotically]] garbed Miss America, appearing regularly in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' and ''[[All Winners Comics]]''. 

In the latter, she was a member of Timely's superhero team the [[All-Winners Squad]] (hyphenated), fighting alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky]], the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]], the [[Sub-Mariner]], and the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] in the group's two Golden Age adventures. In the second of these, she wore glasses, one of the extremely few superheroes to require them. Miss America made her final Golden Age appearance in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #85 (Feb. 1948). 

Joyce was later revealed to have married fellow Golden Age superhero Robert Frank (the Whizzer).  Because the two had been exposed to radiation, their first child was the radioactive [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[Nuklo]]. However, Joyce died in childbirth with her second, stillborn child due to [[radiation poisoning]] from her first offspring.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Giant-Size Avengers]]'' #1 (Aug. 1974)</ref>  It was also suggested during this time that Joyce and Frank were the parents of Avengers members [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]], although this was ultimately refuted when it was revealed that [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his wife Magda were those twins' biological parents. Miss America was then [[retconned]] in 1976 as a member of the [[World War II]] super-team the [[Liberty Legion]], set between the creation of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and the post-war All-Winners Squad.

Miss America returned from the dead for 24 hours in the 2006 miniseries ''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'', where she was revealed to be spending an eternity in [[Hell]], and was depicted as a racist often in conflict with the late [[Anarchist (comics)|Tike Alicar]] of [[X-Statix]], whom she later found romance with when the two entered [[Heaven]] at the end of the comic.

==The Initiative==
In the ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]] Annual'' #1, a new version of the [[Liberty Legion]], known as the Liberteens, based in [[Pennsylvania]], debuted, one of their number calling herself ''Ms. America'', and possessing the same powers of flight and strength as the original Miss America.

==In other media==
===Television===
Miss America also appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[animated TV series]], as one of the "Six Forgotten Warriors". She was voiced by [[Kathy Garver]].

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=August 2007}}
Miss America was loosely adapted for the 1979 "[[Super Sentai]]" [[Japan|Japanese]] [[TV series]] ''[[Battle Fever J]]'' as part of the collaboration between Marvel Comics and the studio [[Toei Company|Toei]].  While retaining the name, the costume and character were both changed for the series.
