[[Image:Timelymissamerica.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]'''Miss America''' is a [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[superhero]]ine in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She debuted in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #49 (Nov. [[1943]]), and was created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[Al Gabriele]] for [[Timely Comics]], the 1940s precursor of Marvel.

Madeline Joyce was an heiress who gained superhuman strength and the ability to fly when a [[mad scientist]]'s device was struck by lightning.  The device and scientist were destroyed, but Madeline, as the patriotically garbed Miss America, went on to appear regularly in the pages of ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' and ''All Winners Comics''. She joined the short-lived [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superhero team, the [[All-Winners Squad]], and was made a member of the [[retcon]]ned [[World War II]] team, [[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]band its subsequent post-WWII iteration, the [[Liberty Legion]].

''Miss America'' was a Timely comic for years, although the Miss America character only appeared in the first issue; a model dressed in the Miss America costume would appeared in photograph on the cover of several subsequent issues.  Beginning with the second issue, superhero stories were discarded from ''Miss America'' in favor of making the series a magazine oriented toward teenage girls.  The long-running teen humor character [[Patsy Walker]] debuted in ''Miss America'' #2.

In the [[1970s]], Miss America was revealed to have married fellow WWII-era superhero Robert Frank, the [[Whizzer]], and to have had a son with him. However, Madeline died in childbirth due to [[radiation poisoning]] from their son, the radioactive [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[Nuklo]].  It was also suggested during this time that Madeline and Robert were the parents of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], although this was ultimately refuted when it was revealed that [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his wife Magda were their biological parents.

Miss America appeared in the [[1990s]] ''[[Spider-Man]]'' animated series, as one of the ''Six Forgotten Warriors''. She was voiced by [[Kathy Garver]].
