'''Menace''' ('''Lily Hollister''') is a supervillain foe of [[Spider-Man]]. Her first appearance as Menace is in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #549, which is the start of the second [[story arc]] in the ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' overarching storyline that follows the events of [[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Stealing a weapons cache of the original [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn), Menace was later being hunted down by [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]]. During Jackpot's search, she meets Spider-Man and reluctantly accepts his help. Menace then attacks a council meeting and kidnaps Councilwoman Lisa Parfrey, and [[Spider-Man]] and Jackpot attack her. Menace's glider slams into the rescued councilwoman, killing her, and Menace escapes the crime scene but not before accusing Spider-Man of being responsible for the woman's death.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #549-51</ref>

Menace later vandalizes campaign ads, and tries to find Bill Hollister, one of the candidates for the election. She says that she's been sabotaging his campaign for his own good against Randall Crowne, his opponent. Menace then proceeds to threaten the redeemed Norman Osborn, even recreating Osborn's original death by ramming him with his glider. However, Osborn survives the attack and Menace spares him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #570-71</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
Menace appears in the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Amazing Spider-Man'' miniseries, killing one of the invading [[Skrull]]s, and then setting her sights on Jackpot, believing her to be "Spider-Man's girlfriend" <ref>''Secret Invasion: Spider-Man'' #2</ref>. Their fight takes her into the path of one of the Skrulls, with Menace's glider exploding on contact. Menace survives, though badly injured, and limps away from the scene.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Spider-Man'' #3</ref>.

===Identity Revealed===
When Menace attacks a Hollister Rally, she manages to badly beat Spider-Man (who had earlier been shot through the arm) and claims a "citizen's arrest" to the arriving police. Menace then flies into the Hollister party headquarters, and changes into [[Harry Osborn]]'s girlfriend Lily Hollister, just before Harry walks in on her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #584</ref> She reveals to Harry that she found a hidden door in his closet and found an old former journal of his. She continues to tell him she uncovered the location of one of Norman's Osborn's secret rooms in the journal. When she had first gone in, she found all of the Goblin's equipment along with some experiments. After accidentally knocking over some experimental Goblin chemicals, she absorbed them into her skin, and is now able to transform into her "Menace" form at will. She explains that she orchestrated Menace's attacks against her father to give him more public support in the mayoral election. She then told Harry that she accepts his earlier marriage proposal.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref>

On Election Day, Menace attacks two police officers for arresting [[Carlie Cooper]] for a crime she didn't commit, then attacked Spider-Man when he appeared. Menace was about to finish him until Harry, as the Green Goblin, appeared and shot Menace with a serum, with Spider-Man giving her the full injection. This caused Menace to change back into Lily and was seen in a live broadcast, with her father watching in shock and in tears of this revelation. A few days after the event, with Bill Hollister as the new Mayor of New York, Lily is now in prison and was visited by Norman Osborn, who discovered the engagement ring given to her by Harry and his belongings and says to her "Welcome to the Family".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref> She is later seen released from prison and approaches Harry in her Menace form; telling him that she's "moved on". Harry believes that she has started a relationship with Norman and warns her that she will be disposed of once Norman's done with her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Extra!'' #3</ref>

===Dark Reign===
Lily reappears in her Menace form to Harry in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #595 (''American Son'' Part 1 of 5) threatening Harry's life at first, but then showing Harry that she is pregnant. After this, Harry calls Norman to inform him that he will be accepting his invitation to work for the Avengers, which highly upsets Peter Parker. Harry's real reason for joining is to steal a cure for the serum to use on Lily and the baby so they can be healthy. However she pushes him away, and reveals that it was all a ruse to make Harry become the hero American Son (who would be used to die in a tragedy to engender sympathy and support for Norman Osborn).  She also shows a new goblin form, with a decidedly more feminine figure, large full horns, and a green complexion. Lily reveals to Harry that he is not the father of the baby, and that Norman Osborn is.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
She is armed with a variety of bizarre portable incendiary devices in her shoulder bag and uses a Mark 7 Goblin Glider<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #571</ref> as a personal transport, until it was destroyed by Norman Osborn. She also uses concussion and incendiary Pumpkin Bombs. She originally wore bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic and cap. With her new form, debuted in American Son, she now wears a form-fitting bodysuit of an unknown material, with a helmet that has holes cut out for her horns.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref>

Exposure to an experimental version of the goblin serum has given Menace great physical strength. She was capable of overcoming Norman Osborn in a physical struggle, indicating that she has gained even greater strength than he had. This is further reinforced when Menace nearly beats an injured Spider-Man to death (although Spider-Man was not fighting at full capacity due to a bullet wound which he acquired shortly before the encounter). 

Menace is able to change from her human form to her enhanced form at will, although it takes a visible effort and is quite discomforting.
