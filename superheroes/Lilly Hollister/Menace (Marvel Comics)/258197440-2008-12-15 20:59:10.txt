'''Menace''' is a supervillain foe of [[Spider-Man]]. His first appearance is in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #549, which is the start of the second [[story arc]] in the ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' overarching storyline that follows the events of [[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]. He bears a strong resemblance to the previous [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] villains and uses one of the [[Goblin Glider]]s.

==Fictional character biography==
Menace's back-story, including his real name, remains largely unknown. Stealing a weapons cache of the original Green Goblin, [[Norman Osborn]], this Menace was later being hunted down by [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]]. During her search, she meets Spider-Man and reluctantly accepts his help. Menace then attacks a council meeting and kidnaps a council woman, and [[Spider-Man]] and Jackpot attack him. Menace's glider slams into the rescued councilwoman, killing her, and Menace escapes the crime scene but not before accusing Spider-Man of being responsible for the woman's death.

Menace later vandalizes campaign ads, and tries to find Bill Hollister, one of the candidates for the election. He says that he's been sabotaging his campaign for his own good against Randall Crowne, his opponent. Menace then proceeds to threaten the redeemed Norman Osborn, even recreating Osborn's original death by ramming him with his glider. However, Osborn survives the attack and Menace spares him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction.

===Secret Invasion===
Menace appears in the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Amazing Spider-Man'' miniseries, killing one of the invading [[Skrull]]s, and then setting his sights on Jackpot, believing her to be "Spider-Man's girlfriend" <ref>''Secret Invasion: Spider-Man'' #2</ref>. Their fight takes him into the path of one of the Skrull's, with Menace's glider exploding on contact. Menace survives, though badly injured, and limps away from the scene.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Spider-Man'' #3</ref>.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #588, the identity of Menace will be revealed.

==Powers and abilities==
He is armed with a variety of bizarre portable incendiary devices in his shoulder bag and uses a Mark 7 Goblin Glider<ref>[[Amazing Spider-Man]] #571</ref> as a personal transport, until it was destroyed by Norman Osborn. It is fast and extremely maneuverable. Other weapons he uses are concussion and incendiary Pumpkin Bombs. He wears bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cap, and mask. 

As he was capable of overcoming Norman Osborn in a physical struggle it must be inferred that he has superhuman strength just as Osborn does. Whether or not this is due to ingesting the Goblin serum, which he could have stolen along with the other goblin paraphernalia, has not been revealed.

There is evidence to suggest that Menace's mask may not actually be a real mask. During the aforementioned fight with Menace, Jackpot attempted to remove it, only to find she could not budge it, even with her enhanced strength. Later, however, [[Harry Osborn]] is shown having a bump on his forehead, from a fall he can't quite remember. This, and Norman's discovery about some Goblin paraphernalia stolen or tampered in the warehouse under Harry's place, may suggest a connection between Harry rebirth and Menace insurgence.
