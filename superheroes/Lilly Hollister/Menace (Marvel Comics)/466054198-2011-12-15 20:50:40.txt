'''Menace''' ('''Lily Hollister''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[villain]] and enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. Her first appearance as Lily Hollister is in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #545, and her first appearance as the costumed character Menace is in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #549, which is the start of the second [[story arc]] in the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" overarching storyline that followed the events of "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]".

==Fictional character biography==
Lily Hollister is the daughter of Bill Hollister, a candidate for the position of mayor of [[New York]]. While dating [[Harry Osborn]], she found a hidden door in his closet and found an old former journal of his, which detailed the location of one of [[Norman Osborn|his father's]] secret Green Goblin hideouts. When she entered the hideout, she accidentally shattered vials full of a new type of Goblin Serum that made contact with her skin, mutating her. Using weapons from the hideout, and calling herself "Menace", she targets her father's campaign, intending for him to gain the public's sympathy due to her attacks. Menace kidnaps Councilwoman Lisa Parfrey. [[Spider-Man]] and [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]] attempt to rescue the Councilwoman, but Menace's glider slams into the Councilwoman and kills her. Menace escapes the crime scene but not before accusing Spider-Man of being responsible for the woman's death.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #549-551</ref>

Menace then proceeds to threaten the supposedly redeemed Norman Osborn, even attempting to recreate Osborn's original death by ramming him with his glider. However, Osborn survives the attack and Menace spares him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #570-571</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Menace appears in the ''Secret Invasion: Amazing Spider-Man'' [[miniseries]], killing one of the invading [[Skrull]]s, and then setting her sights on Jackpot.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Spider-Man'' #2</ref> Their fight takes her into the path of one of the Skrulls, with Menace's glider exploding on contact. Menace survives, though badly injured, and limps away from the scene.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Spider-Man'' #3</ref>

When Menace attacks a Hollister Rally, she manages to badly beat Spider-Man (who had earlier been shot through the arm) and claims a "citizen's arrest" to the arriving police. Menace then flies into the Hollister party headquarters, and changes back to her real self, just before Harry walks in on her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #584</ref> She reveals to Harry the truth, and explains that she orchestrated Menace's attacks against her father to give him more public support in the mayoral election. She then told Harry that she accepts his earlier marriage proposal.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref>

On Election Day, Menace attacks two police officers for arresting [[Carlie Cooper]] for a crime she didn't commit, then attacked Spider-Man when he appeared. Menace was about to finish him until Harry, as the Green Goblin, appeared and shot Menace with a serum, with Spider-Man giving her the full injection. This caused Menace to change back into Lily, seen in a live broadcast, with her father watching in shock and in tears of this revelation. A few days after the event, with Bill Hollister as the new Mayor of New York, Lily was visited in prison by Norman Osborn, who discovered the engagement ring given to her by Harry and his belongings and says to her "Welcome to the Family".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref> She is later seen released from prison and approaches Harry in her Menace form; telling him that she's "moved on". Harry believes that she has started a relationship with Norman and warns her that she will be disposed of once Norman's done with her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Extra!'' #3</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Lily reappears in her Menace form to Harry in [[American Son (comics)|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #595]] threatening Harry's life at first, but then showing Harry that she is pregnant. After this, Harry calls Norman to inform him that he will be accepting his invitation to work for the Avengers, which highly upsets Peter Parker. Harry's real reason for joining is to steal a cure for the serum to use on Lily and the baby so they can be healthy. However she pushes him away, and reveals that it was all a ruse to make Harry become American Son (who would be used to die in a tragedy to engender sympathy and support for Norman Osborn). She also shows a new goblin form, with a decidedly more feminine figure, large full horns, and a green complexion. Lily reveals to Harry that Norman is actually the father of the baby.<ref name="AMS598">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref> She then goes to work for Osborn's Avengers in an unknown capacity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #599</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Lily is on the run from the law after Norman's fallout. It is also revealed that due to the time of conception there is a possibility that Harry is the father of her unborn child.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' # 1</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Lily crashes into Harry Osborn's coffee shop and gives birth to a baby boy. Soon after, she is attacked by a group of supervillains hired by Doctor Octopus who kidnap the baby.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Spider-Man manages to rescue the baby, but he is stolen again by [[Lizard (comics)|The Lizard]].<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #645">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref> Spider-Man manages to track him down only to have The Lizard willingly give the baby back to Spider-Man, as he ran tests to prove that Norman Osborn is not actually the father. Word of her child's safety (but not the paternity) gets back to Lily, who is relieved. She runs away because she feels she is unfit to raise the child.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #645"/> Spider-Man later tests Harry's blood revealing that he is in fact the father and leaves the child in his care.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Menace is able to change from her human form to her enhanced form at will, although it takes a visible effort and is quite discomforting.

She is armed with a variety of bizarre portable incendiary devices in her shoulder bag and uses a Mark 7 Goblin Glider<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #571</ref> as a personal transport, until it was destroyed by Norman Osborn. She also uses concussion and incendiary Pumpkin Bombs. She originally wore bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic and cap. With her new form, debuted in American Son, she now wears a form-fitting bodysuit of an unknown material, with a helmet that has holes cut out for her horns.<ref name="AMS598"/>

Exposure to an experimental version of the goblin serum has given Menace great physical strength. She was capable of overcoming Norman Osborn in a physical struggle, indicating that she has gained even greater strength than he had. This is further reinforced when Menace nearly beats an injured Spider-Man to death (although Spider-Man was not fighting at full capacity due to a bullet wound which he acquired shortly before the encounter).
