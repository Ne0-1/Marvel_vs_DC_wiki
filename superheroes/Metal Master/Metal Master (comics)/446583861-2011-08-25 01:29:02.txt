'''Metal Master''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
The Metal Master first appeared in ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 1 #6 (March 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Rampaging Hulk'' #3 (June 1977), ''ROM'' #30 (May 1982), and ''Maximum Security'' #2 (December 2000).

Metal Master received an entry in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #7 (2006).

==Fictional character biography==
Metal Master was an alien who can psionically control the atoms and molecules of metals.

When he came to Earth, the Metal Master attacked Gamma Base and defeated the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The Hulk returned with a plastic weapon; when the Metal Master's powers could not affect the gun, he was caught off guard and the Hulk easily beat him.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

The Metal Master returned to Earth again later, seeking large amounts of metals that [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#A|Astrans]] thrive on. There he encountered the [[Spaceknights|Spaceknight]] [[Rom (comics)|Rom]], and tried to control Rom's metal armor.  Rom resisted him, and the Metal Master was nearly driven mad by the thought of a metal that he could not control.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

Later, the Metal Master wound up in an intergalactic prison. During the events of [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]], Metal Master was one of the many aliens sent to Earth, and he fought the [[Scarlet Witch]].{{issue|date=November 2010}}

==Powers and abilities==
The Metal Master possesses the ability to animate and control virtually all known forms of metal. He can alter the shape and form of metals at will, forming complex objects out of them, levitate them, etc. One notable exception is Plandarium, the metal from which the armor of the Spaceknights of Galador is made (at least the cyborg armor, which is fused with his living cells is resistant, anyway). He could affect this Plandarium to some degree, but he could not control it as with other metals.
