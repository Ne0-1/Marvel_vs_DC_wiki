'''Metal Master''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Metal Master was an alien who can psionically control the atoms and molecules of metals.

When he came to Earth, the Metal Master attacked Gamma Base and defeated the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The Hulk returned with a plastic weapon; when the Metal Master's powers could not affect the gun, he was caught off guard and the Hulk easily beat him.

The Metal Master returned to Earth again later, seeking large amounts of metals that [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#A|Astrans]] thrive on.  There he encountered the [[Spaceknights|Spaceknight]] [[Rom (comics)|Rom]], and tried to control Rom's metal armor.  Rom resisted him, and the Metal Master was nearly driven mad by the thought of a metal that he could not control.

Later, the Metal Master wound up in an intergalactic prison.  During the events of [[Maximum Security]], Metal Master was one of the many aliens sent to Earth, and he fought the [[Scarlet Witch]].
