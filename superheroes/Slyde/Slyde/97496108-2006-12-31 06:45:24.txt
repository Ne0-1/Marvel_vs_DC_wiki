'''Slyde''' is the alias of '''Jerome Beacher''', a [[fictional character]] who is a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]] . His first appearance was in  ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #272. 

==Character history==

Jerome Beacher was a [[chemical engineer]] who created a [[non-stick]] coating that could be applied to anything. He created a [[costume]] coated in the substance and decided to use it to [[bank robbery|rob banks]]. His all-white bodysuit allows him to slide across floors with relative ease, and renders him impervious to [[Spider-Man]]'s webbing. The suit has pads on the gloves so that Slyde can grip objects without them slipping from his grasp. 
Slyde was part of the seventh such group called the [[Masters of Evil]] (Masters of Evil VII) when the villainous assemblage tangled with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], ironic because the Thunderbolts are mostly made up of reformed members of the Masters of Evil.

In ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' #26, Slyde was killed by the sword of [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] who was presumed dead/resurrected by [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]].

Slyde was apparently freed from his brainwashing by the Hand and returned to his criminal ways. He, along with the [[Trapster]], met with mob boss [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. Hammerhead was attempting to organize an organization of super-criminals to take advantage of the Civil War between the super-heroes, but Slyde balked at the proposal. He was shot in the back of the head and apparently killed by Hammerheads' enforcer Underworld, in order to send a message to those who would refuse to join Hammerhead's organization.
