'''Slyde''' ('''Jalome Beacher'''), is a [[fictional character]] who is a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #272. 

==Fictional character biography==
Jalome Beacher was a [[chemical engineer]] who created a [[non-stick]] coating that could be applied to anything, only to be fired by his employers. He created a [[costume]] coated in the substance and decided to use it to [[bank robbery|rob banks]]. His all-white bodysuit allows him to slide across floors with relative ease, and renders him impervious to [[Spider-Man]]'s webbing. The suit has pads on the gloves so that Slyde can grip objects without them slipping from his grasp. 

Slyde was part of the seventh such group called the [[Masters of Evil]] when the villainous assemblage tangled with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], ironic because the Thunderbolts are mostly made up of reformed members of the Masters of Evil.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Upon the realization that he was turning forty soon, he got a new costume, gave himself a new (and fictional) origin, and made an attempt at robbing a bank with henchmen—but it was all a ploy to lure Spider-Man out in order to fight him.. At the end of the story, on the way to jail, he mused that, knowing that he "went toe to toe with Spider-Man", he is entirely all right with middle age.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

In ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' #26, Slyde was apparently killed by the sword of [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] who was presumed dead/resurrected by [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]]. This was later revealed to be Jalome's stepbrother Matt, wearing Jalome's costume and using the Slyde identity while Jalome was in prison.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

===Civil War===
Slyde is among the army of villains recruited by [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] and his Thunderbolts to serve as "hero-hunters" during the events of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Jalome, as Slyde again, along with the [[Trapster]], met with mob boss [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], who was attempting to organize a group of super-criminals to take advantage of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] between the Marvel superheroes. However, Slyde balked at the proposal. He was shot in the back of the head and apparently killed by Hammerhead's enforcer [[Underworld (comics)|Underworld]], in order to send a message to those who would refuse to join Hammerhead's organization<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1 (February 2007)</ref>.

===The Initiative===
The identity of the current Slyde is unknown, but he appears in Jalome's costume and has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes. <ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref>. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>. Slyde's appearance however is not proof of his involvement in the Initiative, or may mean the Slyde costume has passed on to an heroic successor.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #602, a new version of Slyde appeared though the costume was now completely blue. After a brief chase with Spider-Man, it was revealed that Slyde was an undercover police officer.
