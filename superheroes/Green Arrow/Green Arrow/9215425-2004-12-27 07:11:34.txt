'''Green Arrow''' (Oliver "Ollie" Queen) is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Mort Weisinger]] and [[Greg Papp]], he first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #73 ([[1941]]).

Dressed like [[Robin Hood]], Green Arrow is an [[archery|archer]], who invents arrows with various special functions, such as a glue arrow, a net arrow, a punching glove arrow, etc. Originally, most of his other traits were borrowed from [[Batman]]. Like the caped crusader, Green Arrow was a millionaire, mentored a young [[sidekick]] ([[Speedy]]) and policed a fictional metropolis ([[Star City]]).

Throughout his first twenty-five years, Green Arrow was not a significant hero. But in the late [[1960s]], after he lost his fortune, writers gave him the unique role of streetwise crusader for the working class. In [[1970]], he was paired with the more law-and-order-orientated hero [[Green Lantern]] in a groundbreaking, socially conscious [[comic book]] series. Since then, he was been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban, gritty approach to the character.

==Inspirations==
The Green Arrow character was inspired by a few different sources, including [[Edgar Wallace]]'s ''[[The Green Archer]]'' (and the [[1940]] [[Columbia Pictures]] [[serial]] of the same name based on the novel) and [[Fawcett Publications]]' earlier archery-themed hero [[Golden Arrow]]. Green Arrow was also obviously created as an archery-themed version of the earlier character [[Batman]], as several similarities between the two characters can be spotted, especially in Green Arrow's earlier incarnation: Green Arrow has a teenaged [[sidekick]] named Speedy just as Batman has [[Robin (Batman)|Robin]]; Green Arrow and Batman are both millionaire playboys in their secret identitites; Green Arrow has an Arrowcar and an Arrowplane similar to Batman's Batmobile and Batplane; while Batman is summoned to police headquarters by the Bat-signal, Green Arrow is summoned by the Arrow-signal. The Arrowcar is yellow in color and shaped reminiscent of the land-speed record holder of the 1920s, the British [[Golden Arrow]]. 

==Publishing history==
===Beginnings===
Created in [[1941]] by writer/editor [[Mort Weisinger]] and artist [[George Papp]], who remained with the series for almost twenty years, Green Arrow and Speedy first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #73 ([[Periodical cover date|cover-dated]] November [[1941]]). 

Incidentally, another Mort Weisiner-created character called [[Aquaman]] also appeared for the first time in that issue, and these two back-up features continued to run concurrently in ''More Fun Comics'' until the mid-[[1940s]], and then in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' from [[1946]] until [[1960]]. Green Arrow and Speedy also appeared in various issues of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' until issue #140 ([[1964]]). The Green Arrow and Speedy feature was one of five back-up features to be promoted in one of the earliest team-up books, ''[[Leading Comics]].''

Green Arrow was one of the few DC characters to keep going after the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. The longevity of the character was due to the influence of creator Mort Weisinger, who kept Green Arrow and Aquaman as back-up features to the headlining [[Superboy]] feature first in ''More Fun Comics'' and then ''Adventure Comics''. The Green Arrow and Speedy feature had a relatively undistinguished publishing history, though the main exception in this period was a short run in [[1958]] by [[Jack Kirby]]. 

After the last original Green Arrow and Speedy features in the early [[1960s]], Green Arrow was made the first non-charter member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], a team which guaranteed the character's being continually featured, in some way or another, continuously until [[1998]].

===Neal Adams and Dennis O'Neil===

In [[1969]] artist [[Neal Adams]] decided to update the character's visual appearance by giving him a [[goatee]] beard and costume of his own design. Inspired by Adams' redesign, writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] followed up on Green Arrow's new appearance by completely remaking the character's attitude in the pages of ''Justice League of America'' #79 ([[Periodical cover date|cover-dated]] November 1969), giving his personality a rougher edge like that of [[Marvel Comics]]' archery-themed hero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. This revision was explained by having Oliver Queen lose his fortune and become an outspoken and strident advocate of the underprivileged in society and the political left wing. In short, he became a kind of superhero cross between [[Robin Hood]] and [[Abbie Hoffman]]. In addition, the Green Arrow began a long running romantic relationship with [[The Black Canary]]. As a member of the [[Justice League]], he became an argumentative figure who tended to get on the others' nerves while in his better moments, acted as the political conscience of the team.

In the early [[1970s]], he became a co-feature with [[Green Lantern]] in the latter's series in an acclaimed, but shortlived series of stories by O'Neil and Adams that dealt with various social and political issues in which Green Arrow spoke for the [[liberal]] argument (and thus a voice for O'Neil himself) and Green Lantern was a half-hearted [[conservative]] advocate. In addition, Queen got a job as a [[newspaper]] [[reporter]] which allowed him to articulate his political beliefs in a more public field. It was durign this period that the most famous Green Arrow story of all time appeared, in ''Green Lantern'' #85-86, when it was revealed that Speedy was addicted to heroin.

In [[1984]] Green Arrow appeared for the first time in his own comic book, a four issue [[miniseries]].

Green Arrow has a small role in [[Frank Miller]]'s [[1986]] [[dystopia]]n [[Batman]] story, ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]],'' in which he has recently been released from prison, is bald, and has lost his left arm and carries a grudge against [[Superman]] for it. Batman has him shoot a single [[Kryptonite]] arrow at Superman; Green Arrow draws the bowstring with his teeth.

===Mike Grell to Chuck Dixon===
In [[1987]], the character was changed once more in ''Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters'', written and illustrated by [[Mike Grell]]. In this three-issue [[prestige format]] mini-series, Green Arrow abandons his gadget arrows and fights crime in [[Seattle, Washington]]; the series took on a more gritty, violent, and urban tone. ''The Longbow Hunters'' mini-series led to a long-running regular series (''Green Arrow'' volume 2), which Grell wrote for 80 issues. Grell tried to write Green Arrow as a 'realistic' real world character, purging the world of any superhero characteristics. Green Arrow lost his mask a couple of issues into the regular series when someone pointed out it did not disguise his identity at all, Black Canary remained his partner for most of the series but she lost her 'sonic scream' superpower and when Hal Jordan visited no mention was made or seen of his Green Lantern powers. 

Under later writers, such as [[Kelley Puckett]], [[Kevin Dooley]], and [[Chuck Dixon]], the fantastic elements of the DC Universe were re-introduced. The series eventually included Oliver Queen's death and replacement by his son '''Connor Hawke'''. Oliver's death scene plays tribute to his character seen in [[The Dark Knight Returns]].  In Dark Knight Oliver is bitter at Superman for an undetailed incident that lead to Oliver losing his arm. here Superman is about to rescue Oliver from certain death by removing his arm, but Ollie refuses to let him.

Connor starred in the series (as "Green Arrow II") from issue 102 until issue 137, when it was canceled.

===The 21st Century===
In [[2000]], Oliver Queen was revived in a new ''Green Arrow'' series, written by [[Kevin Smith]] and illustrated by [[Phil Hester]] and [[Ande Parks]]. Smith's storyline returned the character to life from a point before the Mike Grell period, although the world around him still reflected the changes that had taken place &mdash; for example, the introduction of [[Wally West]], [[Kyle Rayner]] and Connor Hawke to replace [[Barry Allen]], [[Hal Jordan]], and Queen himself, respectively. Smith's fifteen issues were followed by a story arc by [[Brad Meltzer]], who in [[2002]] handed the title over to [[Judd Winick]]. Hester and Parks remained as the art team throughout these changes.

One of Winick's most-publicized innovations was to reveal that Mia Dearden, a former prostitute unofficially adopted by Green Arrow during Kevin Smith's run, had tested positive for [[HIV]]. Winick had published a [[graphic novel]] ([[Pedro and Me]]) about a [[gay]] friend who died of HIV/[[AIDS]], and subsequently wrote a ''Green Lantern'' storyline about [[homophobia]], so some critics have [[pigeonhole]]d him as a writer of social-commentary storylines, or for being overly didactic. Others feel that Mia's diagnosis is merely a gimmick to increase sales. Winick argues that his writing range is wider than simple [[liberal]] [[propaganda]], that socially relevant storylines are part of the Green Arrow tradition, and that he intends to show Mia living a normal life, "living with HIV, as many people do."

Green Arrow also appears in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' cartoon series.  He is voiced by [[Kin Shriner]].

==Secret origins==
The character Green Arrow has had several official "secret origins" attributed to it.

Washed overboard on an ocean cruise, the wealthy Oliver Queen lived like [[Robinson Crusoe]] on a desert island, hunting with a bow. When criminals came to the island, he captured them and returned to civilization.
