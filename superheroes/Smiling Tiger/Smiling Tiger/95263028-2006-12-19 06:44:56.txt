'''Smiling Tiger''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. 

==History==
During the [[Vietnam war]] Smiling Tiger's father Collier Mack served in the Army recon unit nicknamed the Half-Fulls along with [[Left Hand (comics)|Diego Casseas]] and the fathers of the other members of the [[Folding Circle]]. After stumbling upon the Dragon's Breadth cult in Cambodia the soldiers encountered Tai who then demanded they marry the 6 remaining daughters of the Dragon's Breadth's breeding program.

Whether Collier or his wife played a part in Smiling Tiger's childhood is unknown. Smiling Tiger appears to have long blades in place of his finger nails and toe nails. He is mute and tends to act as if he is a [[feral]] animal. His degree of intelligence has never been explored.

Smiling Tiger was recruited by the Left Hand to join the Folding Circle in his bid to gain the power of the Dragon's Breadth cult. After a confrontation with Tai and the [[New Warriors]] the Folding Circle stole the [[quinjet]] the New Warriors had originally stolen from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The Folding Circle crashed in [[Madripoor]] and tried to become players in the Madripoor underworld.

Disappearing into comic Limbo for several years, Smiling Tiger was brought back during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event and forced to join the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. 

===Universal Wellspring===
Smiling Tiger is not a mutant, he is a mutate like the rest of the [[Folding Circle]] as well as [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]],  [[Midnight's Fire]], [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]], and [[Speed Demon]]. His powers come from the ''Universal Wellspring'' as seen in [[Thunderbolts]] #107.
