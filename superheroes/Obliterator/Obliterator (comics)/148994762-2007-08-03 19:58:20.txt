The '''Obliterator''' is a [[fictional character]], an alien [[supervillain]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]], a foe of the [[Silver Surfer]].

==Fictional character biography==
Decided to track down and kill every other member of his race. Eventually accomplishing his "mission," he wandered the galaxies searching for other things to kill, when the Elder known as [[Gardener (comics)|the Gardener]] introduced the Obliterator to the other [[Elders of the Universe|Elders]].

Some time later, a number of Elders came up with the plan to kill [[Galactus]] to start a new Big Bang, and the Obliterator was on hand to try to kill the interfering [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]].

Although defeated when the Surfer transmuted his weapons into harmless flashlight-like devices, the Obliterator soon returned to fight Silver Surfer again, but was again repulsed.

Later, he encountered and battled the Avengers [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Thunderstrike]] and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].  At the request of the Caregiver, he was removed by Quasar to prevent him from harming an infant cosmic organism.  Quasar dumped him in between galaxies.

==Powers and abilities==

Like all Elders, the Obliterator is completely immortal.  He is immune to aging, disease, conventional injury and poison.  He can survive in space without food, water or air.  

It has been hinted that the Obliterator can channel his [[Power Primordial]] through his weapons enabling them to match the power of the Silver Surfer. 

Due to his obsession with hunting other lifeforms, the Obliterator has failed to develop himself to the extent of the other Elders.  He cannot travel in space unaided and has no destructive powers without his weapons.  He also is not very intelligent.
