'''Daredevil''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic-book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character was created by [[writer]]-[[Literary editor|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Bill Everett]] in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964), with an unspecified amount of input from [[Jack Kirby]],<ref name="r1">Comics historian and former [[Jack Kirby]] assistant [[Mark Evanier]], investigating claims of Kirby's involvement in the creation of both [[Iron Man]] and Daredevil, interviewed Kirby and Everett on the subject, years before their deaths. In his column [http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq4.htm P.O.V. Online: The Jack FAQ: "What did Jack do on the first stories of Iron Man and Daredevil?"], he concluded that, "in both cases, Jack had already drawn the covers of those issues and done some amount of design work. He ... seems to have participated in the design of Daredevil's first costume. ... Everett did tell me that Jack had come up with the idea of Daredevil's billy club. ... Jack, in effect, drew the first page of that first Daredevil story. In the rush to get that seriously late book to press, there wasn't time to complete Page One, so Stan had [production manager] [[Sol Brodsky]] slap together a paste-up that employed Kirby's cover drawing. ... Everett volunteered to me that Jack had "helped him" though he wouldn't — or more likely, couldn't — elaborate on that. He just plain didn't remember it well, and in later years apparently gave others who asked a wide range of answers". 

Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] later noted in his ''Newsarama''  column [http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays4.htm "Joe Fridays Week 4" (2005, no other date given)] that when Everett turned in his first-issue pencils extremely late, Brodsky and [[Spider-Man]] artist [[Steve Ditko]] inked "a lot of backgrounds and secondary figures on the fly and cobbled the cover and the splash page together from Kirby's original concept drawing" .</ref> and is notable as being among the few superheroes with a [[disability]], being [[blindness|blinded]] in a [[radioactive]] accident when young (although his remaining senses were drastically heightened and he gained a "radar-sense" allowing him to perceive his surroundings).<!--The 1940s Golden Age Daredevil was originally mute, and Dr. Mid-Nite was blind. Marvel's DD is one of the few, but not one of the first. Marvel's own [[Professor X]] even precedes him. -->
His public identity is '''Matt Murdock''', a successful [[attorney-at-law]].

Although ''Daredevil'' had been home to the work of many legendary comic-book artists — Everett, Kirby, [[Wally Wood]], [[John Romita, Sr.]], and [[Gene Colan]], among others — it is [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s influential tenure on the title in the late 1970s and early 1980s that is best remembered, cementing the character as a popular and individual part of the [[Marvel Universe]]. ''Daredevil'' has also been adapted into various other media including a live-action [[film]] released in 2003. 
==Publication history==
===Volume 1: 1964 - 1998===
Daredevil's original costume was a combination of black, yellow and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights, and went through minor revisions in issues #2 through #4 by [[EC Comics]] artist [[Joe Orlando]]. Fellow acclaimed EC veteran Wally Wood penciled #5-8, introducing the modern, completely red costume in issue #7. [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] great [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]] ([[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]]) penciled two issues over Wood layouts, and they then swapped for #11, which Wood inked over Powell's pencils.
[[Image:Daredevilv1issue1splashpage.png|thumb|left|Daredevil's first costume, from ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964). Splash-page art by [[Jack Kirby]] (penciler) and [[Bill Everett]] (inker).<ref name="r1" />.]]
Issue #12 began a brief run by Jack Kirby (layouts) and [[John Romita, Sr.]] It was Romita's return to superhero penciling after a decade of working exclusively as a [[romantic fiction|romance]]-comic artist for DC. Romita had felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker.<ref>Romita, from ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #6 (Fall 1999) [http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06romita.html]: "I had inked an ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' job for Stan, and I told him I just wanted to ink. I felt like I was burned out as a penciller after eight years of romance work. I didn't want to pencil any more; in fact, I couldn't work at home any more — I couldn't discipline myself to do it. He said, 'Okay,' but the first chance he had he shows me this Daredevil story somebody had started and he didn't like it, and he wanted somebody else to do it." Elaborating in ''Alter Ego'' #9 (July 2001) [http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/09romita.html], he added, "Stan showed me [[Dick Ayers]]' splash page for a ''Daredevil''. He asked me, "What would you do with this page?" I showed him on a tracing paper what I would do, and then he asked me to do a drawing of Daredevil the way I would do it. I did a big drawing of Daredevil ... just a big, tracing-paper drawing of Daredevil swinging. And Stan loved it."</ref>

When Romita left to take over ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', Lee gave ''Daredevil'' to the character's first signature artist, [[Gene Colan]], who began with issue #20 (Sept. 1966). Colan pencilled all but three issues through #100 (June 1973), plus the 1967 annual, followed by ten issues sprinkled from 1974-79. (He would return again, an established legend, for an eight-issue run in 1997). Among the notable plot developments during this period were Matt Murdock's panicky creation of a "twin brother", the "sighted" and devil-may-care Mike Murdock, in #25 (Feb. 1967), whom Karen Page and Foggy Nelson are led to believe is Daredevil; "Mike's" death in #41 (June 1968); and Matt revealing his Daredevil identity to Karen Page in #57 (Oct. 1969).

Much like in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' — and in what was already an established hallmark of Marvel Comics storytelling — interpersonal drama was as central to the series as action and adventure. A triangle of unrequited love develops between Foggy Nelson, Karen Page and Murdock, with Nelson unable to win over Page and Matt unable to admit that Page loves anyone other than Daredevil. When the revelation of Murdock's dual identity proves too much for Page, she leaves the firm and the comic.

In the 1970s the title featured a double billing, co-starring Daredevil's girlfriend, the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]. During this time, the series' writers included [[Gerry Conway]], [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Chris Claremont]].  Artists included [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] and [[Don Heck]]. 
[[Image:Dd181.png|thumbnail|''Daredevil''  #181 (April 1982). Cover art by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Klaus Janson]].]]

The modern definition of ''Daredevil'' began in 1979 with [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s entrance on the title.  Miller's first contributions were as an artist, where he imbued a new dynamism and a drastically different visual style.  The series' tone became that of [[noir]] with [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] itself playing a more prominent role.

With issue #168, Miller additionally became the series' writer, and the comic underwent a drastic metamorphosis. The most significant change was the introduction of [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] as Daredevil's new arch-nemesis. Until that point, Daredevil's enemies were primarily, though not exclusively, costumed villains. The Kingpin was a departure in that although he possessed extraordinary size, strength and fighting ability, his villainy came from his ruthless brilliance in running a criminal empire, rather than superpowers. The title still retained costumed antagonists — notably [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] — but found its central theme to be one more grounded in reality: [[organized crime]].

Miller also introduced [[ninjas]] into the Daredevil canon, bringing a greater focus on the [[martial arts]] aspect of Daredevil's fighting skills, and introducing the characters [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. This was a drastic change to a character once considered a swashbuckler. The focus of a ninja's control of the inner self served as a counterbalance to the emerging themes of anger and torment.

Comics-artist legend [[Wally Wood]], following kidney failure and the loss of vision in one eye, returned to the character he helped define, inking Miller's cover of ''Daredevil'' #164 (May 1980). It was one of Wood's final assignments before his death in 1981.

Miller's noir take on the character continued, even after he left (in 1983, after issue #191). However, successor [[Dennis O'Neil]] did not find the commercial success of his predecessor. In late 1985, Miller returned to the series, co-writing #226 with O'Neil, then writing the acclaimed  "[[Daredevil: Born Again]]" storyline in #227-233 (Feb.-Aug. 1986), with artist [[David Mazzuchelli]].

A [[round-robin]] of creators contributed in the year that followed ''Born Again'': writers [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Danny Fingeroth]], [[Steve Englehart]] (under the [[pseudonym]] "John Harkness") and [[Ann Nocenti]], and pencilers [[Steve Ditko]], [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], Louis Williams, [[Sal Buscema]], [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Keith Pollard]],and Chuck Patton. [[Longshot]] co-creator Nocenti, who'd written #236, became the regular writer for a four-and-a-quarter year run of all but two issues from #238-291 (Jan. 1987 - April 1991). [[John Romita, Jr.]] joined as penciller from #250-282 (Jan. 1988 - Jul. 1990), and was generally inked by [[Al Williamson]]. The team specifically addressed societal issues, with Murdock, now running a non-profit urban legal center, confronting [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[nuclear proliferation]] while fighting supervillains. Nocenti introduced the popular antagonist [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] in issue #254.

Under writers [[Karl Kesel]] and later [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], the book gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and [[Foggy Nelson|Foggy]] (who now knows of Matt's dual identities) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother, Rosalind Sharpe.

===Volume 2===
[[Image:Ddsmith.png|thumbnail|left|The death of [[Karen Page]]. Promotional art for ''Daredevil Visionaries: Kevin Smith'' by [[Joe Quesada]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]].]]
In 1998, ''Daredevil'''s numbering was rebooted, with the title "cancelled" and revived a month later as part of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint. [[Joe Quesada]] drew the new series, written by filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]].  Its first eight-issue story arc, "[[Daredevil: Guardian Devil|Guardian Devil]]" depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the [[Messiah]] or the [[Anti-Christ]]. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has [[AIDS]] (later revealed to be a hoax), and her subsequent death at [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s hands.

After "Guardian Devil", Smith was succeeded by writer-artist [[David Mack]], who contributed the seven-issue "Parts of a Hole" (#9-15). This arc introduces Maya Lopez, also known as [[Echo (comics)|Echo]], a [[deaf]] martial artist.  Mack brought indie-comic colleague [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to Marvel for the following arc, "Wake Up" (#16-19), which follows reporter [[Ben Urich]] as he investigates the aftereffects of a fight between Daredevil and an obscure old villain called [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leapfrog]]. Following Mack and Bendis were ''[[Back to the Future]]'' screenwriter [[Bob Gale]] and artists [[Phil Winslade]] and David Ross for the story "Playing to the Camera". Mack continued to contribute covers.

Issue #26 (Dec. 2001) brought back [[Brian Michael Bendis]], working this time with artist [[Alex Maleev]], for a four-year-run that became one of the series' most acclaimed. Maleev's harsh and grainy look is in contrast to Quesada's more cartoony lines, and distinctively reads like a marriage of Frank Miller's [[film noir]] style and the [[Pulp magazine|pulp-magazine]] art of the 1920s and '30s. Developments in this run included the introduction of Milla Donovan, the outing of Murdock's secret identity to the press, the reemergence of the Kingpin, and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI. Writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Michael Lark]] became the new creative team with ''Daredevil'' #82 (Feb. 2006), no longer under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.

===Early life===
[[Image:Daredevil47.jpg|thumb|right|''Daredevil'' #47 (Dec. 1968). Cover art by [[Gene Colan]] (pencils) and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]] (inks).]]
[[Irish-American]] Matthew Murdock is raised by [[single father]] and fading [[Boxing|boxer]] "Battling Jack" Murdock after his mother, presumably a [[nun]] named Maggie, left both Jack and Matthew in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. Jack instills in Matt the importance of education and non-violence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. Though Jack's intentions are noble, Matt is left unprepared to handle the bullying he received at school, and is branded with the sarcastic nickname, "Daredevil". Matt vents his frustration and anger by training in secret.<ref name="man without fear">{{cite book|author=Frank Miller| authorlink =Frank Miller (comics)|coauthors =[[John Romita Jr.]]| title =Daredevil: The Man Without Fear| publisher = [[Marvel comics]]|date=1993-4}}</ref>

In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt is blinded by a [[radioactive]] substance that falls from the vehicle. Though the act of heroism robs him of sight, the radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human thresholds, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #1</ref> A mysterious man, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], becomes his mentor, and teaches him to control his new abilities while honing his natural aptitude in [[acrobatics]] and [[martial arts]]. Stick, also blind, teaches Matt how to form a mental image of the objects around him, and Matt develops a "radar sense" to make up for his sight. Still in school, Matt continues to honor his father's wishes by excelling in his studies, and ultimately enrolls in the [[Columbia Law School|Columbia School of Law]].<ref name="man without fear"/>

Back in Hell's Kitchen, Jack struggles and becomes an enforcer for small-time crook and boxing manager, the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]. In exchange for his services, the Fixer rigs a series of matches and provides "Battling Jack" a late-life boxing renaissance, resulting in the once near-destitute fighter becoming a title contender. On the night of the title fight against "Crusher" Creel, the future [[Absorbing Man]], with his son in the crowd, Jack ignores the Fixer's demands to take a dive and wins by knockout. For his disobedience, the Fixer has him murdered.<ref>''Daredevil'' #1</ref><ref name="man without fear"/>

In college, Matt meets and falls in love with [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], the daughter of a [[Greece|Greek]] diplomat. When Elektra and her father are kidnapped by [[terrorists]], Matt dons a mask for the first time and fights to save the two. In the mayhem that follows, Elektra's father is accidentally shot and killed by a SWAT team member. Overcome with grief, Elektra breaks Murdock's heart by leaving America behind and returning to the study of martial arts.<ref name="man without fear"/>

Matt is devastated by the loss of his father and the judicial system's failure to convict the men responsible. Mindful of the childhood promise he made to his father not to lead a violent life, Matt dons a new identity for providing justice. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes, renamed with the moniker of his childhood derision, and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronts the killers and avenges his father as the superhero Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #1</ref><ref name="man without fear"/>

''Daredevil: Yellow'' is an [[epistolary]] take on the origin story, using letters written to Karen Page after her death. Here Page believes she is in love with both Daredevil and Murdock, and Nelson with Karen Page, resulting in a silent rivalry between the two men. The supervillains the Owl and the Purple Man are the [[antagonists]]. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase "The Man without Fear", and she also suggest to Daredevil he wear red instead of black and yellow.

After establishing his law firm with his best friend and college roommate [[Franklin Nelson|Franklin "Foggy" Nelson]] and secretary [[Karen Page]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #1</ref> Daredevil embarks on a series of colorful adventures involving such villains as the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]], [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], and the [[Enforcers]].  Daredevil's early exploits were often large, [[swashbuckling]] adventures, and sub-plots involved [[romantic triangle]]s between Matt, Karen and Foggy and cases of [[mistaken identity]]. He also meets [[Spider-Man]] during this time.<ref>''Daredevil'' #16</ref>

Daredevil moves to [[San Francisco]] for a time to live with the spy and super-heroine the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], and enters into a romantic relationship with her<ref>''Daredevil'' #81</ref> but she soon ends the relationship, fearing that playing "[[sidekick]]" to Daredevil is sublimating her identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #124</ref> Murdock returns to Hell's Kitchen. The two remain intimate friends and occasional lovers.

Karen Page eventually returns as a heroin-addicted star of [[adult films]], who sells Daredevil's secret identity for drug money.

Daredevil then allies with [[Captain America]] against the nuclear menace, [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #233</ref> Daredevil is also attacked by Ultron, who was acting on Dr. Doom's orders. He is almost beaten, but Ultron eventually destroys itself as a result of having all of it's previous forms running at once.

After a while, Daredevil meets [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #254</ref> He battles her, and at the same time romances her as Matt Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil'' #255</ref> He is transported to Hell by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and is forced to endure physical and psychological torture, however he manages to resist Mephisto's attempts at corruption.<ref>''Daredevil'' #278-282</ref>

However, Daredevil's secret identity becomes public knowledge. Forced to fake his own death and change his uniform to an armored "razor costume", Murdock undergoes one of his numerous breakdowns. The change does not last, and Daredevil soon returns to his traditional red costume, while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a [[deus ex machina]] [[doppelgänger]]).

Daredevil encounters the supervillain [[Mysterio]], who is dying of cancer from overexposure to his primary weapon, a mist. Mysterio orchestrates events so that Daredevil is convinced he is involved in the saving of a reborn baby [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], leading to a battle between Daredevil and Bullseye that ends with the death of [[Karen Page]].<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #8 (June 1999)</ref>

===Identity revealed===
Ambitious mobster [[Sammy Silke]] orchestrates a coup against the Kingpin, leading to violent revenge by [[Vanessa Fisk]], the Kingpin’s wife. Silke, in exchange for protection, gives Daredevil's identity to the [[FBI]], which makes it public in the ''Daily Globe''. Murdock responds by vigorous denials and a [[libel]] [[lawsuit]] against the newspaper. While the world ponders whether the respected attorney has made a mockery of the justice system with many past trials involving Daredevil he hires [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]] as bodyguards. In other developments, client Hector Ayala, the superhero [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]], is shot and killed by police after Murdock loses a [[manslaughter]] case in which Ayala was innocent.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #26-37, (Dec. 2001 - Nov. 2002)</ref> (During this period, Daredevil was invited to join the [[New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]] after aiding the team in stopping a riot at a supervillain prison, but refused the offer because he didn't want to affect their reputations in the public eye<ref>''New Avengers'' #3</ref>, although he did suggest his ex-girlfriend [[Echo (comics)|Echo]] as an alternative member<ref>''New Avengers'' #11</ref>)

===Breakdown===
Murdock meets and romances the blind [[Milla Donovan]], and battles efforts by the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]] to take Fisk's place as Kingpin by marketing the drug MGH (Mutant Growth Hormone). Daredevil discovers that the Kingpin, thought dead, has recovered from the coup's attempt on his life and after a violent confrontation that sends his nemesis to the hospital, Daredevil declares himself the kingpin of Hell's Kitchen.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46-50 (June-Oct. 2003)</ref>

A year later, the increasingly violent and antisocial Daredevil has married Donovan and also won his case against the ''Daily Globe'', resulting in a multimillion dollar settlement he reinvests into the community. His reporter friend [[Ben Urich]] suggests he's suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] brought on by unresolved feelings over the death of Karen Page. Donovan, in response, annuls the marriage.

===Iron Fist as Daredevil===

Imprisoned by the FBI through the machinations of the Kingpin, Murdock cannot stop the apparent murder of Foggy Nelson at Ryker's, while a mysterious new Daredevil appears in Hell's Kitchen.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #87 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Murdock escapes with the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] during a prison riot and discovers the ersatz Daredevil to be his friend, [[Heroes for Hire|Hero for Hire]] Danny Rand, the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Rand is unwittingly employed by a  mysterious figure who has been manipulating Daredevil. Unbeknownst to Murdock, Nelson is in the [[Witness Protection Program]]. 

Traveling to Europe, Murdock learns the Kingpin's wife, Vanessa Fisk, is behind both Nelson's attack and the substitute Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #89-93 (Nov. 2006 - March 2007)</ref> Ill and dying, she has the FBI agent in charge of the Murdock case killed, planting a fake suicide note saying he had framed Murdock. Matt reunites with Foggy and Milla in New York, and feels obliged to have the Kingpin's charges dropped. The Kingpin, U.S. citizenship revoked, is forced to leave the country. While Murdock is away, Rand, filling-in as Daredevil during the events of the Superhero Registration "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]", is captured and imprisoned for not registering.<ref>''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] #5</ref>. Rand would later escape and join The Secret Avengers in the final battle.<ref>''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] #6</ref>.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Daredevil's four remaining senses are heightened far beyond human levels, due to exposure to radiation. Although Murdock is blind, he can "see" by means of his "radar sense". This radar sense allows him sense the proximity of objects and persons around him, which allows him to react to attacks and launch his own attacks much faster than normal humans. This also enables him to dodge most ranged and close combat attacks with reliability.  Daredevil's radar sense, combined with his super hearing enable him to instantly map the trajectory of a projectile (i.e., bullet or arrow) enabling him to dodge attacks with relative ease.  He can also detect pulse fluctuations which serve as early warnings to physical attacks.

His sense of touch is sensitive enough to detect the faint impressions of ink on paper, allowing him to read by touch.  Mudock can read computer screens by feeling the heat differentiation in varying light intensities. He can 'see' paintings by feeling even subtle brush strokes on the canvas.  Early issues even show Daredevil has the ability to 'feel' color because each color reflects light at a different vibration.  He is also able to feel minute changes in temperature and pressure due to body heat and air disturbance. His sensitivity to heat allows him to sense the temperature of people and objects in order to determine whether a person is living or dead and, if dead, for how long.

Daredevil's sense of smell is enhanced enough to distinguish individuals by their natural odors, and remember and identify them no matter how they attempt to mask their scent, as well as track that individual scent through a crowd of people. He can also determine the ingredients of food and drink down to concentrations of 20 milligrams by their scent. His sense of taste is sharp enough to enable him to detect the number of grains of salt on a pretzel.

Daredevil's enhanced sense of hearing enables him to detect acoustic pressure changes that ordinary humans cannot. Daredevil can often hear gunshots in time to avoid them, if the shooter is far enough away. He can hear human voices through soundproofed walls and the steady rhythm of a heartbeat from several feet away. Daredevil's sense of hearing makes him constantly aware of his own heartbeat, blood circulation, breathing, physical movements, etc.  This skill is often employed by Murdock to serve as a lie-detector for his career as an attorney and as Daredevil.  Other superheroes have sought Daredevil's aid at times for the expressed purpose of using him as a lie-detector.  Extremely loud noises (or other extreme forms of sensory input, including visual) cause Daredevil considerably more distress than the average person; beyond a certain size, crowds of people cause too many sensory impressions for him to sort through without great difficulty.

Daredevil possesses superhumanly acute powers of concentration, allowing him to sift through his sensory input and concentrate on any one specific stimulus to the extent of the exclusion of all others.

Daredevil's senses grant him a superhuman level of [[kinesthetics|kinesthetic]] awareness, which greatly enhances his fighting skills. Daredevil has extensive knowledge of pressure points, due to his training and radar sense. Due to his training by Stick he uses ninja stealth/vanishing and has control of his chi, to his own self training. Daredevil is a master of a unique martial art from a blend of [[ninjutsu]], aiki-jujutsu, [[judo]], gymnastics, and American-style [[boxing]].  Although [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Captain America]] are considered the top martial artists in the Marvel Comics Universe, Daredevil could easily be considered the third best, rivaling even [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Shang-Chi]], and indeed he has fought Wolverine, Black Panther, Task Master, and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] to a standstill in single combat.  Daredevil is also a very intelligent fighter, in the sense that he often uses his wits to overcome opponents with superior power, such as [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], [[Klaw]], and the [[Absorbing Man]].  

Daredevil is a superb athlete and gymnast, possessing extraordinary agility, endurance, skill and balance.  Because a person's sense of balance is linked with their sense of hearing (similar to the way that taste is linked with the sense of smell), Daredevil's superhuman hearing also grants him superhuman balance.  He has been know to run across and even jump up and down on hydro wires.  This 'super balance' enhances Daredevil's acrobatic skills beyond even what a highly skilled but sighted athlete would possess.  

Daredevil's signature weapon is his specially designed billy club, which he created. Disguised as a blind man's cane in civilian garb, it is a versatile, multi-purpose weapon that contains thirty feet of aircraft control cable connected to a case-hardened steel [[grapnel]]. Internal mechanisms allow the cable to be neatly wound and unwound, while a powerful spring launches the grapnel. The handle can be straightened for use when throwing. The club can also be split into two parts, one of which is a fighting baton, the other of which ends in a curved hook. Daredevil has extreme accuracy when throwing his club, and can hit multiple enemies with ricochets.

As Matt Murdock, Daredevil is also a highly skilled criminal defense attorney with an extensive knowledge of the American legal system, even going so far as to defend some of his former adversaries in court.  As he believes very strongly in the justice system, he has gone so far as to defend criminal murderers against other superheroes who would kill them for their crimes, battling [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and the [[Punisher]] and winning on both occasions.

==Characters==
===Love interests===
[[Image:Ddelektra.png|thumb|Daredevil and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. Detail from of ''Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller Vol. 2''. Cover art by Miller.]]

Within [[Marvel Comics]], few characters endure a love life as convoluted and tortured as Daredevil's. His girlfriends fall roughly into two groups: ordinary women who suffer great pain at his side; and super-powered, highly dangerous love interests. Either way, most end up killed, maimed or traumatized, a narrative aspect some media critics refer to as "[[Women in Refrigerators (comics)|Women in Refrigerators]]" syndrome.

She later works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle, accompanying Ben Urich on diverse assignments.

* Matt Murdock also makes a brief cameo appearance in the Top Cow/Marvel crossover "Unholy Alliance".

==In other media==
===Television===
*Daredevil first appeared on television in his civilian identity as Spider-Man's lawyer, Matt Murdock (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), in the "[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends#Season 3|Attack of the Arachnoid]]" episode of the 1981-83 ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' [[animated TV series]].

===Film===
[[Image:Daredevil poster.JPG|thumb|''Daredevil'' movie poster.]]

Daredevil's earliest appearance in a theatrical movie was a cameo in Kevin Smith's ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001), in which the starring characters run through a movie lot where an actor in a Daredevil costume has an action scene in the background. The DVD includes a longer Daredevil scene. Kevin Smith had previously written for ''Daredevil''.

In [[February 2003|February]] [[2003 in film|2003]], [[20th Century Fox]] released [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'']], a feature film starring [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], and directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]]. While opening strongly and eventually surpassing $100 million in ticket sales, poor word-of-mouth and mixed reviews curtailed its momentum.

A [[director's cut]] [[DVD]] was released November 2004 with nearly 30 minutes of additional footage, including a subplot involving a murder trial that led to the capture of Kingpin Wilson Fisk. Several appearing scenes in the theatrical release were missing from or altered in the director's cut. Missing scenes include Murdock and Elektra's love scene, and scenes set inside a church [[confessional]]. A scene featuring Bullseye that was placed after the credits in the theatrical version was integrated into the movie in the director's cut.

Matt Murdock also appeared on a deleted dream sequence of the movie's spin-off ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'', featured on the DVD release.

===Video games===

Daredevil has special dialogue with Black Widow, Blade and Bullseye.

===Toys===

He appeared in the spin off series Face-Off (with an unmasked variant) along with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].
The "Spider-Man Classics" toy line, which was a precursor to Marvel Legends, also included a Daredevil figure, clad in his traditional red costume.  A very hard to find (and sometimes quite expensive) variant of DD in his original yellow and black garb was also released in the same series.
