'''Victor Mancha''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]; a [[cyborg]] made by [[Ultron]], he is most popularly known as the character who is one day supposedly going to kill every hero in the Marvel Universe. He debuted in the Marvel comics series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' Vol.2 #1.

== Character History ==
Ultron met Marianella Mancha in a scrapyard after fighing the [[Avengers]]. Marianella was a [[drug mule]] who was physically unable to have children, and Ultron promised to give her a child as a "reward" for saving him, though he had ulterior motives. Marianella, a devout Christian, saw Ultron as a [[John the Baptist]] figure and followed his words. He used her [[DNA]] to begin work on a fully-grown [[cyborg]] that was programmed with false memories of a normal childhood. He then dubbed the cyborg "Victor" and gave it a deep-rooted love for [[super-heroes]]. Ultron's long-term plan involved sending Victor to [[New York City]] when he was twenty-one so that he could meet his idols, the Avengers, and be recruited to the team after exhibiting his powers. Ultron counted on Victor's [[Hispanic]] heritage garnering him a spot on the team to fulfill the Avengers' need for ethnic [[diversity]].

In one Marvel timeline, Ultron's plan succeeds. Victor joins the Avengers under the codename Victorious and becomes the world's greatest super-hero. After learning the secret plans, strengths, and weaknesses of his teammates, Victor's sleeper-switch is activated and he kills every super-hero on Earth, including the Avengers, the [[Fantastic Fourteen]], [[Iron Woman]], and the [[X-Men]]. The leader of the Avengers, Heroine (who is in fact an older version of the Runaways' very own [[Gertrude Yorkes|Arsenic]]) goes back in time to deliver a warning to her past self and her former teammates. Heroine dies, but not before telling the Runaways where to find the present-day Victor Mancha. 

Marianella keeps Victor isolated on the West Coast so that he will not make contact with any super-beings, who are concentrated on the East Coast. As a result of his cybernetic parts, Victor cannot pass through [[metal detector]]s. Victor is a student at East Angeles High School in [[Los Angeles]] when he first meets the Runaways. Ultron, still wishing to keep Victor's true origin a secret, sends a [[Doombot]] to kidnap Marianella and pose as Victor's father. Victor and the Runaways rush to the rescue and the Doombot is destroyed; Ultron chooses that moment to reveal himself and kills Marianella right in front of Victor. Ultron then triggers Victor's sleeper-switch so that he will attack the Runaways; however, Gert is able to reason with Victor and he rejects his programming, defying his "father." Afterwards, the Runaways take the now-orphaned Victor back to their hideout to keep him from ending up in [[Social Services]].

Because of his superior intelligence and [[electromagnetic]] powers, Chase calls him the ''Calculator Kid'' and Nico calls him ''Zapper''. After observing the team in action for a month, Victor proves his worth by defeating [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]] using his electromagnetic abilities.

The Runaways are mostly friendly towards Victor, but they know that he is still a potential threat. He is often paired with [[Molly Hayes]] when the team separates to buy supplies, because Molly is the only individual member of the team strong enough to take him down should he go rogue. [[Chase Stein]] is still suspicious of Victor, and resents his developing interest in Gert. Judging by a comment made by [[Nico Minoru]] at the end of "True Believers," she is fully prepared to kill Victor if the need arises.
