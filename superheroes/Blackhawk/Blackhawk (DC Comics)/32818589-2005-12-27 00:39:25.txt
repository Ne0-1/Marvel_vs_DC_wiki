'''''Blackhawk''''' is a long-running [[comic book]] series published first by [[Quality Comics]] and later by [[National Periodical Publications]], the primary company of those that evolved to become [[DC Comics]]. The series was created by [[Will Eisner]], [[Chuck Cuidera]] (a.k.a. [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]]), and [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]], but the [[artist]] most associated with the feature is [[Reed Crandall]]. Future [[Justice League of America]] artist [[Dick Dillin]] succeeded him in the [[1950s]], continuing on through DC's acquisition of the series.

The Blackhawks are a small team of [[World War II]]-era [[flying ace|ace pilots]] of varied nationalities:

* '''Blackhawk''' himself is their leader, variously shown to be [[Poland|Polish]] and/or born in the [[United States]].
* '''Andre''' is [[France|French]].
* '''Olaf''' is from [[Sweden]].
* '''Chuck''' is a [[Texas]]-born [[United States|American]].
* '''Hendrickson''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutchman]].
* '''Stanislau''' is [[Poland|Polish]].
* '''Chop-Chop''' (Wu Cheng), by far the most controversial of the lot, is [[China|Chinese]].

Chop-Chop is both the youngest member of the team and the most stereotypical.  His initial portrait, while not atypical of World War II-era perception, would now be considered offensive.  The character has been developed in a more respectful way since, and some latter-day stories have referenced the fact that for decades he was not given enough respect even to wear the same uniform as his teammates.  After DC Comics' company-wide crossover event ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', which streamlined and revamped many of DC's properties, the old depiction of Chop-Chop was explained as that of a comic-book-within-the comic-book that featured the team's adventures and which Chop-Chop, now a more realistically drawn man in a standard uniform, found profoundly insulting.

Supporting cast included Zinda Blake a.k.a. [[Lady Blackhawk]], who was since time-displaced due to another DC event, "[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]", and who became a regular character in comics starring the character [[Guy Gardner]].  As of late [[2004]] she was the supporting-character pilot for the costumed crimefighters [[Birds of Prey]].

==Publication history==

The Blackhawks debuted in Quality Comics' ''Military Comics'' #1 (August 1941), and were published in that title as well as in their own book for a long while.  ''Military Comics'' was renamed "Modern Comics" and eventually cancelled with #102 (October 1950), but their self-named book (which debuted in 1944) continued to be published by Quality up until #107 in 1956.  Quality itself had folded by then, but the title kept being published by DC Comics, with little or no disruption at all.  It was integrated with the [[DC Universe]] and published continuously until #243 (November 1968), by which time its genre had become too [[anachronistic]] to compete with the rising [[superhero]] books.

Time itself also played a role in the cancellation.  The Blackhawks as a concept were heavily tied to World War II, and as the years passed by it became more and more difficult to [[Suspension of disbelief|suspend disbelief]] about their continuous adventuring up to present days.  There was a disastious attempt to turn them into superheroes (#230-241), before they were restored to the original roots for 2 issues before they were cancelled in 1968.  A short run from #244 to #250 was published in the 1970s tried to update them, but since then nearly all Blackhawk sightings (few and far between) are of a flashback nature.  A well received series in the 80s (#251-273) were set in World War II.  A later mini-series by [[Howard Chaykin]] revamped the WWII team, and a new post-war series began in ''[[Action Comics]] Weekly'' and then their own series.  

Since then, only modern hints of the team have appeared, usually with 'Blackhawk Express' or the time-displaced [[Lady Blackhawk]].  One of the best examples of this is the 1990s appearance of Chop-Chop in a few issues of DC's "[[Hawkworld]]" series, which naturally enough depict him as an aged, resourceful and respectable man, long rid of his racial stereotype trappings.

However, other Blackhawk air pilot groups have been shown during present time or alternate future events such as "[[Our Worlds At War]]" and "[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]".  It is unknown which connection beyond homage and inspiration, if any, those groups have to the classic Blackhawks.

==Trivia==
Blackhawk was involved in one of the very earliest examples of [[fictional crossover]]s, when [[Kid Eternity]] summoned him in his very second appearance (1942's ''Hit Comics'' #26).

==Other media==

*''Blackhawk: Fearless Champion of Freedom'' was a 1952 film [[serial]] based on the comic book, starring [[Kirk Alyn]] as Blackhawk.
* A now hard to find Blackhawk novel was published in the early 80s, apparently due to hopes of a Blackhawk movie that never materialized.
*"The Savage Time", the first-season finale of the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series featured appearances by many of DC's best-known World War II-era heroes, including the Blackhawks. Blackhawk was voiced by [[Robert Picardo]].
*"I Am Legion", the third-season premiere of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (or the fifth-season premiere of ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', depending on how you look at it), featured an now-elderly Chuck, voiced by [[Seymour Cassel]]. According to Chuck, he was the only Blackhawk still living, and he was married to Marzey, as the character was in the comic books. It was not revealed how the others died. The episode focused around [[Lex Luthor]], [[Key (comics)|The Key]], and [[Doctor Polaris|Dr. Polaris]] raiding the decomissioned Blackhawk Island in order to steal the advanced technology the Blackhawks had acquired on various missions and stored there. During a chase through the museum on the island, a statue or mannequin of [[Lady Blackhawk]] can be seen.

==Awards==
The 1989 series of comics was nominated for the Squiddy Award for New Continuing Series in 1989.
