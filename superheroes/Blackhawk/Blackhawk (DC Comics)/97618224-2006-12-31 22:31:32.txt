'''''Blackhawk''''', a long-running [[comic book]] series, was also a film serial, a radio series and a novel. The comic book was published first by [[Quality Comics]] and later by [[National Periodical Publications]], the primary company of those that evolved to become [[DC Comics]]. The series was created by [[Will Eisner]], Chuck Cuidera (as [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]]), and [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]], but the [[artist]] most associated with the feature is [[Reed Crandall]]. Future [[Justice League of America]] artist [[Dick Dillin]] succeeded him in the 1950s, continuing on through DC's acquisition of the series.

The Blackhawks are a small team of [[World War II]]-era [[flying ace|ace pilots]] of varied nationalities:

* '''''Janos Prohaska (Blackhawk)''''' is their leader, variously shown to be [[Poland|Polish]] and/or born in the [[United States]].
* '''''Andre Blanc-Dumont''''' is [[France|French]].
* '''''Olaf Friedricksen''''' is [[Sweden|Swedish]].
* '''''Carlos "Chuck" Sirianni''''' is a [[Texas]]-born [[United States|American]].
* '''''Ritter Hendrickson''''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutchman]].
* '''''Stanislaus Drozdowski''''' is [[Poland|Polish]].
* '''''Weng Chan (Chop-Chop)''''' , by far the most controversial of the lot, is [[China|Chinese]].
* '''''Natalie Reed (Lady Blackhawk)''''' is [[Russia|Russian]][[United States|-american]].

Chop-Chop is both the youngest member of the team and the most stereotypical.  His initial portrait, although now considered offensive by many, was not atypical of World War II-era depictions of Asians.  The character has been developed in a more respectful way since, and some latter-day stories have referenced the fact that for decades he was not given enough respect even to wear the same uniform as his teammates.  After DC Comics' company-wide crossover event ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' revamped and streamlined many of DC's properties, Chop-Chop's old depictions were suggested to be those of a comic-book-within-a-comic-book style format that featured the team's adventures, with Chop-Chop playing the role of sidekick. He was subsequently a more realistically drawn character in a standard uniform.

Supporting cast included Zinda Blake ([[Lady Blackhawk]]), who was since time-displaced due to another DC event, ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', and who became a regular character in comics starring the character [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].  As of [[2006]] she is the supporting-character pilot for the costumed crimefighters depicted in the series ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]''.

==Publication history==
[[Image:BlackhawkIssue230.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Blackhawk #230]]
The Blackhawks debuted in Quality Comics' ''Military Comics'' #1 (August 1941) and were published in that title as well as in their own book for years. ''Military Comics'' was renamed "Modern Comics" and eventually cancelled with #102 (October 1950), but their self-named book (which debuted in 1944) continued to be published by Quality until #107 in 1956. Quality itself had folded by then, but the title was integrated with the [[DC Universe]] and published continuously until #243 (November 1968), by which time its genre had become too [[anachronistic]] to compete with the rising [[superhero]] books.

Time itself also played a role in the cancellation. The Blackhawks as a concept were heavily tied to World War II, and as the years passed by it became more and more difficult to [[Suspension of disbelief|suspend disbelief]] about their contemporary adventures. After a disastrous attempt to turn them into superheroes (#230-241), they were restored to their original roots for two issues before the 1968 cancellation.  A short 1970s run (#244 to #250) attempted an update, but since then nearly all Blackhawk sightings (few and far between) are of a flashback nature. A well received 1980s series, written by Mark Evanier and illustrated by Dan Spiegle (#251-273), was set in World War II. In the 1980s a mini-series by [[Howard Chaykin]] reimagined the WWII team (notably in reinventing the title character as a Pole rather than American), with their adventures continuing in post-war stories in ''[[Action Comics]] Weekly'' and then their own short-lived ongoing series in the early 1990s.  

Since then, only modern hints of the team have appeared, usually with "Blackhawk Express" or the time-displaced [[Lady Blackhawk]]. One of the best examples of this is the 1990s appearance of Chop-Chop in a few issues of DC's ''[[Hawkworld]]'' series, which naturally enough depict him as an aged, resourceful and respectable man, long rid of his racial stereotype trappings. However, other Blackhawk air pilot groups have been shown during present time or alternate future events such as ''[[Our Worlds At War]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''. It is unknown which connection beyond homage and inspiration, if any, those groups have to the classic Blackhawks. Blackhawk currently is an extension of [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]].

Three weeks after [[9/11]], DC coincidentally reprinted the early pre-Pearl Harbor 1941 issues of ''Military Comics'' in ''The Blackhawk Archives, Vol. 1'' (2001) as part of its hardcover DC Archive Editions.

==International Incarnations==
The Blackhawk concept and characters proved to be popular on the international market as well as in the United States. Quality licensed the rights to Blackhawk, as well as many of their other characters, to London's [[Boardman Books]] which used them in a series of three-color reprints from 1948 to 1954. Boardman also reprinted Blackhawk stories in their ''Adventure Annual'' series of hardcover Christmas publications. Many of the British Blackhawk reprints were repackaged by Boardman art director [[Denis McLoughlin]], who created at least one British original Blackhawk story as well as the illustrations for several Blackhawk text stories. After Boardman's contract lapsed, Strato Publications launched a square-bound 68-page Blackhawk series which ran for 36 issues between 1956 and 1958.

==Aircraft==
* [[PZL P.50a Jastrzab]]  This is the plane that Blackhawk flew in Poland during the Nazi invasion of 1939.
* [[Grumman XF5F-1 "Skyrocket]]" - This airplane is the fighter that is most identified with the Blackhawks. They flew this plane during World War II and well into the post-WWII years.  
* [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]]  By the early 1950s, the Blackhawks converted the squadron to jets. This was the Blackhawk Squadrons first jet aircraft.
* [[Lockheed F-90B]]  The Blackhawks flew this plane from 1950 to 1955.
* [[Lockheed F-90C]] The Blackhawks were flying this model by 1957.
* [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]]  The Blackhawks modified this plane with [[VTOL]] capability.
* [[Lockheed F-94 Starfire]]  This is the plane that [[Lady Blackhawk]] flew.

==Trivia==
In 1942 Blackhawk was involved in one of the earliest examples of [[fictional crossover]]s when [[Kid Eternity]] summoned him in his second appearance (''Hit Comics'' #26).

* The ''[[Blackhawk (radio)|Blackhawk]]'' radio series was broadcast Wednesdays at 5:30pm on ABC from September to December 1950. Michael Fitzmaurice portrayed Blackhawk. 
* A hard to find Blackhawk novel by John Rotsler was published in 1982, apparently due to hopes for a Blackhawk movie that never materialized.
*"The Savage Time", the first-season finale of the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series featured appearances by many of DC's best-known World War II-era heroes, including the Blackhawks. Blackhawk was voiced by [[Robert Picardo]].
*"I Am Legion", the third-season premiere of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (or the fifth-season premiere of ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', depending on how you look at it), featured a now-elderly Chuck, voiced by [[Seymour Cassel]]. According to Chuck, he was the only Blackhawk still living, and he was married to Marzey, as the character was in the comic books. It was not revealed how the others died. The episode focused around [[Lex Luthor]], [[Key (comics)|The Key]], and [[Doctor Polaris|Dr. Polaris]] raiding the decomissioned Blackhawk Island in order to steal the advanced technology the Blackhawks had acquired on various missions and stored there. During a chase through the museum on the island, a statue or mannequin of [[Lady Blackhawk]] can be seen.
* A Blackhawk [[G.I. Joe]] action figure was produced in limited edition in the late 1990s. The figure wore the classic black flight uniform from World War Two.  Two uniform accessories were produced. The first was Blackhawk's red and green uniform from the mid to late 1960s. The other had a special arctic survival uniform in sky blue.
