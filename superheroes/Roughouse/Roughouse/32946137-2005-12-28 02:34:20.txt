'''Roughhouse''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and the occasional enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. His first appearance was in Wolverine (vol.2) #4. The character was created by Chris Claremont and John Buscema.

==Character biography==
Roughhouse is one of the most mysterious opponents that Wolverine has come across. Little is known of his past beyond the fact that Roughhouse is descended from the race of [[troll]]s that inhabit the [[Asgard (comics)|dimension of Asgard]], the mythical home of the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian "gods"]].  In Wolverine (vol. 2) #6, Roughhouse provides the first clue to his origin by uttering the phrase, "Ymir's icy breath".  This is a reference to the giant Ymir, said to be the father of the race of beings known as the Frost Giants, the primary enemies of the Asgardian "gods". He is also known to have been systematically [[Child abuse|abused by his father as a boy]].  Some writers have suggested that the reason Roughhouse wears long a full beard is to hide [[scar]]s received at the hands of his father.  However, this is merely speculation.  As, Roughhouse is descended from the Rock Trolls, there is a possibility that one of his parents might have been one.

In recent years, Roughhouse came to the island nation of [[Madripoor]] along with his partner, the "pseudo-vampire" [[Bloodscream]]. They found employment under [[General Coy]], one of the islands' most powerful crime lords, as special enforcers used to eliminate any threats to his operations.  They were sent after the woman called [[Tyger Tyger]], Coy's primary rival as the supreme crime boss of Madripoor.  This brought the two mercenaries into a number of conflicts with Wolverine. The duo were never able to defeat him.  

General Coy grew tired of Roughhouse's failures and literally sold him to [[Geist (comics)|Geist]] ("[[Ghost]]"), a former high ranging agent of [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and a cyborg. By the time Roughhouse met him, Geist was financing himself through  [[illegal drugs trade]] and was needed an guinea pig to experiment a new drug on.
Roughhouse was taken by Geist's men and received a dose of this experimental version of cocaine which temporarily drove him mad.

Wolverine held back in the fight with Roughhouse, since Roughhouse was not truly even aware of what he was doing.  After helping Roughhouse escape, they came upon a mysterious [[nun]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] known only as Sister Salvation, who possessed the ability to cure those suffering from physical or mental injuries and cure sickness just by touching them with her hands.  After several "sessions" she was able to fully purge Roughhouse's body of the cocaine.  Her mission had been destroyed and Roughhouse decided to stay with her and help her rebuild it.

It would be quite a while before Wolverine and Roughhouse would cross paths again. Roughhouse and Bloodscream had renewed their partnership and ambushed Wolverine after the adamantium had been stripped from his skeleton. They managed to get the upper hand and beat Wolverine unconscious and brought him to their hideout, where they beat him repeatedly over the next few days..  Wolverine was able to free himself from the chains and ambushed and defeated his captors. This was the last time he crossed paths with Roughhouse to date.

It is unknown why Roughhouse renewed his partnership with Bloodscream, but as Bloodscream became increasingly cannibalistic it is unlikely Roughhouse would have stayed with him as Roughhouse, while a villain, still had some sense of honor and valued human life. Sure enough, when next Wolverine encountered Bloodscream, Roughhouse was no longer with him, but was instead replaced by the cannibalistic imbecile, [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]].

==Powers and abilities==
Roughhouse possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of his unique heritage.  

Roughhouse possesses an unspecified degree of superhuman strength.  The average, full blooded, male Rock Troll can lift roughly 25 tons.  Roughhouse has demonstrated that he possesses sufficient strength to lift at least 25 tons.

Like full blooded Rock Trolls, the various tissues of Roughhouse's body have much greater density than those of ordinary humans(contributing somewhat to Roughhouse's great strength and size).  As a result, Roughhouse's body is highly resistant to conventional injury.  Roughhouse's body can withstand temperature extremes, puncture wounds, impact trauma, and high caliber machine gun shells without being injured. Even though Roughhouse can be injured, the force or weaponry required to do so would have to be considerably more powerful than most conventional materials.  It has been theorized that Roughhouse could possibly possess some form of accelerated healing powers, since enhanced healing is a common attribute of the Rock Trolls.  Roughhouse was once impaled on both sets of Wolverine's Adamantium claws and received what, otherwise, would have been fatal injuries.  A short time after receiving the injuries, roughly around five minutes, Roughhouse reappeared and was shown to have, seemingly, fully recovered.  

Roughhouse's superhuman musculature produces far less lactic acids than the musculature of ordinary humans, granting him superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities.  The average Rock Troll can exert himself/herself at peak capacity for several hours.  It is likely that Roughhouse possesses superhuman stamina operating on similar levels.

==Skills==
Aside from his superhuman powers, Roughhouse is a formidable hand to hand combatant.  He utilizes mostly street fighting techniques that let him make full use of his great size and physical strength.  He also has many connections throughout the criminal underworld, where he often hires himself out as a special enforcer.
