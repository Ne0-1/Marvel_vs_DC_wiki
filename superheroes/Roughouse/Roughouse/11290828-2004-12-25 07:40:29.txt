'''Roughhouse''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and occasional enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. 

Roughhouse was apparently a [[mutant]] with [[superhuman]] strength and endurance who worked in [[Madripoor]] as a criminal enforcer with his partner, [[Bloodscream]].  The pair worked for various unscrupulous drug lords. He often came into conflict with Wolverine, who was then operating in his alter-ego as Patch. After an encounter with a nun with healing powers, Roughhouse apparently reformed from his life of crime and retired to seclusion; however, he has been since seen partnered with Bloodscream once again.
