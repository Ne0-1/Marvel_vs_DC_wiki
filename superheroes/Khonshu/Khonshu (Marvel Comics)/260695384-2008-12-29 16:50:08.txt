'''Khonshu''' is a [[fictional character]] that has appeared in various [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Based loosely on the [[Chons|Khonshu]] of [[Egyptian mythology]] the character exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. Khonshu first appeared in ''[[Moon Knight]]''  #1 (November 1980).

He is the patron of the superhero Moon Knight. 

==Fictional character biography==

While Khonshu possessed Moon Knight durring the West Coast Avenger's Khonshu was often shown as a largely benevolent god who wanted to assist his fellow avengers.  He was at times shown to be conflicted as to if he should reveal his powers and what was worthy of it.  He was able to effortly resist being controled by the mutant The Voice and seemed very certain he could free or defeat the entire roster of the West Coast Avengers if need be but he was unable to decide if saving Hank Pym's life (whom the controled Avengers were trying to kill at the time) was worth revealing himself and giving up his mortal life.  During this period Khonshu was shown to be a largely benevolent creature who struggled between the moral choices like the worth of one man and its own desires vs the needs of others like most mortal heroes. 

Moon Knight volume #4 initially treats Khonshu in a rather different way, portraying him as a harsh and unforgiving god of vengeance who is strengthened by the fear that his avatar inspires. Accordingly, he is quite prepared to manipulate Marc Spector's allies and enemies in order to revive Moon Knight's career, and is highly critical of Spector. As with many Moon Knight stories, the line between reality and hallucination is sometimes intentionally blurred, but aspects of the art and story do strongly suggest that Khonshu's actions are entirely real.

In Volume #4, Khonshu appears as a statue, but primarily converses with Moon Knight in the mutilated form of the [[Bushman (comics)| Bushman]], who was killed when Spector carved his face off.  Khonshu calls this his 'greatest work.'

In the [[Universe X]] saga it is suggested that [[Uatu]] the Watcher who lives on the moon was the original inspiration for the Egyptian moon god Khonshu.

==In other media==
Khonshu does appear as an alternate costume for Moon Knight in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', it is however the version of Moon Knight at the time Marc Spector's body was inhabited by Khonshu.
