'''Themyscira''' is a [[fictional]] [[island]] [[nation]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. It is an alternative spelling of the [[mythological]] city [[Themiscyra]] - the capital of the [[Amazons|Amazon]] tribe in [[Greek mythology]]. The comic book version is located somewhere in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] atop a gateway to the realm of [[Tartarus]]. The immortal Amazons are charged by the gods with defending the gateway and keeping it sealed.

As a seperate tribe of Amazons took residence on the island (the Amazons of [[Bana-Mighdall]]), the word "Themyscirian" can also be used to identify a specific tribe of Amazons.

Among its residents is most notably [[Wonder Woman]]. Other prominent residents are [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], [[Donna Troy|Troia]], [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]], [[Harbinger (comics)|Harbinger]], as well as several others.

The island, prior to the [[1985]] [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], was known as '''[[Paradise Island]]''' and is generally considered to be an analog of that particular [[Bahamas|Bahamanian]] island.

Currently, Themyscira was under attack by OMAC forces, as discribed in DC Comics's
Infinite Crisis. Due to this attack, as well as the many various other attacks the island has suffered through since Diana became Wonder Woman, it was decided that the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Goddesses]] as well as the goddesses of [[Bana-Mighdall]] would transport the island and it's inhabitants (sans Diana) to an undisclosed location to live in peace.
