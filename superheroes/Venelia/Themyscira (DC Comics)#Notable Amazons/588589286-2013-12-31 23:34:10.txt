'''Themyscira''' (pronounced ''Them-mes-skera'') ({{Audio|themyscira-pronounce.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a [[fictional]] island nation in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] that is the place of origin of [[Wonder Woman]] and her sister  [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]. Known as '''Paradise Island''' since Wonder Woman and the island's first appearance in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #8 (December 1941), it was renamed "Themyscira" with the character's February 1987 relaunch in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1.<ref name="dc-ency">{{cite book |author1=Scott Beatty |author2=Alastair Dougall |author3=Robert Greenburger |author4=Daniel Wallace |title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia| url = http://books.google.com/?id=SPA3LQAACAAJ| date = 2008-09-23| publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]| isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1| oclc = 213309017| page = 132 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> The island is named after the [[mythological]] city of [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], the capital of the [[Amazons|Amazon]] tribe in [[Greek mythology]].

==Pre-Crisis (1941-1987)==
When Wonder Woman's homeland is first introduced in 1941, it is referred to as Paradise Island, a secret and hidden island inhabited by the Amazons of myth. The Amazons had grown tired of the evil ways of mankind in ancient [[Greece]] after being enslaved by Hercules and had separated themselves to this island where they could practice a peaceful way of life and cultivate their minds. With the island blessed by the [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian Gods]], no man is allowed to physically set foot on it. When [[United States Army]] intelligence officer [[Steve Trevor]]'s plane crashes there during [[World War II]], he is nursed back to health on the nearby Island of Healing by Princess Diana, daughter of the island's [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]]. Diana soon competes against other Amazons to become Wonder Woman, the representative from Paradise island who will accompany Steve back to "Man's World" and aid in the fight against the [[Axis powers]]. It is established that all Amazons are adept at a discipline called "bullets and bracelets" in which they are able to deflect bullets fired at them using the metal cuffs on their wrists.

This basic [[back-story]] remains intact throughout the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] and [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], until the 1985-1986 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline. Upon the conclusion of this [[limited series]], most characters in the DC Comics universe underwent some revamp or [[retcon]] in their storyline history, and Wonder Woman was one of several characters whose entire continuity was [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].

==Post-Crisis (1987-present)==
The 1987 relaunch of Wonder Woman establishes that the Amazons are the reincarnated souls of women slain throughout pre-history by men. Shaped from clay over 3,000 years previous and given new lives by five Olympian goddesses — [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], and [[Aphrodite]] — the Amazons are granted immortality, great physical strength, highly acute senses, beauty, wisdom, and love for one another. They are tasked to teach the merits of virtue, love, and equality to the men of "Patriarch’s World".<ref name="ww1">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> They have founded the [[city-state]] of Themyscira in ancient [[Turkey]],<ref name="ww3641">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #36 and 41</ref> which is ruled by sisters Hippolyta and [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]]. [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the God of War and a chief opponent of the Amazons, manipulates his half brother [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]] to gather forces and attack Themyscira. Heracles subdues and ravages Hippolyta, and his forces succeed in ransacking Themyscira and making the Amazons their slaves. Hippolyta pleads with the goddesses for help. Athena agrees to aid the Amazons, but only if they do not go against their purpose of creation by seeking revenge. When they agree to her terms, Athena frees the Amazons from their chains. Once freed, however, the Amazons proceed to slaughter most of their captors. Antiope leads a force of Amazons off into Greece, seeking vengeance on Heracles. As decreed by the goddesses, Hippolyta leads the remaining Amazons to a remote island where, as penance for their failures as teachers, they become guardians of Doom’s Doorway, preventing the escape of the monsters beneath. Renaming the island paradise Themyscira after their fallen capital, the Amazons began their new lives, erecting buildings and monuments and perfecting their skills as artisans and warriors.

For centuries, the Amazons of Themyscira live in a perfect state of harmony with their surroundings. They know no racism, although many consider Antiope's Lost Tribe of Amazons as little more than savages. They do not think in terms of male gender; the word "policeman" is alien to them until Diana’s departure into the outside world. Homosexuality is completely accepted — while some Amazons are chaste, others have loving consorts. Their city is composed entirely of Greco-Roman architecture from 1200&nbsp;BCE, and they wear Greek garb, togas, sandals, and period armor. The Amazons also all wear the Bracelets of Submission as constant reminders of their past, although only Diana is able to deflect bullets with them. They are fervently religious, worshipping their gods as living deities. Artemis is their primary goddess, and they worship her with a sacrifice of a deer. The Amazons celebrate their creation each year in a Feast of Five, remembering the goddesses who brought them to life.

Occasionally, the [[Nereides]] bring to the shores of Themyscira young infants who would have otherwise drowned in accidents. Called "sending forth", these infants are tutored spiritually in Amazonian ideals, and they are then sent back mystically to the place of their disappearance. [[Julia Kapatelis]], Diana's first friend in Patriarch’s World, is one such infant.

Themyscira is presently located in the [[Bermuda Triangle]], but possesses the magical ability to teleport to any location or time period its inhabitants desire.

===Enter Wonder Woman===
[[File:Hippww.PNG|thumb|[[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] uses the soil of Themyscira to create her daughter Diana. Art by [[Adam Hughes]].]]
In recent times, Hippolyta’s daughter Diana, also known as Wonder Woman, has become an ambassador to the outside world. With Diana’s help, the Amazons have opened the shores of Themyscira to dignitaries of "Patriarch’s World".  The creatures beneath Doom's Doorway were defeated, and for a time the Amazons destroyed their battle armor as testament to a new period of peace.  The Amazons opened up their shores to dignitaries from Patriarch’s world, female and male, but that exchange was almost destroyed by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], Goddess of Discord. The Amazons even conducted their own tour of the United States, where they were framed for the murders of several people by Antiope’s descendants, the mercenary assassins of [[Bana-Mighdall]], and [[Circe (comics)|Circe]]. It was during the [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]] that the Amazons recrafted their armory, vowing to once again become warriors.  Circe would transplant many of these mercenary women of Bana-Migdhall, called the ''Lost Tribe'', to Themyscira, where, after warring with the Amazons already there, joined forces to stop Circe herself.  The two sects of Amazons forged an uneasy truce, living at opposite ends of the island.

Professor [[Julia Kapatelis]], close friend to Wonder Woman and the Amazons, was later presented with a [[Grant (money)|grant]] by the [[National Geographic Society]] to locate the original Turkish city of Themyscira.<ref name="ww3641" /> Unfortunately Julia had to leave the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] mid-way through the project once one of her daughter's friends committed suicide.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #46</ref> Whether the original city of Themyscira has been fully excavated or not has not been shown.

Later still, [[Darkseid]]’s forces ravaged Themyscira during a search to locate the Greek gods, killing nearly half of the Amazons there in the process. As they began rebuilding, the Amazons found themselves reverting to stone. This was as a result of the gods’ departure from the mortal plane, and the Amazons’ connection to their creator beings so diminished as to revert their bodies to their primordial state. With the gods returned to Olympus, the Amazons were once again transformed into their flesh and blood state. Yet more Amazons were killed in a confrontation with the demonic entity known as [[Neron]].

With Diana and Hippolyta adventuring in Patriarch’s World as Wonder Woman for longer and longer periods of time, the Banas and the Themyscirans were manipulated into a bloody civil war at the hands of Magala, who had been possessed by the spirit of Antiope’s murderer, [[Ariadne]]. Using the pre-existing disdain of the tribes against each other, Magala used allies among both Amazon cities to spark the vengeful conflict. The island was left in ruins, and the war was only stopped when Hippolyta abolished the royal family, renounced her throne.

Left at odds but on even political ground, the Bana Amazons and the Themyscirans joined forces against the alien forces of [[Imperiex]]. Themyscira, mystically moved into outer space, was destroyed, and hundreds of Amazons from both tribes died.<ref name="dc-ency"/> When Wonder Woman led each tribe of Amazons into an ecumenical prayer, funneling power into the new god Darkseid, the warrior women helped destroy Imperiex and its ally [[Brainiac 13]].

===New Themyscira===
[[File:GoddessBlessings.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian]] and [[Bana-Mighdall]]ian goddesses each bless Themyscira as it is rejuvenated. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]
After the island had been destroyed by [[Imperiex]] during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' storyline, Themyscira was rebuilt and relocated once again, this time to the [[Bermuda Triangle]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> Designed by the likes of [[Julia Kapatelis]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Steve Trevor]], Canadian architect Jean Claude Tibet, and Amazon master designer Kaleeza Fashed, the new Themyscira was built with the help of alien technology. Adding to the re-creation of the islands, Themyscira was restored by the combined might of the Greek and Egyptian goddesses the Amazons worship. Transformed into a mighty series of floating islands dedicated to the free exchange of information and ideas, the new Themyscira was governed by members of both tribes of Amazons. After some time Themyscira was nearly destroyed in a jealous fit of rage by the goddess [[Hera]]. She was angry that Zeus had was magically spying on the bathing form for Artemis via scrying pool and kicked the pool itself.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Because of her actions the islands ceased to float in mid-air under their own power and instead resumed being a cluster of traditional islands once more.

Recently, Themyscira was under attack by [[OMACs|OMAC]] forces, as described in DC Comics's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Due to this attack, as well as the many various other attacks the island has suffered through since Diana became Wonder Woman, it was decided that the [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian]] and [[Bana-Mighdall]]ian goddesses would transport the island and its inhabitants (sans Diana) to an undisclosed location to live in peace.

===One year later===
Under the direction of writer [[Will Pfeifer]] the Amazons attack [[Washington D.C.]] as retaliation for the attack on the island in a six-part mini-series titled ''[[Amazons Attack]]''. At the end of the series the Amazons have their memories erased by [[Granny Goodness]] (posing as the goddess Athena), and are scattered throughout the world with false personas. Only Hippolyta and four of her original Royal Guard remain on Themyscira. The Queen is exiled to near-empty Themyscira (which had seemingly been sunk and restored during the battle) for her crimes of attacking Man's World, though her actions had been influenced by the evil Circe.

Later, Zeus then revives the Amazons' memories and provides transport for them to return to Themyscira.

===Ritual===
As shown in the comic, the Amazons hold several customs and observances. Some include:

====Courting ritual====
When an Amazon wishes to [[courtship|court]] another, the most interested Amazon presents herself before her intended mate and offers her a coconut. Inside the coconut is a nectarine seed strung onto a necklace and a bracelet made of thorns. The nectarine seed signifies a bounty, hoped for but not yet achieved. The thorn bracelet is partially wrapped in blue, red and gold ribbons. The blue represents hope, the red represents danger, and the gold represents a request to the goddess Athena to provide her blessing. The pursuer then takes out the necklace and says "''That thou art full of promise''", blesses it with a kiss, and places the necklace around her intended lover's neck. She then takes out the bracelet and says "''That thou shall know the heart of another''" and places the bracelet on her intended lover's wrist. If the person gifted chooses to accept the courtship, she then agrees to always wear the necklace and bracelet and never remove them until it can be mutually agreed upon to form a lasting relationship together. Until the two Amazons agree to finalize their relationship, the couple puts each other through a series of physical, mental and emotional tests to see if the intended relationship can withstand life's trials.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #18 and #36</ref>

====Feast of the Five====
One of the most revered observances the Themyscirian Amazons hold dear is called ''The Feast of the Five''. On this day the Amazons pay homage to the five original goddesses who took part in their creation. Aside from constant prayer and worship the occasion begins with a hunt in honor to the goddess Artemis. A harvest is also celebrated in honor of the goddess Demeter. A feast is then held in honor of the remaining goddesses. This is said to be the Themyscirians' most holy holiday. The Feast of the Five can be seen almost as a holy birthday for each of the Themyscirian Amazons, with the glory of the occasion being placed in honor to their creators.

====Hiketeia====
The Amazons observe an ancient Greek custom called [[Wonder Woman: The Hiketeia|Hiketeia]], in which one person supplicates themselves to another in exchange for sustenance and protection. The supplication does not have to be accepted once offered, but when it is accepted both parties agree to take the contract very seriously. Should either the guardian or supplicant ever falter in their duties, the [[Erinyes]], ancient and savage judgement bringers, will slaughter them instantly. When Hiketeia is offered, the supplicant says the following words to their intended guardian: "(Name of potential guardian), I am (name of potential servant). I offer myself in supplicaton to you. I come without protection. I come without means, without honor, without hope, with nothing but myself to beg for your protection. In your shadow I will serve, by your breath will I breathe, by your words will I speak, by your mercy will I live. With all my heart, with everything I can offer, I beg you, in Zeus' name, who watches over all supplicants, accept my plea."

====Send Forth====
When a female child is lost at sea, the child is rescued from drowning by the goddess [[Thetis]]. Thetis would rescue mortal female children she deemed "special" and safely transport them to the shores of Themyscira's Island of Healing. (Male children were taken someplace else.) Once on the island the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]'s chief physician Epione would discover them and tend to their care. After this the child would be taken to the royal palace where one Amazon is selected as the child's "Guardian of Inspiration". The baby is then granted great wisdom and strength of spirit via a magical kiss. According to the Amazon Pythia, [[Julia Kapatelis]] was the last of hundreds of babies to experience this in 1937. This "blessing" in actuality is a subliminal suggestion for the child to teach peace and equality throughout their lives. This blessing can extend to descendants as well. This custom is called "Send Forth". Once this is done the child is considered an Amazon and spiritual daughter to the Amazon who blessed them. After a few days of recuperation and blessings, the child is taken to the island shores again, where she is taken back into the ocean and returned, again by Thetis who magically travels back in time to return the child to the exact point in time when the child first left her homeland.<ref>''Wonder Woman Annual'' #1 (1988)</ref>

====Union with the Earth====
All Themyscirian Amazons possesses the ability to relieve their bodies of physical injury and toxins by becoming one with the Earth's soil and then reforming their bodies whole again.<ref name="ww30">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #30</ref> The first time Diana does this she prays to her god [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] saying: "''Gaea, I pray to you. Grant me your strength. You are the Earth who suckled me, who nurtured and bred me. Through you all life is renewed. The circle which never ends. I pray you, mother Gaea, take me into your bosom. Please, let me be worthy.''" This is a very sacred ritual to the Themyscirians, only to be used in the most dire of circumstances.<ref name="ww120">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #120</ref>

====Death====
Originally a cavern was built under the Amazons' Temple of the Dead, which is where those dead are remembered. After an Amazon's funeral is completed, the body is lowered into the cavern where it is laid to rest in a city of the dead. Queen Hippolyta assigns the chief temple priestess to remain alone in the city to watch over the dead for a thousand years before a replacement is made.

This tradition was later changed as the Amazons discovered that the priestess often went mad in her solitude. One such priestess brought the dead to life through the use of magic during a mad outburst. The Amazons soon after burned their dead, during which the souls of the slain Amazons took form among the flames before traveling onto the plane of afterlife called the Elysian Fields.

==Creatures==

===Pre-Crisis===
When the Wonder Woman comic book was first introduced Paradise Island possessed giant [[kangaroo]]s that the Amazons rode like horses called [[Kanga (comics)|Kangas]]. Diana's Kanga was named Jumpa.

===Post-Crisis===
When the comic book was revamped and started anew in the mid-1980s this was scrapped and the island only had common game animals such as deer, wild boar, horses, and fish. The only exotic/mythological creatures on the island were more sinister in nature and existed in Doom's Doorway to the underworld, which the Amazons swore to keep trapped and never to escape. In the waters surrounding Themyscira also lived [[Naiad]]s and in the forests [[Dryad]]s who played most of their days away, occasionally with the Amazons.

In 1999 when writer [[Eric Luke]] took over the Wonder Woman comic book he had several lost mythical creatures from around the globe take asylum on Themyscira. These creatures consisted of: [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], a white [[Pegasus]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]] the [[Dragon]], a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]], and a [[Sphinx]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #142</ref>

Then when writer [[Phil Jimenez]] wrote the title in the early 2000s he had several [[dinosaur]]s from the land of [[Skartaris]] also take refuge on Themyscira, in addition to the reappearance of Kangas on the island. To date no Kangas have been seen as riding animals.

Writer [[Greg Rucka]] reintroduced a second [[Pegasus]] to serve as Wonder Woman's riding companion, this one black with red eyes. It is assumed he still lives on Themyscira.

In 2003, a flashback story by [[Matt Wagner]], [[Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity]] has the island defended by sapient giant birds. They perish in the defense of the Amazons.

The 2007 storyline ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' depicted the Amazons as having creatures such as giant Stygen [[wasp]]s and some domesticated winged horses, large amounts of saddled [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]], and 3 titan sized [[ogre]]s. Then in 2007/2008 the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' storyline introduced the then new revelation that the island is protected by a school of [[Megalodon]]s.

When writer [[Gail Simone]] took over the title she showed that Hippolyta cared for [[griffin]]s in the royal stables. She also introduced the island of [[Thalarion]], the home of [[Gargareans]] during the ''[[Rise of the Olympian]]'' storyline. The Gargareans possessed herds of winged horses similar to Themyscira but also possessed flocks of winged lions as well. Their leader [[Warkiller|Achilles]] also has a domesticated battle elephant named Mysia who has two trunks, two mouths, three glowing eyes, an impenetrable hide, and the ability to walk on air. As the Gargareans incorporated themselves among the Amazons of Themyscira it is safe to assume these creatures also reside there.

==In other media==
[[File:AnimatedThemyscira.jpg|thumb|Themyscira as shown in the 2010 film ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]''.]]
In the television movie ''Wonder Woman'' ([[1974 in film|1974]]) starring actress [[Cathy Lee Crosby]], the island of the Amazons is shown briefly but not named. In line with comic book continuity of the time, the 1975-1979 [[Lynda Carter]] television series ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''  did feature Themyscira but it was called "Paradise Island" instead as Wonder Woman's home in several episodes. Paradise Island also appeared on the animated television series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', in the 1978 episode "Secret Origins of the Superfriends", and ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', in the 1980 episode "Return of Atlantis".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Post-1987, Themyscira appeared in several episodes of the [[Warner Brothers]] animated television series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' between 2001 and 2006 as the homeland of Wonder Woman. Themyscira is one of the playable stages in the 2008 video game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', with a number of Amazons appearing in several cut scenes. Themyscira is also a playable stage in the 2013 video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', represented as a mountaintop temple and a port area. The island was mentioned in the 2004 ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' episode "Asylum", in which a newspaper headline reads "Themysciran Queen Addresses the Vatican".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Themyscira is shown in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' ([[2008 in film|2008]]), in which Wonder Woman spars with a fellow Amazon on a beach.
