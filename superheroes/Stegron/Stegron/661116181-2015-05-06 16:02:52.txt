'''Stegron the Dinosaur Man''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] super-villain, primarily an antagonist of [[Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Vincent Stegron was hired by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to work with [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to study [[DNA]] of dinosaurs from the [[Savage Land]]. Inspired by the experiment that turned Connors into the Lizard, Stegron stole some dinosaur DNA and injected himself with it. In moments Stegron transformed into an orange semi-humanoid ''[[Stegosaurus]]''-like creature. Stegron gained the ability to command real dinosaurs, and he planned to use them in his plans for conquest of the world and converting all of humanity into creatures like himself. Taking several dinosaurs with him from the Savage Land to New York City, he encountered Spider-Man, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]. During the battle that followed, Stegron was beaten by being knocked into a nearby river.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #19–20</ref>

Months later, Stegron returned and blackmailed Connors into helping him restore several dinosaur remains from a museum. Connors did what Stegron asked and accidentally turned into the Lizard. The two reptiles clashed as Spider-Man arrived and put Stegron into hibernation using the extremely cold temperatures the weather was producing.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #165–166</ref>

Months later Stegron, now back in his human form, woke from hibernation and wandered New York. During a battle between the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] and Spider-Man, Stegron regained his powers and joined many of Spider-Man's enemies (including [[Doctor Octopus]], Vulture, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Answer (comics)#Answer (Aaron Nicholson)|Answer]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Ringer (comics)|Strikeback]], and [[Leila Davis|Hardshell]]) in an all out battle to defeat him. Stegron was knocked unconscious and was taken in by the authorities.<ref>''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1–4</ref>

Stegron eventually returned to the Savage Land, where he took over a S.H.I.E.L.D. installation which drew the attention of Thunderstrike, Black Widow, and Black Panther. During the battle over the installation, Stegron was forced into an extremely cold environment and again went into hibernation.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #20</ref> Sometime later, Stegron managed to awaken from his slumber and terrorized [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] (who was illegally drilling in the Savage Land). Soon, Stegron was opposed by Ka-Zar, [[Shanna the She-Devil]], and Spider-Man. During the battle, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and a gigantic bird/ox-like creature known as [[Chtylok]] arrived and helped Stegron fight Roxxon Oil. The heroes joined forces with Stegron when they realized he was trying to protect the Savage Land. Eventually, Stegron managed to scare the Roxxon agents and was left in peace in the Savage Land.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #13–15</ref>

Sometime later, Stegron (reverted to his human form) exiled himself to wander the Arctic Circle when he stumbled upon the Rock of Life. Inspired by its de-evolving abilities, he took it with him back to New York where he slowly began to transform back into his dinosaur form. He then sent the Rock to a friend of his, who then put it on display at the Museum of Natural History in hopes that it would devolve the inhabitants of New York City into prehistoric creatures like himself with him as their leader. As a result, various heroes and villains with connections to the animal kingdom such as Spider-Man, [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], Vulture, Lizard, [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]], and [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]] were affected by its power, causing an increase in their savagery. Spider-Man maintained control, and he discovered Stegron's plans at the museum where the two battled. With the help of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]], Spider-Man managed to stop the Rock's powers from reaching others in New York using a piece of his armor. He then beat Stegron into submission. Stegron was then taken into custody by the authorities as the [[Fantastic Four]] placed the Rock in a secure vault in the Baxter Building.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #23–27</ref>

Stegron again returned to the Savage Land, but shortly after his return, Roxxon Oil attacked again, intent on obtaining [[vibranium]]. Stegron was recruited by Ka-Zar and [[Brainchild (comics)|Brainchild]] to help fight the attackers.<ref>''Marvel Comics Present'' (vol. 2) #6–7</ref>

Stegron was later seen in the [[Negative Zone]]'s Prison during ''[[Secret Invasion]]''.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #3</ref> Somehow, he escaped and returned to the Savage Land. While there he happened upon the starving [[Devil Dinosaur]], who had slumped into a depression after his companion [[Moon-Boy]] was kidnapped by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. Fearing for the survival of the beast (as it was the last of its species), Stegron left the Savage Land without informing Ka-Zar to wage war on S.H.I.E.L.D. Building an army of reanimated dinosaurs, Stegron marched across the US, attacking military base after base, searching for the missing primate. He met little opposition. His only serious challenge coming from attacks by the [[Fifty State Initiative]]. Eventually, due to the help of their new recruit [[Reptil]], Stegron was defeated and taken into custody. Learning the motive behind his attack, they agreed to return Moon Boy to the Savage Land to be reunited with his companion.<ref>''Avengers the Initiative: Featuring Reptil''</ref>

Stegron then tries to turn of all of humanity into dinosaurs with the help of [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], but the duo's plans are unraveled by their own infighting, purposely exacerbated by their mutual crush, Shark Girl.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 10 December 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Elliott Kalan|penciller = Marco Failla|inker = Marco Failla|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Clayton Cowles|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Spider-Man and the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = 28 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>
