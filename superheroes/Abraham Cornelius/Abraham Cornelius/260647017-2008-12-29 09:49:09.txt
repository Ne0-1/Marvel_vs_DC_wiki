'''Doctor Abraham Cornelius''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  He was first mentioned in [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s eight page preview prequel chapter to the original "[[Weapon X Saga]]" in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #72 but first appeared in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #73 (March 1991).

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Cornelius, one of the senior scientists for Weapon X, is employed by the mysterious [[Professor Thornton]]. Some time after World War II, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] is taken in by the project and Cornelius is assigned with the task of perfecting and using a technique that would bond the indestructible alloy [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] to human bone cells. This adamantium-bonding process was first created by [[Lord Dark Wind]] ([[Lady Deathstrike]]'s father), but is only put into use after being perfected by Cornelius when he succeeds in bonding Logan's skeleton with adamantium, after which Logan is indoctrinated into the Weapon X assassin program.

Years later, Japanese crimelord Matsu'o Tsurayaba and his allies, including former Weapon X scientist Doctor Cornelius, resurrect the Russian super-soldier [[Omega Red]]. In order to stabilize his mutant power, Omega Red requires the Carbonadium Synthesizer, a device stolen from him by Team X decades earlier. Omega Red captures Wolverine, who had the location of the C-Synthesizer buried in his memory, and several of Wolverine's teammates in the X-Men. [[David North (comics)|Maverick]] is hired by former Team X liaison Major Arthur Barrington to prevent Omega Red from obtaining the device, and he tracks another former Team X member, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], to Omega Red's location. With Maverick's help, the X-Men are able to defeat the villains, and Matsu'o subsequently kills Cornelius in an act of revenge.

==Ultimate Doctor Cornelius==
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Doctor Cornelius plays a much larger role than his mainstream counterpart.  He first appeared in the [[Ultimate X-Men]] story arc ''Return to Weapon-X''.

In this version, Doctor Cornelius along with his benefactor, Colonel [[Kestrel (comics)|John Wraith]] heads up the Weapon X Program.  Unlike his benefactor though, he does not seem to harbor any anti-mutant sentiments, but he merely wishes to conduct experiments on mutants to indulge his own curiosities. The Weapon X Program is sanctioned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during the [[Gulf War]] and results with the creation of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], their greatest achievement ever. After Wolverine escapes, Weapon X capturs several other mutants to be his replacements and eventually captures the X-Men as well. In their captivity, Cornelius augments the [[Beast (comics)#Ultimate Beast|Beast]]'s natural abilities along with giving him a keen sense of smell. This procedure causes Beast to transform even more by growing blue fur all over his body and growing claws on his hands and feet. After Wraith is killed by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and Weapon X is shut down by S.H.I.E.L.D., Cornelius' whereabouts are unknown. It is not confirmed if he has anything to do with the rogue Weapon X agents led by Tara who hunt Wolverine all over Manhattan and participate with the coup against the President of the United States.

Later on, he recruits the [[quadriplegic]] [[Lady Deathstrike]] and offers her a chance of revenge against [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the person who is responsible for her present condition. He splices some of Wolverine's DNA with hers which gives her a healing factor that is twice as fast as Wolverine's and also bonds her shattered body with adamantium. Cornelius' true objective however is to capture Wolverine since he is accompanied by Storm at that time and he uses that fact to manipulate Deathstrike. His attempts, however, end in failure with Deathstrike being captured and imprisoned in the [[Triskelion]] and his chopper being blown up. He is presumed dead.

It has recently been revealed that he survived the helicopter crash but has been horribly disfigured. He is responsible for [[Sabretooth (comics)#Ultimate Sabretooth|Sabretooth]]'s latest attack on Wolverine in order to gain a tissue sample. The attack works and Corenelius is shown planning to use the flesh to clone a more a compliant Wolverine.

Apart from the scarring, Ultimate Doctor Cornelius resembles Professor Thorton, the original director of the Weapon X project in the mainstream universe.

A retcon in ''[[Ultimate Origins]]'' reveals that Cornelius's experiments on Wolverine created the mutant gene, which he claims is how humanity will survive.
