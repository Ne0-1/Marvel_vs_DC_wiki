'''Blaze''' and '''Satanus''' are [[demon]]ic [[supervillain]] siblings in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].

Blaze was introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #655 (July 1990), although she had been working behind the scenes before this, being involved in the creation of [[Superman]] villains [[Silver Banshee]] and [[Skyhook]]. A red-skinned demoness, with horns, she disguised herself as [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]] nightclub owner Angelica Blaze to steal souls. Superman followed her to [[Hell]] to fight for the souls of [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Perry White]]'s son Jerry.

The ''Demon War'' storyline beginning in ''Adventures of Superman'' #493 (Aug 1992) introduced Blaze's brother Lord Satanus (possibly named after pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] magician/vilain Lord Satanis). Lord Satanus also resembled a traditional demon, save that he wore a heavy Roman-style helmet, and either had black skin or the helmet buried his face in shadow.

They fought for posession of Blaze's domain, using Superman as a pawn. At the end of the story it was revealed that Satanus was disguised as Colin Thornton, the publisher of ''Newstime'' magazine, who first appeared in Nov 1989, and had previously hired Clark Kent as editor.

Blaze also featured in ''[[The Power of Shazam]]'', where she took a new mortal guise as the mob boss of Fawcett City. Her plans for the city (and the [[Rock of Eternity]] connected to it) were foiled by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. The story also revealed that she and Satanus were only half-demons, their father being the wizard [[Shazam]], and that it was Blaze who corrupted [[Black Adam]].

Lord Satanus, meanwhile, had created DMN, a magical drug that transformed people into demons, which he arranged to be sent to areas of the world where people were in desperate straits. After the Fall of Metropolis, the city became one of these areas. Horrified by what had befallen his home, Satanus sent a disguised magical message to [[Zatanna]], who used Perry White and Superman's knowledge of the city to restore it. Satanus would use the DMN addicts again, however, to distract Shazam from detecting his presence when the wizard visited Metropolis.

Following [[Brainiac]]-13's recreation of Metropolis, Satanus made an ambitious effort to capture the soul of the entire city. Superman offered his own soul in exchange, but eventually thwarted Satanus with the help of a young psychic and a mysterious shamaness named Night Eagle whom, it was implied, might be Blaze.

Satanus' identity as Colin Thornton remains a secret, and both he and Blaze remain behind the scenes
