'''Blaze''' and '''Satanus''' are [[fictional characters]], [[demon]]ic [[supervillain]] siblings in the {{DC Universe}}. Both are the half-demon children of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] and an unnamed demoness.

==Publication history==
Satanus first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #527 (January 1982), and was created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Curt Swan]]. Blaze first appeared first in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #655 (July 1990), and was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]]. 

==Fictional character biographies==
====Lord Satanus====
First appeared in Action Comics #527 created by Marv Wolfman and Curt Swan in a story titled, "Sorcery over Stonehenge". We also meet Satanus's wife, Syrene. Lord Satanus resembled a traditional demon, save that he wore a heavy Roman-style helmet, and either had black skin or the helmet buried his face in shadow. The ''Demon War'' storyline<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #493 (Aug. 1992)</ref> reintroduced him as Blaze's brother. They fought for possession of Blaze's domain, using Superman as a pawn. At the end of the story it was revealed that Satanus was disguised as '''Colin Thornton''', the publisher of ''Newstime'' magazine, who first appeared in Nov. 1989, and had previously hired Clark Kent as editor.

====Blaze====
Blaze was introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #655 (July 1990), although she had been working behind the scenes before this, being involved in the creation of [[Superman]] villains [[Silver Banshee]] and Skyhook. A red-skinned demoness with horns, she disguises herself as [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]] nightclub owner '''Angelica Blaze''' to steal souls. Superman follows her to [[Hell]] to fight for the souls of [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Perry White]]'s son Jerry (who in fact was a son of Perry's wife and Lex Luthor). Superman manages to save Jimmy Olsen, but Blaze succeeds in killing Jerry White, whose selfless sacrifice saves his soul.

====Wizard Shazam====
Blaze later appeared in [[Fawcett City]] where she took a new mortal guise as a mob boss. Her plans for the city (and the Rock of Eternity connected to it) were foiled by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Marvel Family]]. The story also revealed that she and Satanus were only half-demons, their father being the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], and that it was Blaze who corrupted [[Black Adam]] (this was later retconned).

====DMN====
Lord Satanus, meanwhile, had created [[List of comic book drugs#DMN|DMN]], a magical drug that transformed people into demons, which he arranged to be sent to areas of the world where people were in desperate straits. After the Fall of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the city became one of these areas. Horrified by what had befallen his home, Satanus sent a disguised magical message to [[Zatanna]], who used Perry White and Superman's knowledge of the city to restore it. Satanus would use the DMN addicts again, however, to distract Shazam from detecting his presence when the wizard visited Metropolis.

Following [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac-13's]] recreation of Metropolis, Satanus made an ambitious effort to capture the soul of the entire city. Superman offered his own soul in exchange, but eventually thwarted Satanus with the help of a young psychic and a mysterious shaman named Night Eagle who, it was implied, might be Blaze.

In another appearance, Lord Satanus appeared in the ''Reign of Emperor Joker'' arc of the Superman titles. In this appearance, he dwelled in that reality's Hell (a literal flaming place accommodated to include annoying songs) and offered the angelic Supergirl and the somewhat-brainwashed Superboy their heart's desires in exchange for their souls, much like his fellow demon Neron, after they had been killed by a blast fired by the monstruous Ignition. He commented that, much like God, he was forced to live in all realities and dimensions simultaneously. At the end, when Supergirl annoyed him with her incessant prayer, he shunted them to life, commenting there were not many Hells he could send them that were worse than the Joker's world.

====Day of Vengeance====

Satanus recently revealed to Superman that he was Colin Thornton when the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] arrived in Metropolis, as part of his mission to destroy all evil magic during the ''Day of Vengeance'' miniseries. Whether Lord Satanus was destroyed or not was not revealed. He does appear at the magician's seance to summon the Spectre during Infinite Crisis. More recently in DC Nation, it is shown a Christmas Wishlist of chatacters and Satanus and Neron are both shown wanting control over hell and it being written in that may be a problem.

====Reign in Hell====
Blaze and Satanus are major characters in the ''Reign in Hell'' storyline (June 2008). In this story they have become the rulers of [[Purgatory]] and lead a rebellion against Hell by offering "hope to the hopeless". They are opposed by [[Neron]], and other demonic characters from the DCU.
