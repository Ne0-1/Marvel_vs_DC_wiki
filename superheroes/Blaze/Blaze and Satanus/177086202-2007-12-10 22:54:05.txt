'''Blaze''' and '''Satanus''' are [[fictional characters]], [[demon]]ic [[supervillain]] siblings in the {{DC Universe}}. Both are the half-demon children of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] and an unnamed demoness.

==Publication history==
Blaze first appeared first in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #655 (July 1990), and was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]]. Satanus first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #493 (August 1992), and was created by writer [[Jerry Ordway]] and [[Tom Grummett]]. Blaze also featured in ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]''.

==Fictional character biographies==
====Blaze====
Blaze was introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #655 (July 1990), although she had been working behind the scenes before this, being involved in the creation of [[Superman]] villains [[Silver Banshee]] and Skyhook. A red-skinned demoness with horns, she disguised herself as [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]] nightclub owner '''Angelica Blaze''' to steal souls. Superman followed her to [[Hell]] to fight for the souls of [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Perry White]]'s son Jerry.

====Lord Satanus====
The ''Demon War'' storyline<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #493 (Aug 1992)</ref> introduced Blaze's brother Lord Satanus (possibly named after pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] magician/villain Lord Satanis). Lord Satanus also resembled a traditional demon, save that he wore a heavy Roman-style helmet, and either had black skin or the helmet buried his face in shadow.

They fought for possession of Blaze's domain, using Superman as a pawn. At the end of the story it was revealed that Satanus was disguised as '''Colin Thornton''', the publisher of ''Newstime'' magazine, who first appeared in Nov 1989, and had previously hired Clark Kent as editor.

====Wizard Shazam====
Blaze later appeared in [[Fawcett City]] where she took a new mortal guise as a mob boss. Her plans for the city (and the Rock of Eternity connected to it) were foiled by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Marvel Family]]. The story also revealed that she and Satanus were only half-demons, their father being the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], and that it was Blaze who corrupted [[Black Adam]] (this was later retconned).

====DMN====
Lord Satanus, meanwhile, had created [[List of comic book drugs#DMN|DMN]], a magical drug that transformed people into demons, which he arranged to be sent to areas of the world where people were in desperate straits. After the Fall of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the city became one of these areas. Horrified by what had befallen his home, Satanus sent a disguised magical message to [[Zatanna]], who used Perry White and Superman's knowledge of the city to restore it. Satanus would use the DMN addicts again, however, to distract Shazam from detecting his presence when the wizard visited Metropolis.

Following [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac-13's]] recreation of Metropolis, Satanus made an ambitious effort to capture the soul of the entire city. Superman offered his own soul in exchange, but eventually thwarted Satanus with the help of a young psychic and a mysterious shaman named Night Eagle who, it was implied, might be Blaze.

====Day of Vengeance====
{{main|Day of Vengeance}}
Satanus recently revealed to Superman that he was Colin Thornton when the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] arrived in Metropolis, as part of his mission to destroy all evil magic during the ''Day of Vengeance'' miniseries. Whether Lord Satanus was destroyed or not was not revealed. He does appear at the magician's seance to summon the Spectre during Infinite Crisis; however, this could be an editorial error.
