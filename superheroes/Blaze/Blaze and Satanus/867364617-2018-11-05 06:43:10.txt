==Fictional character biographies==
Blaze and Satanus are the human-demon hybrid children of the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] and an unnamed demoness.

===Satanus===
Satanus is a brother to the demon '''Blaze'''. Satanus resembles a traditional demon, with large horns that protrude from the front of his head and dark red skin. He wears a heavy Roman-style helmet which buries his face in shadow. Blaze and Satanus fight each other for possession of Blaze's domain, using Superman as a pawn. Satanus has an earthly identity and disguises himself as '''Colin Thornton''', the publisher of ''Newstime'' magazine, who had previously hired Clark Kent as editor.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #493 (August 1992)</ref>

===Blaze===
Blaze is involved in the creation of [[Superman]]'s enemies [[Silver Banshee]] and Skyhook. A red-skinned demoness with horns, she disguises herself as [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] nightclub owner '''Angelica Blaze''' in order to steal souls. Superman follows her to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] to fight for the souls of [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Perry White]]'s son Jerry (who in fact was the son of Perry's wife Alice and [[Lex Luthor]]). Superman manages to save Jimmy Olsen, but Blaze succeeds in killing Jerry White, whose selfless sacrifice saves his soul.<ref>''Action Comics'' #655 (July 1990)</ref>

===''Underworld Unleashed''===
{{main|Underworld Unleashed}}
Blaze and Satanus are two of the many supervillains involved in the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. Both are pawns in the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]'s plans to give many of the DC Universe's supervillains-and superheroes-their heart's desires in exchange for their immortal souls or for completing a task for him.<ref>Their appearances in the crossover event are, in approximately chronological order, ''Fate'' #13 (November 1995), ''Fate'' #14 and ''Underworld Unleashed: Abyss-Hell's Sentinel'' #1 (both December 1995), ''Primal Force'' #13-14 (November-December 1995) and ''Underworld Unleashed'' #3 (late December 1995)</ref>

===''Day of Vengeance''===
{{main|Day of Vengeance}}
Satanus reveals to Superman that he is Colin Thornton when the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] arrives in Metropolis as part of his mission to destroy all evil magic during the ''Day of Vengeance'' miniseries as part of Alexander Luthor Jr.'s plot.<ref>''Action Comics'' #832 (December 2005)</ref>

===''Reign in Hell'' and afterward===
{{main|Reign in Hell}}

Blaze and Satanus are major characters in the eight-issue ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries (September 2008-April 2009). In this story they have become the rulers of [[Purgatory]] and lead a rebellion against Hell by offering "hope to the hopeless", which has never happened before. They are opposed by Neron, other demons and the magical superheroes of the DCU.<ref>''DC Universe Special: Reign in Hell'' #1 (August 2008) and ''Reign in Hell'' #1-8 (September 2008-April 2009)</ref>

Blaze contacts [[Mary Marvel]], offering to restore her lost powers in exchange for killing [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] so that she can have his powers. Mary appears to go along with it, seemingly poisoning Freddy; however, when Blaze arrives, Freddy gets up and fights her, eventually impaling her on an iron statue and using his lightning to send her back to Hell. Now Blaze seems to be interested in manipulating Osiris.<ref>''Shazam!'' #1 (January 2011)</ref>

Satanus sends the Justice League to Hell, where the League thwarts Satanus' plans to get the nine pieces of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s mask. Satanus attempts to use the mask to become all-powerful, but is prevented by [[Plastic Man]], who is possessed by the mask. The mask is then destroyed by the combined efforts of the League and [[Zauriel]] helps the League escape Hell.<ref>''Justice League of America 80-Page Giant 2011''</ref>

==Other versions==
An alternate version of Blaze and (presumably) Satanus appear as creations of [[Lex Luthor]] to use against Superman in ''[[Superman: Red Son]]''.
