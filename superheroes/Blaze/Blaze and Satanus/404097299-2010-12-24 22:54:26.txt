==Publication history==
Satanus first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #527 (January 1982), and was created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Curt Swan]], as Satanis. Blaze first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #655 (July 1990), and was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]].

==Fictional character biographies==
Blaze and Satanus  are the half-demon children of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] and an unnamed demoness.

====Lord Satanis====
In [[Pre-Crisis]] DC Comics continuity, a character named Lord Satanis first appeared ''[[Action Comics]]'' #527, in a story titled "Sorcery Over Stonehenge". The character was created by Marv Wolfman and Curt Swan and was a powerful sorcerer from a million years in the future. Lord Satanis has a wife named Syrene and the two are engaged in a battle for [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin's]] runestone, an artifact that will make one of them extremely powerful and allow them to rule the earth. In a later story, which ran from Action Comics #534 (August 1982) to #541 (March 1983), Lord Satanis and Syrene split Superman in half and separate the two Superman by sending one to the distant past. After one of the Supermen has been apparently killed, Lord Satanis possesses his body and uses it to fight Syrene and Superman's other half. At the conclusion of the story, Superman sends Satanis and Syrene back to their own time.

====Lord Satanus====
In the [[Post-Crisis]] DC Universe, the character is reintroduced as Lord Satanus in the ''Demon War'' storyline <ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #493 (Aug. 1992)</ref>. In this version he is a brother to the demonic Blaze. Lord Satanus resembles a traditional demon, with large horns that protrude from the front of his head and dark red skin. He wears a heavy Roman-style helmet which buries his face in shadow. Blaze and Satanus fight each other for possession of Blaze's domain, using Superman as a pawn. At the end of the story it is revealed that Satanus has an earthly identity and disguises himself as '''Colin Thornton''', the publisher of ''Newstime'' magazine, who first appeared in Nov. 1989, and had previously hired Clark Kent as editor.

====Blaze====
Blaze first appears in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #655 (July 1990), although she has been working behind the scenes before this, being involved in the creation of [[Superman]] villains [[Silver Banshee]] and Skyhook. A red-skinned demoness with horns, she disguises herself as [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] nightclub owner '''Angelica Blaze''' to steal souls. Superman follows her to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] to fight for the souls of [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Perry White]]'s son Jerry (who in fact was the son of Perry's wife Alice and [[Lex Luthor]]). Superman manages to save Jimmy Olsen, but Blaze succeeds in killing Jerry White, whose selfless sacrifice saves his soul.

====Wizard Shazam====
Blaze later appeared in [[Fawcett City]] where she took a new mortal guise as a mob boss. Her plans for the city (and the Rock of Eternity connected to it) were foiled by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Marvel Family]]. The story also revealed that she and Satanus were only half-demons, their father being the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] who had been seduced by a demoness thousands of years ago, and that it was Blaze who corrupted [[Black Adam]] and made a deal with Set to get him powers from Egyptian gods(this was later retconned).

====DMN and Emperor Joker====
Lord Satanus, meanwhile, creates [[List of comic book drugs#DMN|DMN]], a magical drug that transforms people into demons, which he arranges to be sent to areas of the world where people are in desperate straits. After the Fall of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the city becomes one of these areas. Horrified by what has befallen his home, Satanus sends a disguised magical message to [[Zatanna]], who uses Perry White and Superman's knowledge of the city to restore it. Satanus uses the DMN addicts again, however, to distract Shazam from detecting his presence when the wizard visits Metropolis.

Following [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac-13's]] recreation of Metropolis, Satanus makes an ambitious effort to capture the soul of the entire city. Superman offers his own soul in exchange, but eventually thwarts Satanus with the help of a young psychic and a mysterious shaman named Night Eagle who, it was implied, might be Blaze in disguise.

Lord Satanus later appears in the ''Reign of Emperor Joker'' arc of the Superman titles. In this story, he dwells in that reality's Hell (a literal flaming place accommodated to include annoying songs) where he offers the angelic Supergirl and the somewhat-brainwashed Superboy their heart's desires in exchange for their souls after they are killed by a blast fired by the monstrous Ignition. Satanus comments that, much like God, he is forced to live in all realities and dimensions simultaneously. At the end, when Supergirl annoys him with her incessant prayer, he shunts them to life, saying there were not many Hells he could send them to that were worse than the Joker's world.

====Day of Vengeance====

Satanus revals to Superman that he is Colin Thornton when the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] arrives in Metropolis as part of his mission to destroy all evil magic during the ''Day of Vengeance'' miniseries as part of Alexander Luthor's plot.

====Reign in Hell====
Blaze and Satanus are major characters in the ''Reign in Hell'' storyline (June 2008). In this story they have become the rulers of [[Purgatory]] and lead a rebellion against Hell by offering "hope to the hopeless", which has never happened before. They are opposed by [[Neron]], and other demonic characters from the DCU.

At the conclusion of the story they appear triumphant. Blaze then betrays her brother, and is now sole ruler of Hell.

Blaze later appears to [[Kid Devil|Eddie Bloomberg]], who had recently lost his Neron-spawned powers, and offers him a new contract, with his demonic powers now irrevocable, but with the same price of servitude as Neron's contract. [[Kid Eternity]] intervenes and summons Eddie's Aunt Marla, who convinces Eddie not to take the contract.

==Other versions==
An alternate version of Blaze and (presumably) Satanus appear as creations of [[Lex Luthor]] to use against Superman in [[Superman: Red Son]].
