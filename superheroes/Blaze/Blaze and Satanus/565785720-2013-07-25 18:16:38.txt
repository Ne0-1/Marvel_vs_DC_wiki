==Fictional character biographies==
Blaze and Satanus  are the half-demon children of the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] and an unnamed demoness.

===Lord Satanis===
Lord Satanis is powerful sorcerer from a million years in the future. Lord Satanis battles his wife, Syrene, for [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin's]] runestone. The artifact will make one of them extremely powerful and allow them to rule Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #527 (January 1982)</ref>

Later, Lord Satanis and Syrene split Superman in half and separate the two Supermen by sending one to the distant past. After one of the Supermen is killed, Lord Satanis possesses the body and uses it to fight Syrene and Superman's other half. Superman defeats Satanis and sends Satanis and Syrene back to their own time.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #534-541 (August 1982-March 1983)</ref>

===Lord Satanus===
Lord Satanus is a brother to the demon '''Blaze'''. Lord Satanus resembles a traditional demon, with large horns that protrude from the front of his head and dark red skin. He wears a heavy Roman-style helmet which buries his face in shadow. Blaze and Satanus fight each other for possession of Blaze's domain, using Superman as a pawn. Satanus has an earthly identity and disguises himself as '''Colin Thornton''', the publisher of ''Newstime'' magazine, who had previously hired Clark Kent as editor.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #493 (August 1992)</ref> Lord Satanus was created with NO relationship to Satanis.

===Blaze===
Blaze is involved in the creation of [[Superman]]'s enemies [[Silver Banshee]] and Skyhook. A red-skinned demoness with horns, she disguises herself as [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] nightclub owner '''Angelica Blaze''' to steal souls. Superman follows her to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] to fight for the souls of [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Perry White]]'s son Jerry (who in fact was the son of Perry's wife Alice and [[Lex Luthor]]). Superman manages to save Jimmy Olsen, but Blaze succeeds in killing Jerry White, whose selfless sacrifice saves his soul.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #655 (July 1990)</ref>

Satanus reveals to Superman that he is Colin Thornton when the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] arrives in Metropolis as part of his mission to destroy all evil magic during the ''Day of Vengeance'' miniseries as part of Alexander Luthor's plot.<ref>''Action Comics'' #832 (December 2005)</ref>

===Reign in Hell===
{{main|Reign in Hell}}
Blaze and Satanus are major characters in the ''Reign in Hell'' storyline (June 2008). In this story they have become the rulers of [[Purgatory]] and lead a rebellion against Hell by offering "hope to the hopeless", which has never happened before. They are opposed by [[Neron]], and other demonic characters from the DCU.

Blaze contacts [[Mary Marvel]], offering to restore her lost powers in exchange for killing [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] so that she can have his powers. Mary appears to go along with it, seemingly poisoning Freddy; However, when Blaze arrives, Freddy gets up and fights her, eventually impaling her on an iron statue, and using his lighting to send her back to Hell. Now Blaze seems to be interested in manipulating Osiris.<ref>''Shazam!'' #1 (January 2011)</ref>

Satanus sends Justice League to Hell, where the League thwarts Satanus' plans to bring the nine pieces of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s mask. Satanus attempts to use the mask to become powerful but is prevented by Plastic Man, who is possessed by the mask. The mask is then destroyed by the combined efforts of the League and [[Zauriel]] helps the League escape Hell.<ref>''Justice League of America 80-Page Giant 2011''</ref>

==Other versions==
An alternate version of Blaze and (presumably) Satanus appear as creations of [[Lex Luthor]] to use against Superman in [[Superman: Red Son]].
