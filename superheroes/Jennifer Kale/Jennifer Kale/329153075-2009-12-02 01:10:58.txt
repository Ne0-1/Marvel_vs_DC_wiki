'''Jennifer Kale''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Publication history==
Jennifer Kale was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Val Mayerik]], and debuted in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #11 (December 1972). She is the cousin of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]s [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Danny Ketch]], and a founding member of the [[Legion of Night]]. She is based on one of Gerber's friends, Jennifer Meyer.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}  She has appeared as a supporting character of [[Doctor Strange]] and her connection to [[Man-Thing]] is strong enough that she knows his true identity and sometimes calls him "Ted".

==Fictional character biography==
Zhered-Na, who was named for Gerber's then-girlfriend, Edna{{Fact|date=January 2008}}, was a sorceress in [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] circa 18,000 BC. Exiled by emperor [[Kamuu]] for her prophecy that Atlantis would sink, Zhered-Na was relocated to the mainland Thurian continent where she taught about her god Valka. These lessons spawned the Cult of Zhered-Na. When the star-spanning [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] caused the Great Cataclysm, sinking Atlantis, Zhered-Na was killed by a pawn of the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demonic]] [[Dweller-in-Darkness]]. Zhered-Na's former apprentice, [[Dakimh the Enchanter|Dakimh]], continued her teachings and perpetuated the Cult throughout his extended lifespan. Centuries ago, an unnamed demon and angel shared the mystic knowledge of their realms with Cultis Illyana Kale, who added it to her own knowledge to complete the ''Tome of Zhered-Na''. To prevent the knowledge's abuse, only the combination of a Kale family member and angelic and demonic agents could utilize the Tome.

Jennifer was born into the Kale family, born in the fictional town of [[Citrusville]], Florida, and living in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades|swamp regions]]. Attuned to mystical forces since birth, she began studying her family's history at an early age and eventually became an asset and ally to the [[Man-Thing]]. Jennifer learned of the Tome via her grandfather Joshua, who led the modern incarnation of the Cult. The aged Dakimh took Jennifer as his apprentice, drawing energies from the angelic realm [[Therea]] and demonic realm [[Sominus]] to use the Tome to prevent Earth's invasion by the demonic [[Thog]]. Jennifer joined the Dakimh, Man-Thing, [[Howard the Duck]] and [[Korrek]] in opposing further plots of Thog, the Congress of Realities, the wizard Klonus and barbarian Mortak, and the mad demon Bzzk'joh and his Imperium Emporium organization. Even after Joshua's death, his spirit continued to advise Jennifer. Between her efforts to live a normal life at various colleges, she has been drawn into numerous magical conflicts, including learning of her familial connection to the [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].  When last seen (aside from in a vision) in the pages of ''Ghost Rider'', she was riding on the back of [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]'s motorcycle trying to help him find his kids, supposedly last seen with [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] during the [[Siege of Darkness (comics)|Siege of Darkness]], although Wendigo was not involved in the Siege of Darkness, and Blaze got his kids back in ''Blaze'' #12, after the Siege of Darkness and before Jennifer met Blaze. Blaze says that they got bus tickets back to New York by selling the bike.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #94</ref>

Jennifer was also once sought out to help the mutant team known as [[X-Force]]. She helped against Pandemonia, who had taken mystic control of several of their other members. Based on their description of her, Jennifer identified her via her Demonic Corcordance text. Jennifer joined X-Force in confronting Pandemonia. She freed Pandemonia's mental slaves ([[Locus (comics)|Locus]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]) and, assisted by [[Danielle Moonstar]], she banished Pandemonia back to her home dimension on the chaos plane. Jennifer examined the reality warping energies that Danielle Moonstar had recently begun to display, confirming that they were not supernatural in origin. Later, Jennifer taught [[T'ai Chi Ch'Ã¼an|Tai Chi]] to members of X-Force, having become friends with Danielle Moonstar. Again some time later, Jennifer assisted X-Force against the Queen of Star Swords, the extra-dimensional counterpart of Moonstar's friend, Arcadia Deville, who summoned four counterparts of Moonstar herself, and another reality's [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], which also drew Man-Thing to their location.

===Witches===
The demon [[Marduk Kurios]], one of many to use the alias Satan, duped Jennifer's brother Andrew into touching the ''Tome of Zhered-Na''. Hereby they unleashed the curse of the Hellphyr which threatened to destroy all magical beings on Earth. Jennifer was recruited by [[Doctor Strange]], alongside some other magical heroes to oppose this plot. During the battle, Jennifer was forced to slay her Hellphyr-possessed brother. After the battle, Jennifer refused to surrender her familial Tome to Doctor Strange, who had lied to her about his true intentions of possessing the Tome for himself. Instead Jennifer decided to remain with fellow magicians [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]]. Together, they formed the group known as the [[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]], hoping to keep the world safe from mystical threats and stop would-be thieves from stealing her family book<ref>''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]''</ref>.

===Marvel Zombies 3===
{{Main|Marvel Zombies 3}}
Kale appears with [[Wundarr the Aquarian]] and [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] as a member of Florida's [[Fifty State Initiative]] team, "The Command", who are sent to Citrusville (home of [[Man-Thing]]) to investigate strange sightings. There they are attacked by zombies who have been transported from the Marvel Zombies universe to [[Earth 616]]. They are then attacked by zombie [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who uses throwing knives to sever the tendons in her arm to prevent her from casting spells. Wundarr throws Deadpool into the blades of a nearby skiff and Kale activates them, reducing Deadpool to a bloody pulp. Siege, who had been turned into a zombie, attacked her and broke her ankle but was killed when his cybernetic parts took over and shot his head off. She is later shown quarantined at A.R.M.O.R. headquarters, apparently shellshocked.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #1</ref> She sat in her room, paralyzed with fear, as zombies began to infect the A.R.M.O.R. personnel and take over the base.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #3</ref>

===The Initiative===
Jennifer is later shown defending Florida during the [[Skrull]] invasion, her body and mind sufficiently healed for her to engage magic in combat against a Skrull in Florida. <ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #19</ref>

===Marvel Zombies 4===
{{Main|Marvel Zombies 4}}
Jennifer appears as part of the new [[Midnight Sons]] team, killing zombie Men-Fish and fighting their leader, [[Piranha (comics)|Piranha]]. Dormammu comes and offers her his power when she is in grave peril, leaving her to make a decision with no time to spare.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #1-2</ref> Desperate after seeing [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russell]] apparently infected with the zombie virus, she calls on Dormammu and accepts his offer.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #3</ref> Jennifer battled [[Daimon Hellstrom]], who helps free her from Dormammu's control, and she then confines the zombie virus inside the [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]] (Simon Garth) with the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]]'s help.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #4</ref>

===Dark Reign===
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
Because Strange had abused his position as [[Sorcerer Supreme]], he had to find a successor, searching all over Earth in hopes of seeking one. As he tells to Wiccan (who lacked knowledge of both Kale and the Man-Thing), he managed to track down Jennifer, though for some reason he had great difficulty in doing so, but determined that she was not the one, despite his belief that she would have been suitable due to her high ability. <ref>''[[New Avengers]]'' #51</ref>

==Sexuality==
While Jennifer did have a boyfriend named Bernard Drabble during her time in the [[Legion of Night]], and was originally shown with a boyfriend named Jaxon (surname unrevealed),<ref>''Fear'' #13; ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 #4, and passim</ref> in the ''Ghost Rider'' series her cousin [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] has a vision of a life where their family never was involved in magic. In this scenario he envisions Jennifer as having a girlfriend of three years named Marie.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #92</ref> Later during her encounter with Satana, the latter suggests that Jennifer is not interested in boys and makes a snide comment about Jennifer staring at her chest.<ref>''Witches'' #2</ref>

Jennifer was officially recognized as [[bisexual]] in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Mystic Arcana - The Book of Marvel Magic'' (2007) in the entry for ''Witches'' - the informal trio of Kale, Topaz, and Satana.

In ''Marvel Zombies 4'', Jennifer Kale quotes Topaz as having called her "girlfriend" in an ironic sense.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref>

==''Dead of Night:  Man-Thing''==
In [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]]'s 2008 [[Marvel MAX]] retelling of Man-Thing's origin, Jennifer Kale is 22 years old, and Andrew Kale's legal guardian.  She works as an exotic dancer in a witch-woman costume, which also doubles for her witches-garb when she is actually conjuring demons and casting spells.

==Powers and abilities==
Though initially only a novice in the mystic arts of the [[Marvel Universe]], Jennifer Kale held tremendous potential for wielding magic and has since honed it through many years of intensive training and tutelage. Though her training was based upon the brand of magic wielded by Zhered-Na, she has since been tutored by other sorcerers and also self-taught herself to a high extent. As of now, Kale can fire magical bolts, form shields, open dimensional portals, mesmerize others, affect the memories of others, teleport herself and others, and cast numerous other spells for a variety of effects. 

''The Tome of Zhered-Na'' is named after the antediluvian sorceress who foretold the end of Atlantis, and the Tome allegedly possessed all the mysticism known to man and demonkind at the time of its creation. For speaking this truth, Zhered-Na was banished and set adrift upon the sea. While she floated, her god, Valka whispered secrets to her about the world and the world of the future. After many weeks she landed at Thuria and founded the Cult of Zhered-Na. She lived and taught there until she was slain by the demon D'Spayre. Atlantis met its fate that same day. Two spirits rescued the wisdom of Zhered-Na and decades later gave it to Illyana Kale, the descendant of a cult member. Kale was inspired then to write the Tome. Certain deities felt that too many secrets were contained inside the Book, so they placed the demon Hellphyr inside its pages to ward away unwelcome users. When the Book was recently opened and Hellphyr was released, Illyana's descendant Jennifer Kale joined with fellow witches Topaz and Satana to stop the demon and save the Tome. The Tome of Zhered-Na is currently with Jennifer Kale. Though presumably less powerful than the Darkhold or the Book of the Vishanti, it is nonetheless powerful enough to strike awe into the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] [[Doctor Strange]] and was sealed so only a member of the Kale lineage could access it, and only then assisted by a representative of divinity and a representative of the underworld.
