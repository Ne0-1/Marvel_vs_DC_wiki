'''Jennifer Kale''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Val Mayerik]]. She debuted in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #11 (1972). She is the cousin of [[Ghost Rider|Johnny Blaze]] and a founding member of the [[Legion of Night]].

==History==
Zhered-Na was a sorceress in [[Atlantis (comics)|Atlantis]] circa 18,000 BC. Exiled by emperor Kamuu for her prophecy that Atlantis would sink, Zhered-Na was relocated to the mainland Thurian continent where she taught about her god Valka. These lessons spawned the Cult of Zhered-Na. When the star-spanning [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] caused the Great Cataclysm, sinking Atlantis, Zhered-Na was killed by a pawn of the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demonic]] [[Dweller-in-Darkness]]. Zhered-Na's former apprentice, [[Dakimh the Enchanter|Dakimh]], continued her teachings and perpetuated the Cult throughout his extended lifespan. Centuries ago, an unnamed demon and angel shared the mystic knowledge of their realms with Cultis Illyana Kale, who added it to her own knowledge to complete the ''Tome of Zhered-Na''. To prevent the knowledge's abuse, only the combination of a Kale family member and angelic and demonic agents could utilize the [[Book of Shadows|Tome]].

Jennifer was born into the Kale family, living in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades|swamp regions]]. Attuned to mystical forces since birth, she began studying her family's history at an early age and eventually became an asset and ally to [[Man-Thing|the Man-Thing]]. Recently, Jennifer learned of the Tome via her grandfather Joshua, who led the modern incarnation of the Cult. The aged Dakimh took Jennifer as his apprentice, drawing energies from the angelic realm Therea and demonic realm Sominus to use the Tome to prevent Earth's invasion by the demonic [[Thog]]. Jennifer joined the Dakimh, her cousin Johnny Blaze (at the time [[Ghost Rider]]), [[Man-Thing]], [[Howard the Duck]] and Korrek in opposing further plots of Thog, the Congress of Realities, the wizard Klonus and barbarian Mortak, and the mad demon Bzzk'joh and his Imperium Emporium organization. Even after Joshua's death, his spirit continued to advise Jennifer. Between her efforts to live a normal life at various colleges, she has been drawn into numerous magical conflicts, including learning of her familial connection to the [[Ghost Rider]].

Jennifer was also once sought out to help the mutant team known as [[X-Force]]. She helped against Pandemonia, who had taken mystic control of several of their other members. Based on their description of her, Jennifer identified her via her Demonic Corcordance text. Jennifer joined X-Force in confronting Pandemonia. She freed Pandemonia's mental slaves ([[Locus (comics)|Locus]], [[Meltdown (comics)|Meltdown]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]) and, assisted by [[Danielle Moonstar]], she banished Pandemonia back to her home dimension on the chaos plane. Jennifer examined the reality warping energies that Danielle Moonstar had recently begun to display, confirming that they were not supernatural in origin. Later, Jennifer and Dani Moonstar attended a [[T'ai Chi Ch'Ã¼an|Tai Chi]] course and became somewhat of friends. Again some time later, Jennifer summoned the Man-Thing and assisted X-Force against the Queen of Star Swords, the extradimensional counterpart of Moonstar.

More recently, in the ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' miniseries, the demon [[Marduk Kurios]], one of many to use the alias Satan, duped Jennifer's brother Andrew into touching the ''Tome of Zhered-Na''. Hereby they unleashed the curse of the Hellphyr which threatened to destroy all magical beings on Earth. Jennifer was recruited by [[Doctor Strange]], alongside some other magical heroes to oppose this plot. During the battle, Jennifer was forced to slay her Hellphyr-possessed brother. After the battle, Jennifer refused to surrender her familial Tome to Doctor Strange, who had lied to her about his true intentions of possessing the Tome for himself. Instead Jennifer decided to remain with fellow magicians [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]]. Together, they formed the group known as the [[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Three Witches]], hoping to keep the world safe from mystical threats and stop would-be thieves from stealing her family book.

==Sexuality==
While Jennifer did have a boyfriend named Bernard Drabble during her time in the [[Legion of Night]], in the Ghost Rider series her cousin Danny Ketch has a vision of a life where their family never was involved in magic. In this scenerio he envisions Jennifer as having a girlfriend of three years named Marie. Later during her encounter with Satana, Jennifer is questioned by her teammate as to her sexual orientation. Though she told Satana that it was none of her business, she did so while repeatedly looking at her chest.
