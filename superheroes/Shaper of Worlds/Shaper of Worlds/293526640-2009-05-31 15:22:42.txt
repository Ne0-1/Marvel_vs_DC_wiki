The '''Shaper of Worlds''' is a fictional character of the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. 

==Fictional character biography==
The Shaper of Worlds began existence thousands of years ago as a [[Cosmic Cube]], created by [[Skrull]] scientists, on an unnamed planet in the Skrull Empire, in the Andromeda Galaxy. It was used by the Skrull Emperor to enforce his rule over the Empire as a god-king. The Cube subsequently developed sentience, and because of the [[megalomania]]cal personality of the emperor had been imprinted on it, it lashed out and devastated a significant portion of the Empire before it reached emotional maturity. It was at this point that it started calling itself the "Shaper of Worlds," and chose the form that it uses to this day: an ivory male Skrull torso atop a metallic [[frustum]] and tractor treads for apparent mobility.<ref>origin revealed in ''Captain America Annual'' #7</ref>

On an unnamed extradimensional micro-world, the Shaper created a "world" based on the Nazi-dominated 1940s Earth from the mind of ex-Nazi scientist Otto Kronsteig. This "world" was destroyed by the intervention of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #155</ref> On Earth, the Shaper then created a "world" based on 1950s American popular culture from the mind of ex-henchman "Slugger" Johnson; this "world" was destroyed by the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Shaper took [[Glorian|Thomas Gideon]] as his apprentice before leaving Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #136-137</ref> The Shaper returns later, creating a "paradise world" of peace for the Hulk on an unnamed planetoid, based on his fondest dreams from the mind of the Hulk. This is because the Shaper feels guilty for harassing the Hulk earlier. The Shaper creates illusions of the Hulk's long-deceased friends, [[Jarella]] and Crackajack Johnson. The peace is marred by the appearance of the Toad Men, who have invaded looking for slaves.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #190 (Aug. 1975)</ref> In the next issue, the Toad Men kill the Shaper's friend, [[Glorian]]. This causes the illusion to fall apart, which sends the Hulk on a rampage. The Toad Men are defeated and the Hulk rejects the Shaper's offer for a new illusionary reality, which destroyed the "paradise world".<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #191</ref>

Glorian was later revealed to be the transformed Thomas Gideon, and was not actually destroyed on the paradise world. The Shaper witnessed Glorian's attempt to create a "world" based on the dreams of the inhabitants from a small town ruined by the accidental intervention of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #267</ref> The Shaper was sent by the [[Kree]] [[Supreme Intelligence]] to guide the evolution of Earth's [[Kubik (comics)|Cosmic Cube]] into a sentient being; while there, the Shaper encountered [[Captain America]] and the [[Wundarr the Aquarian|Aquarian]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #7</ref>

With [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]] (formerly the Earth Cosmic Cube), the Shaper encountered the Fantastic Four and [[Doctor Doom]] in the universe of the [[Beyonder]]. The Shaper recounted the Beyonder's true origin as part of the same force that created the [[Molecule Man]], and witnessed the transformation of the Beyonder and Molecule Man into a [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|new Cosmic Cube]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #319</ref> The Shaper later allowed Glorian to return to Earth to use his power to help the Hulk achieve nobility.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #355-356</ref> The outing ultimately goes badly for Glorian, and the Shaper rescues the Hulk and Glorian from the demonic attention of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (in the guise of Cloot). <ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #359</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Shaper of Worlds is an alien matter-energy construct with unknown, and potentially incalculable physical power. He has the ability to restructure finite pockets of reality and to alter the molecular configuration of persons and objects. He is also capable of intergalactic and interdimensional teleportation, and empathic perception. The Shaper's intelligence is immeasurable, but lacking a creative imagination, the Shaper must use the mind of another sentient being as a template for his transformations of worlds.

The Shaper has massive power, but he cannot actually create new worlds - after destroying a significant portion of the Skrull Empire, he deliberately limited the scope of his powers. He only rearranges the structure of an existing world to fit the template that has been requested by another. The alien can only create worlds if it has the dreams of another living being to use as a blueprint. These factors are often considered to be the greatest drawbacks to its powers.

It is his curse that he has a strong desire to make dreams come true, but does not have any dreams himself. He seeks out other beings that he senses have wishes he can fulfill. Only in this way can he find a release for his strong desire to shape reality. 
[[Glorian]] and [[Kubik]] are his protégés.

The Shaper of Worlds has fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. It was he who taught the [[Beyonder]] and the [[Molecule Man]] that they shared a common origin and merged them into the being known as [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]].
