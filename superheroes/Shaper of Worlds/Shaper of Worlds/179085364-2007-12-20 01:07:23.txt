The '''Shaper of Worlds''' is a fictional character of the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. 

==Fictional character biography==
He started existence thousands of years ago as a [[Cosmic Cube]], created by scientist of the [[Skrull]] Empire. It was then used by the Skrull Emperor to enforce his rule over the Skrull Empire as a god-king. It subsequently developed sentience, and because of the [[megalomania]]cal personality of the emperor imprinted on its mind, it lashed out and devastated a significant portion of the empire before it reached emotional maturity. It was at this point that it started calling itself the "Shaper of Worlds," and chose the form that it uses to this day: a male Skrull torso atop a metallic [[frustrum]] and tractor treads.[[Reality Manipulation]],[[Energy Manipulation]],[[Matter Manipulation]]

==Powers and abilities==
The Shaper has massive power, but he cannot actually create new worlds. He only rearranges the structure of an existing world to fit the template that has been requested by another. The alien can only create worlds if it has the dreams of another living being to use as a blueprint. These factors are often considered to be the greatest drawbacks to its powers.

It is his curse that he has a strong desire to make dreams come true, but does not have any dreams himself. So he is searching out other beings he senses have wishes he can fulfill. Only this way can he find a release for his strong desire to shape the reality.

[[Glorian]] and [[Kubik]] are his protégés.

The Shaper of Worlds has fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. It was he who taught the [[Beyonder]] and the [[Molecule Man]] that they shared a common origin and merged them into the being known as [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]].
