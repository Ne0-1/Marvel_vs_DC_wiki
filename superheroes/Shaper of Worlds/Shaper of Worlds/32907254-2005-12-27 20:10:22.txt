The '''Shaper of Worlds''' is a fictional character of the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. He started life many years ago as a [[cosmic cube]], created by the Skrull Empire, though he rarely serves those who consider themselves to be his master. He is a [[cyborg]], with an armoured torso and caterpillar tracks in the place of legs. 

The Shaper has massive power, but he cannot actually create new worlds. He only rearranges the structure of an existing world to fit the template that has been requested by another. The alien can only create worlds if it has the dreams of another living being to use as a blueprint. These factors are often considered to be the greatest drawbacks to it's powers.

The Shaper of Worlds has fought the Hulk and the Fantastic Four. It was he who taught the Beyonder, Kubik and the Molecule Man that they all shared acommon origin and merged them into the being known as Kosmos.
