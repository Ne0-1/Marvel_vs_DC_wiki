The ''Batman: Year Three'' storyline centers on a ledger that Zucco owns, kept safely in a hidden location in the orphanage Dick Grayson was housed after his parent's deaths. This ledger contains details on every single underhanded operation in Gotham to take place, and was enough to incriminate any crime boss for life. In the story, he is released for parole 49 years early in his bid to get it back, as the orphanage will be torn down soon, along with his ledger. When his parole is accepted, despite the efforts of [[Alfred Pennyworth]], he steps out of the prison saying "It's like I said, Taft - I'm going to be a ''KING''!" instants before he is brutally gunned down by a helicopter.

{{spoiler}}
Tony Zucco started off as a young man eager to make a name for himself in the [[racketeering]] business, as well as with the mob. On the side he would strong arm companies to take up "insurance". One business he hit up was Haly's Circus. He sabotaged some equipment which led to the death of Dick Grayson's parents, a death which both Dick and Bruce Wayne were witnesses to. Zucco's brashness infuriated his uncle, mob boss [[Arnold Stromwell]], who disowned him. 

Batman, who as Bruce Wayne adopted the young Grayson, went after Zucco with a vengeance, which increased the mobster's paranoia. After a couple of brief run-ins with Batman, Zucco escaped and hid out in an abandoned amusement park on the edge of Gotham. Nine years later, Batman and Robin catch up with one of Zucco's henchman, and learn that the mobster has returned to the city. After a fight with Batman and Robin, Zucco was arrested and convicted of double murder. He now resides in prison with a [[life sentence]].

===''The Batman''===
{{spoiler}}
Tony Zucco appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "[[A Matter of Family]]", which introduced [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson/Robin]] into that series. In this series, he is voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. In this version, Zucco has several brothers who act as his underlings. They are all involved in circus acts. His brothers are a strong man, a lion tamer, and a juggler. As for Zucco, his skill was knife-throwing. In his childhood he worked in the circus as part of a knife-throwing duo with his father, with Zucco throwing the knives while his father was bound to the giant target. Zucco was to toss the knives to hit the target without hurting his father, but this ultimately resulted in his dad's death after Zucco missed. The circus background gives the Zuccos a larger connection to the Graysons.

When John Grayson refused Zucco's offers of protection money, he was attacked by Zucco's henchmen. Dick had called the police minutes after Zucco first appeared in their big top tent and the call was intercepted by The Batman who quickly took down Zucco and his brothers, even managing to knock one of his brothers out, allowing the police to take him away. Swearing revenge on The Batman and the Graysons for the loss of his brother, Zucco planned the death of the Graysons by removing two nuts from the railings of the Graysons' trapeze act. After the murder of the Graysons, Batman cornered every one of Zucco's henchmen until he found the whereabouts of Tony Zucco. When Zucco gained the upper hand in a fight with Batman at Haley's Circus, Zucco strapped Batman to a knife-throwing wheel and recounted his childhood in the circus. When Zucco was about to do the same thing to Batman that he did to his father, Dick arrives in his Robin costume and battles him long enough for Batman to free himself. At one point Dick has the chance to enact revenge on Zucco for the murder of his parents when Zucco falls from the same platform as the Flying Graysons. Dick chooses to spare Zucco, who is then arrested by Gotham Police. After this, Dick Grayson officially becomes Batman's sidekick Robin.
