'''Anthony "Tony" Zucco''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. He was introduced in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (April 1940) and is best known for his connections to the origin of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

==Fictional character history==

===Pre-Crisis===
Antonio Zucco (originally just '''"Boss Zucco"''' in his first appearance) is a [[Mafia]] boss, or simple low level thug (his position of power varies depending upon the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]) in [[Gotham City]] who is responsible for the death of [[Dick Grayson]]'s parents.

Throughout the years, Zucco's role in Robin's origin remains largely the same. Zucco tries to extort the [[Haly's Circus]], where the Flying Graysons are the main attraction. When the ringmaster Mr. Haly (who runs an honest business) refuses to pay him [[extortion|protection money]], Zucco sabotages the trapeze ropes the Graysons use in their act. The ropes break while Dick's parents are in mid-air. Because the Graysons perform their act without a [[safety net]], they fall to their deaths.

Dick is subsequently [[adoption|adopted]] by Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. [[Batman]]) and becomes his partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Both of them locate Tony Zucco and send him to jail. In the Golden Age version, he is sent to the [[electric chair]]. In the Silver Age version, he is sentenced to [[life in prison]].

===Post-Crisis===

====''Batman: Dark Victory''====
In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', Zucco (dubbed '''Anthony "Fats" Zucco''') is portrayed as a low-level thug working for [[Sal Maroni]], a member of [[Carmine Falcone]]'s Mafia empire. He and another minor family head, Edward Skeevers, are put in charge of [[drug trafficking]]. After constant attacks by other enemies such as [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], Zucco starts a new method of smuggling these drugs. He only lets Skeevers in on the secret, believing that its success will make their minor families greater than the Falcones and the Maronis put together, and attempts to take over Haley's Circus in order to use its trucks for his trafficking activities. He kills Dick Grayson's parents as a demonstration of power to the circus' owner, and then quickly goes underground. He is later found by Batman and Dick Grayson, who is not yet Robin, and is chased down a dark alley by Grayson until he has a [[heart attack]], confessing to various crimes.<ref>''Batman: Dark Victory'' #0-13 (November 1999 - December 2000)</ref>

====''Batman: Year Three''====
Dick Grayson's narration establishes Zucco's backstory. A first-generation immigrant from [[Italy]], Zucco is orphaned at a young age when a gang of criminals murder his parents for refusing to pay [[protection racket|protection money]]. Zucco is sent to an orphanage, where he is cared for by Sister Mary Elizabeth. She tries to counsel Zucco, but he is a lost cause; consumed by anger, he prays only for the deaths of the men who killed his parents. As a young man, he runs away from the orphanage and joins one of Gotham's major crime families, and quickly moves up Gotham's criminal food chain.<ref name="batman11">''Batman'' (vol. 1) #436-439 (Augustâ€“September 1989)</ref>

After Batman apprehends him for murdering Dick Grayson's parents, Zucco is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]. After serving seven years of his sentence, he files for a [[parole]] hearing and offers testimony against other Gotham criminals. He professes remorse for his crimes, but hides an ulterior motive. Before he was sent to prison, Zucco had hidden a ledger in the orphanage where Dick briefly resided following his parents' deaths; the ledger contains incriminating information about the Mafia's operations in Gotham. Zucco plots to remove the ledger from the orphanage before it is demolished. Wanting to keep the truth from Dick (who has recently become [[Nightwing]]), [[Alfred Pennyworth]] goes to the parole hearing and pleads for the judge to keep Zucco in prison. Unfortunately, Dick learns of Zucco's release. Despite Alfred's attempts to stop him, Dick races to Blackgate to confront his parents' killer. However, as he steps out of the prison, Zucco is gunned down by a helicopter hired by a rival crime boss. While Zucco's death gives Dick some [[closure (psychology)|closure]], his already-strained relationship with Batman becomes further complicated. when Dick presses him, Batman insists he knows nothing about Zucco's murder.<ref name="batman11" />

==In other media==

===Television===
* Tony Zucco appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' two-part episode "Robin's Reckoning", voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]. In this version, he is a nephew of Connie Stromwell, the former wife of Arnold Stromwell, a mob rival of [[Rupert Thorne]]. As in the comics, he threatens [[Haly's Circus]]' owner Mr. Haly for protection money and kills Dick Grayson's parents by sabotaging the trapeze ropes. After Bruce Wayne adopts Dick, Batman goes after Zucco with a vengeance. After a couple of brief run-ins with Batman, an increasingly paranoid Zucco escapes town but returns nine years later. After learning that his parents' murderer is back in town, Robin goes after Zucco and ultimately saves Batman's life. Robin is briefly tempted to kill Zucco but ultimately spares him and leaves him to be arrested.

* Tony Zucco appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "A Matter of Family", voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. This version acts as Gotham's Mafia Don with his three brothers that are his underlings and are all involved in circus acts. His brothers are a [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strong man]] (referred to in the credits as '''Bruiser'''), a [[Lion taming|lion tamer]], and a [[Juggling|juggler]]. His own skill is [[knife throwing]]. As a child, he was part of a knife-throwing duo with his father, with Tony throwing the knives while his father was bound to the giant target but he missed one time, killing his father. When Zucco offers his "protection" to the Flying Graysons, John Grayson refuses. When John is attacked by Zucco's brothers, [[Dick Grayson]] calls the police minutes after Zucco first appears in the Flying Graysons' big top tent. The call is intercepted by [[Batman]] quickly taking Zucco and his brothers down, resulting in Zucco's "Lion Tamer" brother being taken away by Gotham police while Zucco and the other two brothers escape. Swearing revenge on Batman and the Graysons, Zucco tampers with the railings of the Graysons' trapeze act, resulting in the deaths of John and Mary Grayson. After John's and Mary's murder, Batman corners every one of Zucco's remaining brothers until learning their boss' whereabouts: Haley's Circus. When Zucco knocks Batman out at Haley's Circus, he straps the Dark Knight to a knife-throwing wheel. However, Robin arrives just in time and battles Zucco long enough for Batman to free himself. At one point, Robin has the chance to enact revenge when Zucco falls from the trapeze platform. Robin chooses to spare his parents' murderer and Zucco is then arrested.

===Miscellaneous===
* Tony Zucco appears in issue 6 of the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' comics. He was featured in a flashback when Robin recaps his history. Like the comics, Tony Zucco tried to offer protection money to Mr. Haly who denied him. On April 1, 2006 during a trapeze routine without a net, Tony Zucco's men sabotaged the trapeze rig which broke during the act killing Dick's parents, aunt, and cousin while his uncle survived but was paralyzed. When Dick Grayson became Robin for the first time, he helped Batman bring Tony Zucco to justice.
