==Fictional character biography==
Skaar is the progeny of a gamma powered Mutate and one of the Oldstrong Shadow People. As seen in the first issue, the blast that killed Caiera turned her into dust in the Hulk's arms. After her death a [[cocoon]] containing Skaar fell into the lake of fire. After a period of time, Skaar emerged from the cocoon, appearing to be the age equivalent of a human preteen. A year later and he appears to have grown into a teenager. He quickly grows into what seems to be an adult after he is attacked by the Bone Axeman's Dragon's flame, which at first looks like an example of his old power.<ref>As seen in ''Skaar, Son of Hulk'' #1</ref> Skaar defeats the Bone Axemen and his dragon with only a sword and his bare hands. Skaar, after having a confrontation with the princess, is shown to be able to speak intelligent sentences when the group is going to be attacked by Wildebots.

==Powers and abilities==
*He shows his mother's heritage in the very first issue by being able to walk on two legs and speak within minutes of emerging from the lava, which is possible in the shadow people race according to the beginning of the issue.
*Skaar demonstrated limited superhuman strength soon after birth. 
*By now he has shown to have immense superhuman strength and superhuman resistance.
*It is unknown if his strength rises like his father when he is enraged.
*Later on he shows that he can draw power from the planet and harden his body similar to his mother Caiera.
*He seems to have regenerative abilities, as he rapidly recovered from being stabbed in the face. The limits of his augmented healing are unknown.
*He has the potential to become a full shadow priest because of his heritage.

==Other versions==
===What If?===
In the ''[[List of What If issues#Sixth Series (2007)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?'', a 21-year-old version of Skaar appeared near the end,  partially seen and obscured by shadows.
