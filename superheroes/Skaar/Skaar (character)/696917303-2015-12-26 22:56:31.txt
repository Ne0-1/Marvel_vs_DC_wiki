==Fictional character biography==
Skaar is the progeny of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and of [[Caiera]] the Oldstrong, who conceived Skaar during the Hulk's time on Caiera's home planet, Sakaar. After Caiera's death, and the Hulk's departure from Sakaar, Skaar emerged from a cocoon, appearing to be the age equivalent of a human preteen. A year later he resembles a human teenager, and subsequently, an intelligent adult, in both appearance and intelligence.<ref>[[Pak, Greg]]. "Cradle of Fire" ''Skaar, Son of Hulk'' #1; Marvel Comics; August 2008</ref> He also demonstrates himself to be a fierce and capable warrior, and becomes the enemy of Axeman Bone. He later gains the power of the stone-based "Oldstrong", which allows him to draw energy from the planet himself, and comes to be seen by some on Sakaar as a savior. Though Skaar is able to communicate with the spirit of his dead mother, Caiera, she is troubled by his becoming a killer instead of a bringer of peace to their people. To address this problem, she summons the [[Silver Surfer]] to the planet, who removes Skaar's Oldstrong power before Skaar can kill Axeman Bone, and informs him that the planet-eater, [[Galactus]], who travels the universe consuming planets for sustenance, is approaching Sakaar. The Surfer offers Skaar the chance to use the Oldstrong power to evacuate the planet, not only saving his people, but becoming a hero to the universe, as the planet harbors enough energy to satiate Galactus' hunger for a hundred thousand years.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Return of the Silver Savage" ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #7; Marvel Comics; March 2009</ref> However, after the Surfer restores Skaar's Oldstrong power, Skaar destroys the evacuation ships, and tells the Surfer that if he does not spare Sakaar, he will use the Oldstrong power to increase Galactus' hunger, and endanger more planets, including ones that Surfer has saved. After the Surfer informs the planet that their safety will lead to the death of countless other planets, he leaves Sakaar. Caiera denounces Skaar for his decision, and exiles him from the planet, absorbing the Oldstrong power from him and waits for Galactus to consume her.<ref>Pak, Greg. ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #10. Marvel Comics. June 2009</ref>

Skaar arrives on Earth with the sole desire to kill his father, the Hulk. After coming into conflict with the [[United States]] military, and other characters such as the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Warbound]], he confronts the Hulk, though not the version who was present on Sakaar. After Hulk engages Skaar in battle, he effortlessly beats him, though their fight creates a fissure that endangers a nuclear power plant. Skaar ceases his attack when he realizes that this Hulk is not the "War Hulk" version that conceived him, who is the one he truly wishes to kill, and prevents the fissure from endangering the power plant. He declares Earth to be his new home.

Skaar later encounters Bruce Banner, who has been robbed of the ability to become the Hulk by the [[Red Hulk]]. Skaar then reiterates his desire to kill the Hulk, but not in Banner's form, since they truly are separate personas. Bruce offers to teach Skaar how to kill the Hulk, should he ever return, though this is a ruse to allow Banner to monitor Skaar, and impart fatherly wisdom in the hope of turning the savage warrior into a hero. Skaar demonstrates his ability to use cunning as well as his physical strength by hurling the villain [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] into outer space.<ref>Pak, Greg.

After defeating the Moloids, Skaar is proclaimed a hero, and a parade is given in his honor. After a confrontation with the [[Red Hulk]] that angers Banner, Banner [[Teleportation|teleport]]s to the country of [[Latveria]], supposedly to transform in private. During a subsequent battle between the Hulk and the Latverian villain [[Doctor Doom]], Skaar intervenes, having teleported to Latveria with Banner's teleportation technology, as he does not wish Doom to rob him of the ability to kill Hulk. Doom overpowers Skaar with magic, reverting him to his human form, and reveals that this Hulk was a robot. Banner then arrives and rescues his son, seeing him in his human form for the first time, but Skaar rejects Banner's affection, believing that Banner cares only for his deceased wife. Concluding that Banner schemed to provoke Skaar's discovery of his teleporter in order to prompt him to come to Latveria for another "lesson", Skaar reiterates his desire to someday kill him as the Hulk.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Dark Son". ''Incredible Hulk'' #606. Marvel Comics. October 2010</ref>

During the "[[Fall of the Hulks]]", "[[World War Hulks]]," and "Dark Son" storylines, Skaar comes to the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by battling the [[Red She-Hulk]],<ref>Pak, Greg. "Unbound" ''Incredible Hulk'' #607; Marvel Comics; April 2010</ref> in a story that involves the villainous group the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] turning scores of people in [[Washington, D.C.]] into Hulks, including the genius [[Amadeus Cho]], and capturing Banner.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Endgame". ''Incredible Hulk'' #608. Marvel Comics. May 2010</ref> During the course of the story, Banner re-emerges as the Green Scar, and Skaar, finally granted the confrontation he had longed for, attacks him. During the course of their battle, Hulk rescues a number of innocent bystanders endangered by their fight. Skaar reacts to this compassion by ceasing his assault, but Hulk continues his, causing Skaar to revert to human form. These actions remind Hulk of Banner's [[Brian Banner|own abusive father]], and as a result, Hulk reverts to human form himself, and embraces his son, who accepts his love.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Dark Son". ''Incredible Hulk'' #611. Marvel Comics.

During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" storyline, Skaar helps his father and his friends in their fight against the forces of Amatsu-Mikaboshi.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #618-619. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Brian Banner]] is discovered to have also been brought back from the dead after what happened to the death realms and becomes a [[Guilt Hulk]]/[[Devil Hulk]] hybrid, Skaar helps his father fight Brian Banner.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #620.

Skaar accompanies Hulk and the Warbound to the [[Savage Land]] when they are contacted by [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] regarding the death of some of the Sakaarians that were living there.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #622. Marvel Comics.</ref> They discover that the insectoid [[Miek]] is involved in a plot to use Sakaarian bodies to store his hatchlings.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #623. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Skaar refuses to allow Hulk to harm the hatchlings, Miek then attempts to drug Skaar. Following Miek's ostensible death, Skaar remains in the Savage Land to keep an eye on the remaining Sakaarians.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #625. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Skaar is seemingly recruited by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to join the second incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics</ref> His first fight with the team went against him when the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] discovered them.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Dark Avengers reveal that they have captured Captain America and are planning to capture the other Avengers and put them on trial, Skaar turns on his teammates.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is revealed at that point that Skaar is actually a double agent. Skaar subsequently frees Captain America while the New Avengers defeat the remaining Dark Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Skaar later traveled to the Savage Land as it reminded him of his planet. He was tracked down by Hulk's Doc Green form in order to depower him as part of his plan to depower every Gamma mutate on the Earth except himself as the cure was derived from his blood and wouldn't have effect. After a brief fight, Skaar was finally depowered. Doc Green teleported Skaar to Paris along with a backpack full of money so he could start a new and better life.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 3 #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Skaar has powers inherited from both his parents. Like the Hulk, his father, he has superhuman endurance, regenerative abilities, and superhuman strength and durability, which, like his father, increases when he is enraged, although he is not as strong as the Savage Hulk persona. He can boost his strength further with old power-a synthesized form of the [[Galactus|Power Cosmic]],{{issue|date=August 2014}} in one instance having absorbed the energy of an entire city.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Greg Pak|penciller=[[Paul Pelletier]]|inker=Danny Miki|story=Sons of Wrath|title=Incredible Hulk|volume=1|number=611|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2010}}</ref> [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] is able to daze him with a powerful chi-punch.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> He can revert to a human form when calm or otherwise incapacitated. However, in his case, his other form is half-human, half-Oldstrong. From his mother, Caiera, he has the powers of an Oldstrong, emerging from his birth cocoon able to walk and talk within moments, and he can draw power from the planet and harden his body.<ref>''Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook''. Marvel Comics.</ref> Having been born within the depths of a lake of lava, Skaar is resistant to intense heat.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>
