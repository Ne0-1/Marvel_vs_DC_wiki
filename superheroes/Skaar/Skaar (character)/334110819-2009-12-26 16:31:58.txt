===Planet Skaar===
A continuation of both ''[[Planet Hulk]]'' and ''World War Hulk'' began in May 2009. A special stand alone prologue and ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #11 saw the beginning of ''Planet Skaar'' an arc which is intended to bring Skaar directly into the middle of the ''[[Marvel Universe]]''. Following the return of the Silver Savage (the [[Silver Surfer]]) in issue #7 events began to spiral that forces Skaar to not only be exiled from Sakaar but to head towards Earth. Already revealed by series writer [[Greg Pak]] is that the ''[[Warbound]]'' will return, that [[Mister Fantastic]] will not be amused with the arrival of another [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]-like being, and that the meeting between father and son may not be very pleasant for the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

==Fictional character biography==
Skaar is the progeny of the Hulk and of Caiera the Oldstrong. As seen in the first issue, the blast that killed Caiera turned her into dust in the Hulk's arms. After her death a [[cocoon]] containing Skaar fell into the lake of fire. After a period of time, Skaar emerged from the cocoon, appearing to be the age equivalent of a human preteen. A year later and he appears to have grown into a teenager. He quickly grows into what seems to be an adult after he is attacked by the Bone Axeman's Dragon's flame, which at first looks like an example of his old power.<ref>As seen in ''Skaar, Son of Hulk'' #1</ref> Skaar defeats the Bone Axemen and his dragon with only a sword and his bare hands. Skaar, after having a confrontation with the princess Omaka, is shown to be able to speak intelligent sentences when the group is going to be attacked by Wildebots and the two form an alliance. After sometime, he gains the power of the Oldstrong with the help of his followers. Soon after, he finds himself allied with the Former King, who was saved from death and rebuilt with a majority of cybernetic parts by the Wildebots. After becoming his ally, many people who considered him a savior, including the Omaka, daughter of the Red King (whom he attempted to kill during his reign, along with the rest of her family so there would be no heir) lose faith in him and ally themselves with Axeman Bone.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #6</ref> 

With his Old power, he manages to see the acts of death committed by everyone on the planet and intends to kill Axeman and his followers, and almost succeeds, when the Silver Surfer makes a sudden return and manages to take away his Oldstrong power and reveals that [[Galactus]] is coming to the planet to consume it. He offers Skaar the chance to use the Oldstrong power to revive the ancient technology of the Shadows to evacuate the planet, becoming a hero of the universe as the planet Sakaar would have enough energy to satiate Galactus' hunger for a hundred thousand years.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #7</ref>

Throughout the series his mother, Caiera, spoke to him asking him to fight for the good of the people of the planet, but he insisted on revenge, consumed with rage over Axeman Bone<ref>''Skaar, Son of Hulk'' #7-8.</ref> Through one final plea of his mother's spirit, she asked him to give up his rage; he instead proceeds into battle, with no regard for the innocent. Caiera, using the little of her strength left as a spirit, used her Oldstrong power to return in a stone form of herself initially, then in the image of his father.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #8</ref> She proceeded to defeat him with ease and asks why he insisted on being a killer instead of attempting to make peace. He then reveals his plan of killing everyone on the planet he deemed evil after glimpsing the destruction so many people made when he briefly wielded the power of Oldstrong.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #9</ref>

His mother, offering him one last chance of redemption, makes Silver Surfer (still being controlled by an obedience disk) bring Galactus, a being who has killed billions in order to truly grasp if he was able to succeed at his plans, showing him with a vision that the consequences of his actions will result in the death of everyone on the planet by the hands of Galactus. The Surfer then sends him back to Sakaar after believing he sees things his way. Caiera then returns to being one with the planet, believing Skaar has taken up the Silver Surfer on his previous offer of evacuating the planet and returns his old power to him to do so. Skaar then unsuspectingly uses his newly returned old power to destroy the ships, dooming everyone on the planet.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #10</ref> He chose that the planet and his mother's soul was more important than its inhabitants and gave the Surfer an ultimatum, spare Sakaar or he will use his old power to increase Galactus' hunger which would cause him to consume every planet the Surfer managed to save. The Surfer decides to leave, informing everyone on the planet of his actions and how they would be subsequently responsible for the deaths of billions. Caiera returns to him once more and denounces him as her son for his decision and exiles him from the planet, saying she can understand the reasons that the people of Earth wanted to get rid of Hulk. She then absorbs the power of Sakaar and awaited for Galactus to consume her.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #10</ref>

===Arrival to Earth===
Skaar arrives on Earth and comes into conflict with the Fantastic Four and other Army personnel. Thought dead in a bombing, Skaar shows that he can revert to his human form, appearing as a five year old child with indistinguishable skin color. After running into and attacking the [[Warbound]], Skaar and the Hulk finally come to face to face, with Skaar asking how he should kill his father. [[Kate Waynesboro]] replies, "You don't."<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #11</ref> Skaar attacks the Hulk, whose strength fluctuates during the battle due to Banner repressing the Hulk's "Green Scar" persona. The fight causes the earth to shake, creating a fissure which heads toward a nuclear power plant. For most of the fight, Hulk was beating Skaar almost effortlessly.  Kate attempts to prevent this from happening but is not able, due to her lack of mastery of the Oldstrong power. Skaar intervenes and stops the eruption. He ends his fight with his father, claiming that this isn't the Hulk he wanted to fight and declares Earth as his new home.

Skaar later encounters Bruce Banner, who had been robbed of the ability to become the Hulk by the [[Red Hulk]]. Bruce offers to teach Skaar how to kill the Hulk, should he ever return, and proceeds to pick a fight between Skaar and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] to help Skaar prepare for this confrontation.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #601</ref> Skaar manages to win his first ''staged'' fight by throwing the Juggernaut into open space, proving to his father his ability to use cunningly his physical strength.<ref>Incredible Hulk #602</ref>

As a second lesson, devised to grant the still naive Skaar the ability to discern friend from foe, and confront his legacy as the scion of the Hulk, Banner uses the recently met Wolverine to bring [[Daken]] and Skaar together. After a friendly chat, Skaar apparently asks Daken to kill him, forcing Banner to separate the two with an impromptu [[Fastball Special]]. The two fathers proceed to separate their offspring, noting to each other how strange their parenting seems.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #603</ref>

Meanwhile, Victoria Hand and [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], still in Ms. Marvel garb, lure Banner and Skaar near an installation seemingly meant to siphon away his Oldstrong power. At first taking Victoria as his hostage, he frees the two women, gleefully acknowledging their real plan: rather than stripping him of his heritage, they wanted to recharge Banner's physiology, accelerating the rebirth of the Hulk. Banner freezes Skaar's childlike glee, noting that Skaar will still need training for his revenge.<ref>''Dark Reign - The List: The Hulk''</ref>.

Skaar later assists Hulk and A-Bomb into fighting Harpy. It turns out that the Harpy that attacked them isn't [[Betty Ross]], but [[Marlo Chandler]] mutated into the Harpy by [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].<ref>Incredible Hulk #604</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Skaar has powers inherited from both his parents. Like the Hulk, his father, he has superhuman endurance, regenerative abilities, and superhuman strength, which, like his father, increases when he is enraged, although he isn't as strong as the Savage Hulk persona. He also can revert to a human form when calm or otherwise incapacitated. However, in his case, his other form is half-human, half-Oldstrong. From his mother, Caiera, he has the powers of an Oldstrong, emerging from his birth cocoon able to walk and talk within moments, and he can draw power from the planet and harden his body.

==Other versions==
===What If?===
In the ''[[List of What If issues#Sixth Series (2007)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?'', a 21-year-old version of Skaar appeared near the end, partially seen and obscured by shadows.
