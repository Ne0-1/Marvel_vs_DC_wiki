'''William Stryker''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[villain]], an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Brent Anderson]], he first appeared in the [[graphic novel]] ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills]]'' (1982).

In ''X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills,'' Rev. Stryker was a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] [[televangelist]] who saw himself on a mission from [[God]] to destroy the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant race]].

When ''God Loves, Man Kills'' was loosely adapted into the 2003 [[sequel]] ''[[X2: X-Men United]],'' Stryker, played by [[Brian Cox]], was a rogue [[United States Army|army]] colonel with an equally fervent desire to [[genocide|destroy]] mutants.

In the [[comic books]], Stryker was an obscure character. Since the release of ''X2,'' he has played a somewhat more prominent role.

==Character history==
===''God Loves, Man Kills''===
Stryker is a [[fundamentalist]] religious fanatic, with a military history which may have involved the [[Weapon X]] project, which resulted in [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] being given his [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] skeleton. When his son was born after Stryker's car crashed in the Nevada desert, he was so physically deformed that Stryker knew he was a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] and, in despair, killed his wife and son, and attempted to commit suicide by igniting the car. However, the car exploded, throwing him from the flames. He became convinced that [[Satan]] had a plot to corrupt humankind by taking over their souls while still in the womb, resulting in their mutations. He further concluded that the only reason God would have allowed his son to be a mutant was to direct him to his true calling: ridding the world of mutants. 

While his followers committed [[hate crime]]s against mutants, Stryker arranged to have [[Professor X]]avier kidnapped, brainwashed, and attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, would kill all living mutants. In order to stop this scheme, the [[X-Men]] are forced to join forces with their nemesis, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. When the extent of his bigotry becomes obvious (he attempts to kill [[Shadowcat (comics)|Kitty Pryde]]), one of his own security guards shoots and arrests him. Stryker eventually redeems himself in ''God Loves, Man Kills 2''.

===God Loves, Man Kills II===
Stryker returned, along with his ally, [[Lady Deathstrike]]. Eventually he turned over a new leaf, only to quickly return to his evil ways.

===Decimation===
However, he recently came back as a major player right at the start of the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] following Marvel's [[House of M]] event, deeming the sudden massive reduction in number of the mutant population a sign of God, saying "He made the first step and now we have to take the next", basically rallying for genocide on TV. As of now he's featured mostly in ''[[New X-Men]]'' as the current arc's main villain, but also appears in other comics set during this time frame. With the help of [[icarus (comics)|Icarus]], one of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute's]] students, he caused a bus to explode, killing about 1/4th of the depowered students from the academy. Then he planned the assassination of [[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]], ordering one of his snipers to shoot her in the head. Next he tried to kill [[Dust (comics)|Sooraya Quadir]], though it was actually [[X-23]].  The deaths of Wallflower and Dust were Stryker's prime objectives, as he had been informed by Nimrod that both girls would be fundamental in the destruction of his army. Finally he attacked the institute with his "purifiers," killing [[Quill (comics)|Quill]], leaving [[Onyxx (comics)|Onyxx]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] critically wounded, and hurting [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Emma Frost]] and other students. After Stryker's Purifiers where defeated, he was killed by the enraged boyfriend of Wallflower, [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]].

The Purifiers would later manage to accquire Stryker's remains from the authorities.

==In other media==
The story prior to his recent reappearing formed the loose basis for the film, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', which follows its basic premise, but also incorporates elements of the [[Dark Phoenix Saga]], In this movie, William Stryker is played by [[Brian Cox]].

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Stryker-1.jpg|500px|thumb|left|Stryker in [[X2 (film)]]]]  -->Stryker was slightly altered for his film interpretation in X2. He is no longer a religious [[fundamentalist]], but a military scientist who has gone into defense contracting. His connection to Wolverine is made more explicit, as is his motivation regarding his son. Also, rather than having killed his son, Jason (who himself is partially modeled after [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], another X-Men foe), at birth,  Stryker sent him to Xavier's school in hopes of curing him, regarding mutation as a disease that must be cured.  Xavier had no interest or belief in 'curing' mutants, which angered Stryker.  Additionally, Jason continued to grow angry, resentful, and vindictive towards his parents; he tortured them by planting illusions in their brains until his mother committed suicide by drilling into her own brain in order to "bore the images out".  Stryker then gave his son a [[lobotomy]] to make him more docile.   Jason, under his father's direction, brainwashes Xavier into using Cerebro II, a reproduction of [[Cerebro]], to kill all mutants.  Xavier and Magneto learned that Stryker is the mastermind behind an assassination attempt on the President by a brainwashed [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].

Magneto, wearing a helmet designed to shield against telepathic attacks, is able to reach Xavier while the X-Men are incapacitated by the psychic assault, but then has Jason make Xavier use Cerebro II to kill ordinary humans. At his direction, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] impersonates Stryker and instructs Jason of a change in plans, which Jason then communicates to the brainwashed Xavier.  Magneto and Mystique escape, and soon thereafter Storm and Nightcrawler enter Cerebro II and disrupt Jason's illusion, allowing Xavier to break free from his control before any humans or mutants are killed.

Stryker himself apparently dies when an explosion at his base of operations destroys a nearby dam, flooding the base and the surrounding valley. In his last moments, he confronts Wolverine about how he apparently volunteered to have the adamantium put in his skeleton, and asks him whether he would actually side with mutants (implying that Wolverine originally hated his mutation before his amnesia). Looking at the young mutant he was carrying to safety, a young boy with a lizard-like tongue, Wolverine informs Stryker that he would "take his chances with him" and left him to die.

Jason, meanwhile, was presumed killed when Cerebro II was destroyed along with the base; wheelchair-bound, he seemed unable to escape under his own power, and the X-Men apparrently made no attempt to save him.
