'''Col. William "Bill" Stryker, M.D.''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]], and enemy of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Brent Anderson]], he first appeared in the 1982 [[graphic novel]] ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills]]''.

Rev. Stryker is a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] [[televangelist]] who sees himself on a mission from [[God]] to destroy the [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant race]]. 

In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', Stryker is played by [[Brian Cox]] as an [[United States Army|army]] colonel with a fervent desire to [[genocide|destroy]] mutants. [[Danny Huston]] portrays Stryker in the superhero prequel movie, ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' in which he is the villainous leader of the [[Weapon X]] project.

==Fictional character biography==
===''God Loves, Man Kills''===
Stryker is a religious fanatic, with a military history which may have involved the [[Weapon X]] project (the same project which results in [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] being given his [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] skeleton). Stryker is characterized by his unequivocal hatred of mutants. So strong is this hatred that Stryker goes so far as to kill his own wife and mutant-born son immediately after his birth. Crazed and outraged, Stryker then makes a failed attempt at [[suicide]]. As time passes, he becomes convinced [[Satan]] has a plot to destroy humankind by corrupting prenatal souls, the result of this corruption being mutants. Additionally, Stryker eventually comes to see the birth of his mutant son as a sign from God, directing him to his true calling: ensuring the eradication of all mutants.

Driven by this newfound conviction, Stryker then becomes a popular but controversial preacher and [[televangelist]]. While his followers, including a secret [[paramilitary]] group called the [[Purifiers]], commit [[hate crime]]s against mutants, Stryker arranges to have [[Professor X]]avier kidnapped, brainwashed, and attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, will kill all living mutants. In order to stop this scheme, the [[X-Men]] are forced to join forces with their nemesis, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. When the extent of his bigotry becomes obvious—he attempts to kill [[Shadowcat (comics)|Kitty Pryde]] in front of a television audience—one of his own security guards shoots and arrests him.

===''God Loves, Man Kills II''===
Stryker, who made no appearances until this storyline in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', was assumed forgotten. This time, it was revealed that Stryker had been serving a prison sentence as a result of the events of his previous actions. [[Lady Deathstrike]], a character with ties to the X-Men's Wolverine, made her way onto the airplane where Stryker was being transferred. Once there, she killed his guards and rescued him, where it was revealed that the two are lovers, and he immediately began a crusade against the X-Men, focusing on Wolverine, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], the X-Treme X-Men team, and Shadowcat, against whom he apparently had a grudge.

Stryker sent a group of followers against several of the X-Men, and kidnapped Kitty Pryde. Along the way, Kitty convinced Stryker that mutants were not an abomination, and he seemed to turn over a new leaf.

===Decimation===
However, he recently came back as a major player right at the start of the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] following Marvel's [[House of M]] event, deeming the sudden massive reduction in number of the mutant population a sign of God, saying "He made the first step and now we have to take the next", basically rallying for [[genocide]] on TV. He was featured mostly in ''[[New X-Men]]'' as the main villain, but also appeared in other comics set during this time frame. With the help of [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]], one of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute's]] students, he caused a bus to explode, killing about 1/4 of the depowered students from the academy. Then he planned the assassination of [[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]], ordering one of his snipers to shoot her in the head. Next he tried to kill [[Dust (comics)|Sooraya Quadir]], though it was actually [[X-23]].  The deaths of Wallflower and Dust were Stryker's prime objectives, as he had been informed by Nimrod that both girls would destroy his army. Finally he attacked the institute with his "Purifiers," killing [[Quill (comics)|Quill]], leaving [[Onyxx (comics)|Onyxx]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] critically wounded, and hurting [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Emma Frost]] and other students. After Stryker's Purifiers were defeated, he was killed by the enraged boyfriend of Wallflower, [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]].

Recently, [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] has resurrected Stryker with a Technarch, to join Bastion's new Purifiers.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate William Stryker===
[[Beast (comics)|Beast]] reveals that the leader of the anti-mutant conspiracy within the U.S. government that operated was an Admiral named Stryker, who is also linked to the creation of the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]]'s version of the [[Legacy Virus]]<ref>''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #81</ref>. Stryker's son, '''Reverend William Stryker, Jr.''' later appears in [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel Comics)|Ultimatum]] as a leader of an anti-mutant coalition. He has cybernetic facial implants and resembles [[Ahab (comics)|Rory Campbell aka Ahab]] from the mainstream Marvel Universe.

===Film===
[[Image:Strykermovie.jpg‎|249px|thumb|right|[[Brian Cox]] as Colonel William Stryker in ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''.]]
* The story prior to his recent reappearing formed the loose basis for the film, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''. Stryker is the main antagonist, and he is played by Scottish actor [[Brian Cox]]. He is said to be a military scientist who has gone into defense contracting, but in a reference to his comics' counterpart, several lines of his hint at a belief that he destined to eradicate mutants. His connection to [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] is made more explicit, as is his motivation regarding his son. Also, rather than having killed his son, Jason (who himself is partially modeled after [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], another X-Men foe), at birth, Stryker sent him to Xavier's school in hopes of curing him, regarding mutation as a disease that must be cured. Xavier had no interest or belief in 'curing' mutants, which angered Stryker. Additionally, Jason continued to grow angry, resentful, and vindictive towards his parents; he tortured them by planting illusions in their brains until his mother committed suicide by drilling into her own brain in order to "bore the images out." Stryker then gave his son a [[lobotomy]] to make him more docile. He attacks the X-Mansion learning the information from brainwashing Magneto. He kidnaps Cyclops and Professor Xavier and brainwashes them both. Jason, under his father's direction brainwashes Xavier into using a reproduction of [[Cerebro]] to kill all mutants. Xavier learns that Stryker is the mastermind behind an assassination attempt on the President by a brainwashed [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. Stryker brainwashes Cyclops and haves him waiting for the X-Men to ambush them. Magneto, wearing a helmet designed to shield against telepathic attacks, is able to reach Xavier while the X-Men are incapacitated by the psychic assault, but then has Jason make Xavier use Cerebro II to kill ordinary humans. At his direction, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] impersonates Stryker and instructs Jason of a change in plans, which Jason then communicates to the brainwashed Xavier. Magneto and Mystique escape, and soon thereafter Storm and Nightcrawler enter Cerebro II and disrupt Jason's illusion, allowing Xavier to break free from his control before any humans or mutants are killed. Stryker attempts to escape, but his attempts are foiled by Wolverine, then Magneto (who chains William to a large block of debris). In his last moments, he confronts Wolverine about how he apparently volunteered to have the adamantium put in his skeleton, and asks him whether he would actually side with mutants (implying that Wolverine originally hated his mutation before his amnesia). Looking at the young mutant he was carrying to safety, a young boy with a lizard-like tongue ([[Artie Maddicks]]), Wolverine informs Stryker that he would "take his chances with him" and left him to die. As Wolverine walks away Stryker says to him that "one day someone will finish what I've started. One day!" Stryker remains chained as the nearby dam bursts.

[[Image:Striker 1 (Danny Huston).png|thumb|right|[[Danny Huston]] as Stryker in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''.]]
* Stryker is in the film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', set roughly twenty years before ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', portrayed by [[Danny Huston]]. Huston liked the complex Stryker, who "both loves and hates mutants because his son was a mutant and drove his wife to suicide. So he understands what they're going through, but despises their [destructive] force." He compared the character to a racehorse breeder, who rears his mutant experiments like children but abandons them when something goes wrong. In the film, Stryker starts off as a Major trying to recruit [[Victor Creed]] and [[James Howlett]] to join [[Weapon X]]. While searching for a mysterious rock, Stryker threatens to kill civilians to garner information, causing Wolverine to leave the team. Through the years Stryker begins working with Creed and using [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]] as Weapon XI. He tells Creed to kill all the other members of the team and to have Logan's girlfriend Kayla ([[Silver Fox]]) - an agent of Stryker's keeping an eye on Logan- fake her death. After Logan is left for dead by Victor, Col. Stryker persuades Logan to become [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. The process is successful, and Stryker wants to use Logan's DNA for the XI, but Logan hears this and escapes. After General Munson tries to shut Weapon X down, learning of Stryker's son and believing that he is too emotionally close to the situation, Stryker kills him. Also Stryker kidnaps mutants, including a younger [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] ([[Tim Pidcock]]) in order to pass their abilities into Weapon XI. The others escape with Kayla and Logan while Logan and Victor battle [[Weapon XI]]. Weapon XI is defeated, but Stryker shoots [[adamantium]] bullets in Logan's head, causing [[amnesia]] as a result of the damage done to his brain; although the physical injury can be healed from, the memories themselves are apparently permanently gone. He points the gun at Kayla but Kayla tells him by using her power of persuasion to walk until his feet bleed and then keep walking, refusing to order him to kill himself as that would make them no better than him. Stryker unwillingly does so, and is investigated at the end of the movie by military police in connection with General Munson's murder. He also started looking like he was in X2, gaining weight, having wrinkles, and more rugged features. <ref name=reynolds>{{cite news | author=Marc Graser | url=Tatiana Siegel | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Reynolds, will.i.am join 'Wolverine' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2008-02-19 }}</ref>

===Video games===
* Stryker is referenced several times in [[X-Men: The Official Game]]. It's revealed that his son [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Stryker]] survived and is using his father's secret program Master Mold to kill the X-Men. It's also revealed that [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]] and [[Silver Samurai|Kenuichio Harada]] funded it for him.
* Col. Stryker appears in a major role in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' voiced by [[David Florek]].
* The game-exclusive master villain in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' named '''Gen. William Kincaid''' (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) is largely based on the film series incarnation of Stryker and similar characters such as [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Steven Lang (comics)|Dr. Steven Lang]].
