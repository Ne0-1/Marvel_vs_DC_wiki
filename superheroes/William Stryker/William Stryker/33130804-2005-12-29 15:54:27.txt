'''William Stryker''' is a fictional character appearing in the [[X-Men]] series of comic books; more specifically, in the [[graphic novel]] [[God Loves, Man Kills]] and its sequel, [[God Loves, Man Kills II]].

==In the Comics==
Stryker is a [[fundamentalist]] religious fanatic, with a military history which may have involved the [[Weapon X]] project, which resulted in Logan/[[Wolverine]] being given his adamentium skeleton. When his son was born, he was so physically deformed that Stryker knew he was a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] and, in a fit of rage, killed his wife and son at once, then concealed the evidence. He became convinced that [[Satan]] had a plot to corrupt humankind by taking over their souls while still in the womb, resulting in their mutations. He further concluded that the only reason God would have allowed his son to be a mutant was to direct him to his true calling: ridding the world of mutants. While his followers committed [[hate crime]]s against mutants, Stryker arranged to have [[Professor X]]avier kidnapped, brainwashed, and attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, would kill all living mutants. In order to stop this scheme, the [[X-Men]] are forced to join forces with their nemesis, [[Magneto]]. When the extent of his bigotry becomes obvious, one of his own security guards shoots and arrests him. Stryker eventually redeems himself in God Loves, Man Kills 2.

==In the Films(X2)==
This storyline formed the loose basis for the film, [[X2 (film)|X2]], which follows its basic premise, but also incorporates elements of the [[Dark Phoenix Saga]], In this movie, William Stryker is played by [[Brian Cox]].

Stryker was slightly altered for his film interpretation. He is no longer a religious [[fundamentalist]], but simply a military officer who has gone into defense contracting. His connection to Wolverine is made more explicit, as is his motivation regarding his son. Rather than having killed his son, Jason, at birth, the film's Stryker sent him to Xavier's school, hoping to cure him. Xavier had no interest or belief in curing mutants, and Jason grew angry, resentful and vindictive towards his parents, torturing his mother by planting illusions in her brain until she committed suicide by drilling into her own brain. Stryker then gave his son a [[lobotomy]] to make him more docile, and it is he who brainwashes Xavier into using a reproduction of [[Cerebro]] to kill all mutants. He is presumably killed when an explosion at his base of operations destroys a nearby dam.
