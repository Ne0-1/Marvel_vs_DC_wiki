'''Southpaw''' (Sasha Martin) is a fictional character that first appeared in the Marvel comic ''[[She-Hulk]]''. She is [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway|Holden Holliway]]'s granddaughter and in the custody of She-Hulk (and if She-Hulk becomes Jennifer Walters, then [[Awesome Android (comics)|Awesome Andy]]).

She is incredibly powerful because of a gauntlet she wears that cannot be removed. She has a short temper and will often act without thinking (i.e., destroying her high school because they brought back school uniforms, or attacking the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]] because he took her piece of fruit from her).

==Fictional character biography==
Sasha first appeared in ''She-Hulk'' #5 attacking the [[New Warriors]] (who were trying to stop her from stealing [[compact disc|CD]]s) sending [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] flying into a building and grabbing Namorita. She was later subdued by [[Night Thrasher]] and was taken to the [[Big House (comics)|Big House]]. The [[Mad Thinker]] told her to aid them in an escape. They shrank down and stowed away on She-Hulk's hand when the miniature villains escaped.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #5</ref> She aided [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] in subduing the [[U-Foes]] after they threatened to kill Holliway.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #6</ref> She was later taken with She-Hulk to Skardon to aid the [[Living Tribunal|Magistrati]] in dethroning Champion and unnwittingly gave She-Hulk the answer to defeat the Champion.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #7</ref>

==Future Southpaw==
===She-Hulk===
In a possible future detailed in ''[[She-Hulk]]'', Southpaw becomes a lawyer and an active superheroine (inspired by The [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] and complete with a partner/sidekick, Kid Glove) and eventually gets recruited from fifteen years in the future to act as She-Hulk's lawyer when the [[Time Variance Authority]] attempts to remove her from the timeline.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

===Bishop===
In [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]'s future someone named Southpaw worked with Hancock in the Summers Rebellion.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Whether or not this is the same Southpaw is unknown; however, given Hancock's age and the fact this future is portrayed as only 70 years in the Marvel Universe's future, it is possible that it is the same Southpaw.{{Or|date=January 2010}}

==Powers and abilities==
Southpaw can use the gauntlet to project energy hands that mimic what her hand inside the gauntlet is doing (however, she once grabbed [[Namorita]] with an energy fist while holding her hand out flat{{Issue|date=January 2010}}). These hands are powerful enough to restrain [[She-Hulk]] temporarily (although, whether She-Hulk was really restrained is questionable, seeing as she subsequently, and playfully, played "This Little Piggy" with the energy hands fingers; this forced Southpaw's fingers open and caused Southpaw great discomfort).{{Issue|date=January 2010}} The energy hand was certainly strong enough to twist [[Ironclad (comics)|Ironclad]]'s arm.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} She uses the hands as her main attack method, mainly by grabbing an opponent. She can also perform feats of class 100 strength, but only with her left hand.

Her gauntlet's size and shape appears to alter at random. Whether this is due to its abilities or simply different artwork has let to be explained, but at times it seems almost as big as her whole body while at others it barely goes past her wrist.
