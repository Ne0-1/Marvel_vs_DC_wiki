'''Southpaw''' is a fictional character that first appeared in the Marvel comic ''[[She-Hulk]]''. She is [[Holden Holliway]]'s granddaughter and in custody of She-Hulk (and if She-hulk becomes Jennifer Walters, then [[Awesome Android (comics)|Awesome Andy]]).

She is incredibly powerful because of a gauntlet she wears that cannot be removed. She has a short temper and will often act without thinking (i.e., destroying her high school because they brought back school uniforms', or attacking [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]] because he took her piece of fruit from her).
 
She can use the gauntlet to project energy hands that mimic what her hand inside the gauntlet is doing (however she once grabbed [[Namorita]] with an energy fist and was holding her hand out flat). These hands are powerful enough to restrain She-Hulk temporarily and twist [[Ironclad (comics)|Ironclad]]'s arm. She uses the hands as her main attack method, mainly by grabbing an opponent. She can also perform feats of class 100 strength but only with her left hand.

*Age: 15
*Hair: Black
*Eyes: Blue

She first appeared in She Hulk #5 attacking the [[New Warriors]] (who were trying to stop her from stealing CD's) sending [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] into a building and grabbing Namorita. She was later subdued by [[Night Thrasher]] and was taken to the Big House. The [[Mad Thinker]] told her to aid them in an escape. They shrunk down and stowed away on She-Hulk's hand when the miniature villains escaped. She aided [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] in subduing the [[U-Foes]] after they threatened to kill Holliway. She was later taken with She-Hulk to Skardon to aid the [[Living Tribunal#The_Magistrati|Magistrati]] in dethroning Champion and unnwittingly gave She-Hulk the answer to defeat Champion.

==Future Southpaw==
===She-Hulk===
In a possible future detailed in [[She-Hulk]] Southpaw becomes a lawyer and an active superheroine (inspired by The [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] and complete with a partner/sidekick, Kid Glove) and eventually gets recruited from fifteen years in the future to act as She-Hulk's lawyer when the [[Time Variance Authority]] attempts to remove her from the timeline.

===Bishop===
In [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop's]] future someone named Southpaw worked with Hancock in the Summers' Rebellion. Whether or not this is the same Southpaw is unknown however given Hancock's age and the fact this future is portrayed as only 70 years in the Marvel Universe's future, it is possible that it is the same Southpaw.
