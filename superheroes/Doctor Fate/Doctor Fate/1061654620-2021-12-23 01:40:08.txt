DC eventually replaced the existing Doctor Fate with a new character, Jared Stevens. Stevens was introduced in a self-titled series called ''Fate'', launched in the wake of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' in 1994,<ref name="fate0">''Fate'' #0 (October 1994)</ref> which was cancelled after 23 issues in September 1996. The character then starred in ''The Book of Fate'', which ran from February 1997 to January 1998 for twelve issues as part of DC's "[[Weirdoverse]]" imprint.
 
In early 2007, DC published a new Doctor Fate comic starring Kent Nelson's [[Doctor Fate (Kent V.

As part of [[The New 52]] initiative, a new Doctor Fate named Khalid Ben-Hassin was created by writer James Robinson<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeffery Renaud |url=http://www.cbr.com/robinson-unleashes-fury-doctor-fate-on-earth-2/ |title=Robinson Unleashes Fury, Doctor Fate on "Earth 2" |website=Comic Book Resources |date=2012-12-06 |access-date=2013-09-12}}</ref> and artist Brett Booth.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Kent Nelson===
{{Main|Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)}}
The original Doctor Fate was Kent Nelson who discovered the tomb of the wizard Nabu and was trained by him in the ways of sorcery in order to fight crime and the forces of evil. He was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name="mf67"/><ref name="mf55"/><ref name="flash306">''The Flash'' #306 (February 1982)</ref><ref name="Fate1987">''Doctor Fate'' #1–4 (July–October 1987)</ref>

===Eric and Linda Strauss===
[[File:Drfateinzanelson.jpg|thumb|160px|''Justice League America'' #31 (October 1989): Linda Strauss as Doctor Fate. Cover art by [[Adam Hughes]].]]

After Kent's death, Nabu chooses Eric Strauss and his stepmother Linda to be the next Doctor Fate, with Eric and Linda having to merge into one being in order to become Fate.<ref name="Fate1987"/> Nabu goes on to possess Kent's corpse in order to personally advise them.<ref name="Fate1987"/> The three of them are soon joined by a friendly demon called Petey and lawyer Jack C. Small.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #2 (December 1988)</ref>

Eric is killed on [[Apokolips]] during a battle with [[Desaad]], forcing Linda to become Doctor Fate on her own.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #12 (December 1989)</ref> Linda is killed soon afterwards by the [[Lords of Chaos and Order#Lords of Chaos|Lords of Chaos]]. Eric and Linda's souls are reincarnated in the bodies of Eugene and Wendy DiBellia while Nabu reincarnates in Eugene and Wendy's unborn child.<ref name="df24">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #24 (January 1991)</ref>

===Inza Cramer Nelson===
Kent and Inza, whose souls have been inhabiting a fantasy world within the amulet, are resurrected in younger bodies,<ref name="df24"/> but only Inza can become Doctor Fate.<ref name="df25">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #25 (February 1991)</ref> As Doctor Fate, Inza becomes more proactive and reckless in the use of her powers, which leads to her temporary separation from Kent.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #26–32 (March 1991–September 1991)</ref>

The Nelsons learn T'Giian, a [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Chaos]], has possessed the helmet. This provides Inza with magic derived from Chaos instead of Order, which is why Kent and Inza can't merge to become Doctor Fate.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #34 (November 1991)</ref> Kent reunites with Inza and helps her defeat T'Giian.<ref name="df35">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #35 (December 1991)</ref> Inza then discovers her new powers come from the people of Earth rather than the magic of Order and Chaos.<ref name="df35"/><ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #37 (February 1992)</ref> The Nelsons start merging as the male Doctor Fate again, but the two of them can become separate Doctor Fates if needed. When operating as separate Doctor Fates, Inza wears the helmet and Kent's original costume while Kent wears the half helmet and costume he used in the late 1940s.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #36 (January 1992)</ref>

Sometime later, the Nelsons and the JSA face the supervillain [[Hank Hall#Zero Hour: Extant|Extant]] during [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'s attempt to change the history of the universe. Extant uses his time manipulation powers to rapidly age Kent and Inza to their proper physical ages. Extant also scatters the helmet, amulet, and cloak. The aged and depowered Nelsons then retire.<ref>{{Comic book reference|writer=[[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]]|penciller=Jurgens, Dan|inker=|story=|title=Zero Hour|volume=|issue=#4-0|date=Sept. 1994|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=|panel=}}</ref>

===Jared Stevens===
[[File:Fatejaredstevens.jpg|thumb|160px|''Fate'' #1 (November 1994) featuring Jared Stevens. Cover art by [[Anthony Williams (comics)|Anthony Williams]] and [[Andy Lanning]].]]
After retiring, the Nelsons hire smuggler Jared Stevens to recover the helmet, amulet, and cloak from an Egyptian tomb. When the Nelsons try to collect the artifacts, they are murdered by two demons. During the battle, Jared attempts to use the amulet as a weapon, which then explodes and imbues him with various magical abilities and a red ankh-shaped scar over his right eye. Jared's injuries force him to use the cloak as a wrap for his right arm and to melt the helmet into a set of ankh-shaped darts and a dagger for use as weapons. After defeating the demons, Jared is contacted by Nabu, who attempts to make Jared the new Doctor Fate. Jared refuses and escapes, becoming a demon hunter using the alias "Fate".<ref name="fate0"/> During his battles, he teams up with the supernaturally powered team of fugitives [[Scare Tactics (comics)|Scare Tactics]], [[Etrigan the Demon]] and other forces to combat threats from the realm of [[Gemworld]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Jared is later murdered by [[Mordru]], who attempts to kill all the agents of Chaos and Order and claim Fate's artifacts for himself.<ref name="jsa1"/> Jared's equipment reverts to its original forms and returns to the Tower of Fate upon his death.<ref>''JSA'' #3 (October 1999)</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Nights: Death Metal]]'' storyline, Jared is among the superheroes that were revived by [[Batman]] using a Black Lantern ring.<ref>''Dark Nights: Death Metal'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>

===Hector Hall===
{{Main|Hector Hall}}
After Jared's murder, the mantle of Doctor Fate, along with a restored helmet, amulet, and cloak, is passed to a reincarnated Hector Hall.<ref name="jsa4"/> The Justice Society is reformed to protect the newly reborn Hector, who is being sought by Mordru so that he can use the boy's body to unlock the magical potential of Doctor Fate's artifacts for his own benefit.<ref>''JSA'' #2 (September 1999)</ref> Hector's new body is the biological son of [[Dove (Dawn Granger)|Hawk and Dove]], who are agents of Chaos and Order, respectively, which makes Hector an agent of balance instead of one side or the other.<ref>''JSA'' #46 (May 2003)</ref>

When the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] goes on a quest to extinguish magic, he banishes Hector and his [[Fury (DC Comics)#Lyta Trevor-Hall|wife]] to a snowy mountain landscape for all eternity, which they are only able to 'escape' by entering the Dream realm, although this essentially kills their bodies and means they can never return to Earth.<ref>{{Comic book reference|writer=[[Keith Champagne|Champagne, Keith]]|penciller=[[Don Kramer|Kramer, Don]]|inker=|story=|title=[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]|volume=|issue=#79–80|date=January and February 2006 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]|page=|panel=}}</ref>

When they did, Khalid gained the Helmet of Fate while Kendra grew bird-like wings. When he is not wearing the Helmet of Fate, Khalid acts crazy in front of everyone as he claims that Nabu can still speak to him this way.<ref>''Earth 2'' #9 (April 2013). DC Comics.</ref>

===Khalid Nassour===
{{Main|Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)}}
In June 2015, a new ''Doctor Fate'' series was launched, starring the Earth-0 incarnation of the character, an Egyptian-American medical student named Khalid Nassour.<ref name="newsarama1"/> Khalid receives the helmet from a statue of Bastet which turned out to be his cat.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 4) #1-4.

==Powers and abilities==
All Doctor Fates possess formidable magical powers due to the object known as the Helmet of Fate, an object of mystical power housing the soul of the Lord of Order, Nabu, allowing them to possess a plethora of abilities such as being able to perform spell-casting, possess powers over natural elements (wind, earth, fire air), create and redirect lightning,<ref>{{Cite book |title=The DC comics encyclopedia: the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe|date=2021|author=Matthew K.

Earlier versions of Doctor Fate suffered from several weaknesses: Fate is unable to counteract spells that have already been cast and are in effect,<ref>''Justice League of America'' #38 (September 1965)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #148 (November 1977)</ref> but is able to cancel elemental spells cast by weaker magicians.<ref name="DC Comics Presents' 1980">''DC Comics Presents'' #23 (July 1980)</ref> Fate was also weak to gas attacks and a lack of oxygen, and can also be overpowered and knocked unconscious. However, later versions of Fate are able to counteract spells already in effect and aren't particularly weak to gas attacks or lack of oxygen although the mortality of his hosts remains. Some Doctor Fates also struggle with control over the Helm as Nabu attempts to overwhelm them with his influence.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The DC comics encyclopedia: the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe|publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK Publishing]]|author=Matthew K.
