'''Doctor Fate''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] and [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]], best known as a member of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman, he first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 ([[1940#May|May 1940]]).

The original and best known Doctor Fate was '''Kent Nelson''', an [[Archaeology|archeologist]] who discovered the tomb of the mystical being [[Lords of Chaos and Order#Lords of Order|Nabu]] and was trained by him in the arts of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].

Doctor Fate was a member of DC’s [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] all-star group the Justice Society of America and was an essential part of the group during its [[1970s]] revival.

Afterwards, DC introduced several new versions of Doctor Fate. These included: '''Eric and Linda Strauss''', a man and woman who could merge to form Doctor Fate; '''Inza Nelson''', Nelson’s [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] wife; [[Fate (comics)|Fate]], a [[mercenary]] who used Nelson’s weapons; and a resurrected '''Hector Hall''', the son of Justice Society of America members [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]].

All of the revivals were relatively short-lived; and as such Dr. Fate's appearances outside of the comic continuity (for instance, in the [[DC animated universe]]) tend to be of the original Golden Age Kent Nelson incarnation. 

==Publication history==
Kent Nelson was raised by an [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] wizard named [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Nabu]], and appeared in 1940 as the heroic Doctor Fate in ''More Fun Comics'' #55. Among Golden Age superheroes, Fate was unusual for wearing a [[Helmet|helm]] that covered his entire face.

Fate became a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]] in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #3 (Winter 1940) and remained a member for several years, departing the group following #23.

In 1941, Fate traded in his full helmet for a half-helmet, leaving his mouth exposed. Fate's popularity waned faster than many of his contemporaries, and he disappeared from the scene before the 1940s were out.

Fate was revived along with the rest of the JSA in the 1960s through the annual team-ups with the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], who were established as residing on a [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] from the JSA. Unlike many of his JSA cohorts, Fate did not have a corresponding JLA analogue. This was perhaps because the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] revivals took a more [[science fiction]]al bent, with which Fate was not essentially compatible. In addition, this may have boosted his long-term popularity especially considering he is the closest counterpart the company has to [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Doctor Strange]].

Fate also teamed with [[Hourman]] in two issues of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'', #55-56 [[#External links|(1)]]. Doctor Fate was a regular member of the JSA during the ''All Star Comics'' revival of the 1970s, as well as appearing in ''[[First Issue Special]]'' #9 (1975), drawn by [[Walt Simonson]]. Kent and Inza, combining into one Doctor Fate, also featured in a series of back-up stories beginning in ''The Flash'' #305 (February 1982) and running through #313 (September 1982). [[Keith Giffen]] drew all nine stories and [[Cary Bates]] wrote the initial one, with [[Martin Pasko]] taking over as writer in issue #306, aided by [[Steve Gerber]] from #310 to #313. DC later collected these stories, among others, in the three-issue [[limited series]], ''The Immortal Dr. Fate''.

In the 1980s following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Fate briefly joined the Justice League and was the star of a 4-issue miniseries by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and Keith Giffen. In this story Nelson finally died of old age and the mantle of Doctor Fatewas taken up by a pair of humans, Eric and Linda Strauss, who would merge into one being to become Fate (similar in this regard to [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]). Nelson's body was reanimated by Nabu (who was revealed to be a [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Order]]), and started calling himself Kent, to help train the pair in their new role. The three starred in a ''Doctor Fate'' series by DeMatteis and [[Shawn McManus]].

After two years, the series and character shifted such that Nelson's wife Inza inherited the Fate mantle and starred in a year's worth of stories in which she tried to change the world for the better using her powers.

After this, DC decided to retire the classic characters, and a character named Fate replaced Doctor Fate. He was a mercenary whose weapons were the transformed helm and amulet of Doctor Fate. He starred in two of his own series, ''Fate'' and ''The Books of Fate'', but both were cancelled after relatively short runs.

In 1999, the Fate character was retired in the new ''JSA'' series, and Doctor Fate returned. In this story the mantle passed to [[Hector Hall]], the former Silver Scarab, and the son of the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl and father of the new [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Dream]]. Like his father, Hall had himself been reincarnated, and assumed the mantle of Doctor Fate after a battle with the wizard [[Mordru]], who craved Doctor Fate's power. In addition to appearing in ''JSA'', this new Doctor Fate starred in a 5-issue miniseries in 2003. This incarnation of Fate was killed off in 2006 during the events of ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''.

DC has recently revived the character during the events of the weekly limited series ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', with the helm currently in the possession of [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]]. A new ongoing series will debut in 2007 featuring the new wearer of the helm. According to scripter Steve Gerber in [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]] {{fact}}, it will be the grandnephew of Kent Nelson who also is named Kent.

==Fictional biographies==
===Kent Nelson/Nabu===
Kent Nelson was the son of an [[United States|American]] archaeologist in the 1920s. While on an expedition to [[Egypt]], Nelson's father opened the [[tomb]] of the wizard Nabu, and was killed for the violation. (Nabu is named after a god from Babylonian mythology. The Nabu of the DC Universe may originally been meant to be this god.)  However, Nabu took pity on the orphaned Nelson and raised him himself, teaching him the skills of a wizard and bestowing upon him a mystical helm and [[amulet]].

By 1940, Nelson had returned to the United States, housed himself in an [[Invisibility|invisible]] tower in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], and embarked on a career fighting [[crime]] and [[supernatural]] [[evil]] as the hero named Doctor Fate.

Fate was a founding member of the Justice Society of America, though he left the group around [[1945]]. As Kent Nelson, he romanced and eventually married a redheaded woman named Inza. His powers as Fate kept the two of them young through the [[1980s]]. In [[1942]], he stopped wearing his full-head helm and switched to a half-helm that left his mouth and chin exposed.

[[Image:Drfate.jpg|frame|Doctor Fate in his half-helm.]]

In ''First Issue Special'' #9 (1975) it was established through a retcon that the full helmet contained the personality of Nabu, who partially replaced Nelson's own personality when the helm was donned. Switching to the half-helmet left Nelson in charge, but also stripped him of much of his sorcerous might, leaving him merely strong, tough, and able to [[flight|fly]], essentially a second-rate [[Superman]]. In ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #27 another retcon revealed that Fate switched to the half-helm because a [[supervillain]] stole the Helm of Nabu and both were cast into an alternate dimension.

Fate presumably retired - or simply disappeared from public life - in the late 1940s and was inactive through the 1950s along with most other Golden Age superheroes.

When the Justice Society reactivated in the 1960s, Fate was a member - again wearing the Helm of Nabu, though how it was recovered has not been revealed. Little is known of Fate's adventures during this period. His only appearances were during the JSA's annual, inter-dimensional gatherings with the Justice League of America, a pair of adventures shared with Hourman facing the [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and the [[Psycho-Pirate]], and a team-up with Superman in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' that aberrantly portrayed him as having become a medical doctor in his civilian identity.

Fate was also a member of the JSA in the [[1970]]s, though he had become increasingly erratic and withdrawn from humanity, though still committed to protecting Earth against supernatural menaces. In the 1980s, Fate briefly joined the Justice League, but Nabu's magic was failing to keep Kent and Inza Nelson young and the pair then passed away.

===Eric and Linda Strauss===
[[Image:Drfateinzanelson.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Linda Strauss as Doctor Fate on the cover to ''Justice League of America'' #31.]]

Nabu bound together a pair of humans, Eric and Linda Strauss into a new Doctor Fate, the pair merging into one being to become the hero, but otherwise living their own lives. Nabu joined them by animating Kent Nelson's corpse and referring to himself as Kent. They moved into Linda's apartment, away from the seemingly destroyed Tower of Fate, where they were soon joined by a small and kind demon dubbed Petey and the lawyer Jack C. Small. 

With Nabu's teaching, the three were active for a couple of years, until Eric was killed in battle on Apokolips. Instead of being allowed to pass on, Eric’s soul was placed in the dying body of Eugene DiBellia, who had been severely injured in a car crash. Eugene was the father to a cosmically important daughter named Raina, who would usher in a new age for mankind. Linda operated on her own for a while, before the mantle of Fate rejected her.

Nonetheless, the Anti-Fate, Dr. Benjamin Stoner, returned to plague her, and Linda and Nabu joined to form Fate. Although the Anti-Fate was defeated, Linda died after the Lords of Chaos magically assaulted her before retreating. Similar to Eric, her soul was placed in the dying body of Wendy DiBellia, Eugene's wife, so that she and Eric could take care of Raina. The DiBellia couple was always fated to die, but thanks to the timely intervention of the [[Phantom Stranger]] and a character serving as the human avatar of God, Raina was not left without her caretakers.{{-}}

===Inza Nelson===
It turned out that the Nelsons' souls still resided within Fate's amulet and they were resurrected in new, young bodies; this time, however, Inza alone was able to manifest as Doctor Fate. Kent chided Inza for what he felt was reckless use of magic but she began to work toward improving their neighborhood.

As a female Doctor Fate, she spent a couple of years striving to improve the lot of humanity, being, unlike her husband, a [[proactive]] Doctor Fate. Her inexperience in the actual use of magics backfired at first, but she grew into her own after some time. After only a few months to develop her skills, Inza was instrumental in the defeat of Circe in the "War of the Gods" saga.

However, as she developed in her magics, she also started to expand in her proactive role. She became increasingly reckless in the way she used her magics. Slowly but surely the people started to become dependent on her and for every little problem called out for Doctor Fate. Instead of retreating, she made matters worse as she developed spheres that responded to the people's wishes.

The abuse of the Fate magics ended up separating Kent and Inza as they steadily found themselves opposed to one another's actions. It was then learned that a Lord of Chaos had taken residence in the Helm of Nabu and was granting Inza powers derived from Chaos instead of Order. The Lord of Chaos was also responsible for keeping Kent from merging with Inza to become the true Doctor Fate. With Kent's help, the Lord of Chaos was defeated and Kent eventually returned to his wife's side. Inza then learned that she drew her new powers from the people of Earth, rather than Chaos or Order.

However, Inza's continued proactive behavior caused the US government to take notice of her, as she was put on trial before Congress. After giving a stern lecture to the Congressmen, she temporarily turned them all into [[newts]].

With the Chaos Lord defeated, Kent and Inza began merging as the male Doctor Fate again. However, they could still form independent Doctor Fates when necessary, with Kent taking the form of his Golden Age half-helm incarnation who was capable of super-strength, flight and energy blasts.

The combined Doctor Fate faced the supervillain [[Hank Hall#Zero Hour: Extant|Extant]] in the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] crisis. In a controversial battle, Extant dispatched much of the JSA without fanfare, and in the process scattered Fate's helm, amulet and cloak and greatly aged the Nelsons, who returned to Salem.

===Jared Stevens===
[[Image:Fatejaredstevens.jpg|thumb|160px|Jared Stevens as the new Fate, on the cover to ''Fate'' #1.]]

:{{main|Fate (comics)}}

Jared Stevens discovered the artifacts, transformed the helm into smaller weapons, and began a career as a balance between Order and Chaos as Fate. During his one encounter with the Nelsons, minions of a villain killed the pair, and their souls returned to Fate's amulet.

He would eventually meet his end at the hands of Mordru, who was killing agents of Chaos and Order alike in a bid to kill the child that would inherit the mantle of Fate and claim the artifacts for himself.

===Hector Hall===
[[Image:drfate4.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Hector Hall as Doctor Fate. ART by Stephen Sadowski]]

:{{main|Hector Hall}}

Nabu had arranged, however, for Hector Hall to be reincarnated as the new Doctor Fate. With the aid of the reformed Justice Society, this came to pass, and Hall took up the mantle.

Hector's reincarnated body, however, supposedly differentiated his purpose from previous "Doctor Fates." Hector's physical body is the son of DC heroes [[Hawk and Dove]], agents of Chaos and Order, respectively. Therefore, Hector was born as be an agent of balance, as opposed to an agent of Order, like the previous Fates were. Later stories either downplayed or dropped this concept.

In ''JSA'' #78-80, after a climactic conflict with the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], Hector Hall and his wife [[Fury (DC Comics)|Lyta]] were banished to "Hell," a snowy mountain landscape, where he would be forced to spend eternity. After protecting his unconscious wife from a group of demons, Hector collapsed, just as Lyta awoke. She revealed that she had communicated with her son Daniel Hall, now the [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Lord of Dreams]]), and made a deal. The two joined their son in the Dreaming, seemingly giving up the mortal world forever.{{-}}

===Nabu===
With the disappearance of Hector Hall, his teammates in the Justice Society travelled to the Tower of Fate, hoping to use his services to travel to the Fifth Dimension and find [[Jakeem Thunder]]. At the Tower they found the garments of Fate, but no Hector. Seeking to call forth Nabu, [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]] wore the garments and Nabu spoke through him. He prepared a spell through which some of the team travelled to the Fifth dimension, but at that time, Mordru returned and botched the spell.

[[Image:NabuMordru.png|frame|Nabu confronts Mordru without the use of a host body in ''JSA'' #80. Art by Don Kramer.]]

In turn, he subjugated the remaining Society members and Doctor Fate. Mordru seemingly crushed Nabu and his helmet, which allowed Sand to use his powers and free himself. Freeing the other members of the team, they took on Mordru, as Nabu started to channel himself through the vestments of Fate without a host. He fought Mordru, transporting him to differing dimensions in hopes of defeating him, travelling to the worlds of ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' before being stopped by Mordru.

The two continued their struggle, with Mordru seeming to be get the upper hand, until the timely arrival of Jakeem and the rest of the JSA. Jakeem and his Thunderbolt single-handedly took care of Mordru. The Justice Society offered Nabu membership, but he discerned that a [[Infinite Crisis|crisis]] was afoot and that his presence was required elsewhere, disappearing.

In the ''Day of Vengeance'' Special, Nabu called together a team of magical beings to stop the Spectre and seal the Seven Deadly Sins. Nabu personally confronted and goaded the Spectre, whose anger grew so great that the Presence took notice and sent the Spectre to his new host. As a result, Nabu died, which caused the end of the Ninth Age of Magic and the beginning of the Tenth Age. 

Before his death, he gave the Helm to [[Detective Chimp]] to give to the new Doctor Fate. The helmet would still have certain abilities, even though Nabu would no longer be contained within it. After a failed attempt by Detective Chimp to put the helmet on, he asked [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to throw the helmet down to Earth and let it land where it will, letting fate pick its next Doctor.

===''52''===
{{main|52 (comic book)}}
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:5218.jpg|160px|Cover art for ''52'' - Week 18, by [[J.G. Jones]].|thumb]]

Detective Timothy Trench finds Nabu's helmet but does not measure up to its standards and is liquified. The Detective Chimp then takes possession of the helmet. The [[Shadowpact]], along with Ralph Dibny, meet up in Giza, where the helmet explains Trench's fate. The helm explains that the new age of magic requires greater precision in the use of magic and that mistakes can be fatal. The helmet tells Dibny that it can fulfill his heart's desire, his wife's resurrection, if he goes through the necessary trials to claim the knowledge within the helm. Dibny leaves with the helm. Currently the helm has taken Dibny through several dimensions to show the possible consequences of his actions before going through with its plans. Dibny agreed.

==Other versions of Doctor Fate==
===Doctor Chaos (Earth-One's Doctor Fate analog)===
Professor Lewis Lang and his assistant Burt Belker discovered a helmet identical to the one used by Nabu, though containing a Lord of Chaos, in the Valley of Ur. The Lord of Chaos possessed Burt to become Doctor Chaos, who had a different agenda to Earth-Two's Doctor Fate. Doctor Chaos's costume was identical to Doctor Fate's, but had an opposite color scheme. [[Superboy]] confronted him and was able to remove the helmet from Belker and jettison it into space. There was no record of the helmet ever returning to Earth, and the merging of alternate universes during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] removed the occurrence from the continuity of the DC universe.

===Fate (Kingdom Come)===
The reality of ''Kingdom Come'' featured a version of Nabu, similar to his final appearance, who was able to channel his consciousness through the Helm and Cloak without the need for a host body. This version of Fate sided with Batman's group during the series, and was amongst the survivors at the end of the story.

===Future (Books of Magic)===
In the fourth Book of the ''Books of Magic'' mini-series by [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Mister E]] shows a future version of Doctor Fate is to [[Timothy Hunter]]. This one is a corrupted version of the Helm which looks like a human skull. It would ultimately kill any of its worshippers that wears it. This one no longer cares about the war between Order and Chaos and believes that there is no meaning in life; just flesh and death. Mister E says he wanted to kill Doctor Fate and destroy the helm long ago, but the Justice League prevented him. (Note: In the first book, Hunter and the Phantom Stranger met Kent Nelson, though Nelson was not aware of their presence.)

===Doctor Strangefate===
[[Doctor Strangefate]] is the [[Amalgam Comics]] equivalent of Doctor Fate combined with Doctor Strange and [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] of Marvel Comics. His powers were based on both Doctors, but he was Charles Xavier under the helm. Doctor Strangefate was the protector of the Amalgam Comics universe, built up the universe around him from the battle between DC Comics and Marvel Comics respectively, and would literally kill to prevent his world from collapsing.

Over time, Marvel Comics' Doctor Strange has evolved to be somewhat similar to Doctor Fate, in that both possess amulets which can emit beams of light, and both live in mysterious abodes filled with mystical books and objects. Fate is considerably more withdrawn from humanity in both demeanor and locale than is the [[Manhattan]]-based Strange.

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Fate possesses a variety of mystical powers.  In general, with the helmet of Nabu, the host can fly, is resistant to damage, has minor [[Psychokinesis|telekenesis]], and has greater-than-human strength. 

At his most potent, Doctor Fate is an accomplished sorcerer, able to match most other wizards in the DC Universe. He has been credited in DC's Who's Who as being one of the top 12 most powerful heroes in the DC Universe. 

Fate has been observed throwing bolts of mystical energy, teleporting across the universe, crafting solid objects out of energy, and transforming objects into other kinds of matter. The full limits of his magical skills are unknown, and have varied greatly from one appearance to the next depending on the needs of the story. For example: In ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' #50, he slays the demon Abnegazar of the [[Demons Three]] with very little effort. Conversely in ''Justice League of America'' #148 the Demons Three control him and set him against his fellow heroes.

At perhaps the peak of his abilities, he was able to take control of [[Etrigan the Demon]], [[Darkseid]], [[Highfather]] and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] and harness their powers to take on the Anti-Life entity. In this instance, he was powerful enough to destroy a reality in order to halt the advance of the entity using a "Mystic Firebreak". As powerful as he is, he has been shown to be on the losing side of drawn out battles with the Spectre, as shown in the recent ''Day of Vengeance'' series.

===Helm of Nabu===
The helmet that Doctor Fate wears is the focus of the Doctor Fate identity. It originally housed Nabu's spirit and allowed him to possess the current host, it later only allowed him to advise the host instead. The helmet is what provides the link to Nabu and by not wearing it, as Kent Nelson did at one time, Doctor Fate loses much of its power and knowledge.

Putting on the helmet of Doctor Fate usually results in its wearer being clad in the other garments of Fate, unless the one with the actual claim to the helmet wants to prevent it. On several occasions, villains seeking the power of Doctor Fate have stolen the helmet, in which case the result has typically been that the wearer goes insane when they try to put on the helmet.

===Amulet of Anubis===
The circular device that adorns the [[livery collar]] worn around Doctor Fate's chest and shoulders is the Amulet of Anubis, which gives anyone who wears it vast magical abilities. It holds many similarities to the Amulet of Agamotto of Marvel Comics character Doctor Strange, with both Amulets being capable of revealing and recognizing magical characters. The amulet has also been shown to house the souls of many whom have worn the vestments of Fate. In JSA, the amulet contained the image of a farmhouse with the souls of Kent and Inza Nelson, Eric and Linda Strauss, Jared Stevens and [[Kid Eternity]] inhabiting it. This dimension was used more than once as a refuge for the JSA to regroup in battle or access the advice of previous Doctor Fates. Mordru was imprisoned in this dimension for some time.

==Awards==
Both the character and the comics of the same name have received recognition, including:
* ''1963 Alley Award for Strip Favored for Revival''
* ''1965 Alley Award for Best Revived Hero''

==Other media==
Doctor Fate has guest appeared in animated form on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', and became a member of the Justice League in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The Doctor Fate in those series is the Kent Nelson version. In ''Superman: The Animated Series'' George Del Hoyo provided his voice. In his return appearances in the ''Justice League'' series, [[Oded Fehr]] provides his voice.

In his ''Superman'' appearance, "The Hand of Fate", Superman goes to seek Fate's help when a supernatural threat named Karkull, whom Fate is responsible for defeating previously, invades and conquers the [[Daily Planet]]. At first, Fate refuses to get involved because he was tired of the eternal struggle between "good" and "evil". Superman's insistence on returning to fight on his own, despite success being unlikely to, inspires Fate to join the good fight again.

This fatigue with mortal concerns has continued in his animated incarnations, as seen in his next appearance on ''Justice League'' entitled "The Terror Beyond". He and [[Aquaman]] help [[Solomon Grundy (comics)#In other media|Solomon Grundy]] escape from the authorities so they can enact an age-old spell to save this dimension from an invasion by the Old Ones, creatures based on the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. They are stopped by the League and end up fighting the Old Ones in their own dimension.

Only after this episode does it seem that Fate maintains any continual relationship with fellow superheroes (miscommunication being the reason for the struggles between him and the League in "Terror"), including joining the expanded League in ''Unlimited''. However, he is still not much of a team player, maintaining his own little mini-League of outsiders within the League. This team is a disguised version of Marvel Comics' [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]; including Aquaman for Submariner, [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Hawkgirl]] for Nighthawk, Solomon Grundy for the Hulk and [[Amazo#Amazo in other media|Amazo]] for the Silver Surfer. Fate is a stand-in for Doctor Strange.

==Action Figures==

To date, three versions of Doctor Fate are available in [[action figure]] form. The first Doctor Fate toy was released in [[1985]] under the second wave of Kenner's [[Super Powers Collection]]. The Super Powers Collection version also included a mini-comic book. In the book, Doctor Fate was forced to fight Superman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] who had fallen under control of Darkseid and sent them to collect Doctor Fate's artifacts.

[[DC Direct]] released the second in [[2000]] as part of the Mystics, Mages and Magicians collection.

The third was released within the Justice League Unlimited series several times as a single figure and as part of three-pack collections.

All versions were the Kent Nelson form of Doctor Fate.
