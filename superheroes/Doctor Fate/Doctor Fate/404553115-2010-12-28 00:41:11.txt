'''Doctor Fate''' (also known by the [[diminutive]], '''Fate''') is the name of a succession of fictional [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]] who appear within [[DC Comics]]' [[DC Universe|universe]]. The original version was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman, and first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 ([[1940#May|May 1940]]). In 1940, the character also became a founding member of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superhero group the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Doctor Fate | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 103  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Initially, Doctor Fate was Kent Nelson, the son of [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] Sven Nelson, who died after Kent opened the tomb of the ancient wizard Nabu. The orphaned boy was trained by Nabu in the arts of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, several different versions of Doctor Fate were introduced, but were relatively short-lived. Doctor Fate's appearances in other media and comics set outside the continuity of the [[DC Universe]] (for instance, in the [[DC animated universe]]) tend to be of the original Golden Age Kent Nelson incarnation.

==Publication history==
<!--as per exemplar, real world history of the characters' use-->
''More Fun Comics'' #55 (May 1940) introduced the first Doctor Fate. After a year with little background, his alter ego Kent Nelson and origins were shown in ''More Fun Comics'' #67 (May 1941). At this point, the character was shown to be an archaeologists' son who had discovered the tomb of an ancient wizard named Nabu.

Visually, the character was unusual in that he wore a full face [[helmet|helm]] in his earliest appearances. His love interest was known variably as "Inza Cramer",<ref name="mf72">''More Fun Comics'' #72 (Oct. 1941)</ref><ref>''More Fun Comics'' #80 (June 1942)</ref> "Inza Sanders",<ref>''More Fun Comics'' #75 (Jan. 1942)</ref><ref>''More Fun Comics'' #77 (March 1942)</ref> "Inza Nelson",<ref>''More Fun Comics'' #79 (May 1942)</ref> and "Inza Carmer."<ref>''More Fun Comics'' #76 (Feb. 1942)</ref><ref>''More Fun Comics'' #78 (Dec. 1942)</ref><ref>''More Fun Comics'' #86 (April 1942)</ref><ref>''More Fun Comics'' #89 (March 1943)</ref><ref>''More Fun Comics'' #90 (April 1943)</ref> His enemies included (in order of first appearance) Wotan, [[Ian Karkull]], [[Nergal|Negal]],<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=298482 Grand Comics Database: Weird Secret Origins]</ref> Mr. Who, The Clock, The Octopus, Mad Dog, and various mad scientists, mobsters, and thugs. 

When the [[Justice Society of America]] was being created for ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #3, Doctor Fate was one of the characters [[DC Comics#The Golden Age|National Comics]] used for the joint venture with [[All-American Publications]]. He made his last appearance in the book in issue #21 (Summer 1944), virtually simultaneously with the end of his own strip in ''More Fun Comics'' #98 (July - Aug. 1944).

In ''More Fun Comics'' #72 (Oct. 1941), Doctor Fate's appearance was modified, exchanging the full helmet for a half-helmet so his lower face was exposed. The focus of the strip also shifted away from magic to standard superhero action. By the end of 1942, the character had been changed into a medical doctor with fewer mystic elements in the strip. The character's popularity waned faster than many of his contemporaries', and the strip was cancelled before the end of World War II in 1944. 

Doctor Fate was revived along with many other Justice Society members in the 1960s through the annual team-ups with the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. These stories established that the two teams resided on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel worlds]]. Unlike many of his JSA teammates, Doctor Fate did not have an analogue or counterpart among the Justice League.

Aside from the annual team up in ''Justice League of America'', DC featured the original Doctor Fate in other stories through the 1960s and 1970s. These included a two-issue run with [[Hourman]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #55-56,<ref>{{cite web| last =Hamilton| first =M.| title =SHOWCASE #55: The Glory of Murphy Anderson| publisher =the comic book bin| date= 2005-08-03| url =http://comicbookbin.com/showcase055.html| accessdate =2007-02-11 }}</ref> wherein it was revealed Kent Nelson and Inza Cramer had married since the end of the Golden Age; appearances with [[Superman]] in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (#208, Dec. 1971) and ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' (#23, July 1980); with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' (#156, Nov. 1979); and a solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #9 (Dec. 1975), written by [[Martin Pasko]] and drawn by [[Walt Simonson]]. With this story, Pasko added the concept that the spirit of Nabu resided in the helmet and took control of Nelson whenever the helmet was donned. 

In the early 1980s, [[Roy Thomas]] incorporated the retcon that Nabu inhabited the helmet into his ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' series, set in late 1941, as an explanation for the changes in Doctor Fate's helmet and powers.{{Issue|date=November 2010}} (In a caption box on the final panel of ''All-Star Squadron'' #28's main story (Dec. 1983), Thomas indicated an explanation of how and why Nelson returned to the full helmet and possession by Nabu when the JSA reactivated in the 1960s was forthcoming, but it was never published). This led to Kent and Inza, combining into one Doctor Fate, featuring in a series of back-up stories running from ''The Flash'' #305 (Feb. 1982) to #313 (Sept. 1982). [[Cary Bates]] wrote the initial story, with Pasko taking over as writer in issue #306, aided by [[Steve Gerber]] from #310 to #313. In 1985 DC collected these back-up stories, as well as a 1978 retelling of Dr. Fate's origin by [[Paul Levitz]], [[Joe Staton]] & [[Michael Netzer|Michael Netzer (Nasser)]] originally published in ''Secret Origins of Super-Heroes'' (''DC Special Series'' #10, 1978, in the indicia), the aforementioned Pasko/Simonson story from ''1st Issue Special'' #9, and a 1940s Doctor Fate tale from ''More Fun'' #56, in a three-issue [[limited series]] titled ''The Immortal Doctor Fate''.

Following 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Doctor Fate briefly joined the Justice League.<ref>''Legends'' #6 (April 1987)</ref> Kent Nelson finally died of old age and the mantle of Doctor Fate was passed to a pair of humans, Eric and Linda Strauss, who merged into one being to become Doctor Fate, similar to Kent and Inza.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 1) #1 - 4 (July - Oct. 1987)</ref> Based on the success of the limited series, DC continued the story in a separate ongoing series, also titled ''Doctor Fate'', by DeMatteis and [[Shawn McManus]].<ref name="Doctor Fate 1988">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #1 (Winter 1988)</ref>

After two years, [[William Messner-Loebs]] became the writer, and the series and character shifted so that Nelson's wife Inza inherited the Doctor Fate mantle and starred in a year's worth of stories in which she tried to change the world for the better using her powers.<ref name="df25">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #25 (Feb. 1991)</ref>

When Messner-Loebs' run ended,<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #41 (June 1992)</ref> DC retired the character, replacing Doctor Fate with "Fate". The new character, Jared Stevens, was introduced in a self-titled series launched in the wake of ''Zero Hour'' in 1994.<ref>''Fate'' #0 (Oct. 1994)</ref> He was a mercenary whose weapons were the transformed helm and amulet of Doctor Fate. Both ''Fate'' and its follow up, ''The Book of Fate'' were canceled after relatively short runs.<ref>''Fate'' #22 (Sept. 1996) & ''The Book of Fate'' #1 - 12 (Feb. 1997 - Jan. 1998)</ref>

In 1999, during the revival of the Justice Society in ''[[Justice Society of America#JSA|JSA]]'', DC allowed the character to be reworked. The initial story arc mirrored the transition from Doctor Fate to Fate; Jared Stevens was killed<ref name="jsa1">''JSA'' #1 (August 1999)</ref> and the mantel, along with a restored helm and amulet and the original name, was passed to a new character, in this case a reincarnated Hector Hall, son of the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl.<ref>''JSA'' #3 - 4 (Oct. - Nov. 1999)</ref> In addition to appearing in ''JSA'', DC published a self-titled, five-issue limited series featuring Hall<ref>''Dr. Fate'' (vol. 3) #1 - 5 (Oct. 2003 - Feb. 2004)</ref> and positioned him as a prominent magical character in various company-wide event stories.

The character was again set up for change during the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' limited series,<ref>''Day of Vengeance'' #2 (July 2005)</ref> part of the lead in to the 2005 company wide event story, ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. This included both Hall<ref>''JSA'' #77 - 80 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006)</ref> and Nabu<ref>''Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special'' #1 (March 2006)</ref> being killed off and Doctor Fate's helmet being sent to find a new wearer.

In early 2007, DC published a bi-weekly run of one-shot comics featuring the helmet passing through the hands of various magical characters. These included [[Detective Chimp]]; [[Ibis the Invincible]]; [[Sargon the Sorcerer]]; [[Zauriel]]; and [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]].<ref>{{cite web| last =Brady| first =Matt| title =Dr. Fate's Helmet Tours the DCU Before Return Next Spring| publisher =Newsarama| date= 2006-10-12| url =http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=87428| accessdate = 2007-02-11 }}</ref> The one-shots were intended to be followed by a new ''Doctor Fate'' ongoing series in February 2007, written by [[Steve Gerber]] and illustrated by [[Paul Gulacy]], featuring Kent V.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Kent Nelson/Nabu===
Kent Nelson, the young son of American archaeologist Sven Nelson, accompanied his father on an expedition to the Valley of [[Ur]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in 1920. When Kent opened the [[tomb]] of the [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} wizard Nabu, a poison gas was released which ultimately resulted in the death of Sven Nelson. Nabu, taking pity on the orphaned Kent, raised him and taught him the skills of a wizard, and then bestowed upon him a mystical helmet, [[amulet]] and cloak.<ref name="mf67">''More Fun Comics'' #67 (May 1941)</ref>

[[Image:More Fun Comics 61.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Cover to ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #61 (Nov. 1940). Kent Nelson as Doctor Fate. Art by Howard Sherman.]]

By 1940, Nelson returned to the United States and resided in an [[Invisibility|invisible]] tower in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. From this sanctum he embarked on a career fighting crime and supernatural evil as the hero, Doctor Fate. During the early part of this career he met, romanced, and eventually married a red-headed woman named Inza (this character's surname varied in the early part of the feature, but the creative team eventually settled on Carmer).<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In late 1940, Doctor Fate was among the founding members of the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]] | penciller=[[Everett Hibbard|Hibbard, Everett]] | inker= | story= | title=[[All Star Comics]] | volume=1 | issue=3 | date=Winter, 1940 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=1-4 | panel= }}</ref> He remained active with the group through the middle of the decade, resigning in 1945. At this time he withdrew entirely from public activities, either retiring or turning his attention elsewhere. When the team came out of retirement to work with the Justice League in the 1960s, he returned as well, rejoining his old teammates.

In 1942, due to Nabu's personality, which resided in the full helmet, taking full control of Nelson's body when he wore the helm,<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Martin Pasko|Pasko, Martin]] | penciller=[[Walt Simonson|Simonson, Walt]] | inker=Simonson, Walt | story=Dr. Fate | title=[[1st Issue Special]] | volume=1 | issue=9 | date=Dec., 1975 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref> he replaced the Helm of Nabu with a half-helmet that left his lower face exposed.<ref name="mf72"/> The change, while stripping him of most of his magical power, left Nelson in full control of his actions and still more than a normal human. During this time, Nelson acquired a medical license and became an interne at the Weatherby Free Clinic.<ref>''More Fun Comics'' #85 (Nov. 1942)</ref> Shortly thereafter, when a [[supervillain]] stole the Helm of Nabu, Nelson lost all access to the Helm as both it and the thief were cast into an alternate dimension.<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | penciller=Howell, Richard | inker=[[Gerald Forton|Forton, Gerald]] | story=By Hatred Possessed! | title=[[All-Star Squadron]] | volume=1 | issue=28 | date=Dec. 1983 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=19-23 | panel= }}</ref> At some point between his withdrawal from the JSA and his return in the 1960s, he was able to retrieve the Helm as he returned to wearing it and relying on Nabu's presence.

Even with the return of the JSA, Doctor Fate's activities were less than public. These included assisting fellow JSA member [[Hourman]] against [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and the [[Psycho-Pirate]],<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]] | penciller=[[Murphy Anderson|Anderson, Murphy]] | inker=Anderson, Murphy | story= | title=[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]] | volume=1 | issue=55-56 | date=March/April & May/June, 1965 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref> and teaming up on various occasions with [[Superman]]<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Len Wein|Wein, Len]] | penciller=[[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]] | inker=[[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]] | volume=1 | issue=208 | date=Dec. 1971 | story=Peril of the Planet-Smashers! | title=[[World's Finest Comics]] | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Denny]] | penciller=[[Joe Staton|Staton, Joe]] | inker=[[Vince Coletta|Coletta, Vince]] | story=The Curse Out of Time! | title=[[DC Comics Presents]] | volume=1 | issue=23 | date=July 1980 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref> and [[Batman]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Cary Burkett|Burkett, Cary]] | penciller=[[Don Newton|Newton, Don]] | inker=[[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]] | story=Corruption | title=[[The Brave and the Bold]] | volume=1 | issue=156 | date=Nov. 1979 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref>

When the Justice Society re-established itself early in the modern age of heroes, Doctor Fate was among the returning members.{{Issue|date=November 2010}} Though he had become increasingly erratic and withdrawn from humanity, he was still committed to protecting Earth against supernatural menaces. During this time Nelson also went through a period where, in order to become Doctor Fate, he had to fuse with his wife Inza.<ref>''Flash'' (vol. 2) #305 - 313 (Feb. 1982 - Sept. 1982)</ref>

Kent later became the sole wearer of the Helm and joined the re-formed Justice League.<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[John Ostrander|Ostrander, John]], [[Len Wein|Wein, Len]] | penciller=[[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] | inker=[[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]], [[Dennis Janke|Janke, Dennis]] | story=Finale! | title=[[Legends (comics)|Legends]] | volume=1 | issue=6 | date=Apr. 1987 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref> The magic Kent used to keep Inza and  himself young soon failed.

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Kent was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4 (Dec. 2009)</ref>

===Eric and Linda Strauss===
[[Image:Drfateinzanelson.jpg|thumb|''Justice League America'' #31 (Oct. 1989): Linda Strauss as Doctor Fate. Cover Art by [[Adam Hughes]].]]

With Kent Nelson's passing, Nabu began the search for a new host. This search took him to a young man named Eric Strauss (aged to an adult by Nabu's magic) and his stepmother Linda Strauss.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 1) #1 (July 1987)</ref> Nabu bound them so that they had to merge to become Doctor Fate, but could live apart when Fate was not needed.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He then animated Kent Nelson's corpse to serve them as adviser and instructor.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 1) #4 (Oct. 1987)</ref> Since the tower Nelson used as a sanctum had apparently been destroyed, the pair operated out of Linda's apartment.<ref name="Doctor Fate 1988"/> Over time they were joined by a small, kind demon they dubbed Petey and a lawyer named Jack C. Small.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #2 (Dec. 1988)</ref> Petey and Jack provided moral support and managed to assist in some of their battles.

During a battle on [[Apokolips]], Eric was killed, leaving Linda to take over the role of Doctor Fate.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #12 (Dec. 1989)</ref> Soon, the Lords of Chaos succeeded in assaulting Linda and killing her. The souls of Eric and Linda were then placed in the bodies of Wendy and Eugene DiBellia.<ref name="df24">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #24 (Jan. 1991)</ref>

===Inza Nelson===
Inza and Kent Nelson's souls, which had been inhabiting Doctor Fate's amulet, were resurrected in new younger bodies.<ref name="df24"/> However, they found that now only Inza was able to become Doctor Fate.<ref name="df25"/> Inza became more confident, proactive and reckless in the use of her powers, which she used to improve the lot of humanity, leading her and Kent to separate for a while.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #26 - 32 (March 1991 - Sept. 1991)</ref>

The Nelsons learned that a Lord of Chaos named T'Giian had taken residence in the Helm of Nabu, providing Inza with magic derived from Chaos instead of Order, and was the reason that Kent and Inza could no longer merge to become Doctor Fate.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #34 (Nov. 1991)</ref> Kent eventually returned to his wife's side and helped her defeat T'Giian. Inza then learned that she derived her new powers from the magic of Earth, rather than Chaos or Order.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #35 (Dec. 1991)</ref>

After defeating T'Giian, the Nelsons began merging as the male Doctor Fate again. The Nelsons retained the ability to become independent Doctor Fates if the situation called for it. In these cases Kent's form would resemble that of the costume he wore when he used the half-helm.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #36 (Jan. 1992)</ref>

In their last days as Doctor Fate, the Nelsons, along with the rest of the JSA, faced the supervillain [[Hank Hall#Zero Hour: Extant|Extant]] during [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'s attempt to [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|change the history of the universe]]. Extant, with seeming ease, caused most of the Justice Society to rapidly approach their proper physical ages. He also separated the Nelsons from the Helm, Amulet, and Cloak. The greatly aged and depowered Nelsons returned to Salem and went into retirement.<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | penciller=Jurgens, Dan | inker= | story= | title=[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] | volume=1 | issue=4-0 | date=Sept. 1994 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref>

===Jared Stevens===

After the Nelsons' return to Earth, Jared Stevens discovered Doctor Fate's raiments and altered them into a knife, a set of throwing darts, and an armband. He called himself simply "Fate". His sole encounter with the Nelsons resulted in the couples' death and the return of their souls to the amulet.<ref>''Fate'' #1 (Nov. 1994)</ref>

Jared was killed at the hands of [[Mordru]] as part of the latter's attempt to claim the mantle and artifacts of Doctor Fate for himself.<ref name="jsa1"/>

===Hector Hall===

[[Image:drfate4.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Panel from ''JSA'' #4 (November 1999) featuring Hector Hall as Doctor Fate. Art by [[Stephen Sadowski]] and [[John Kalisz]].]]

Nabu, aware of Mordru's ambitions, had planned ahead to ensure that the Helm and the mantle of Doctor Fate would pass to a reincarnated Hector Hall. This plan coincided with the rebirth of the Justice Society, which acted to protect the newly reborn Hector.<ref>''JSA'' #2 (Sept. 1999)</ref>

Hector's new body was the son of Hank Hall and Dawn Granger, agents of both Chaos and Order once known as [[Hawk and Dove#Hank Hall and Dawn Granger|Hawk and Dove]].<ref>''JSA'' #46 (May 2003)</ref> This therefore made Hector an agent of balance instead of an agent of one side or the other.

Later the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], attempting to expunge evil by extinguishing magic, confronted Hector. This resulted in Hector and his wife's banishment to a snowy mountain landscape, where he would be forced to spend eternity. The two later joined their [[Daniel Hall (comics)|son]] in the Dreaming, giving up the mortal world forever.<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Keith Champagne|Champagne, Keith]] | penciller=[[Don Kramer|Kramer, Don]] | inker= | story= | title=[[Justice Society of America|JSA]] | volume=1 | issue=79-80 | date=Jan. and Feb. 2006 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref>

===Nabu===
[[Image:NabuMordru.png|thumb|200px|Nabu confronts [[Mordru]] without the use of a host body in a panel from ''JSA'' #80. Art by [[Don Kramer]].]]

Unaware of the reasons behind Hector's disappearance, his teammates in the Justice Society traveled to the Tower of Fate, hoping to use his services to travel to the Fifth Dimension and find [[Jakeem Thunder]]. At the Tower they found the raiments of Fate, but not Hector. [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]] used the raiments to prepare a spell and speak to Nabu.<ref>''JSA'' #78 (Dec. 2005)</ref>  However, Mordru returned before the spell was complete and caused it to malfunction.<ref>''JSA'' #79 (Jan. 2006)</ref> After a battle with Mordru, the Justice Society offered Nabu membership, but he sensed that a [[Infinite Crisis|crisis]] was coming and that his presence would be required elsewhere, and disappeared.<ref>''JSA'' #80 (Feb. 2006)</ref>

During the last hours of the Ninth Age of Magic, Nabu called together Earth's remaining magicians to deal with the Spectre and the destruction of the Rock of Eternity. Nabu personally confronted and goaded the Spectre, whose anger grew so great that he fatally wounded Nabu.<ref name="dc-ency"/> This caused the Presence to take notice and send the Spectre to his new host. As a result of Nabu's impending death, the Ninth Age of Magic ended and the birth of the Tenth Age began.

Before his death, Nabu gave the Helmet to [[Detective Chimp]] to pass on to the Doctor Fate of the new Age, telling him that the Helmet will still have certain abilities, even though Nabu would no longer be contained within it. After Detective Chimp found that the Helmet would not fit him, he asked [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to throw the helmet randomly into space, allowing the helmet to find its own new owner. After traveling an unknown yet vast distance, the rigors of space warped the helmet to resemble Kent Nelson's alternate, half-face helmet of the 1940s before plummeting back to Earth.<ref>{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Bill Willingham|Willingham, Bill]] | penciller=[[Justiniano]] | inker= | story=The Ninth Age of Magic | title=[[Day of Vengeance]] [[Infinite Crisis]] Special | volume=1 | issue=1 | date=March, 2006 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref>

[[Image:DrFateVol4No1.jpg|left|Promotional art for ''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 4) #1, by [[Paul Gulacy]].|thumb]]

The helmet resurfaced [[One Year Later|a year after]] the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', crossing paths with various heroes, and once again resembling the half-helm that Kent Nelson used during the 1940s. These appearances were depicted in a series of one-shots.

It first returned again to the possession of [[Detective Chimp]], who found he could now wear the altered helmet. After acting as Doctor Fate for a short time, he decided he did not have the temperament to wear the helmet and sent it on its way.<ref>''The Helmet of Fate: Detective Chimp'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref> 

Next, the helm came into the possession of [[Ibis the Invincible]], and attracted the attention of the dark god [[Set (mythology)|Set]]. Set defeated Ibis, forcing the hero to retreat into hibernation as a mummy to heal. Ibis' last act was to choose his replacement. The new Ibis confronted Set, retrieved the helmet and then sent it on.<ref>''The Helmet of Fate: Ibis the Invincible'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref> 

As it traveled from place to place, the helm was interrupted by the spirit of [[Sargon the Sorcerer]], who diverted it in an effort to protect his grandson, David. David bestowed something of himself into the helmet before returning it to its journey.<ref>''The Helmet of Fate: Sargon the Sorcerer'' #1 (Feb. 2007)</ref> 

The helmet crossed paths with the angel [[Zauriel]], who also passed it along after removing it from a tyrant of another solar system.<ref>''The Helmet of Fate: Zauriel'' #1 (Feb. 2007)</ref> 

[[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] was the next recipient, who unsuccessfully tried to make the helm obey her. When the helmet started to indiscriminately punish everyone who wronged her, including her loved ones, she realised the helmet would fulfill her desires, but destroy her life in the process. Black Alice then relinquished it.<ref>''The Helmet of Fate: Black Alice'' #1 (March 2007)</ref>  

Ultimately, the helmet falls to Doctor Kent V. Nelson, grandnephew of the original Kent Nelson, who becomes the new Doctor Fate.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Kent V. Nelson===
[[Image:Countdown to Mystery 1 textless.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional artwork for ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown to Mystery]]'' #1 (Nov. 2007), featuring Kent V. Nelson as Doctor Fate. Art by [[Justiniano]].]]
Doctor Kent V. Nelson, divorced and out of work, is beaten up by a former patient for a ''[[Bumfights]]'' knockoff and is thrown in a dumpster, his pay stolen. The Helmet of Fate has fallen into the dumpster, and Nelson uses it to cover his wounds, as it has started to rain. The helmet reveals its entire history to him, and despite his attempts to pawn it, the helmet returns to him.<ref>''Countdown To Mystery'' #1 (Nov. 2007)</ref> 

Nelson learns spells gradually and uses the helmet for gambling. He meets a woman named Maddy, who runs an occult bookstore, where he goes into an intense inter-dimensional [[meditation]] exploring the pains of his psyche. He drags her along into his vision. After this incident, Kent uses magic in the real world to fly, but sinking into self-pity and depression after forgetting both his daughter's birthday and the magic word for flying, he falls into a large, nearby fountain and nearly drowns until he is saved by an intrepid young comic writer named Inza. Inza is completely liquefied while Nelson is taking a shower - the doing of Negal, a demon Kent thwarted in the beginning of his adventure. After the death of Inza, Kent seems all but certain to retreat further into alcoholism.<ref>''Countdown To Mystery'' #5 (March 2008)</ref> 

Despairing, Nelson decides he has had enough of this mystic interference in his life, and gives the helmet to Maddy. He is immediately captured by Negal. On her first attempt at using the helmet Maddy is also brought to despair by Negal's sidekick, Ymp, and brought to him alongside the captured Nelson and the remains of Inza.<ref>''Countdown To Mystery'' #7 (May 2008)</ref>

Four potential endings to the story were written by different writers following Steve Gerber's death.

* In the first, by [[Adam Beechen]], Maddy is inspired by Kent's efforts to overcome his self-absorption to distract Negal with an image of Inza's character Killhead. This gives enough time for an [[Elf with a Gun|elf with a gun]] to shoot Negal. The elf then departs, as [[Howard the Duck|a quacking voice]] invites him to share a beer with the "big guy", "[[Thundarr the Barbarian|Thunny]]", "[[Omega the Unknown|Megs]]" and "Bev" before the big guy has to "head upstairs". Nelson and Inza recover, and Maddy gives him back the helmet. As they return to Vegas, Nelson says that whatever happened, it took all three of them, and that the helmet still has a lot to teach them.

* In the second, by [[Mark Evanier]], Nelson sees his life flashing before his eyes, as Negal gloats that he will now destroy Dr. Fate forever. Nelson seizes on the happy moments in his life, and claims that killing him never achieved anything, and he should know. He tells Negal that Dr. Fate is an ideal, and has returned before. Since Nelson is no longer consumed by self-pity, Negal (lord of the self-despised) is powerless and returns them all to where he left them, claiming that he will return. With Inza back in her apartment and Maddy back at the bookshop, Nelson returns to the casino, reflecting that every journey must end, through chance or fate.

* In the third, by [[Mark Waid]], Maddy tries to wake Nelson, but cannot. In his dream, Nelson has a conversation with one of his patients, Mr. Mardillo, who is drawn to resemble Steve Gerber, and the scene takes the form of a text piece, a common device in Gerber's work. Mordillo explains fate is the hand you are dealt, but destiny is the way you play it. Negal hates fate because, as a demon, he has no way of changing his destiny. Mardillo points out that Nelson seems resigned to the same thing, and talks him through his problems. As in the previous story, Nelson's newfound hope gives him power against Negal and, although he acknowledges his depression will return, for the moment he is able to use the helmet to free himself and the others, briefly gaining the original Dr. Fate's costume while doing so. Back in Vegas, he is astonished to find a note from Mardillo in his pocket, but is unable to read the handwriting.

* In the final piece, by [[Gail Simone]], Maddy is "tripping" on the power in the helmet and unable to use it effectively. Upon seeing Kent awaken, she gives him the helmet. Finding Inza is now a living statue, he asks her if she wants to live and, when she says yes, points out to Negal that she still has hope, and is therefore beating him. Using his psychiatric skills, he diagnoses Negal's obsession with causing and feeding on misery as indicating an addictive personality with narcissistic tendencies. Acknowledging his own faults, he adds that he is still good at his job, and offers to help Negal. The final panel shows Kent flying across Vegas, with Inza and Maddy in tow, reflecting on how well Negal's therapy is going and that he may be falling in love with Inza.<ref>[http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=283 stevegerblog » Blog Archive » Some Thoughts on Doctor Fate - Part 1]</ref><ref>''Countdown to Mystery'' #8 (July 2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Pre-Crisis===
====Doctor Chaos (Earth-One)====
[[Image:Doctorchaosdcu0.jpg|thumb|200px|Doctor Chaos. Art by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]]]
In ''New Adventures of Superboy'' #25 (Jan. 1982), Professor Lewis Lang and his assistant Burt Belker discover a helmet in the Valley of Ur identical to the one given to Kent Nelson by Nabu on Earth-Two. This helmet contained a Lord of Chaos, which went on to possess Burt and turn him into Doctor Chaos, whose agenda differed from the Earth-Two Doctor Fate's. Doctor Chaos' costume mirrors Doctor Fate's, with an inverted color scheme. [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] confronts him and is able to remove the helmet from Belker and jettison it into space. There have been no further appearances of the helmet.

===Post-Crisis===
====Future (''Books of Magic'')====
In the fourth Book of the ''[[The Books of Magic|Books of Magic]]'' limited series<ref>''Books of Magic'' (vol. 1) #4 (June 1991)</ref> by [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Mister E]] shows a future version of the Helm to [[Timothy Hunter]] which resembles a human skull. It would ultimately kill any of its worshipers that wears it. It no longer cares about the war between Order and Chaos and believes that there is no meaning in life; just flesh and death. Mister E says he wanted to kill Doctor Fate and destroy the helmet long ago, but the Justice League prevented him. In the first book, Hunter and the [[Phantom Stranger]] observe Kent Nelson, though Nelson is not aware of their presence.

====Earth-2====
The final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' revealed the existence of a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], consisting of fifty-two identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated Earth-2. As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-2, such as the Justice Society of America being this world's premier super-team. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Doctor Fate that is shown is visually similar to the Nelson, Strauss, and Hall versions of the character.<ref>

This version of Doctor Fate (based upon the Kent Nelson version of the character) later appeared in ''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1. Doctor Fate, along with the Spectre, suspected something awry with Power Girl's mysterious reappearance.<ref>''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1 (2008)</ref>

====Earth-20====
In ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #1, the heroes pass through Earth-20 briefly. While there, they are seen by Doc Fate, a hero described by writer Grant Morrison as 'a cross between Doctor Fate and Doc Savage'. Doc Fate is based in a windowless Manhattan skyscraper and is the leader of the Society of Super-Heroes, a group of 'pulp'-style mystery men consisting of Immortal Man, the Mighty Atom, Lady Blackhawk, the Green Lantern, and the Bat-Man.<ref>''Final Crisis: Secret Files'' #1 (Feb. 2009)</ref>

====Earth-22 (''Kingdom Come'')====
The ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' limited series featured a version of Nabu, similar to his later appearance before his death, who was able to channel his consciousness through the Helm and Cloak without the need for a host body. This version of Fate sided with Batman's group during the series, and was amongst the survivors at the end of the story.

==Awards==
Both the character and the comics of the same name have received recognition, including:
* ''1963 Alley Award for Strip Favored for Revival''
* ''1965 Alley Award for Best Revived Hero''

==In other media==
===Television===
====''Superman: The Animated Series''====
The Kent Nelson version of Doctor Fate, played by [[George DelHoyo|George Del Hoyo]] has guest appeared along with his wife Inza, played by [[Jennifer Lien]] in animated form on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "The Hand of Fate". Superman seeks Fate's help when a supernatural threat named Karkull (whom Fate has defeated previously) seizes the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. Fate, depicted as middle-aged, refuses to get involved because he is tired of the eternal struggle between "good" and "evil". Superman's insistence on returning to fight on his own, despite his success being unlikely, inspires Fate to join the "good fight" again.

====''Justice League''====
Doctor Fate (also Kent Nelson) along with his wife Inza appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "The Terror Beyond". [[Oded Fehr]] portrays Dr. Fate while voice actress [[Jennifer Hale]] plays the role of Inza. Dr. Fate and [[Aquaman]] help [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] escape from the authorities so they can enact an age-old spell to save this dimension from an invasion by the Old Ones, creatures based on the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].<ref>[http://jl.toonzone.net/ichthultu/ichthultu.htm Ichthultu - The Justice League Watchtower]</ref> They are stopped by the League and end up fighting the Old Ones leader '''Ichthultu''' (a variant of [[Cthulhu]]) in their own dimension.

====''Justice League Unlimited''====
Oded Fehr and Jennifer Hale reprised their roles as Dr. Fate and Inza in ''Justice League Unlimited''. Fate maintains a loose relationship with his fellow superheroes (lack of prior communication being the reason for the struggles between him and the League in "Terror"), including joining the expanded League in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. However, he maintains his own "team" within the League, consisting of himself, Aquaman and Ivo's Android (or A.M.A.Z.O).

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
Doctor Fate appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Eyes of Despero!" played by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]. He teams up with [[Batman]] to stop [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]] from robbing the Library of Infinity. Prior to the mission, Batman gave Doctor Fate [[boxing]] lessons to defend himself should he lose his powers. In "The Fate of Equinox!", Doctor Fate investigates universal disturbances caused by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Equinox]] and helps Batman defeat him by absorbing the powers of other heroes and passing them on to Batman, later assisting in the final fight. Oded Fehr, who previously played Dr. Fate in ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited'', voiced Equinox. A younger version of Doctor Fate also appears in a small cameo role in "The Siege of Starro! Part One", where he is shown battling [[Per Degaton]] alongside the JSA in the 1940s. In this appearance, Fate is shown sporting his short-lived half-helmet.

===Film===
====''Justice League: The New Frontier''====
* Dr. Fate later shows up as a member of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] in the opening credits of the ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' animated film.

====''Smallville''====
[[Image:Smallville-Brent Stait as Doctor Fate.jpg|120px|thumb|right|[[Brent Stait]] as Doctor Fate on ''Smallville''.]]
Actor [[Brent Stait]] played Kent Nelson/Dr. Fate in the ''Smallville'' double episode, "[[Absolute Justice]]" on February 5, 2010. The double episode combined what was originally conceived as the regular length episodes 11 and 12 of the ninth season.<ref>[http://tv.ign.com/articles/103/1036548p1.html Exclusive: Two of Smallville's Justice Society - TV News at IGN]</ref> This was the first live action appearance of the character. In the episode, he can teleport others, can see the past and the future and can see the "fate" of individuals. The helmet appears to possess the spirit of Nabu, as Nelson refers to it by name several times. In the episode, Nelson is killed by [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], although it is later said that the helmet will eventually choose a new Dr. Fate. Actress Erica Carroll played Inza. The Helmet of Nabu reappears in season 10 when [[Chloe Sullivan]] uses it in order to track down the whereabouts of the missing Oliver Queen.<ref>[http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/08/11/ask-ausiello-spoilers-greys-glee-90210/ Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's,' 'Chuck,' 'Glee,' '90210,' 'Pretty Little Liars,' and more! | Ausiello | EW.com]</ref>
