<!--as per exemplar, real world history of the characters' use-->
''More Fun Comics'' #55 (May 1940) introduced the first Doctor Fate in his own self-titled six page strip. After a year with no background, his alter ego and origins were shown in ''More Fun Comics'' #67 (May 1941).<ref name="Beatty">{{cite book|last1=Beatty|first1=Scott|last2=Wallace|first2=Dan|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe|date=2008|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|Dorling Kindersley Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=0756641195|page=103|edition=Updated and expanded}}</ref>

When the [[Justice Society of America]] was created for ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #3 (Winter 1940), Doctor Fate was one of the characters [[DC Comics#The Golden Age|National Comics]] used for the joint venture with [[All-American Publications]]. He made his last appearance in the book in issue #21 (Summer 1944), virtually simultaneously with the end of his own strip in ''More Fun Comics'' #98 (July – August 1944).

Aside from the annual JSA/JLA team-ups in ''Justice League of America'', DC featured the original Doctor Fate in other stories through the 1960s and 1970s, including a two-issue run with [[Hourman]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #55–56, two appearances with [[Superman]] in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (#201, Mar. 1971 and #208, Dec. 1971) and ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' (#23, July 1980); an appearance with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' (#156, Nov. 1979); and a solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #9 (Dec. 1975), written by [[Martin Pasko]] and drawn by [[Walt Simonson]].

The character featured in a series of back-up stories running in ''The Flash'' from #306 (Feb. 1982) to #313 (Sept. 1982) written by [[Martin Pasko]] (aided by [[Steve Gerber]] from #310 to #313) and drawn by [[Keith Giffen]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Riley|first = Shannon E.|title = A Matter of (Dr.) Fate Martin Pasko and Keith Giffen Discuss Their Magical ''Flash'' Backup Series|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 64|pages = 64–68|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013}}</ref> 

In 1985, DC collected the back-up stories, a retelling of Doctor Fate's origin by [[Paul Levitz]], [[Joe Staton]], and [[Michael Netzer|Michael Nasser]] originally published in ''Secret Origins of Super-Heroes'' (Jan. 1978) (''DC Special Series'' #10 in the indicia), the Pasko/Simonson story from ''1st Issue Special'' #9, and a Doctor Fate tale from ''More Fun Comics'' #56 (June 1940), in a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Immortal Doctor Fate''.

Following 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Doctor Fate briefly joined the Justice League.<ref>''Legends'' #6 (April 1987)</ref> A ''Doctor Fate'' limited series was released soon afterwards, which changed the character's secret identity.<ref name="Fate1987">''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 1) #1–4 (July – Oct. 1987)</ref> DC began a ''Doctor Fate'' ongoing series by [[J.M.

Stevens was introduced in a self-titled series called ''Fate'', launched in the wake of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' in 1994,<ref name="fate0">''Fate'' #0 (Oct. 1994)</ref> which was cancelled after 23 issues in September 1996. The character then starred in ''The Book of Fate'', which ran from February 1997 to January 1998 for twelve issues as part of DC's "[[Weirdoverse]]" imprint.
 
In 1999, the revival of the Justice Society in ''[[Justice Society of America#JSA|JSA]]'' allowed the character to be reworked again.<ref name="jsa1">''JSA'' #1 (August 1999)</ref><ref name="jsa4">''JSA'' #4 (Nov. 1999)</ref> In addition to appearing in ''JSA'', DC published a self-titled, five-issue limited series in 2003.<ref>''Dr. Fate'' (vol. 3) #1–5 (Oct. 2003 – Feb. 2004)</ref> The character was killed in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' limited series in 2005 as part of the lead in to the 2005 company-wide event story, ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.<ref>''Day of Vengeance'' #1–6 (June – Nov. 2005)</ref>

In early 2007, DC published a bi-weekly run of one-shots depicting the search for a new Doctor Fate. These were intended to be followed by a new ''Doctor Fate'' ongoing series in April 2007, written by [[Steve Gerber]] and illustrated by [[Paul Gulacy]], featuring the new Doctor Fate.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLauchlin|first=Jim|title=A Twist of Fate|publisher=Wizard|date=2006-12-03|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002578766.cfm|accessdate=2007-02-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212102237/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002578766.cfm|archivedate=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=283 |title=stevegerblog " Blog Archive " Some Thoughts on Doctor Fate – Part 1 |publisher=Stevegerber.com |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> However, the series was delayed due to extended production and creative difficulties. Steve Gerber said in an interview for [[Newsarama]] that the story intended for the first arc of the ''Doctor Fate'' ongoing series had been reworked to serve as the main story for ''Countdown to Mystery'', a dual-feature eight-issue miniseries with Eclipso as the second feature.<ref>{{cite web|title=DC Announcement|publisher=stevegerblog|date=2007-06-15|url=http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/06/15/dc-announcement/|accessdate=2007-08-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200602/http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/06/15/dc-announcement/|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref> The first issue of ''Countdown to Mystery'', with art by [[Justiniano]] and Walden Wong rather than Gulacy, was released in November 2007.

The final issue was written by Beechen, [[Gail Simone]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Mark Evanier]], who each wrote a different ending to the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=13096|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225150908/http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=13096|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-02-25|title=CBR News: WonerCon: DC Nation Panel|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=2008-02-22|accessdate=2011-01-16|df=}}</ref>

The character then appeared in the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries<ref>''Reign in Hell'' #1–8 (Sept. 2008 – April 2009)</ref> and in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #30, featuring in the book until its cancellation with #54 in August 2011.

Following the events of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' mini-series in 2011, DC's continuity was [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed. As part of [[The New 52]] initiative, a new Doctor Fate named Khalid Ben-Hassin was created by writer James Robinson<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeffery Renaud |url=http://www.cbr.com/robinson-unleashes-fury-doctor-fate-on-earth-2/ |title=Robinson Unleashes Fury, Doctor Fate on "Earth 2" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref> and artist Brett Booth.

After the conclusion of the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' limited series in June 2015, DC launched a new ''Doctor Fate'' ongoing series, written by [[Paul Levitz]] and drawn by [[Sonny Liew]]. The title focused on the newest Doctor Fate, an [[Egyptian American|Egyptian-American]] medical student named Khalid Nassour.<ref name="newsarama1">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24153-levitz-channels-ditko-for-june-s-new-unusual-dr-fate.html |title=LEVITZ Channels DITKO For June's New, Unusual DR.

The Nelsons learn T'Giian, a Lord of Chaos, has possessed the helmet.

===Jared Stevens===
After retiring, the Nelsons hire smuggler Jared Stevens to recover the helmet, amulet, and cloak from an Egyptian tomb. When the Nelsons try to collect the artifacts, they are murdered by two demons. During the battle, Jared attempts to use the amulet as a weapon, which then explodes and imbues him with various magical abilities and a red ankh-shaped scar over his right eye. Jared's injuries force him to use the cloak as a wrap for his right arm and to melt the helmet into a set of ankh-shaped darts and a dagger for use as weapons. After defeating the demons, Jared is contacted by Nabu, who attempts to make Jared the new Doctor Fate. Jared refuses and escapes, becoming a demon hunter using the alias "Fate".<ref name="fate0"/> During his battles, he teams up with the supernaturally powered team of fugitives [[Scare Tactics (comics)|Scare Tactics]], the demon [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]] and other forces to combat threats from the realm of [[Gemworld]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

When Detective Chimp finds the helmet will not fit him, he asks [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to throw the helmet into space, allowing the helmet to find its new owner.
