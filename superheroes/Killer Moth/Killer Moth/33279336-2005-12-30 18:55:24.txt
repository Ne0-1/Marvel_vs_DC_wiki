'''Killer Moth''' is a [[Batman]] villain first appearing in ''Batman #63'' published in 1951.  Killer Moth originally wore a garish costume with striped purple and green spandex, orange cape and a moth-like mask. His identity was millionaire Cameron Van Cleer. Setting himself up as the "anti-Batman," complete with Moth-signal, Mothmobile and Mothcave, he hired himself out to Gotham's criminals to help them escape the police. He was thwarted by Batman but remained a persistent enemy through the 80's. In the 90's he was re-invented as a "joke" character - a failure whose real name was revealed to be Drury Walker. He then sold his soul to the demon Neron and was metamorphed into an actual killer-moth like creature by the name of ''Charaxes''.

A short episode of the 1967 Batman TV show that premiered [[Batgirl]] featured Killer Moth as the villain but it was never aired. It can be found bootlegged through the internet or sometimes at conventions.

Killer Moth appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series where he wears a very different costume from his comic counterpart. In the series, he is a masked and costumed criminal who bio-engineers giant Moth creatures that wreck havoc on the city. He blackmails Robin into taking his [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Kitten|spoiled daughter Kitten]] to the prom. Killer Moth is often confused with the [[Enemies of Batman|Bat-villain]] [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]]. In the animated series, Killer Moth's daughter Kitten (voiced by [[Tara Strong]], who also does [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]) is a bully and a braggart and enjoys showing off to others, especially her boyfriend [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Fang|Fang the spider-boy]], by bringing the [[Robin (comics)|Boy Wonder]] as her prom date. Though Killer and Kitten were both arrested at the end of the episode "Date with Destiny", Killer Moth returned for "Can I Keep Him?" where he turned [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire's]] pet worm [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Silkie|Silkie]] against the Titans; he is eventually taken down by his own creation when Silkie decides he prefers Starfire over Killer Moth. Kitten and her father become members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil#In the Teen Titans animated series|Brotherhood of Evil]], and she had returned to race against Robin with her Fang but were betrayed by Red X. Kitten has also appeared in a '''Teen Titans Go!''' issue entitled "Pop Quiz".

Killer Moth was voiced by [[Thomas Haden Church]] in his first appearance and by [[Marc Worden]] in subsequent appearances.
