'''Killer Moth''' is a [[Batman]] villain first appearing in ''Batman #63'' published in 1951. Killer Moth originally wore a garish costume with striped purple and green spandex, orange cape and a moth-like mask.

Killer Moth is often confused with the [[Enemies of Batman|Batman villain]] [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]]. He is also mistaken for the  [[List of cryptids|cryptid]] "[[Mothman]]".

His identity was millionaire '''Cameron Van Cleer'''. Setting himself up as the "anti-Batman," complete with Moth-signal, Mothmobile and Mothcave, he hired himself out to [[Gotham City|Gotham's]] criminals to help them escape the police. He was thwarted by Batman but remained a persistent enemy appearing through the bronze age. (60's through 80's) He is most remembered for being the first criminal fought by Barbara Gordon [[Batgirl]].

===Charaxes===
{{spoiler}}
In the 1990s, a new Killer Moth by the name of Drury Walker showed up. It is unknown where the original was or what happened to him. He set up a team called "the Misfits", comprising second-string Batman villains such as [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Calendar Man]]. This team proved unsuccessful. He then sold his soul to the demon [[Neron]] and was metamorphed into an actual killer-moth like creature by the name of '''Charaxes'''. As Charaxes, Walker resembles a vaguely humanoid giant brown moth. He is [[cannibal]]istic, and spins [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s to keep his prey in.

At one point, much to his horror, Charaxes found himself laying hundreds of eggs, all of which hatched into duplicates of Drury Walker. Charaxes despised his progeny, but was unable to destroy them. Following his capture, these duplicates were taken into government custody. During an argument between various bodies as to what should be done with them, they attacked a scientist, and were killed.

At around the same time, [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] was confronted by a man who claimed to be the ''real'' Killer Moth (the one she had defeated), and that Charaxes had been an imposter. 

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Charaxes is ripped in half by [[Superboy-Prime]] during the [[Battle of Metropolis]], and thus presumed deceased.

Killer Moth was voiced by [[Thomas Haden Church]] in his first appearance and by [[Marc Worden]] in subsequent appearances. His animated incarnation is much more dangerous then his comic appearance; he is a twisted genius with enhanced strength, speed, and agility. His only real limitation is the spoiled demands of his daughter, which rather undermines his otherwise menacing presence.
