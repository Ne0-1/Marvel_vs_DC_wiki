'''Killer Moth''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''Batman #63'' published in 1951. Killer Moth originally wore a garish costume with striped purple and green spandex, orange cape and a moth-like mask.

Killer Moth is not to be confused with the similar [[Enemies of Batman|Batman villain]] [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]]. 

==History==
===Cameron van Cleer===
The original Killer Moth is a prisoner identified only by his prison number, 234026. Whilst he is in prison, he reads a newspaper article about Batman and decides to set himself up as the "anti-Batman," hiring himself out to [[Gotham City]]'s criminals to help them elude capture by police. Upon his release, he uses the hidden proceedes of his crimes to build a Mothcave modelled on the photos of the Batcave in the newspaper article he read. 

Killer Moth also establishes a false identity, as millionaire philanthropist '''Cameron van Cleer'''. In this guise, he becomes friends with Bruce Wayne. Meanwhile, he promotes himself to Gotham's criminals using his identity as Killer Moth, giving them each an infra-red Moth-signal. In his first job, he rescues some criminals from the police and then uses his Mothmobile to defeat and capture Batman and Robin. The duo escape and lead Killer Moth to a climactic battle on Gotham Bridge, which ends when the villain plunges 1,000 into the river and disappears.

In his second appearance (''Batman #64'' Mar 1951) Killer Moth kidnaps [[Bruce Wayne]] and learns his secret identity. However, he is shot by other criminals and the resultant cranial injury caused [[amnesia]].  He remains a persistent enemy appearing through the [[Silver Age of comics]]. He is frequently remembered as being the first criminal [[Batgirl]] encounters in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359.

===Drury Walker===
In the 1990s, in the Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] continuity, Killer Moth's real identity is revealed as Drury Walker. Walker is an unsuccessful criminal who no one takes seriously. He again adopts the false identity of Cameron van Cleer and the persona of Killer Moth to fight Batman. This version first appears in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7 (Dec 1992), with a more detailed origin appearing in ''Batgirl: Year One''.

In ''Shadow of the Bat'', Killer Moth sets up a team called "the Misfits", comprising second-string Batman villains such as [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Calendar Man]], to make another kidnap attempt on Bruce Wayne, as well as other prominent citizens. This team proves unsuccessful, turning against Moth when they realise he plans to kill the hostages.

He is one of the villains who sells their souls to the demon [[Neron]] in ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', where he asks to become feared. He is metamorphed into a moth-like like monster called '''Charaxes'''.  As Charaxes, Walker resembles a vaguely humanoid, giant brown moth. He consumes humans and spins [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s to keep his prey in.

In a later story, Charaxes begins laying hundreds of eggs, all of which hatch into duplicates of Drury Walker. Charaxes despises his progeny, but is unable to destroy them. Following his capture, these duplicates are taken into government custody. During an argument between various bodies as to what should be done with them, they attack a scientist, and are killed. <ref> ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' #s 107-110, Dec 2002-March 2003 </ref>

At around the same time, [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] is confronted by a criminal named Danko Twag who claims to be the ''real'' Killer Moth (the one she had defeated), and that Drury Walker had been an imposter. During a rant in which he claims they are going to be a team, she captures him in an energy cell and he seemingly disintegrates himself. <ref> ''[[Birds of Prey]]'' #s 50-52 Feb-Apr 2003 </ref>.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Charaxes is ripped in half by [[Superboy-Prime]] during the [[Battle of Metropolis]], and presumed deceased.

===Unknown===
A character named Killer Moth appears in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #652, during the storyline ''"[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]"''.  Nothing is revealed about the identity of this Killer Moth. Another character with the real name and costume of the first Killer Moth appears in the ''[[Batgirl: Year One]]'' mini-series as the first villain the teenage Batgirl faces, and his true identity is depicted as a once-wealthy "wannabe" super-villain who has fallen on hard times.

==Appearances in other media==
===''Batman (TV series)''===
A short episode of the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s live-action ''Batman'' television series]] that premiered Batgirl featured Killer Moth as the villain, but it was never aired. It has been circulated through bootlegs on the internet or at conventions. However, in the character's simultaneous comic book introduction (''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, January 1967), "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl", Killer Moth is Batgirl's first and main adversary after he leads her to believe that he killed Bruce Wayne. Batgirl later learns that Wayne has not died, after confronting Batman and Robin.

===Videogames===
Killer Moth appears at the end of the first stage of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game loosely based on the 1989 Batman film, in a suit of flying insect-like armor.

Killer Moth also appears as a [[Boss (video game)|boss]] character in the [[Nintendo]] [[video game]] ''[[Batman: Revenge of the Joker]]''.

===''Teen Titans''===

[[Image:TT killer moth.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Killer Moth as depicted on ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]''.]]
In the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series episode "Date with Destiny," Killer Moth is introduced as a costumed criminal who has bio-engineering mutant moth creatures with the intention of using them to take over the city. At the prodding of his spoiled daughter, Kitten, Killer Moth uses the creatures to blackmail [[Robin (comics)#Dick Grayson|Robin]] into taking [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Kitten|Kitten]] to her junior prom. His plan is foiled when Robin breaks the device which controls his moths, and Killer Moth and Kitten are taken to jail.

Killer Moth returns in the episode "Can I Keep Him?," where he turns [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire's]] pet larva named [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Silkie|Silkie]] into a giant moth to attack the Titans. He is eventually taken down by his own creation when Silkie decides that he prefers Starfire over Killer Moth. 

Killer Moth and Kitten later become members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil#Teen Titans animated series|Brotherhood of Evil]]. The two join in the final battle against the Titans in "Calling All Titans" where Kitten fights with a laser-whip, while Killer Moth attacks Starfire with a large swarm of moths. Since the battle ends off-screen in "Titans Together," and since Starfire later reappears inside the Brain's base to rescue Beast Boy's group along with Bumblebee and Red Star, it is assumed that either Starfire won the fight off-screen or at least was able to escape capture. Both Kitten and Killer Moth are turned to ice when [[MÃ¡s y Menos]] send them through Professor Chang's flash-freezing machine.

Killer Moth was voiced by [[Thomas Haden Church]] in his first appearance and by [[Marc Worden]] in subsequent appearances. As Killer Moth never takes off his costume, it is undetermined if he is wearing a costume at all. His animated incarnation is much more dangerous than his comic appearance; he is a twisted genius with enhanced strength, speed, and agility. Although not shown in his first episode, he can also fly. His only real limitation is the spoiled demands of his daughter, which rather undermines his otherwise menacing presence.

In the comic based around the Teen Titans show (not to be confused with the original [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans comic series]]), Kitten disguises herself as numerous female/daughter duplicates of the Titans' nemeses, such as "Mad Maud" as a duplicate of [[Mad Mod]] and "Pink X" as a duplicate of [[Red X]]. This revealed to be part of a plot to make her father pay attention to her.

===''The Batman''===
[[Image:KillerMoth.jpg|thumb|right|Killer Moth as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Killer Moth appears in the series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. The character is a physically weak coffee boy for [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]]'s gang in the episode "Team Penguin". He is transformed into a massive, powerful version of Charaxes after being exposed to chemical fumes during a robbery with Penguin.  Moth still maintaines his milquetoast personality and poor combat abilities despite his size and strength.  He is mentioned by Batman, but not seen, in the episode "Rumors".
