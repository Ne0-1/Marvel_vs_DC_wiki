'''Killer Moth''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''Batman #63'' published in 1951. Killer Moth originally wore a garish costume with striped purple and green spandex, orange cape and a moth-like mask.<ref name="dc-ency1"/>

Killer Moth is not to be confused with another [[Enemies of Batman|Batman villain]], the [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]], who has worn a similar costume.

==History==
===Cameron van Cleer===
The original Killer Moth is a prisoner identified only by his prison number, 234026. While in prison, he reads a newspaper article about [[Batman]] and decides to set himself up as the "anti-Batman," hiring himself out to [[Gotham City]]'s criminals to help them elude capture by police. Upon his release, he uses the hidden proceeds of his crimes to build a "Mothcave", modeled on the photos of the [[Batcave]] in the newspaper article he read. 

Killer Moth also establishes a false identity, as millionaire [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] '''Cameron van Cleer'''. In this guise, he becomes friends with Bruce Wayne. Meanwhile, he promotes himself to Gotham's criminals using his identity as Killer Moth, giving them each an [[infra-red]] Moth-signal. In his first job, he rescues some criminals from the police and then uses his Mothmobile to defeat and capture Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. The duo escape and lead Killer Moth to a climactic battle on Gotham Bridge, which ends when the villain plunges 1,000 feet into the river and disappears.

In his second appearance (''Batman #64'' March 1951) Killer Moth kidnaps Bruce Wayne and learns his [[secret identity]]. However, he is shot by other criminals and the resultant cranial injury causes [[amnesia]].  He remains a persistent enemy appearing through the [[Silver Age of comics]]. He is frequently remembered as being the first criminal [[Batgirl]] encounters in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359.

===Drury Walker===
In the 1990s, in the Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] continuity, Killer Moth's real identity is revealed as Drury Walker, an unsuccessful criminal whom no one takes seriously. He again adopts the false identity of Cameron van Cleer and the persona of Killer Moth to fight Batman. This version first appears in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7 ([[December 1992]]), with a more detailed origin appearing in ''[[Batgirl: Year One]]''.

In ''Shadow of the Bat'', Killer Moth sets up a team called "the Misfits", comprising second-string Batman villains such as [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Calendar Man]], to make another kidnap attempt on Bruce Wayne, as well as other prominent citizens. This team proves unsuccessful, turning against Moth when they realize he plans to kill the hostages.

He is one of the villains who sells their [[soul]]s to the demon [[Neron]] in ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', where he asks to become feared. He is metamorphosed into a moth-like like monster called ''Charaxes''.  As Charaxes, Walker resembles a vaguely humanoid, giant brown moth. He consumes humans and spins [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s in which to keep his prey.

In a later story, Charaxes begins laying hundreds of eggs, all of which hatch into duplicates of Drury Walker. Charaxes despises his progeny, but is unable to destroy them. Following his capture, these duplicates are taken into government custody. During an argument between various bodies as to what should be done with them, they attack a scientist and are killed. <ref> ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' #s 107-110, Dec 2002-March 2003 </ref>

At around the same time, [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] is confronted by a criminal named Danko Twag who claims to be the "real" Killer Moth (the one she had defeated), and that Drury Walker had been an imposter. During a rant in which he claims they are going to be a team, she captures him in an energy cell and he seemingly disintegrates himself.<ref> ''[[Birds of Prey]]'' #s 50-52 Feb-Apr 2003 </ref>

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Charaxes is ripped in half by [[Superboy-Prime]] during the [[Battle of Metropolis]], and presumed deceased.<ref name="dc-ency1">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Charaxes | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 77  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

===Unknown===
A new Killer Moth appears in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #652, during the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline wherein he displays competence in hand-to-hand combat and the ability of flight when facing Robin. He later appears working alongside fellow Gotham criminals [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]] and [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] in the ''[[Gotham Underground]]'' [[limited series]]. The identity and origins of this new Killer Moth remain unrevealed.

==Powers and abilities==
In his original incarnation, Killer Moth has no [[superhuman]] abilities; he relies on the vast array of equipment he has developed. Killer Moth’s range of gimmicks includes a moth mobile, a moth signal, and a steel-line, which allows him to swing through the skies. He carries a [[cocoon]] gun that fires a stream of sticky threads that can totally envelop a victim. The gun can also fire a [[grenade]].

As Charaxes, he has superhuman strength, agility and endurance, an [[exoskeleton]] that gives him some protection from physical and energy attacks, a set of wings that allows him to fly, sharp claws, and sharp, prehensile feelers. Charaxes secretes a sticky [[acid]]ic substance that can trap the strongest of men and dissolve their bodies.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
====''Batman (TV series)''====
A short episode of the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s live-action ''Batman'' television series]] that premiered [[Batgirl]] featured Killer Moth as the villain (played by Tim Herbert), but it was never aired. It has been circulated through bootlegs on the [[Internet]] or at conventions. However, in the character's simultaneous comic book introduction (''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, January 1967), "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl", Killer Moth is Batgirl's first and main adversary after he leads her to believe that he killed Bruce Wayne. Batgirl later learns that Wayne has not died, after confronting Batman and Robin.

====''Teen Titans''====
[[Image:TT killer moth.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Killer Moth as depicted on ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]''.]]
In the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series episode "Date with Destiny," Killer Moth (voiced by [[Thomas Haden Church]] and later by [[Marc Worden]]) is introduced as a criminal who has been bio-engineering mutant moth creatures with the intention of using them to take over the city. At the prodding of his spoiled daughter Kitten (whose boyfriend Fang recently broke up with her), Killer Moth uses the creatures to [[blackmail]] [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] into taking [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Kitten|Kitten]] to her junior prom. His plan is foiled when Robin breaks the device which controls his moths, and Killer Moth and Kitten are taken to jail.

Killer Moth returns in the episode "Can I Keep Him?," where he turns [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire's]] pet larva named [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Silkie|Silkie]] into a giant moth to attack the Titans. He is eventually taken down by his own creation when Silkie decides that he prefers Starfire over Killer Moth. 

Killer Moth and Kitten later become members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil#Teen Titans animated series|Brotherhood of Evil]]. The two join in the final battle against the Titans in "Calling All Titans" wherein Kitten fights with a laser-whip, while Killer Moth attacks Starfire with a large swarm of moths. Since the battle ends off-screen in "Titans Together," and since Starfire later reappears inside the Brain's base to rescue Beast Boy's group along with Bumblebee and Red Star, it is assumed that either Starfire won the fight off-screen or at least was able to escape capture. Killer Moth is turned to ice when [[Más y Menos]] send him through Professor Chang's flash-freezing machine.

====The Batman==== 
[[Image:KillerMoth.jpg|thumb|right|Killer Moth as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Killer Moth appears in the series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. The character is a physically weak coffee boy for [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]]'s gang in the episode "Team Penguin". He is transformed into a massive, powerful version of Charaxes after being exposed to chemical fumes and [[radioactive]] moths dissolving into his skin during a robbery with Penguin. Moth still maintains his milquetoast personality and poor combat abilities despite his size and strength.  He is mentioned by Batman, but not seen, in the episode "Rumors".

===Video games===
[[Image:Lego killer moth.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Killer Moth in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]''.]] Killer Moth appears at the end of the first stage of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]'s [[Batman (NES)|Batman loosely movie-based Batman game]], in a suit of flying insect-like armor. Killer Moth also appears as a [[Boss (video game)|boss]] character in the [[Nintendo]] [[video game]] ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''. 

Killer Moth (identified as Drury Walker) appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' as a boss and a playable character.<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph.  See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> . He aids [[Joker (comics)|Joker's]] plot in poisoning Gotham City with his laughing gas.  Like his namesake, in game Killer Moth is attracted to bright lights, even trying to touch a lamp at the Joker's hideout with the others, but [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|the Scarecrow]] stops him. He uses a handgun as a weapon. He also has the ability to glide using his wings.
