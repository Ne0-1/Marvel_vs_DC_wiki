'''Kala''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  

==Fictional character biography==
Kala is the Queen of the Netherworld, which is another name for the city of Netheria.  Netheria was once a city on the continent of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], which was enclosed in an airtight dome to protect itself from the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] empire based in [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]].  The people excavated the foundations beneath the city to expand it below the ground, and discovered a way to recycle their air supply.  When Atlantis sank in the great cataclysm, Netheria remained intact. Netheria sank to the bottom of the sea, in a huge cavern beneath the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, in part of what is now known as [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]].  Its people renamed their kingdom the Netherworld, and themselves Netherworlders.

Queen Kala sought to use her armies and highly advanced weaponry to conquer the surface world, and sought a means to transport them to the surface.  [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] became encased in a crystalline substance that sank into the Earth, transporting him to the Netherworld.  Kala demanded that Stark create a means for her to bring her armies to the surface or else she would execute him. Stark instead used the Netherworlders' laboratories to create a duplicate of his Iron Man armor, using the armor to capture Kala and fly to the surface.  Exposure to the surface world's air caused Kala to age rapidly into an elderly state.  Realizing that her people could not live on the surface world, she renounced her plans of conquest, and was returned to the Netherworld where she regained her youth.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #43</ref>

Kala then planned to gain control of the [[Mole Man]]'s realm in Subterranea by pretending to fall in love with him.  Mole Man had captured his greatest rival for rulership, [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]], and Kala actually fell in love with Tyrannus instead.  She freed Tyrannus from the Mole Man's control, and the Mole Man was crushed to find that she had deceived and betrayed him.  She teamed with Tyrannus in capturing the Mole Man, and planned to destroy surface civilization with molten lava.  Kala planned to rule the entire realm with Tyrannus, but Tyrannus turned against her and imprisoned her, though she later regained her freedom.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #127-128</ref> She then went to war against the Mole Man, and once again grew elderly on exposure to the air of the surface world.  However, after having been spurned by Tyrannus, she became the Mole Man's consort out of desperation.<ref>''Marvel Treasury Edition'' #25</ref>

Much later, Kala went to the surface world in search of Stark and Iron Man, and asked Stark to send Iron Man to help the Mole Man against Brutus and the Deviants. She was returned to Subterranea by the [[Outcasts (Marvel Comics)|Outcasts]]. She then asked the [[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]]'s aid for the Mole Man against Brutus. She was wounded saving the Mole Man's life, and was reconciled with the Mole Man.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #20; ''Iron Man Annual'' #12; ''Avengers West Coast Annual'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kala is an otherwise ordinary woman who is actually centuries old but remained a beautiful, robust young woman until recent times due to the unexplained effect of the atmosphere of the subterranean "Netherworld." For unknown reasons, exposure to the atmosphere of the Earth's surface causes Netherworlders to grow old and weak within moments; only "Netherworld" air or Tyrannus's fountain of youth can restore Kala's youth from her frail, elderly woman state.

Kala was educated by the Royal tutors of Netherworld, and is a charismatic ruler, cunning military strategist and efficient administrator.  Due to her life underground, Kala can see clearly in far dimmer light than most surface humans can.

As queen of the Netherworld, Kala commanded the use of its highly advanced technology and weaponry and of its well trained army.
