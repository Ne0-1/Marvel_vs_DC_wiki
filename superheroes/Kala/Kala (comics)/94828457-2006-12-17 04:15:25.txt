'''Kala''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  Kala is the Queen of the Netherworld, which is another name for the city of Netheria.  Netheria was once a city on the continent of [[Atlantis (comics)|Atlantis]], which was enclosed in an airtight dome to protect itself from the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] empire based in [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]].  The people excavated the foundations beneath the city to expand it below the ground, and discovered a way to recycle their air supply.  When Atlantis sank, Netheria remained intact, and sank to the bottom of the sea.  Its people renamed their kingdom the Netherworld, and themselves Netherworlders.

Queen Kala sought to use her armies and highly advanced weaponry to conquer the surface world, and sought a means to transport them to the surface.  [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] became encased in a crystalline substance that sank into the Earth, transporting him to the Netherworld.  Kala demanded that Stark create a means for her to bring her armies to the surface or else she would execute him. Stark instead used the Netherworlders' laboratories to create a duplicate of his Iron Man armor, using the armor to capture Kala and fly to the surface.  Exposure to the surface world's air caused Kala to age rapidly into an elderly state.  Realizing that her people could not live on the surface world, she renounced her plans of conquest, and was returned to the Netherworld where she regained her youth.

Kala then planned to gain control of the [[Mole Man]]'s realm in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]] by pretending to fall in love with him.  Mole Man had captured his greatest rival for rulership, [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]], and Kala actually fell in love with him instead.  She freed Tyrannus from the Mole Man's control, and the Mole Man was crushed to find that she had deceived and betrayed him.  Kala planned to rule the entire realm with Tyrannus, but Tyrannus turned against her, forcing her to become the Mole Man's consort out of desperation.
