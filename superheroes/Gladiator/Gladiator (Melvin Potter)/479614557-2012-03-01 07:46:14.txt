He was later forced into working for the Kingpin's elderly predecessor [[Alexander Bont]], who claimed that Potter had a four year old daughter that he had never met and that she would die if Potter did not help.

The Gladiator was defeated by the new [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]], and went back to prison.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #67-70</ref>

Gladiator is accused of murdering two fellow inmates and Matt Murdock's law firm is defending him. Murdock's super-senses indicate that he is telling the truth when he claims he is innocent. However, at the end of the issue, taunted by another inmate, Gladiator snaps his handcuffs and brutally assaults the inmate and a guard, only to surrender to another guard and claim once again that he didn't do it.

It is revealed that [[Mister Fear#Larry Cranston|Larry Cranston]] had administered chemicals to Potter that caused his outbursts.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #96-99</ref>
