Potter was pressured into producing a Daredevil costume for a madman in the employ of the crime lord known as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], but Murdock comes to tell him to play along.<ref>During the ''[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]'' storyline, ''Daredevil'' #230-231</ref> Potter later donned his Gladiator costume again to discourage a youth from a life of crime.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #98</ref>

He was later forced into working for the Kingpin's elderly predecessor [[Alexander Bont]], who claimed that Potter had a four-year-old daughter that he had never met and that she would die if Potter did not help. Gladiator brought Murdock to Bont, who attempted to kill Murdock and assume his old mantle but instead died of a drug-induced heart attack. The Gladiator was defeated by the new [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]], and went back to prison.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #67-70</ref>

Gladiator is accused of murdering two fellow inmates and Matt Murdock's law firm is defending him. Murdock's super-senses indicate that he is telling the truth when he claims he is innocent. However, at the end of the issue, taunted by another inmate, Gladiator snaps his handcuffs and brutally assaults the inmate and a corrections officer, only to surrender to another officer and claim once again that he didn't do it. Later, after being broken out of an armored car, Melvin beats a confused Daredevil and moves to the sewers, heading for his Gladiator costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #95</ref>  Gladiator then goes on a rampage in [[Chinatown]] killing innocent people and then attacking Matt and Milla in a restaurant.

Melvin realizes what he has done and attempts suicide, but is saved by Daredevil. Potter is taken back to prison, and is heavily sedated after repeatedly banging his head against the wall. It is revealed that [[Mister Fear#Larry Cranston|Mr. Fear]] had administered chemicals to Potter that caused his outbursts.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #96-99</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gladiator has no superhuman abilities. However, he is a superb martial arts fighter and very physically powerful. He wore a thick metal armor with a helmet and metallic gauntlets, and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling, jagged circular sawblades made of titanium steel, one mounted on each gauntlet. Small rotors in the gauntlets cause the blades to rotate at high speeds, and the whirling blades could also be detached to serve as short-range missile weapons.

In civilian life, Potter is an accomplished clothing designer, proficient in drafting, design and sewing.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #18</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===

==In other media==
===Television===
* Melvin Potter appears in the live-action [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Netflix series]] ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', portrayed by [[Matt Gerald]].<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/netflixs-daredevil-announces-casting-for-turk-gladiator-more</ref> He designs protective suits for [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and his cohorts. Designs for and components of his Gladiator costume from the comic books appear scattered around his workshop in various episodes. He fights with circular sawblades, albeit only as an improvised weapon as he throws them at Daredevil. His relationship with Betsy Beatty is hinted at as he works exclusively for Fisk (and Fisk's allies) because Fisk has threatened to harm Betsy if Potter does not comply or if anyone shows up that wasn't in the company of Fisk. In the episode "The Path of the Righteous," Daredevil finds where Melvin Potter works and has a brief skirmish with him where Melvin Potter states that the only ones that visit must be in the presence of Wilson Fisk. After Daredevil learns of Fisk's hold on him, Potter later assists Daredevil by creating a red costume (that resembles the classic comic book outfit for Daredevil) when Daredevil promises him that Fisk will never hurt Betsy again. In the episode "Daredevil," the second suit for Daredevil is later finished by Gladiator by the time Daredevil goes to confront Wilson Fisk. Potter explained the design noting which areas of the armor were more protective against bullets and knives. Daredevil removed his glove and touched the material before telling him that the suit was indeed up to standard.

===Novels===
* Potter appeared in the Daredevil novel ''Predator's Smile'', written by [[Christopher Golden]].
