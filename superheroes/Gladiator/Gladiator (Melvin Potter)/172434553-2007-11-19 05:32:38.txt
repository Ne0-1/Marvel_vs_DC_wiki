'''Gladiator''' ('''Melvin Potter''') is a reformed [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Potter was one of the first enemies of the superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. In civilian life, he is a costume-designer. He eventually reformed and became one of the staunchest supporters of Daredevil.

During the ''[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]'' storyline, he was pressured into producing a Daredevil costume for a madman in the employ of the crimelord known as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].

Around this time Potter appeared in the Daredevil novel ''Predator's Smile'', written by Christopher Golden. It is not known if this novel is considered regular Daredevil continuity.

He was later forced into working for the Kingpin's elderly predecessor [[Alexander Bont]], who claimed that Potter had a four year old daughter that he had never met and that she would die if Potter did not help. Gladiator brought Murdock to Bont, who attempted to kill Murdock and assume his old mantle but instead died of a drug-induced heart attack. The Gladiator was defeated by the new [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], and went back to prison.

Gladiator is accused of murdering two fellow inmates and Matt Murdock's law firm is defending him. Murdock's super-senses indicate that he is telling the truth when he claims he is innocent. However, at the end of the issue, taunted by another inmate, Gladiator snaps his handcuffs and brutally assaults the inmate and a guard, only to surrender to another guard and claim once again that he didn't do it. Later, after being broken out of an armored car, Melvin beats a confused Daredevil and moves to the sewers, heading for his Gladiator costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' (2nd series) #95</ref>  After, Gladiator goes on a rampage in [[Chinatown]] killing innocent people and then attacking Matt and Milla in a restaurant. After being knocked out, Matt reawakens in a police car to hear a voice that Gladiator will murder his wife. Matt finds the Gladiator and Milla, rescues Milla, and defeats the Gladiator. Melvin realizes what he has done and attempts suicide, but is saved by Daredevil. Potter is taken back to prison, and is heavily sedated after repeatedly banging his head against the wall. It is revealed  that [[Larry Cranston]] had administered chemicals to Potter that caused his outbursts. <ref>''Daredevil'' (2nd series) #99</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gladiator has no superhuman abilities. However, he is a superb martial arts fighter and very physically powerful. He wore a thick metal armor and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling circular blades protruding from his wrists.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Gladiator===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Gladiator has a cameo appearance. He appears as an enemy of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], and is a crazed madman obsessed with Emperor [[Nurhachi]].
