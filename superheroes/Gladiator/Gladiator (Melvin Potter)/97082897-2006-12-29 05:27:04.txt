'''Gladiator''' ('''Melvin Potter''') is a reformed [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Character history==
Potter was one of the first enemies of the superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. In civilian life, he is a costume-designer. He eventually reformed and became one of the staunchest supporters of Daredevil.

During the "[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]" storyline, he was pressured into producing a Daredevil costume for a madman in the employ of the crimelord known as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].

He was later forced into working for the Kingpin's elderly predecessor [[Alexander Bont]], who claimed that Potter had a four year old daughter that he had never met and that she would die if Potter did not help. Gladiator brought Murdock to Bont, who attempted to kill Murdock and assume his old mantle but instead died of a drug-induced heart attack. The Gladiator was defeated by the new [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], and went back to prison.

==Powers and abilities==
Gladiator has no superhuman abilities. However, he is a superb martial arts fighter and very powerful. He wore a thick metal armor and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling blades protruding from his wrists.

==Ultimate Gladiator==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Gladiator has a cameo appearance. He appears as an enemy of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], and is a crazed madman obsessed with Emperor [[Nurhachi]].
