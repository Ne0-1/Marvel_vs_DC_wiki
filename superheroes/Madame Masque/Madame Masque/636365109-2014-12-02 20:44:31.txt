'''Madame Masque''', real name '''Whitney Frost''' and also known as '''Masque''', is a [[fictional character]], a supervillain that has appeared in various [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is an occasional love interest, and sometimes enemy of [[Iron Man]] within the [[Marvel Universe]]. She originally wore a golden mask to cover up her disfigured face, and continues to do so after her face was healed.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Whitney Frost first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #98 (February 1968), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gene Colan]].  She first appeared as Madame Masque in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #17 (September 1969).

==Fictional character biography==
Madame Masque was born as '''Giulietta Nefaria''', the daughter of the master criminal [[Count Nefaria|Count Luchino Nefaria]], in [[Rome, Italy]]. Her mother died when giving birth and Luchino wanted his daughter to lead a respectable life, so he gave the child to Byron Frost, a wealthy financier and an employee of Nefaria, and his wife Loretta to be raised. He called the child Whitney and raised her as his own.

As a young adult, Whitney was a debutante and socialite, and became engaged to politician Roger Vane. The Frosts die and Count Nefaria approaches Whitney and reveals her true parentage. He tells Whitney that he wants her to take his place as leader of [[Maggia (comics)|the Maggia]], a [[Mafia]]-like organization based on the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Whitney at first refuses, but when she tells Roger about her father, he leaves her, afraid that her connections to a known criminal would hamper his political career.

Whitney accepts her father's offer to become a professional criminal mastermind and is trained by him in strategy, criminal activities, and combat. She turns out to be a brilliant student and when her father is imprisoned, she becomes the new Big M, the leader of the Nefaria family of the Maggia. Her role as Big M brings her into conflict with [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #98</ref> Whitney is forced to flee after a raid on his company, Stark Industries. The plane she escapes in crashes and Whitney's face is scarred, but she is saved by the criminal [[Midas (comics)|Mordecai Midas]] and starts to work for him. Midas is obsessed with gold and Whitney hides her face behind a golden mask and uses the alias "Madame Masque".<ref>''Iron Man'' #17</ref>

Madame Masque meets Tony Stark (Iron Man's [[alter ego]]) and he shows concern for her despite her scarred face. She turns on Midas to save Stark, but leaves Stark because of her criminal past. Unable to forget him, she returns as Krissy Longfellow, Stark's personal secretary. Both come to know each other's secret identity and start a romantic relationship. Their happiness is short-lived as Count Nefaria, her father, is dying as the result of an attempt to gain superhuman powers. Whitney hires the [[Ani-Men]] to bring her father to her and then asks Stark to find a cure for him. Nefaria tries to use violence to force Stark, and a battle starts between the Ani-Men and Iron Man. Whitney is unable to choose between her father and her lover, and when Nefaria's life-support is damaged in the fight, she goes insane with guilt and grief.<ref>''Iron Man'' #116-117</ref> Whitney returns to the Nefaria Maggia and as "The Director" becomes its leader. She often fights Iron Man and his friends.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

At one point, Frost becomes [[Paranoia|paranoid]] and starts to create copies of herself, known as bio-duplicates. One of her bio-duplicates known as ''Masque'', becomes an ally of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].{{issue|date=July 2013}} She also creates robotic servants known as the ''Inner Guard'' and names them individually after notable historical traitors, [[Benedict (Marvel)|Benedict]], Brutus, Fawkes, Quisling, Monmouth (based on [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Vidkun Quisling]] and the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]) and two other, unnamed members.<ref>''Avengers'' volume 3 #32</ref><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/innerguardmasque.htm|Inner Guard}} Retrieved 19.July 2013</ref>

One member of the Inner Guard, Benedict, recaptures Masque for Whitney. Masque tries to convince her the Avengers are benevolent and that she should reach out to Stark again, but Whitney is still too fearful to do so. She continues to be a criminal figure of importance, until her father returns from the dead once again and destroys her base. She reluctantly assists the Avengers and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] against Nefaria, but she secretly plans to betray and destroy both sides, her increased paranoia causing her to believe that both sides want only to kill her. Masque again tries unsuccessfully to convince her to side with the heroes, then joins the battle in Whitney's place. Masque uses a weapon designed to disrupt Nefaria's ionic energy that Whitney was saving until the Avengers were dead and Nefaria weakened, and is slain by Nefaria. Madame Masque is shocked by her duplicate's nobility and sacrifice, with Iron Man's dismayed reaction at what appears to be her death compared to Nefaria's glee forcing her to recognize that her duplicate was right about the Avengers. Whitney joins the battle and plays a key role in her father's defeat, her weapon causing him to begin leaking ionic energy until he finally collapses. She renounces her criminal past, and [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-II]] of the Thunderbolts offers her membership, but she declines, departing to parts unknown to consider her future. Before leaving, she asked MACH-II to thank everyone for her, especially Iron Man.<ref>''Avengers'', volume 3 #34</ref>
