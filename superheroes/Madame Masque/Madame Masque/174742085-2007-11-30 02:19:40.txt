'''Madame Masque''' (Whitney Frost) is a [[fictional character]], occasional love interest, and sometimes enemy of [[Iron Man]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Madame Masque was born as Giulietta Nefaria, the daughter of the master criminal [[Count Nefaria|Count Luchino Nefaria]], in [[Rome, Italy]]. Her mother died when giving birth and Luchino wanted his daughter to lead a respectable life, so he gave the child to Byron Frost, a wealthy financier and an employee of Nefaria, and his wife Loretta to be raised. He called the child Whitney and raised her as his own.

As a young adult, Whitney became engaged to politician Roger Vane. The Frosts died and Count Nefaria approached Whitney and revealed her true parentage. He told Whitney that he wanted her to take his place as leader of the Maggia, a [[Mafia]]-like organisation running the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Whitney at first refused, but when she told Roger about her father, he left her, afraid that her connections to a known criminal would hamper his political career. 

Whitney accepted her father's offer and was trained by him in strategy, criminal activities, and combat. She turned out to be a brilliant student and when her father was imprisoned, she became the new Big M, the leader of the Nefaria family of the Maggia. Her role as Big M brought her into conflict with [[Iron Man]].  Whitney was forced to flee after a raid on his company, Stark Industries. The plane she escaped in crashed and Whitney's face was scarred, but she was saved by the criminal [[Midas (comics)|Mordecai Midas]] and started to work for him. Midas was obsessed with gold and Whitney hid her face behind a golden mask and used the alias "Madame Masque".<ref>Iron Man vol 1 #17</ref>

Madame Masque met Tony Stark, Iron Man's [[alter ego]], and he showed concern for her despite her scarred face. She turned on Midas to save Stark, but left Stark because of her criminal past. Unable to forget him, she returned as Krissy Longfellow, Stark's personal secretary. Both came to know each other's secret identity and started a romantic relationship. Their happiness was short-lived as Count Nefaria, her father, was dying as the result of an attempt to gain superhuman powers. Whitney hired the [[Ani-Men]] to bring her father to her and then asked Stark to find a cure for him. Nefaria tried to use violence to force Stark, and a battle started between the Ani-Men and Iron Man. During the battle Whitney was unable to choose between her father and her lover and when Nefaria's life-support was damaged in the fight, she went insane with guilt and grief. Whitney returned to the Nefaria Maggia and as "The Director" became its leader. She often fought Iron Man and his friends.

===Masque and the Inner Guard===
At one point, Whitney became [[Paranoia|paranoid]] and started to create copies of herself, known as bio-duplicates. One of her bio-duplicates known as ''Masque'', was an ally of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She also created robotic servants known as the ''Inner Guard'' and named individually after notable historical traitors (including [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], [[Guy Fawkes]] and [[Vidkun Quisling]]).

One member of the Inner Guard, Benedict, eventually recaptured Masque for Whitney.  Masque then tried to convince her the Avengers were benevolent and that she should reach out to Stark again, but Whitney was still too fearful to do so. She continued to be a criminal figure of importance, until her father returned from the dead once again and destroyed her base. She reluctantly assisted the Avengers and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] against Nefaria, but she secretly planned to betray and destroy both sides, her increased paranoia causing her to believe that both sides wanted only to kill her. Masque again tried unsuccessfully to convince her to side with the heroes, then joined the battle in Whitney's place and was promptly slain by Nefaria, who showed only glee at her apparent demise while Iron Man was clearly genuinely horrified at the loss of the woman he'd once loved. Shocked by her duplicate's nobility and sacrifice, Whitney joined the battle and played a key role in her father's defeat, causing him to begin leaking ionic energy until he finally collapsed. Deciding to renounce her criminal past, [[MACH-IV (Marvel Comics)|MACH-II]] of the Thunderbolts offered her membership, but she politely declined, departing to parts unknown to consider her future. Before leaving, she asked MACH-II to thank everyone for her, especially Iron Man. Afterward, Jasper Sitwell, an old ally of Iron Man's and Whitney's who had been in contact with him over the course of the conflict asks if that was the real Whitney. Iron Man says that it was, but that she slipped away in the confusion. He says that she really came through when it mattered. He says that she is gone, but that if you look at it- she is really back.

===New Avengers===
Madame Masque has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>New Avengers #35</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Madame Masque has no superhuman powers, but is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and markswoman. She has access to advanced technology like her bio-duplicates.
