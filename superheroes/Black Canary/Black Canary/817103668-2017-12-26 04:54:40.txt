'''Black Canary''' is a fictional [[superhero]]ine in comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by the writer-artist team of [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Carmine Infantino]], the character debuted in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #86 (August 1947). One of DC's earliest super-heroines, Black Canary has appeared in many of the company's flagship [[team-up]] titles including ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' and ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]''. Since the late 1960s, the character has been paired with archer superhero the [[Green Arrow]] professionally and romantically.

At her [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] debut, Black Canary was the alter ego of Dinah Drake and participated in crime-fighting adventures with her love interest (and eventual husband), [[Gotham City]] detective [[Larry Lance]]. Initially, the character was a hand-to-hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs. Later stories depicted her as a world-class martial artist with a superpower: the "Canary Cry", a high-powered [[sonic weapon|sonic scream]] which could shatter objects and incapacitate enemies (even ones powerful enough to kill [[Kryptonians]] such as [[Superman]]).<!--Is this saying she is able to incapacitate Supes, or not?--> When DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|adjusted its continuity]], Black Canary was established as two separate entities: mother and daughter, Dinah Drake-Lance and Dinah Laurel Lance. Stories since the Silver Age have focused on the younger Black Canary, ascribing her superhuman abilities to a [[metahuman|genetic mutation]].

Black Canary has been adapted into various media, including [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies|direct-to-video animated films]], video games, and both live-action and animated television series, featuring as a main or recurring character in the shows ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV Series)|Young Justice]]'' and ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. The character is ranked the 21st-greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.comicvine.com/wizard/4010-2081/forums/wizards-top-200-comic-book-characters-644479/| title= Wizard's top 200 characters | publisher=''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140727061118/http://www.comicvine.com/wizard/4010-2081/forums/wizards-top-200-comic-book-characters-644479/|archivedate= July 27, 2014|deadurl= no}} <!-- External link consists of a forum site summing up the top 200 characters of ''Wizard'' since the real site that contains the list is broken.--></ref> and [[IGN]] rated her its 11th greatest all-time comic book hero.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/81|title= #11 Black Canary|publisher= IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130715162500/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/81|archivedate= July 15, 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> She was number 6 on ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book|last= Frankenhoff|first= Brent|authorlink= Brent Frankenhoff|title= Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics|publisher= [[Krause Publications]]|year= 2011|location= Iola, Wisconsin|page= 24|isbn= 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino created the character in 1947 to be featured in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' as a supporting character. Appearing first as a clandestine crime-fighter who infiltrates criminal organizations to break them from the inside, Black Canary was drawn with [[fishnet]] [[Hosiery|stockings]] and a black leather jacket to connote images of a sexualized yet strong female character.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Madrid|first1= Mike|title= The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines|publisher= [[Tod Davies|Exterminating Angel Press]]|year= 2009|pages= 27–28|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ITJvdZ0VB5QC&pg=PA27&dq=black+canary+fishnets&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQgvTdyLTJAhVHph4KHXhlDlAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=black%20canary%20fishnets&f=false|isbn= 978-1935259039}}</ref> She appeared as a character in a back-up story featuring "[[Johnny Thunder]]":

{{quote|I was drawing Johnny Thunder, which was not much of a character. I suppose he could have been better because his 'Thunderbolt' was interesting, but the situations they were in were pretty juvenile. Bob Kanigher wrote those stories, and he had no respect for the characters. These stories were nowhere near as good as 'The Flash' stories. DC knew it—they knew 'Johnny Thunder' was a loser, so Kanigher and I brought the ''Black Canary'' into the series. Immediately she got a good response, and it was, 'Bye, bye, Johnny Thunder.' Nobody missed him."<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010">{{cite book|last1= Amash|first1= Jim|last2= Nolen-Weathington|first2= Eric|title= Carmine Infantino: Penciler, Publisher, Provocateur|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2010|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|pages= 30–32|isbn= 978-1605490250}}</ref>|Carmine Infantino}}

According to Amash & Nolen-Weathington (2010), Black Canary is "really" Carmine Infantino's "first character."<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010"/> According to the artist:
"When Kanigher gave me the script, I said, 'How do you want me to draw her?' He said, 'What's your fantasy of a good-looking girl? That's what I want.' Isn't that a great line? So that's what I did. I made her strong in character and sexy in form. The funny part is that years later, while in Korea on a National Cartoonists trip, I met a dancer who was the exact image of the Black Canary. And I went out with her for three years.

Bob didn't ask me for a character sketch [for the Black Canary]. He had a lot of respect for me, I must say that. He always trusted my work... Bob loved my Black Canary design."<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010"/>

Black Canary was revived with the other [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters during the 1960s. In these stories, it is retroactively established she lives on the parallel world of [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] (home of DC's Golden Age versions of its characters).

A story in ''Justice League of America'' #219-220 (October and November 1983) served to explain the origin of Black Canary's new sonic scream powers, and further, why she continued to appear youthful despite being active since the late 1940s (thereby making her nearly 60 years old). It was established that during the 1950s, she and Larry had a daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, who was cursed by the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] with a devastating sonic scream. Her mother hoped that Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt could cure her, but the Thunderbolt was only able to keep the younger Dinah in suspended animation in his own dimension. To ease their pain, the Thunderbolt altered the memories of the tragedy, leaving all to believe Dinah's daughter had simply died. Following the battle with Aquarius, Dinah discovered she was dying from radiation exposure, and she asked to see her daughter's grave one last time. Shown the body of her daughter—still in suspended animation, but now grown to adulthood—Dinah wished that she could somehow be her successor. The Superman of Earth-1 and the Thunderbolt conceived a solution, and transferred Dinah's memories into her daughter's body so that she could continue fighting as the Black Canary.<ref name="Markstein" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy; Conway, Gerry|penciller= [[Chuck Patton|Patton, Chuck]]|inker= [[Romeo Tanghal|Tanghal, Romeo]]|story= Crisis in the Thunderbolt Dimension!|title= Justice League of America|issue= 219|date= October 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= Patton, Chuck|inker= Tanghal, Romeo; [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]]|story= The Doppelganger Gambit|title= Justice League of America|issue= 220|date= November 1983}}</ref>

A Black Canary miniseries by writer [[Greg Weisman]] and artist [[Mike Sekowsky]] was planned in 1984. Although its first issue was pencilled, the project was [[List of comics solicited but never published|shelved]] due to the character's use in writer-artist [[Mike Grell]]'s high-profile ''[[Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters]]'' series.

Following the universe-altering events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (concluding in March 1986), Black Canary's history was revised again. The mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded; in this version of the story, the present-day Black Canary is Dinah Laurel Lance, who inherits the identity from her mother, Dinah Drake Lance. Although some references (for example, those in [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson's]] ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' series) tried to distinguish the two Canaries by calling the first "Diana", recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother's given name.

The two Canaries' origin stories were told in full in ''Secret Origins'' #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force. When she is turned down, her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards. Determined to honor his memory, Dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means. She becomes a costumed vigilante, using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last= Beatty|first= Scott|author-link= Scott Beatty| contribution= Black Canary|editor-last= Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 50|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> Dinah marries her lover, private eye Larry Lance, and several years later their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, is born (''Birds of Prey'' #66 (June 2004) would established that they took the name "Laurel" from a librarian Dinah befriended during a case<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gail Simone|Simone, Gail]]|penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]|inker= Manley, Mike; Hanna, Scott; Golden, Michael|story= Sensei & Student Part Five Murder & Mystery|title= [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]|issue= 66|date=June 2004}}</ref>).

The younger Dinah has her own "Canary Cry"—in this version, the result of a [[metagene]] absent from both her parents—which (unlike the Silver Age Black Canary) she can control.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Growing up surrounded by her mother's friends in the disbanded JSA (seeing them as uncles and aunts), she wishes to be a costumed hero like her mother, but the elder Dinah discourages her, feeling that the world has become too dangerous for her daughter to succeed. Regardless, Dinah finds fighters (including former JSA member [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]]) who help her hone her skills, and after years of dedication and training, she assumes the mantle of Black Canary despite her mother's opposition. Like her mother, Dinah operates out of Gotham, with a day job in the family floral business.

In an early ''Birds of Prey'' issue, writer [[Chuck Dixon]] has Dinah briefly married and divorced at a young age. Although ex-husband Craig Windrow seems to need her help, he actually wants to reconcile after he embezzles from the mob.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller= Giordano, Dick|inker= Faucher, Wayne|story= |title= Birds of Prey: Wolves|issue= 1|date= 1997}}</ref> Dinah's early marriage and ex-husband are not mentioned again until the 2007 ''Black Canary'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]].

After joining the Justice League, Dinah meets Green Arrow (Oliver Queen). Although she dislikes him at first, they become romantically involved despite their age difference; opposite the earlier depiction, in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] stories Oliver is considerably older than Dinah. Dinah is a League member for about six years, including a brief stint with [[Justice League International]] (JLI, which she helps found). After her mother's death from radiation poisoning received during her battle with Aquarius, Dinah feels that her time in the JLA is over. She moves to Seattle with Green Arrow and opens a flower shop, Sherwood Florist.

When Dinah belonged to the JLI during the 1980s she wore a new costume, a blue-and-black full-body jumpsuit with a bird motif and a slightly looser fit instead of her traditional, skin-tight black outfit with fishnet stockings. The change was poorly received and short-lived, and later artists restored her original look.<ref name="Kingman" />

===''Birds of Prey''===
{{main article|Birds of Prey (comics)}}
When former Batgirl [[Barbara Gordon]] is [[Batman: The Killing Joke|seriously injured]] by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], she reestablishes her crime-fighting career as Oracle, information broker to the superhero community. After briefly working with the [[Suicide Squad]], she forms a covert-mission team. Since Barbara thinks that of all the superheroes Dinah has the most potential, Oracle asks Black Canary to become an operative.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Dolan, p. 286: "Oracle and Black Canary were finally rewarded with their own ongoing series by scripter Chuck Dixon and penciller Greg Land."</ref>

Black Canary reinvents herself, trading her blonde wig for bleached blonde hair. Her relationship with Oracle is rocky at first, since her impulsiveness clashes with Oracle's organization. Gradually, they learn to work together and became friends. When Oracle flees from [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] Dinah rescues her and meets Barbara Gordon,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Dixon, Chuck|penciller= [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]]|inker= Guice, Jackson|story= Part Four: The Deep|title= Birds of Prey|issue= 21|date= September 2000}}</ref> deepening their friendship.

''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' gives Earth a new timeline, with [[Wonder Woman]] again a founding member of the Justice League. In a  Week 51 back-up feature of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Black Canary is at the battle which forms the League. Its core is Black Canary, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], the [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], [[Aquaman]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and Wonder Woman. In the 2007 ''Black Canary'' miniseries, she and Green Arrow join the Justice League after its founding and are tested by founding member Batman early in their membership.

During publication of the ''Infinite Crisis'' limited series, most [[DC Universe]] comic books advanced one year. After this "[[One Year Later]]" jump, Dinah trades life experiences with [[Lady Shiva]] to soften the warrior and begins a harsh training regimen in an unidentified Vietnamese [[shanty town]]. The regimen replicates Shiva's early life and training, and Shiva assumes Dinah's role in Oracle's group.

During ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'', several series include tie-ins and run-ups to the wedding of Dinah and Ollie.<ref>Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 331: "Two of DC's best-loved characters were married in the ''Green Arrow and Black Canary Wedding Special'' - or so it seemed."</ref> ''The Black Canary Wedding Planner'' details the preparations; in ''Birds of Prey'' #109, Dinah and Barbara discuss the wedding (and Ollie). ''Countdown: Justice League Wedding Special'', and ''Justice League'' #13 deal with the bachelor and bachelorette parties.

Post-[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]], Dinah Drake was born the child of a teenage single mother, handed into foster care at the age of four. Considered a troublemaker, she moved from foster home to foster home, and finally ran away at the age of ten. Taking to the streets of Gotham, she was caught dumpster diving by Desmond Lamar, an ex-Special Forces agent and martial arts sensei who took her in, offering her a job to clean his dojo after classes, and in return he would provide her with food and a safe place to sleep. At her request, Lamar took to teaching her the same teaching he provided his students, and she became his regular. When Lamar contracted fatal brain cancer, he left her his dojo. Unfortunately, he was the only one who could keep the local gangs from getting protection money out of them. Dinah's martial arts prowess could only keep them at bay for so long. Eventually she began losing students who feared the possibility of their retaliation. Flashbacks show that during [[Zero Year]], Dinah's dojo was destroyed in a fire. It was at this point, [[John Lynch (comics)|John Lynch]], impressed by her martial arts prowess in taking down several [[League of Assassins|ninjas]] during an attack, recruited her into [[Team 7]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Landry Walker|Walker, Landry Q.]]; Fawkes, Ray; [[Christy Marx|Marx, Christy]]|penciller= Hepburn, Scott; [[Richard Isanove|Isanove, Richard]]; [[Rick Burchett|Burchett, Rick]]|inker= Hepburn, Scott; Isanove, Richard; Burchett, Rick|story= Red Roots; John Constantine; Code Black|title= Secret Origins|volume= 3|issue= 11|date= May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Marx, Christy|penciller= Molenaar, Romano; Sampere, Daniel; [[Scott McDaniel|McDaniel, Scott]]|inker= Glapion, Jonathan; Cifuentes, Vicente|story= Sunrise|title= Birds of Prey|volume= 3|issue= 25|date= January 2014}}</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
In [[Geoff Johns]]' ''DC Rebirth'' #1, [[Wally West]] reflects, from outside the universe, on how Black Canary and Green Arrow hardly know each other any more, when they should be husband and wife, as a result of sinister alterations to the timeline. The comic shows the pair briefly meeting, by chance, and then separately staying up at night, contemplating what is missing from their lives. They meet again in ''Green Arrow Rebirth'' #1, and instantly hit it off. In the ensuing ''Green Arrow'' series, Dinah is the first to notice something awry with Oliver's apparent suicide (in fact, an attempted assassination by [[Shado (comics)|Shado]]) and disappearance. She is also a current member of the ''Birds of Prey'', as well as the ''Justice League of America''. In ''Birds of Prey: Rebirth'', it is revealed that Dinah and Barbara ([[Batgirl]]) have been good friends for a few years now, while just meeting [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]] ([[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]). In ''Justice League of America'', she is seen fighting Caitlin Snow ([[Killer Frost]]), and is later recruited by [[Batman]] due to the skills she possesses.

=={{anchor|Powers, abilities, and equipment}}Powers, abilities and equipment==
Although depictions of Black Canary have varied over the years, she is often portrayed as a prodigious hand-to-hand combatant with [[Boxing]], [[Judo]],<ref name=BlackCanaryMartialArts>''Birds of Prey'' #58 (October 2003)</ref> [[Okinawan martial arts | Shuri-Te]],<ref name=BlackCanaryMartialArts /> and [[Wing Chun]]<ref>''JSA'' #14 (September 2000)</ref> being the most notable of her style. Having been trained by other top-tier fighters such as [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], [[Lady Shiva]], [[Cassandra Cain]], [[Wonder Woman]] and more. In addition to her martial arts skills, Black Canary has also been depicted as an expert motorcyclist, gymnast, covert operative, and investigator. She is also an excellent leader and tactician, having served as the field commander of the Birds of Prey and was the leader of the Justice League for a time.

The origin of Black Canary’s Canary Cry has been retconned over the course of her character history, with it being depicted as magical in origin due to being cursed by the Wizard. Later, the cry is depicted as an inborn [[metahuman]] ability. As of the New 52, her ability is result of human experimentation by the executive leaders of Team 7 involving her being treated with genes from an alien girl named Ditto.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Fletcher, Brenden|penciller= [[Annie Wu (artist)|Wu, Annie]]|inker= Wu, Annie|story= Speed of Life|title= Black Canary|volume= 4|issue= 3|date= October 2015}}</ref>
