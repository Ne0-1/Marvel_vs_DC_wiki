==Publication history==
Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino created the character in 1947 to be featured in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' as a supporting character. Appearing first as a clandestine crime-fighter who infiltrates criminal organizations to break them from the inside, the Black Canary was drawn with [[fishnet]] [[Hosiery|stockings]] and a black leather jacket to connote images of a sexualized yet strong female character.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Madrid|first1= Mike|title= The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines|publisher= [[Tod Davies|Exterminating Angel Press]]|year= 2009|pages= 27–28|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ITJvdZ0VB5QC&q=black+canary+fishnets&pg=PA27|isbn= 978-1935259039}}</ref> She appeared as a character in a back-up story featuring "[[Johnny Thunder]]":

{{quote|I was drawing Johnny Thunder, which was not much of a character. I suppose he could have been better because his 'Thunderbolt' was interesting, but the situations they were in were pretty juvenile. Bob Kanigher wrote those stories, and he had no respect for the characters. These stories were nowhere near as good as 'The Flash' stories. DC knew it—they knew 'Johnny Thunder' was a loser, so Kanigher and I brought the ''Black Canary'' into the series. Immediately she got a good response, and it was, 'Bye, bye, Johnny Thunder.' Nobody missed him."<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010">{{cite book|last1= Amash|first1= Jim|last2= Nolen-Weathington|first2= Eric|title= Carmine Infantino: Penciler, Publisher, Provocateur|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2010|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|pages= 30–32|isbn= 978-1605490250}}</ref>|Carmine Infantino}}

According to Amash & Nolen-Weathington (2010), Black Canary is "really" Carmine Infantino's "first character."<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010"/> According to the artist:
"When Kanigher gave me the script, I said, 'How do you want me to draw her?' He said, 'What's your fantasy of a good-looking girl? That's what I want.' Isn't that a great line? So that's what I did. I made her strong in character and sexy in form. The funny part is that years later, while in Korea on a National Cartoonists trip, I met a dancer who was the exact image of the Black Canary. And I went out with her for three years.

Bob didn't ask me for a character sketch [for the Black Canary]. He had a lot of respect for me, I must say that. He always trusted my work... Bob loved my Black Canary design."<ref name="Amas&Nolen-Weathington2010"/>

==={{anchor|Pre-Crisis}}Dinah Drake===
{{Main|Black Canary (Dinah Drake)}}
At her [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] debut, the Black Canary was the [[alter ego]] of Dinah Drake and participated in crime-fighting adventures with her love interest (and eventual husband), [[Gotham City]] detective [[Larry Lance]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=The Black Canary |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/bcanary.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Initially, the character was a hand-to-hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs. Later stories depicted her as a world-class martial artist with a superpower: the "canary cry", a high-powered [[Sonic weapon|sonic scream]] which could shatter objects and incapacitate and even kill powerful foes. When DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|adjusted its continuity]], the Black Canary was established as two separate entities: mother and daughter, Dinah Drake-Lance and Dinah Laurel Lance. Stories since the Silver Age focused on the younger Black Canary, ascribing her superhuman abilities to a [[Metahuman|genetic mutation]]. However, since the launch of ''[[The New 52]]'', the two identities have been merged, with Dinah Drake possessing a metahuman canary cry.<ref name=Guide/>

==={{anchor|Post-Crisis}}Dinah Laurel Lance===
{{Main|Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance)}}
Following the universe-altering events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (concluding in March 1986), the Black Canary's history was revised again. The mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded; in this version of the story, the present-day Black Canary is Dinah Laurel Lance, who inherits the identity from her mother, Dinah Drake-Lance. Although some references (for example, those in [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson's]] ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' series) tried to distinguish between the two Canaries by calling the first "Diana", recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother's given name.

The two Canaries' origin stories were told in full in ''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force. When she is turned down, her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards. Determined to honor his memory, Dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means. She becomes a costumed vigilante, using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last= Beatty|first= Scott|author-link= Scott Beatty| contribution= Black Canary|editor-last= Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 50|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref> Dinah marries her lover, private eye Larry Lance, and several years later their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, is born (''Birds of Prey'' #66 (June 2004) would establish that they took the name "Laurel" from a librarian Dinah befriended during a case).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gail Simone|Simone, Gail]]|penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]|inker= Manley, Mike; Hanna, Scott; Golden, Michael|story= Sensei & Student Part Five Murder & Mystery|title= [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]|issue= #66|date=June 2004}}</ref>

Post-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', Dinah Drake was born the child of a teenaged single mother, handed into foster care at the age of 4. Considered a troublemaker, she moved from foster home to foster home and finally ran away at the age of 10. Taking to the streets of Gotham, she was caught dumpster-diving by Desmond Lamar, an ex-Special Forces agent and martial arts sensei, who took her in and offered her a job to clean his dojo after classes. In return, he would provide her with food and a safe place to sleep. At her request, Lamar took to teaching her the same skills he provided his students, and she became his regular. When Lamar contracted fatal brain cancer, he left her his dojo. Unfortunately, he was the only one who could keep the local gangs from getting protection money out of them. Dinah's martial arts prowess could only keep them at bay for so long. Eventually, she began losing students who feared the possibility of their retaliation. Flashbacks show that during [[Zero Year]], Dinah's dojo was destroyed in a fire. It was at this point, [[John Lynch (comics)|John Lynch]], impressed by her martial arts prowess in taking down several [[League of Assassins|ninjas]] during an attack, recruited her into [[Team 7]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Landry Walker|Walker, Landry Q.]]; Fawkes, Ray; [[Christy Marx|Marx, Christy]]|penciller= Hepburn, Scott; [[Richard Isanove|Isanove, Richard]]; [[Rick Burchett|Burchett, Rick]]|inker= Hepburn, Scott; Isanove, Richard; Burchett, Rick|story= Red Roots; John Constantine; Code Black|title= Secret Origins|volume= 3|issue= 11|date= May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Marx, Christy|penciller= Molenaar, Romano; Sampere, Daniel; [[Scott McDaniel|McDaniel, Scott]]|inker= Glapion, Jonathan; Cifuentes, Vicente|story= Sunrise|title= Birds of Prey|volume= 3|issue= 25|date= January 2014}}</ref>

Throughout her missions with the Birds, Dinah encounters and protects an elderly woman, Miss Ettie, later revealed to be known as Mother Eve, a centuries-old woman hunted by Ra's al Ghul for her immortality which takes place in the form of her metamorphosis into her youth after every life.

Although depictions of the Black Canary have varied over the years, the characters are often portrayed as a prodigious hand-to-hand combatant, having mastered styles such as [[Aikido]],<ref>''Black Canary'' vol. 3 #2 (September 2007)</ref> [[Boxing]], [[Capoeira]], [[Hapkido]], [[Judo]],<ref>''Green Arrow Annual'' (vol. 2) #1 (September 1988)</ref><ref>''Batman: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (October 1997)</ref><ref name="BlackCanaryMartialArts">''Birds of Prey'' vol. 1 #58 (October 2003)</ref> [[Jujutsu]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Okinawan martial arts|Shuri-te]],<ref name=BlackCanaryMartialArts /> and [[Wing Chun]].<ref>''JSA'' #14 (September 2000)</ref> She has been trained by other top-tier fighters, such as [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], [[Lady Shiva]], [[Cassandra Cain]], and [[Wonder Woman]], as well as having bested [[Batman]] from time to time in hand-to-hand combat.  In addition to her martial arts skills, the Black Canary has been depicted as an expert motorcyclist, gymnast, covert operative and investigator. She is also an excellent leader and tactician, having served as the field commander of the Birds of Prey and the leader of the Justice League and League of Assassins for a time.

Her superpower, the canary cry,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry|penciller= Tanghal, Romeo|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= Gravitational Boom-a-rang|title= [[World's Finest Comics]]|issue= 262|date= April–May 1980}}</ref> allows her to create ultrasonic vibrations whenever she screams, allowing her to severely damage both organic and inorganic objects.

Despite her power, the Black Canary often relies on her martial arts skills instead, preferring to use her canary cry only during urgent situations, such as against superpowered opponents.

The origin of the Black Canary's canary cry has been retconned over the course of her character history, with it being originally depicted as magical in origin due to being cursed by the Wizard. Later, the cry is depicted as an inborn [[metahuman]] ability. As of ''The New 52'', her ability is the result of human experimentation by the executive leaders of Team 7, involving her being treated with genes from an alien girl named Ditto.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Fletcher, Brenden|penciller= [[Annie Wu (artist)|Wu, Annie]]|inker= Wu, Annie|story= Speed of Life|title= Black Canary|volume= 4|issue= 3|date= October 2015}}</ref>

The Black Canary has appeared in live action and animated adaptations of DC properties and in video games based on the comic books.

=== Television ===
==== Live action ====
The Black Canary's first live-action appearance was Danuta Wesley's 1979 portrayal in [[NBC]]'s two ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' specials.

The character appeared in the short-lived 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', an adaptation of the comic book. Dinah Lance became Dinah Redmond (played by [[Rachel Skarsten]]) a teenage runaway with psychic powers. Her mother Caroline Lance (played by [[Lori Loughlin]]) was the Black Canary with a supersonic canary cry.

In 2008, ''[[Smallville]]'' introduced the Black Canary (played by [[Alaina Huffman]]) as an assassin who is recruited for the Green Arrow's [[Justice League in other media#Live action|team of superheroes]]. She appears in a number of episodes, including several season premieres and finales.

In the 2012 television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and other series set in [[Arrowverse|its fictional universe]], [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Dinah Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]) is an attorney, and commonly goes by the name Laurel. Her younger sister, [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]) returns in [[Arrow (season 2)|season two]] after a six-year absence as a trained assassin for the [[League of Assassins]], working alongside the [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Arrow]] ([[Stephen Amell]]) to protect Starling City as a masked vigilante, the Canary. When she is murdered in [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]], Laurel takes up her sister's identity, operating as the Black Canary until her own murder in [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]]. In the spin-off show ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', a resurrected Sara Lance resumes heroism under the moniker White Canary as prompted by Laurel prior to her death. Cassidy later portrays Laurel's villainous [[Earth-Two]] metahuman doppelgänger, the Black Siren, on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and also in the [[Arrow (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''Arrow''. Cassidy reprises her role as the Black Siren on [[Arrow (season 6)|season six]] of ''Arrow'' as a series regular,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/arrow-katie-cassidy-cast-black-siren-laurel-lance-doppelganger-the-cw-1202053043/|title=Arrow:Katie Cassidy To Return As Black Siren, Will Be Regular In Season 6|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 27, 2017|access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref> who gradually redeems herself after working alongside Green Arrow, eventually becoming the Black Canary of Earth-2 before that universe is destroyed.

After Harley breaks the legs of a man employed as Sionis' personal driver, he appoints Dinah as the man's replacement, impressed after witnessing her fighting skills. Due to her knowing Cassandra Cain, she is convinced by detective Renee Montoya to be her informant on Sionis' operations, after the detective mentions that her mother, a hero who trained Dinah to be her successor, died in the line of duty. Dinah is determined to do what she can to bring down Sionis and not allow any harm to befall Cassandra, but she becomes a target once Sionis' right-hand man, Victor Zsasz, discovers her dealings with the police. She agrees to help Harley safeguard Cassandra, and uses her Canary Cry to incapacitate several of Sionis' men at once, allowing Harley to chase after him as he abducts Cassandra. After Sionis' defeat, she joins Renee and Helena Bertinelli to form the titular Birds of Prey, funded by Helena's recovered fortune.
