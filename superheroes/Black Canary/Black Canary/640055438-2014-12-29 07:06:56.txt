'''Black Canary''' is a [[superheroine]] appearing in comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. Black Canary was created by the writer-artist team of [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Carmine Infantino]], and debuted in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #86 (August 1947). One of DC's earliest superheroines, the Black Canary has featured on many of the company's flagship team-up titles, including both [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[Justice League of America]]. Since the late 1960s, the character has often been paired with the archer superhero [[Green Arrow]] professionally, romantically and the two were eventually married.

As introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], the Black Canary was the alter-ego of Dinah Drake, and took part in crime-fighting adventures alongside her love interest and eventual husband, [[Gotham City]] detective [[Larry Lance]]. The Black Canary did not possess superpowers, but was a hand-to-hand fighter who frequently posed as a criminal to covertly take down criminal organizations. She featured as a member of the Justice Society of America, the first superhero team to appear in comic books. Later stories, published during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], depicted the Black Canary as a world-class martial artist with a superpower &mdash; the "Canary Cry" &mdash; a high powered [[sonic weapon|sonic scream]] that could shatter objects and incapacitate enemies. DC Comics later [[retcon|adjusted its continuity]] to explain that Black Canary was in fact two characters, mother and daughter Dinah Drake and Dinah Laurel Lance, with stories since the Silver Age primarily focusing on the younger Black Canary and ascribing her superhuman abilities to a [[metahuman|genetic mutation]]. In 2011, DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched its continuity]], and in the process re-established Black Canary as a singular superpowered heroine, Dinah Lance (née Drake).

Black Canary is ranked as the 71st greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.comicvine.com/wizard/4010-2081/forums/wizards-top-200-comic-book-characters-644479/| title= Wizard's top 200 characters | publisher=''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140727061118/http://www.comicvine.com/wizard/4010-2081/forums/wizards-top-200-comic-book-characters-644479/|archivedate= July 27, 2014|deadurl= no}} <!-- External link consists of a forum site summing up the top 200 characters of ''Wizard'' since the real site that contains the list is broken.--></ref> [[IGN]] placed Black Canary as the 81st greatest comic book hero of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/81|title= #81 Black Canary|publisher= [[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130715162500/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/81|archivedate= July 15, 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref>  She was ranked 26th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 24| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

Dinah Drake first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #86 (August 1947), as a supporting character in the "[[Johnny Thunder]]" feature written by [[Robert Kanigher]] and drawn by [[Carmine Infantino]]. Initially, she seemed to be a villain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 55 |quote = Debuting as a supporting character in a six-page Johnny Thunder feature written by Robert Kanigher and penciled by Carmine Infantino, Dinah Drake [the Black Canary] was originally presented as a villain.}}</ref> Johnny Thunder was instantly infatuated with her and was reproached for this by his Thunderbolt.

Black Canary was revived along with the other [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters during the 1960s, and was shown as existing on the parallel world of [[Earth-Two]], home of DC's Golden Age versions of its characters. It is revealed Dinah has married Larry Lance during the 1950s. Dinah takes part in various annual team-ups between the Justice Society and [[Earth-One]]'s [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].<ref name="Markstein" />

In a 1969 JLA-JSA team up against the rogue living star-creature Aquarius, who had banished all the inhabitants of Earth-2 to another dimension except for a JSA group, Larry Lance is killed while saving Dinah's life from an attack of energy. There is a brief funeral for him after which Aquarius is defeated.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]|penciller= [[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]|inker= [[Sid Greene|Greene, Sid]]|story= Where Death Fears to Tread|title= [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]|issue= 74|date= September 1969}}</ref> Out of grief, Canary decides to move to Earth-One to make a fresh start, where she joins the Justice League.

In ''Justice League of America'' #219 and #220 (October and November 1983), it is revealed this Black Canary is actually the daughter of the original Black Canary and her husband.<ref name="Markstein" /> Born in the 1950s, the infant is cursed by the Justice Society foe the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] with the "gift" of a devastating, yet uncontrollable, Canary Cry. Dinah asked her old friend Johnny Thunder to summon his Thunderbolt in hopes of a cure, but it was to no avail. Instead, the Thunderbolt keeps the child in suspended animation (aging all the while) in his native Thunderbolt dimension, until, the Lances hope, a way to cure or control her power can be found. Seeing his friends in pain, the Thunderbolt decides to erase all memory of the child, letting everyone think she has died.

After the battle with Aquarius, Dinah realizes she is dying from the radiation she was exposed to. She discusses possible solutions with the Thunderbolt and Superman of Earth-1. The three arrange to transfer Dinah's memories into the body of her now-adult daughter, still held in suspended animation, while not letting Dinah believe anything unusual has happened to her. This [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] was established to deal with the fact Black Canary had been active since the late 1940s and would therefore have had to been nearly 60 years old by that time.<ref name="Markstein" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy; Conway, Gerry|penciller= [[Chuck Patton|Patton, Chuck]]|inker= [[Romeo Tanghal|Tanghal, Romeo]]|story= Crisis in the Thunderbolt Dimension!|title= Justice League of America|issue= 219|date= October 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= Patton, Chuck|inker= Tanghal, Romeo; [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]]|story= The Doppelganger Gambit|title= Justice League of America|issue= 220|date= November 1983}}</ref>

===Post-Crisis===

Following the [[retroactive continuity]] change in 1983, Black Canary became two distinct characters, mother and daughter, named '''Dinah Drake Lance''' and '''Dinah Laurel Lance'''. The younger Dinah Lance would become the current Black Canary. Some references, notably those in [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson's]] ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' series, would attempt to distinguish the two Canaries further by referring to the first as 'Diana', but more recent accounts have confirmed 'Dinah' as the elder Canary's given name.

A miniseries by writer [[Greg Weisman]] and artist [[Mike Sekowsky]] was planned in 1984. The first issue of the series was pencilled, but the project was [[List of comics that were never published|ultimately shelved]] due to the character being used in writer/artist [[Mike Grell]]'s high profile ''[[Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters]]'' series. Elements from the ill-fated project were used for Weisman's ''[[DC Showcase: Green Arrow]]'' short film.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Wells|first= John|title= Failure to Launch: The Black Canary Miniseries That Never Took Flight |journal= Back Issue!|issue= 46|pages= 45–52|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= February 2011}}</ref>

In post-''Crisis'' continuity, ''Secret Origins'' #50 (August 1990) revealed the first Dinah had been trained by her father, Detective Richard Drake, and intended to follow in his footsteps on the Gotham City police. She was turned down by the force and her disillusioned father died of heart failure shortly thereafter. Dinah was determined to honor his memory and fight crime and corruption by whatever method possible. This led to her debut as a costumed vigilante; she would use her inheritance to open a florist shop as her day job.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last= Beatty|first= Scott|author-link= Scott Beatty| contribution= Black Canary|editor-last= Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 50|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

The elder Dinah married her beau, private eye Larry Lance and maintained her florist business. In a Times Past-style story in ''Birds of Prey'', Lance was an acquaintance of [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], father to [[Barbara Gordon]]. A few years later, their daughter, named Dinah Laurel Lance, was born. In ''Birds of Prey'' #66 (June 2004), which is a flashback to a cold case investigated – but never solved – by the elder Dinah, Laurel was the name of a librarian that Dinah consulted during the case and later befriended.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gail Simone|Simone, Gail]]|penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]|inker= Manley, Mike; Hanna, Scott; Golden, Michael|story= Sensei & Student Part Five Murder & Mystery|title= [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]|issue= 66|date=June 2004}}</ref>

Growing up, Dinah Lance was surrounded by her mother's friends in the disbanded JSA and looked to them as uncles and aunts. Dinah wished to become a costumed hero like her mother before her. Instead of encouraging the younger Dinah, her mother forbade it, thinking the world had grown into a darker, more dangerous place than when she herself fought crime, too dangerous for the younger Dinah to succeed.

The younger Dinah had her own "Canary Cry" – in this version, the result of a [[metagene]] not present in either parent – which unlike the Silver Age Black Canary she is fully able to control.<ref name="dc-ency"/> With this weapon, the younger Dinah next sought out numerous fighters to help her hone her skills, including former JSA member [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]]. Years of training and intense dedication paid off, and Dinah took on her mother's mantle, even though it was against the elder Dinah's wishes at first. She took an active role in the "Silver Age" of heroes, operating, like her mother before her, out of Gotham, while maintaining a day job in the family florist business.

In an early issue of ''Birds of Prey'', writer [[Chuck Dixon]] established that Dinah had married at a very young age briefly before divorcing. Her ex-husband Craig Windrow showed up in a storyline needing her help but actually wanted her to rejoin him after he had stolen funds from the mob.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller= Giordano, Dick|inker= Faucher, Wayne|story= |title= Birds of Prey: Wolves|issue= 1|date= 1997}}</ref> This early marriage and ex-husband were not referred to again until the 2007 ''Black Canary'' [[limited series]].

Shortly into the Justice League's history, she met [[Green Arrow]] (Oliver Queen). While Dinah could not stand him at first, they later became romantically involved despite the difference in their ages. In the Modern Age stories, Oliver is substantially older than Dinah, the reverse of the earlier depiction. Dinah remained a member of the League for roughly six years, including a brief stint with [[Justice League International]] (JLI), of which she was a founding member. It was during that time her mother died due to radiation poisoning she experienced during a battle with the villain Aquarius. Her mother's death affected Dinah deeply, and led her to accept her time in the JLA was over.

She moved to Seattle with Green Arrow after the breakup of the Justice League, and would open her own florist shop, named "Sherwood Florist".

For a brief period in the 1980s coinciding with her membership in the JLI, rather than her traditional skintight black outfit with fishnet stockings she wore a blue and black costume with a bird motif notably looser and less revealing than traditional female superhero garb. This change proved short-lived, and later artists restored her original look.<ref name="Kingman" />

===Birds of Prey===
Around the time Dinah's life began to spiral out of control, the former Batgirl, [[Barbara Gordon]], was [[Batman: The Killing Joke|gravely injured]] by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. Not one to give up easily, Barbara reestablished a crime-fighting career as Oracle, an information broker to the superhero community. After briefly working with the [[Suicide Squad]], Barbara formed her own covert mission team. Barbara concluded that of all the superheroes, Dinah had the most potential and was most in need of direction. Consequently, Oracle asked Black Canary to become an operative.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Dolan, p. 286: "Oracle and Black Canary were finally rewarded with their own ongoing series by scripter Chuck Dixon and penciller Greg Land."</ref>

Black Canary took to this role with great satisfaction. Feeling a new chapter in her life required a few new changes, Dinah decided to abandon the blonde wig, choosing to bleach her hair blonde. Her relationship with Oracle proved somewhat rocky at first, as her impulsive nature clashed with Oracle's tactical planning. As time passed they began to fully understand how to work together as a team and as friends. Later, when Oracle fled from the villain [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], Dinah came to her rescue and Dinah met Barbara Gordon face-to-face.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Dixon, Chuck|penciller= [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]]|inker= Guice, Jackson|story= Part Four: The Deep|title= Birds of Prey|issue= 21|date= September 2000}}</ref> This adventure led to them establishing an even stronger friendship.

''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' produced a recreation of the Earth with a new timeline. It is revealed [[Wonder Woman]] was "once again" a founding member of the Justice League. In ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 51, a back-up feature revealed Black Canary was present at the battle forming the League. The core of the League consisted of Black Canary, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], the [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], [[Aquaman]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and Wonder Woman.

The 2007 Black Canary miniseries established Black Canary and Green Arrow joined the Justice League at a time after it was founded, and they were tested by founding member Batman early on in their membership.

During the publication of the ''Infinite Crisis'' limited series, most [[DC Universe]] comic books skipped forward one year. Following the "[[One Year Later]]" jump, Dinah trades life experiences with [[Lady Shiva]] in hopes of softening the warrior, undertaking a harsh training regimen in an unidentified Vietnamese [[Shanty town|bidonville]], or shantytown. The regimen replicates Shiva's early life and training; Shiva, meanwhile, assumes Dinah's role in Oracle's group and demands her associates call her the "Jade Canary".

During the events of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'', several series included tie-ins and run-ups to the wedding between Dinah and Ollie.<ref>Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 331: "Two of DC's best-loved characters were married in the ''Green Arrow and Black Canary Wedding Special'' - or so it seemed."</ref> ''The Black Canary Wedding Planner'' offers details about the preparations; ''Birds of Prey'' #109 depicts Dinah and Barbara discussing the event and Ollie in detail. ''Countdown: Justice League Wedding Special'', and ''Justice League'' #13 deal with aspects of the wedding, particularly the bachelor and bachelorette parties. A major plot thread throughout these books, which ties in to the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Piper]] and [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] arc of ''Countdown'', is that the [[Injustice League]] plans to attack the wedding.

Eventually, Dinah resigns her position as chairwoman of the JLA after the team's disastrous confrontation with the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]]. After learning that Ollie has started his own Justice League with Hal Jordan, Dinah confronts him when he arrives at the Watchtower to warn her about an impending attack on the world's superheroes.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller= [[Mauro Cascioli|Cascioli, Mauro]]|inker= Cascioli, Mauro|story= The Beginning|title= [[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]|issue= 1|date= September 2009}}</ref> [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]] arrives and attacks the team, severing Red Arrow's arm and defeating Dinah by maneuvering her into the path of an energy bolt fired by [[Mikaal Tomas]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James|penciller= Cascioli, Mauro; [[Scott Clark (artist)|Clark, Scott]]|inker= Cascioli, Mauro; Clark, Scott|story= The Lie|title= Justice League: Cry for Justice|issue= 5|date= January 2010}}</ref> After Prometheus is defeated, he destroys Star City via a teleportation device.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James|penciller= Clark, Scott|inker= Clark, Scott|story= The Game|title= Justice League: Cry for Justice|issue= 6|date= March 2010}}</ref> While searching for survivors, Dinah and Ollie discover the bloodied corpse of Roy's daughter Lian.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James|penciller= Cascioli, Mauro; Clark, Scott; [[Ibraim Roberson|Roberson, Ibraim]]|inker= Cascioli, Mauro; Clark, Scott; Roberson, Ibraim|story= Justice|title= Justice League: Cry for Justice|issue= 7|date= April 2010}}</ref> Dinah is later seen at Roy's hospital bedside alongside [[Donna Troy]], preparing to deliver the grim news about his daughter once he awakens from his coma.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James|penciller= [[Mark Bagley|Bagley, Mark]]|inker= Hunter, Rob; Alquiza, Marlo; Wong, Walden|story= Team History|title= Justice League of America|volume= 2|issue= 41|date= March 2010}}</ref>

During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Dinah travels to [[Coast City]] to fight [[Nekron]]'s army of [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. Nekron reveals that he has the power to control all the heroes who have died and been resurrected, including Ollie.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller= [[Ivan Reis|Reis, Ivan]]|inker= Albert, Oclair; Prado, Joe|story= What is Nekron?|title= [[Blackest Night]]|issue= 5|date= January 2010}}</ref> Alongside Mia and Connor, Dinah tries to fight her husband, who has been transformed into a Black Lantern. Eventually, Ollie is able to regain control of his body long enough to deliberately miss a shot aimed at his wife, which then severs a hose containing liquid nitrogen. Dinah tells Connor to use the hose on Ollie, which he reluctantly does, freezing him solid.

Following Ollie's return to normal, it is discovered that he had secretly murdered Prometheus and left the body to rot in Prometheus' headquarters. After Barry Allen and Hal Jordan confront Ollie and Dinah with this revelation, Ollie goes on the run. Dinah joins Hal and Barry in searching the ruins of Star City for him, and eventually finds the archer scouring the city for one of the men who had worked for Prometheus. He easily defeats all three of them, leaving Dinah trapped in a specialized fluid designed to restrain her.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Krul, J.

During the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', Dinah returns to Gotham with the relaunch of ''Birds of Prey'', with Gail Simone at the helm. In ''Birds of Prey'' #1 (July 2010) she is sent out to save a child, with [[Lady Blackhawk]] for company. Soon afterward, they receive a call from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], and the team - including [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] is reunited. They are immediately confronted by a new villainess calling herself '''White Canary''', who supposedly harbors a deep-seated grudge against Dinah.

===The New 52===
Following the events of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' as seen in [[The New 52]], Dinah is a founding member of the Birds of Prey and recruits the team, starting with her old friend, Ev Crawford (aka Starling). Other members of the Birds of Prey are Katana, and Poison Ivy.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
The original Black Canary superpowers, preferring physical skill over inborn abilities. During times of extreme stress, Canary has displayed the ability to create sonic vibrations capable of destroying whatever was obstructing her mouth.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Conway, Gerry|penciller= Tanghal, Romeo|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= Gravitational Boom-a-rang|title= [[World's Finest Comics]]|issue= 262|date= April–May 1980}}</ref> Black Canary lost the Cry during the ''Green Arrow'' series. Although she fought crime without it for several years, she regained it after being immersed in a [[Lazarus Pit]] during her time with the ''Birds of Prey''. Following DC's [[The New 52|company-wide reboot in 2011]], in ''Birds of Prey'' #10 (2012), Black Canary glides across a gorge by rebounding on sonic waves. She explains that she has been holding back ever since her husband died. In subsequent issues, she is shown using the Canary Cry to propel herself large distances in the air. In the comic "Injustice: Gods among us" she utilized the cry to overpower Superman.

Dinah Lance is extremely proficient in the various styles of [[martial arts]], and is among the world's best fighters (in ''Birds of Prey'' #125, Oracle suggests that Dinah could outfight even [[Batman]]). Moreover, Dinah possesses uncanny reflexes, on many occasions showing the ability to catch or destroy arrows in flight. Dinah is an expert motorcycle rider.

==Other versions==

===JLA: The Nail===

===Kingdom Come===
In the DC [[Elseworlds]] comic ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Black Canary sides with Batman and acts as one of his generals together with her husband Green Arrow (Oliver Queen).

Her costume is actually just a uniform she wore for her job. She is offended by the lewd flirtation of the bar's male patrons (one of which looks exactly like Oliver Queen/Green Arrow). Deciding that she has finally had enough, Black Canary beats up all the male patrons in the bar. When her boss asks her what got into her, she simply replies "Batman," assaults him, and then leaves the scene on a motorcycle stolen from one of the men she has just battered. She later shows up at the docks to bust up a meeting between some gangsters. She takes some out but the men outnumber her and trap her behind some crates. Batman sees her and decides to help her out. He lights a [[molotov cocktail]] and sets the gangsters on fire. Black Canary thanks him for saving her and then the two have sex. After that, Batman gives her a lift home in the Batmobile. Later, she goes back to the bar where all the men lay on the floor unconscious. She lights the money she stole on fire and tosses it, setting the whole place on fire. This version of Black Canary is an [[immigrant]] from [[County Monaghan]], Ireland. In this continuity, Black Canary wears a mask, as the Golden Age version did briefly.

===The Dark Knight Strikes Again===
In ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' a Black Canary is a member of the pop music trio "The Superchix". She is depicted as a [[dumb blonde]] of unspecified age. She is a copycat of the original. Miller claims these stories are both in his so-called "Dark Knight Universe".

She will be written in her late teens as the daughter of a former cop who lives with her parents in Florist Shop in Gotham City's East End. Her parents hold high hopes for her and consider her above most other teenagers. She is respectful to them, but is secretly inspired and enamored by the adventures of Doc Savage and protects her neighborhood. This version of Dinah Drake wears a mini-skirt, boots, fishnets, a black leather jacket, and makeup reminiscent of a bird around her eyes. She is either of Korean, Indian, or Middle Eastern descent.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2009/11/09/how-about-some-more-rags-morales%25e2%2580%2599-sketches-from-first-wave|title= How about some more Rags Morales’ sketches from ''First Wave''?|date= November 9, 2009|publisher= DC Comics|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6RNLchYj8|archivedate= July 27, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref>

==In other media==
{{Main|Black Canary in other media}}
Though not of the same profile as DC's flagship characters [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]], Black Canary has appeared extensively in live action and animated adaptations of DC properties over the years, as well as in video games based on the comic books.

===Live action===
*<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:BlackCanaryLiveAction.PNG|230px|right|<center>'''Faces of Canary'''<br><small>''(Clockwise from middle left: Wesley, Skarsten, Loughlin, Huffman, Kingston, Lotz, Lotz, Cassidy)''</small></center>|thumb]] -->Her first live action depiction was in 1979 when Danulta Wesley portrayed the character in both of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' specials.

*The character was adapted again for the short-lived 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', an adaptation of the ''Birds of Prey'' comic book. In a fairly loose adaptation of the comic book, the show reinvented Dinah Lance as Dinah Redmond ([[Rachel Skarsten]]), a teenage runaway with psychic abilities. It later introduced her mother Carolyn Lance ([[Lori Loughlin]]) in one episode, depicting her more traditionally as a superheroine known as Black Canary possessed of a supersonic Canary Cry.

*In 2008, the television series ''[[Smallville]]'', which depicts the adventures of a young Superman and features Green Arrow as a main character, introduced the Black Canary ([[Alaina Huffman]]) as an assassin who is recruited to the Green Arrow's [[Justice League in other media#Live action|team of superheroes]]. She went on to appear in a number of episodes, including several season premieres and finales.

*The 2012 Green Arrow television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' features [[Katie Cassidy]] as the character Dinah Laurel Lance, an attorney who is the ex-girlfriend of Oliver Queen. Her mother ([[Alex Kingston]]) is also named Dinah Lance. In the [[Arrow (season 2)|second season]], Laurel's sister, Sara Lance ([[Caity Lotz]]){{#tag:ref|[[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]] portrays Sara in the series' pilot and in still photography in season one, before the casting of Lotz.|group=Note|name=note1}} appears in Starling City as the Canary.  Oliver had been cheating on Laurel with Sara aboard the ''Queen's Gambit'' when it capsized and stranded him on the island Lian Yu. He later discovers she was alive during his time on the island, having been saved by [[Professor Ivo]] ([[Dylan Neal]]). After being separated from Oliver again during his battle with [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]] ([[Manu Bennett]]), she is found by [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] ([[Katrina Law]]) and is trained in combat by the [[League of Assassins]] at [[Nanda Parbat]]. Despite pledging her allegiance to Nyssa's father and the League's leader, [[Ra's al Ghul]] ([[Matthew Nable]]), Sara is never acknowledged officially as a member of the League. She eventually escapes and goes into hiding from Ra's. She has a sidekick named [[Sin (DC Comics)|Sin]] ([[Bex Taylor-Klaus]]) and uses a hand-held sonic boom device and a pair of batons that combine into a [[Bō|bō staff]]. Sara departs Starling City after helping Oliver defeats Slade, handing her Canary jacket to her sister, Laurel.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvline.com/2014/05/20/arrow-season-3-malcolm-merlyn-laurel-black-canary/|title= ''Arrow'' Season 3 Burning Questions Answered: The Next Big Bad, a New Canary and More|first= Matt|last= Webb Mitovich|date= May 20, 2014|publisher= [[TVLine]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6RNM7I6L8|archivedate= July 27, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref> Sara later returns in the third season premiere to track [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Malcolm Merlyn]] ([[John Barrowman]]) for the League and helping Oliver stop a bomb threat.  She is then shot with three arrows by Oliver's maternal half-sister and Merlyn's illegitimate daughter Thea (who is under her father's brainwashing at the time), falls off the roof and dies in Laurel's arms.  Grief-stricken and vengeful, Laurel seeks former boxer/vigilante [[Wildcat (comics)#Theodore .E2.80.9CTed.E2.80.9D Grant|Ted Grant's]] (J.R. Ramirez) help with combat training, determined to takeover the Canary mantle in hopes of avenging her sister's murder in the guise. After Laurel informs her mother about Sara's murder, Dinah shares her eldest daughter's thirst for revenge and urges Laurel to take it when the time comes.

===Animation===
Animated depictions of the character have largely been faithful to the source material. The Dinah Drake version of the character is the basis of a character who appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Legends" (2002), voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].

The Dinah Laurel Lance version (voiced by [[Morena Baccarin]]) appears with increasing prominence in the show's sequel ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004&ndash;2006), in which she is a member of the Justice League. She develops a romantic relationship with Green Arrow ([[Kin Shriner]]) and a loose, begrudging partnership with the Huntress ([[Amy Acker]]) over the course of the series.

The show ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' (2008&ndash;2011) featured Black Canary (voice of [[Grey DeLisle]]) in numerous episodes, as well as the Golden Age Black Canary. In one episode she forms the Bird of Prey alongside Catwoman ([[Nika Futterman]]) and Huntress ([[Tara Strong]]), and the trio perform a musical number.

The animated series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (2010&ndash;2013) features Black Canary, voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]], as a member of the Justice League and the combat trainer for the show's team of teenage superheroes. She is in a relationship with Green Arrow and has close links to his family of related superheroes. Both classic and modern age versions of the character are featured in several [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]].

[[Kari Wahlgren]] voices the character in the Green Arrow series in the ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kariwahlgren.net/resume_vo.html|title=Resume – Kari Wahlgren - Voiceover |publisher= KariWahlgren.net (Kari Wahlgren official site)|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141105030717/http://www.kariwahlgren.net/resume_vo.html|archivedate= November 5, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Twitter status|user= Jeff_Mednikow|statusid= 460850557242966016|title= @tinsmm @KariWahlgren https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDD3FJSUX4U …  Check it out, now on youtube from Cartoon Network!|name= Jeff Mednikow|date= April 28, 2014|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141127023243/https://twitter.com/Jeff_Mednikow/status/460850557242966016|archivedate= November 26, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= September 15, 2014}} See also followup tweets in the thread confirming her role in the series.</ref><!-- http://twitter.com/Jeff_Mednikow/status/460850557242966016 -->
