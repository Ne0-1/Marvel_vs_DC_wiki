'''Black Canary''' is a female [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]].  

The Black Canary was originally a non-superpowered crimefighter who relied on martial arts and detective skills to combat crime.  Later the character was given a superhuman sonic "Canary Cry" that could be used to shatter objects or disable opponents.  She has often been referred to as "The Blonde Bombshell" due to her extraordinary beauty and sex appeal, which have been accentuated by her trademark fishnet stockings (which have come and gone through the years in various forms via costumes, but which she currently wears).

As a result of ''Justice League of America'' issues #219-20 and the limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the Black Canary was [[retcon|retconned]] into two characters, 'Dinah Drake Lance' and 'Dinah Laurel Lance'. The elder Dinah married her beau, Larry Lance, and when her daughter came of age she took over her mother's costumed identity (against her mother's wishes). Even though the elder Dinah began fighting crime in 1947, it has been established that the younger Dinah has been active for 12 years in the 'DC Comics Universe continuity', which is a fixed timeline DC Comics uses when discussing its modern heroes.

Dinah Drake Lance replaced [[Johnny Thunder]] as a post-World War II member of the [[Justice Society of America]].  Dinah Laurel Lance was a founding member of the post-''Crisis'' [[Justice League]], a member of the [[Gotham City]]-based superhero group [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]], alongside [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] and the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], and was recently an active member of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]].  As of this writing, she holds reserve status in both the JLA and the JSA.

She had a long running romance with Oliver Queen AKA The [[Green Arrow]]. Over time though, with numerous problems, it finally ended.

A modified version of Dinah Laurel Lance, ''Carolyn Lance aka The Black Canary'' (played by [[Lori Loughlin]]) made an appearance on the [[The WB|WB]] [[television series]] ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' as the estranged mother of regular character Dinah Redmond.
