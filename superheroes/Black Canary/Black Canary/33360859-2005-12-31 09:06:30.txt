'''Black Canary''' is a female [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]].  

The Black Canary was originally a non-superpowered crimefighter who relied on martial arts and detective skills to combat crime.  Later the character was given a superhuman sonic scream dubbed the 'Canary Cry' that could be used to shatter objects or disable opponents.  She has often been referred to as 'The Blonde Bombshell' due to her extraordinary beauty and sex appeal, which have been accentuated by her trademark fishnet stockings (which she has worn off and on since her inception).
==Golden and Silver Age history==

Black Canary first appeared in ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash Comics]]'' #86 in [[1947]], as a character who initially interacted with (and eventually replaced in the comic) [[Johnny Thunder]]. Initially, she appeared to be a villainess; Johnny was instantly infatuated with her and was reproached for this by his Thunderbolt. In her secret identity, Dinah Drake was a black-haired [[florist]] whose romantic interest was Larry Lance. Her costume covered her hair with a blonde wig besides her trademark mesh stockings (It could be suggested that what she wore was not really fishnets but rather blue leggings with a black fishnet pattern), pirate boots, bathing-suit like garment, and her jacket which is never buttoned. Initially, she also wore a variant of a domino mask.  Black Canary soon joined the [[Justice Society of America]] as a heroine, not as a mole, and ceased being published along with the rest of the team by the early 1950s.

Black Canary was revived along with the other [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] characters during the 1960s, and was shown as existing on the parallel world of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the home of DC's Golden Age versions of its characters). It was also revealed that Dinah had married Larry Lance sometime during the 1950s. Dinah also took part in various annual teamups between the Justice Society and [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One's]] [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

In a [[1969]] JLA-JSA teamup against the rogue living star-creature Aquarius, Larry Lance was killed while trying to save Dinah's life from an attack. Out of grief, Black Canary decided to leave Earth-Two and move to Earth-One to create a fresh start. Sometime afterwards, she soon met, and began dating, superhero [[Green Arrow]], and discovered that she had somehow gained a powerful supersonic scream, eventually named the Canary Cry. The Black Canary also joined the Justice League, and made regular appearances with the team during the 1970s and into the 1980s. 

In ''Justice League of America'' #219 and #220, it was revealed (via a [[retcon]]) that Black Canary was actually the daughter of an original Black Canary. Sometime during the 1950s, Dinah and her husband Larry had had a child, but the infant's canary cry (given to it by the Justice Society foe the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]]) proved uncontrollable and devastating, and thus Dinah asked her old friend Johnny Thunder to summon his Thunderbolt, who kept the child in suspended animation (but aging all the while) in his native Thunderbolt dimension. The Thunderbolt, without their knowledge, also erased all knowledge from the three that he had done this, letting them think that the child had died somehow, figuring that this would be for the best. After the battle with Aquarius, Dinah realized she was dying from the radiation she was exposed to during the battle with the star creature, and [[Superman]], after discussing possible solutions with the Thunderbolt, arranged a solution---to transfer Dinah's consciousness into the body of her now-adult daughter still held in suspended animation, while not letting Dinah believe anything unusual had happened to her. This retcon was written to deal with the fact that Dinah was originally much older than her romantic counterpart, Green Arrow, as well as the rest of the Justice League characters.

==Modern Age history==
As an adjustment to the retcon revealed in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #219-220, and as a result of the [[1985]] miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Black Canary post-Crisis became two completely separate characters, '''Dinah Drake Lance''' and '''Dinah Laurel Lance'''. In post-Crisis continuity, the elder Dinah married her beau, Larry Lance, and when her daughter came of age she took over her mother's costumed identity (against her mother's wishes). Even though the elder Dinah began fighting crime in 1947, it has been established that the younger Dinah has been active for 12 years in the modern-day DC Universe timeline, a fixed timeline DC Comics uses when discussing its modern heroes.

She had a four issue mini-series entitled Black Canary: New Wings in 1991, and a 12 issue series in 1993.

Dinah Laurel Lance was a founding member of the post-''Crisis'' Justice League (retroactively replacing [[Wonder Woman]] in all Silver Age appearances with the team), a position she took at the age of 19. Shortly into the League's history she met [[Green Arrow]] (Oliver Queen). While Dinah couldn't stand him at first, they quickly became involved (despite him being roughly 35 years old when she was about 20). Dinah remained part of the League for about five or six years before it was dissolved by [[Aquaman]] and reformed in Detroit. During that time, her mother died as a result of the radiation from the JLA and JSA's battle with Aquarius, which affected her deeply.

She moved to Seattle with Green Arrow after the breakup of the Justice League, where at one point she was kidnapped and tortured, losing her Canary Cry superpower as well as her ability to have children. Nonetheless, she continued fighting crime, keeping a fairly active presence as a crimefighter. Eventually, she and Green Arrow parted ways due to a romantic indiscretion on Green Arrow's part. Some time afterwards,  Dinah felt she was at a low point in her life and lacked focus. This eventually led to her meeting [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] (Barbara Gordon), and a pairing that became known unofficially as the "[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]." Currently the two are the closest of friends.   

On one adventure, the Black Canary was seriously wounded and then was immersed in a [[Lazarus Pit]]. This revitalized her metahuman power, restoring her Canary Cry as well as her ability to have children that had been impaired several years earlier. 

Recently the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] has joined the ranks of the Birds of Prey, as well as [[Lady Blackhawk|Zinda Blake]], the original Lady [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk]]. 

She was highly honored to be a member of the newly reformed [[Justice Society of America|JSA]].  She is one of the few DC characters to hold reserve status in both the JLA and the JSA.

In [[1979]], the character appeared in two television specials ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'', where she was portrayed by [[Danuta Wesley]]. 

A modified version of Dinah Laurel Lance, named ''Carolyn Lance'' made an appearance on the [[2002]] [[The WB|WB]] [[television series]] ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'', where she was played by played by [[Lori Loughlin]]. The character was depicted as a former member of the Birds of Prey team and the mother of Dinah Redmond Lance, a teenager with mental abilities who lives with Oracle/Barbara Gordon. This version of Black Canary appears to be killed off at the end of the episode, though the writers left her fate ambiguous in order to allow a possible return later. When ''Birds of Prey'' was first announced, the producers indicated that the teenaged Dinah Redmond Lance would be a retconned Black Canary, but outcry from fans led to the character being modified.

On the [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Black Canary is voiced by [[Morena Baccarin]]. She is first seen in a small cameo at the end of "Initiation", where her fetching looks are enough to convince [[Green Arrow]] to stay in the League. Later, in "The Cat and the Canary", we are truly introduced to her as a fearsome physical fighter (as well as sporting her sonic cry). She is vexed because her old mentor, [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], has been obsessively engaging in underground fighting tournaments, and she convinces Arrow to help her find him and get him out of there. The two start a relationship after that as seen in "Double Date", thereby paying homage to their famed romance in the comics.

==Awards==
The 1991 mini-series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Limited Series in 1991.
