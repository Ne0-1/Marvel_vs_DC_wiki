'''Aquagirl''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s featured as [[superheroine]]s in the comic books and other media produced by [[DC Comics]].

== Early incarnations ==

=== Lisa Morel ===
'''Lisa Morel''' is introduced in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #266 (November 1959) as one of several violet-eyed Atlantean children born unable to adapt to the watery world. They had been sent to the surface in waterproof lifeboats so they might survive among land-dwellers, and Lisa had been adopted by the scientist Dr. Hugo Morel and his wife. With Aquaman in danger, Lisa's water-breathing and [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers awaken; she makes herself a costume identical to Aquaman's, takes on the name "Aquagirl" and fights alongside him. However, her new-found powers are short-lived, and she loses them permanently. This is the first and last appearance of the character.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15369#4 "Aquaman Meets Aquagirl!" ''Adventure Comics'' #266] (November 1959).

=== Selena ===
'''Selena''' is a young Poseidonis teenager who temporarily teams up with Aquaman under the name "Aqua-Girl" in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #133 (May 1963) to make her former boyfriend jealous; she succeeds, making Aqualad jealous of her temporary status as Aquaman's sidekick as well. This is the first and last appearance of the character.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=17657#4 "Aquaman's New Partner, Aquagirl." ''World's Finest Comics'' #133] (May 1963).

== Tula ==
'''Tula''' is introduced in ''[[Aquaman]]'' Vol. 1 #33 (May–June 1967).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=20950 "Aqualad's Deep-Six Chick!" ''Aquaman'' #33] (May–June 1967).

Given the title Princess of Poseidonis, Tula is schooled in Atlantean traditions, and never leaves the royal palace until she meets [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] (Garth) at age 15 in this issue.<ref name="DC Encyc">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link =  | contribution = Anthro | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 17 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Tula sometimes helps Aqualad with missions during his time with the original [[Teen Titans]], using the name Aquagirl.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=23885 "Some Call It Noise." ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 1) #30] (November–December 1970). The Grand Comics Database. Retrieved on March 14, 2009.</ref> When [[Aquaman]] leaves his throne to search for his then-missing wife [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], Narkran takes over Atlantis as a dictator. His reign falls only when Tula leads a rebellion against him. Tula and Garth resume their romance when he returns to Atlantis, and they later appear in the 1980s revival series ''New Teen Titans'' to aid the Titans in bringing down the [[H.I.V.E.]].

===Death===
During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[limited series]] (1985–1986), Aquagirl is killed by the villain [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] when she drowns in water that he has poisoned.

Years later, in the ''Tempest'' mini-series, a woman claiming to be Tula enters Garth's life. In truth, it is a [[doppelgänger|doppelganger]] created by the villainous [[Slizzath]] as part of an elaborate plan to siphon Garth's mystical energies for his own dark purposes. Garth sees through the ruse and is able to defeat Slizzath, and finally gain a sense of closure about Tula's death. It is also at this time that Garth adopted a new identity as "Tempest."

Most recently, Tula reappears in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) issues 30 and 31. Aquagirl is brought back to life by [[Brother Blood]] &mdash; along with [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]], and [[Kole]] &mdash; to fight against the Titans. After being freed by [[Beast Boy]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. [[Kid Eternity]] is able to lay the deceased Titans back to rest.

Tula has a statue in the "Hall of Fallen Titans" at Titans Tower, alongside the original Hawk and Dove, Kole, and others. A year later, Tula is channeled by Kid Eternity when the Titans face Blood again. She angrily pummels the villain, claiming to be enraged about being resurrected as his puppet. She later is then returned to the afterlife after her time limit in Eternity's body is reached.

===''Blackest Night''===
In the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' miniseries, Tula, Aquaman, and [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]] appear as a group of reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] who attack Tempest and [[Mera (comics)|Mera]]. Tula and Dolphin argue over Tempest, at the same time mocking him for not saving them. Sensing Garth's hope that she could fight what had been done to her to, Tula tore out his heart, killing him and bringing about his reanimation as a Black Lantern.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #2 (August 2009)</ref> Tula later appears to battle the Titans. However, her body is soon destroyed by a burst of white light emanating from [[Hawk and Dove|Dawn Granger]].<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #3 (October 2009)</ref>

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] rebooted continuity, Tula is first seen as a shadowing female Atlantean reporting to the current King of Atlantis, Orm aka Ocean Master, about the attacks made to the boy born with purple eyes, who is believed by some to bring the end of Atlantis. Ocean Master ordered Garth to be returned to his mother unharmed.<ref>''Aquaman'' (vol. 5) #14 (November 2012)</ref> She later battles [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] during Atlantis' invasion of the United States,<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #16 (January 2013)</ref> and later when Aquaman becomes the king of Atlantis, she's seen reporting to him and according to the conversation she had with him, it is revealed that she and Orm share the same father, meaning that Orm is her half-brother.<ref>''Aquaman'' (vol. 5) #18 (March 2013)</ref>

== Lorena Marquez ==
{{main|Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)}}
'''Lorena Marquez''' is on a date at the [[San Diego Zoo]] when an earthquake shakes [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands &mdash; including Lorena's entire family. She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health as she discovers that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean. The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, as well as Anton Geist, the scientist responsible for the catastrophe. Lorena and Aquaman have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as "[[Sub Diego]]." When [[Ocean Master]] switches lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumes the identity of Aquagirl, adopting an aquatic costume.

== Other versions==
In the 1996 [[limited series]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Aquagirl is Tula II, the estranged teenage daughter of Garth (formerly Aqualad, now Aquaman).<ref>from: {{cite web|url=http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/kingdom.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129233853/http://www.titanstower.com:80/source/whoswho/kingdom.html |archivedate=2008-01-29 |df= }}</ref> She is named Tula after her father's late girlfriend, and is part of a team consisting of the other original Titans' children who end up taking [[Batman]]'s side in the story's key conflict. In her appearances, Tula seemingly demonstrates a partial shapeshifting ability, changing parts of her body to resemble those of sea creatures. She is last seen battling Donna Troy during the climatic battle at the superhuman Gulag and is possibly killed by the nuclear explosion that ends the conflict

This Tula's mother is possibly [[Deep Blue (comics)|Deep Blue]], described in annotations for the series as "Mizuko Perkins," daughter of [[Tsunami (DC Comics)|Tsunami]] and [[Neptune Perkins]]. In standard DC Comics continuity, Deep Blue is Aquaman's half-sister Debbie, the daughter of Tsunami and [[Atlan (DC Comics)|Atlan]], raised by Tsunami and Neptune Perkins.

==In other media==

===Television===
* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Aquagirl is '''Mareena''', a member of the future Justice League and the daughter of Aquaman. The character was created specifically for the ''Batman Beyond'' episodes "The Call: Part 1" (November 11, 2000) and "The Call: Part 2" (November 18, 2000), in which [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] meets the "Justice League Unlimited," a future version of the [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]. Aquagirl was voiced by [[Jodi Benson]], the actress who provided the voice of [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. When Batman is going over her file on the computer, it is shown that she is the daughter of Aquaman, with powers including control over water. She later reappears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series (which showcases the present-day lineup of the ''JLU'') in "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]". She has very distinctive [[platinum blond]]e hair; it is always wet and slicked evenly back. Her costume varies; she is usually portrayed as wearing a one-piece swimsuit of various colors with bare arms and legs and also wears fingerless gloves.
* In Season 2 of ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', [[Mandy Moore]] portrays Aquagirl in the Aquaman movie that exists in the ''Entourage'' fictional universe. The storyline has Moore, who was playing herself as the ex-girlfriend of character Vince, about to be dropped from the project due to the turmoil of their personal relationship. Mandy is not removed from the movie however, and Vince and Mandy re-kindle their former romance. Following this, Mandy breaks Vince's heart again, stating that she still loves her former fiancé, Chris. Vince decides to continue working on the movie with Mandy still attached. It then becomes the highest-grossing movie opening of all time.
[[Image:AquagirlAnimated.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Tula as she appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''.]]
* Tula (though she is never referred to as Aquagirl in the first season) appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Downtime" voiced by [[Cree Summer]]. She is portrayed as the childhood friend of [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Kaldur'ahm]] who ultimately entered into a relationship with his friend Garth after Kaldur left Atlantis to become Aquaman's sidekick. Unlike the comics, the Tula in ''Young Justice'' is shown to possess magical abilities that help her manipulate water. When Kaldur returns to Poseidonis for a dinner with the royal family, he invites Tula as his guest unaware that she has left him for his best friend. She eventually tells him about this, and the two reconcile during an attack on the city led by [[Black Manta]], with Kaldur departing on friendly terms when he eventually returns to the surface world. Tula and Garth make a cameo appearance in "Failsafe", working alongside [[Red Arrow (comics)|Red Arrow]], [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]] and [[Zatanna]] in a training simulation. In the episode "Alienated" set five years later, Tula's death is mentioned as one of the reasons Aqualad (who is undercover about the Light's [[Reach (comics)|partner]]) has apparently turned on his former team. This is the first instance of Tula being referenced as Aquagirl in the series. In the episode "Satifaction", her statue is among the statues fallen of heroes located in the grotto of Mount Justice. In the episode "The Fix", Tula appears as a psychic projection when [[Miss Martian]] and [[Artemis Crock]] enter Aqualad's mind.

===Film===
* Tula makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' as a member of [[Aquaman]]'s army in the altered timeline. She is killed in the final battle with the Amazons.

===Video Games===
* Tula, as Aquagirl, appears in ''[[Young Justice: Legacy]]'', with [[Cree Summer]] reprising the role. She serves as the coordinator of the Team, providing information on [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light's]] attempts to steal the pieces of an ancient statue, and keeping the pieces safe. Near the end of the game, [[Klarion the Witch Boy|Klarion]] disguised as [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] tricks her into giving him the pieces of the statue, and kidnaps her, intending to use her magic to revive [[Tiamat]] in [[Bialya]]. The Team arrives to free Tula and defeat Klarion and [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], but is too late to stop Tiamat's revival. When Tiamat proves too powerful to kill, a weakened Tula offers to use her remaining magic to defeat and imprison Tiamat again, sacrificing herself just like [[Marduk]] did in ancient times. Tula succeeds, but is killed by falling debris. Tempest grieves her death, and [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Aqualad]] quits the Team, leading up to the events in the second season of the show.
