'''Tula''' is introduced in ''[[Aquaman]]'' Vol. 1 #33 (May–June 1967).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=20950 "Aqualad's Deep-Six Chick!" ''Aquaman'' #33] (May–June 1967). The Grand Comics Database. Retrieved on December 4, 2008.</ref> After losing her parents soon after her birth, she had been found and adopted by one of the royal families of [[Atlantis]]. Given the title Princess of Poseidonis, Tula is schooled in Atlantean traditions, and never leaves the royal palace until she meets [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] (Garth) at age 15 in this issue.<ref name="DC Encyc">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger  | first = Robert | author-link =   | contribution = Anthro | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 17 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Tula sometimes helps Aqualad with missions during his time with the original [[Teen Titans]], using the name Aquagirl.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=23885 "Some Call It Noise." ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 1) #30] (November–December 1970). The Grand Comics Database. Retrieved on March 14, 2009.</ref> When [[Aquaman]] leaves his throne to search for his then-missing wife [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], Narkran takes over Atlantis as a dictator. His reign falls only when Tula leads a rebellion against him. Tula and Garth resume their romance when he returns to Atlantis, and they later appear in the 1980s revival series ''New Teen Titans'' to aid the Titans in bringing down the [[H.I.V.E.]].

===Death===
During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[limited series]] (1985–1986), Aquagirl is killed by the villain [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] when she drowns in water that he has poisoned.

Years later, in the ''Tempest'' mini-series, a woman claiming to be Tula enters Garth's life. In truth, it is a [[doppelgänger|doppelganger]] created by the villainous Slizzath as part of an elaborate plan to siphon Garth's mystical energies for his own dark purposes. Garth sees through the ruse and is able to defeat Slizzath, and finally gain a sense of closure about Tula's death. It is also at this time that Garth adopted a new identity as "Tempest."

Most recently, Tula reappears in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) issues 30 and 31. Aquagirl is brought back to life by [[Brother Blood]] &mdash; along with [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]], and [[Kole]] &mdash; to fight against the Titans. After being freed by [[Beast Boy]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], [[Kid Eternity]] is able to lay the deceased Titans back to rest.

Tula has a statue in the "Hall of Fallen Titans" at Titans Tower, alongside the original Hawk and Dove, Kole, and others. A year later, Tula is channeled by Kid Eternity when the Titans face Blood again. She angrily pummels the villain, claiming to be enraged about being resurrected as his puppet. She later is then returned to the afterlife after her time limit in Eternity's body is reached.

===''Blackest Night''===
In the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' miniseries, Tula, Aquaman, and [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]] appear as a group of reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] who attack Tempest and [[Mera (comics)|Mera]]. Tula and Dolphin argue over Tempest, at the same time mocking him for not saving them. Sensing Garth's hope that she could fight what had been done to her to, Tula tore out his heart, killing him and bringing about his reanimation as a Black Lantern.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #2 (August 2009)</ref> Tula later appears to battle the Titans. However, her body is soon destroyed by a burst of white light emanating from [[Hawk and Dove|Dawn Granger]].<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #3 (October 2009)</ref>

== Lorena Marquez ==
{{main|Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)}}
'''Lorena Marquez''' is on a date at the [[San Diego Zoo]] when an earthquake shakes [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands &mdash; including Lorena's entire family. She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health as she discovers that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean. The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, as well as Anton Geist, the scientist responsible for the catastrophe. Lorena and Aquaman have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as "[[Sub Diego]]." When [[Ocean Master]] switches lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumes the identity of Aquagirl, adopting an aquatic costume.

== Early incarnations ==
=== Lisa Morel ===
'''Lisa Morel''' is introduced in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' Volume 1 #266 (November 1959) as one of several violet-eyed Atlantean children born unable to adapt to the watery world. They had been sent to the surface in waterproof lifeboats so they might survive among land-dwellers, and Lisa had been adopted by the scientist Dr. Hugo Morel and his wife. With Aquaman in danger, Lisa's water-breathing and [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers awaken; she makes herself a costume identical to Aquaman's, takes on the name "Aquagirl" and fights alongside him. However, her newfound powers are short-lived, and she loses them permanently. This is the first and last appearance of the character.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15369#4 "Aquaman Meets Aquagirl!" ''Adventure Comics'' #266] (November 1959).

=== Selena ===

This is the first and last appearance of the character.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=17657#4 "Aquaman's New Partner, Aquagirl." ''World's Finest Comics'' #133] (May 1963).

== Other versions==
In the 1996 [[limited series]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Aquagirl is Tula II, the estranged teenage daughter of Garth (formerly Aqualad, now Aquaman).<ref>from: http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/kingdom.html</ref> She is named Tula after her father's late girlfriend, and is part of a team consisting of the other original Titans' children who end up taking [[Batman]]'s side in the story's key conflict. In her appearances, Tula seemingly demonstrates a partial shapeshifting ability, changing parts of her body to resemble those of sea creatures. 

This Tula's mother is possibly [[Deep Blue (comics)|Deep Blue]], described in annotations for the series as "Mizuko Perkins," daughter of [[Tsunami (DC Comics)|Tsunami]] and [[Neptune Perkins]]. In standard DC Comics continuity, Deep Blue is Aquaman's half-sister Debbie, the daughter of Tsunami and [[Atlan (DC Comics)|Atlan]], raised by Tsunami and Neptune Perkins.

==In other media==
* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Aquagirl is '''Marina''', a member of the future Justice League and the daughter of Aquaman.
