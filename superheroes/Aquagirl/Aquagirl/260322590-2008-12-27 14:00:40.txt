== Lisa Morel ==
'''Lisa Morel''' is introduced in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' Volume 1 #266 (November 1959) as one of several violet-eyed [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] children born unable to adapt to the watery world. They had been sent to the surface in waterproof lifeboats so they might survive among land-dwellers, and Lisa had been adopted by the scientist Dr. Hugo Morel and his wife. With [[Aquaman]] in danger, Lisa's water-breathing and [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers awaken; she makes herself a costume identical to Aquaman's, takes on the name "Aquagirl" and fights alongside him. However, her newfound powers are short-lived, and she loses them permanently.  This is the first and last appearance of the character.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15369#4 "Aquaman Meets Aquagirl!" ''Adventure Comics'' #266] (November 1959).

'''Tula''' is introduced in ''[[Aquaman]]'' Vol. 1 #33 (May-June 1967).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=20950 "Aqualad's Deep-Six Chick!" ''[[Aquaman]]'' #33] (May-June 1967).

Given the title Princess of Poseidonis, Tula is schooled in Atlantean traditions, and never leaves the royal palace until she meets Aqualad (Garth) at age 15 in this issue.<ref name="DC Encyc">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger  | first = Robert | author-link =   | contribution = Anthro | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 17 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Tula sometimes helps Aqualad with missions during his time with the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]; eventually, she also becomes an honorary member, taking the name Aquagirl. When Aquaman leaves his throne to search for his then-missing wife [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], Narkran takes over Atlantis as a dictator.  His reign falls only when Tula leads a rebellion against him. Tula and Garth, resume their romance when he returns to Atlantis, and they later aid the Titans in bringing down the [[H.I.V.E.]] once and for all. 

=== Death and return ===
During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[limited series]] (1985-1986), Aquagirl is killed by the villain [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] when she drowns in water that he has poisoned.

Years later, in the ''Tempest'' mini-series, a woman claiming to be Tula enters Garth's life. In truth, it is a [[doppelg√§nger|doppelganger]] created by the villainous Slizzath as part of an elaborate plan to siphon Garth's mystical energies for his own dark purposes. Garth sees through the ruse and is able to defeat Slizzath, and finally gain a sense of closure about Tula's death. It is also at this time that Garth adopted a new identity as "Tempest."

Most recently, Tula reappears in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) issues 30 and 31. Aquagirl is brought back to life by [[Brother Blood]] - along with [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]], and [[Kole]] - to fight against the Titans. After being freed by [[Beast Boy]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], [[Kid Eternity]] is able to lay the deceased Titans back to rest.

Tula has a statue in the "Hall of Fallen Titans" at Titans Tower, alongside the original Hawk and Dove, Kole, and others.

'''Lorena Marquez''' is on a date at the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] Zoo when an earthquake shakes the city and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands, including Lorena's entire family. She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health, while discovering that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean.

The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, and [[Anton Geist]] (the scientist responsible for the catastrophe). They have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as '[[Sub Diego]]'. When [[Ocean Master]] switches lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumes the identity of Aquagirl, adopting an aquatic costume, and she is also always barefoot, from this point in time, onward. After Aquaman exposes Ocean Master's scheme, Lorena keeps her Aquagirl costume and identity, and the two carry on protecting 'Sub Diego'.

In the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' timeline, Lorena, as Aquawoman, is a member of the Titans. It is revealed that she has developed telepathic powers which she had used to kill (or paralyze) former Titan member Garth.

Aquagirl is a member of the Teen Titans during the events of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]''. She assists [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] in launching an attack on Lexcorp when [[Natasha Irons|Natasha]] is captured by [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]. 

=== One Year Later ===
{{main|One Year Later}}
In ''Teen Titans'' Volume 3 #34 (May 2006), Lorena is shown at [[Titans Tower]] arguing with Hawk. She later resurfaces as supporting character of the new Aquaman, [[Aquaman (Arthur Joseph Curry)|Arthur Joseph Curry]], in ''Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis''. Apparently, as one of the last Sub Diegoans able to breathe water, she is left in the seas, mourning Koryak's death in the rubble of Poseidonis. She then joins Curry, [[Cal Durham]], Tempest, and the new [[Topo (DC Comics)|Topo]] in their voyage to Sub Diego. Aquagirl appears up in ''[[Terror Titans]]'' #1 and is kidnapped (along with a bunch of other Titans) by the Terror Titans. While her teammate [[Molecule (comics)|Molecule]] is slain by the new [[Persuader (comics)#Elise Kimble|Persuader]], Lorena is taken alive, to be mindwiped and forced to fight in the [[Darkseid|Dark Side Club]] at the behest of the [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] Gods on Earth.

== Other versions==
In the 1996 [[limited series]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Aquagirl is Tula II, the estranged teenage daughter of Garth (formerly Aqualad, now Aquaman).<ref>from: http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/kingdom.html</ref> She is named Tula after her father's late girlfriend, and is part of a team consisting of the other original Titans' children who end up taking [[Batman]]'s side in the story's key conflict. In her appearances, Tula seemingly demonstrates a partial shapeshifting ability, changing parts of her body to resemble those of sea creatures. 

Tula's mother is possibly the [[Deep Blue (comics)|Deep Blue]], described in annotations for the series as "Mizuko Perkins," daughter of [[Tsunami (DC Comics)|Tsunami]] and [[Neptune Perkins]]. In standard DC Comics continuity, Deep Blue is Aquaman's half-sister Debbie, the daughter of Tsunami and [[Atlan (DC Comics)|Atlan]], raised by Tsunami and Neptune Perkins.

==Other media==
===Television===
* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Aquagirl is '''Marina''', a member of the future Justice League and the daughter of Aquaman. The character was created specifically for the ''Batman Beyond'' episodes "The Call: Part 1" (November 11, 2000) and "The Call: Part 2" (November 18, 2000), in which [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] meets the "Justice League Unlimited," a future version of the [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]. Aquagirl was voiced by [[Jodi Benson]], the actress who provided the voice of [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. When Batman is going over her file on the computer, it is shown that she is the daughter of Aquaman, with powers including control over water. She later reappears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series (which showcases the present-day lineup of the JLU) in "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]". She has very distinctive [[platinum blond]]e hair; it is always wet and slicked evenly back. Her costume varies; she is usually portrayed as wearing a one-piece swimsuit of various colors with bare arms and legs, and she always goes [[barefoot]].

* Aquagirl has not appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series. However, ''Teen Titans Go!'', the comic series based on the animated series, featured an aquatic superheroine named Gill Girl that could be seen as a combination of Aquagirl and [[Lagoon Boy]].

* In Season 2 of ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'', [[Mandy Moore]] portrays Aquagirl in the Aquaman movie that exists in the ''Entourage'' fictional universe. The storyline has Moore, who was playing herself as the character Vince's ex-girlfriend, get ultimately dropped from the project due to the turmoil involved in their personal relationship. It is not known what actress, "real" or fictional, replaced Moore on that movie within the TV show's continuity.
