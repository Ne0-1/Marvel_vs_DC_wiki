'''Aquagirl''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s who were [[superhero]]s from [[DC Comics]]. Although there have been many different characters bearing the name, the most recognizable one is [[Aqualad]]'s Atlantean girlfriend. 

==Lisa Morel/Aquagirl I==
First Appearance: Adventure Comics Vol. 1 #266, November 1959

'''Lisa Morel''' was among several violet-eyed Atlantean children that were born unable to adapt to the watery world, and would soon die. To save them, they were ejected in waterproof lifeboats to the surface, to live among land-dwellers. Lisa was adopted by the scientist Hugo Morel and his wife.

When [[Aquaman]] was in danger, her water-breathing and telepathic powers awakened. She made herself a costume identical to his, took on the name "Aquagirl", and fought alongside him. But her newfound powers were short-lived, and she permanently lost them.

==Selena/Aquagirl II==
First Appearance: World's Finest Comics #133

'''Selena''' was a young Poseidonis teenager that teamed up with Aquaman as the second Aquagirl in order to impress her boyfriend and become a superheroine. However, as with Lisa Morel, Selena only appeared once and was never mentioned again.

==Tula/Aquagirl III==
First Appearance: Aquaman Vol. 1 #33

'''Tula''' being her real name, she lost her parents soon after her birth. She was found and adopted by one of the royal families of Atlantis. Given the title of princess of Poseidonis, Tula was schooled in Atlantean traditions. She never left the royal palace until she was 15, when she met Aqualad. The two were complete opposites from each other, but they fell in love regardless.

Tula would sometimes help Aqualad with missions during his time with the [[Teen Titans]], she also became an honorary member. She took the name Aquagirl to honor her boyfriend as well as [[Aquaman]]. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' mini-series, Aquagirl was killed by the villain [[Chemo]] after she drowned in water that he poisoned. Tula has a statue in the "hall of fallen Titans" at Titans Tower, alongside the original [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Kole]] and others.

First Appearance: Aquaman Vol. 6 #16

'''Lorena Marquez''' was on a date at the San Diego Zoo when an earthquake shook the city and caused it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands, Lorena's entire family among them. She came into contact with Aquaman, who nursed her back to health, while discovering that she had developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean.

The two managed to locate the other survivors of the quake, and the scientist responsible for the catastrophe, a man named Geist. They had no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as 'Sub Diego'. When the Ocean Master switched lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumed the identity of Aquagirl. After Aquaman exposed the scheme of his, Lorena kept her Aquagirl costume, and the two have gone on protecting 'Sub Diego'.

In an alternate future in the Titans of Tomorrow timeline, Lorena is a member of the Titans as Aquawoman, and has developed telepathic powers, which she had used to kill (or paralyze) former Titan member Tempest.

==Tula (Kingdom Come)==
The Aquagirl of this timeline is the estranged teenage daughter of Garth/Aquaman II (formerly Aqualad) and Deep Blue. She is named Tula, after her father's late girlfriend. She is part of a team consisting of the other original Titans' children.

==Other Media==
* A two-part episode of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' featured a future Justice League Unlimited that included a version of Aquagirl named [[Aquagirl (animated)|Merina]], [[Aquaman]]'s daughter.
