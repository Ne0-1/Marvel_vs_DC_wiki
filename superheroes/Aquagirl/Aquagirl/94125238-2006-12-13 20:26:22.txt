'''Aquagirl''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s who were [[superhero]]es featured in comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. Although there have been four different characters bearing the name, only two are canonical, the most recognizable being [[Aqualad]]'s Atlantean girlfriend. 

==Lisa Morel==

'''Lisa Morel''' (first appearance: ''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 1) #266 (November 1959)) was among several violet-eyed Atlantean children who were born unable to adapt to the watery world, and would soon die. To save them, they were ejected in waterproof lifeboats to the surface, to live among land-dwellers. Lisa was adopted by the scientist Hugo Morel and his wife.

When [[Aquaman]] was in danger, her water-breathing and telepathic powers awakened. She made herself a costume identical to his, took on the name "Aquagirl" and fought alongside him. But her newfound powers were short-lived, and she permanently lost them. She is not considered to have been active as Aquagirl in current continuity.

==Selena==
'''Selena''' (first appearance: ''World's Finest Comics'' #133) was a young Poseidonis teenager who teamed up with Aquaman under the name "Aqua-Girl" in order to impress her boyfriend and become a superheroine. However, as with Lisa Morel, Selena only appeared once and was never mentioned again. She is also not considered to have been active as Aqua-Girl in current continuity.

==Tula==

'''Tula''' is the first canonical Aquagirl. After losing her parents soon after her birth, she is found and adopted by one of the royal families of Atlantis. Given the title of princess of Poseidonis, Tula is schooled in Atlantean traditions. She never leaves the royal palace until she meets [[Aqualad]] at age 15.

Tula sometimes helps Aqualad with missions during his time with the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]; eventually, she also becomes an honorary member. She takes the name Aquagirl to honor her boyfriend as well as [[Aquaman]]. When Aquaman leaves his throne to search for his then-missing wife Mera, [[Nakran]] takes over Atlantis as a dictator.  His reign falls only when Tula leads a rebellion against him. Tula continues her life after this, resuming her life with Garth (Aqualad) when he returns to Atlantis. She continues to be an ally to Garth and the Teen Titans. She and Garth aid the Titans in bringing down the [[H.I.V.E.]] once and for all. 

===Death and return===
During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' mini-series, Aquagirl is killed by the villain [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] after she drowns in water that he has poisoned.

Years later, in the ''Tempest'' mini-series, a woman claiming to be Tula enters Garth's life. In truth, it is a [[doppelganger]] created by the villainous Slizzath as part of an elaborate plan to siphon Garth's mystical energies for his own dark purposes. Garth sees through the ruse and is able to defeat Slizzath, and finally gain a sense of closure about Tula's death. It is also at this time that Garth adopted a new identity as [[Tempest (comics)|Tempest]].

Most recently, Tula reappears in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) issues 30 and 31. Aquagirl is brought back by [[Brother Blood]] - along with [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Phantasm]], and [[Kole]] - to fight against the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. After being freed by [[Beast Boy]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], [[Kid Eternity]] is able to lay the deceased Titans back to rest.

Tula has a statue in the "hall of fallen Titans" at Titans Tower, alongside the original [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Kole]], and others.

'''Lorena Marquez''' is going on a date at the [[San Diego]] Zoo when an earthquake shakes the city and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands, including Lorena's entire family.  She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health, while discovering that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean.

The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, and Geist, the scientist responsible for the catastrophe.  They have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as '[[Sub Diego]]'. When [[Ocean Master]] switches lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumes the identity of Aquagirl. After Aquaman exposes Ocean Master's scheme, Lorena keeps her Aquagirl costume, and the two carry on protecting 'Sub Diego'.

In the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' timeline, Lorena, as Aquawoman, is a member of the Titans.  It is revealed that she has developed telepathic powers which she had used to kill (or paralyze) former Titan member [[Tempest (comics)|Garth]].

===One Year Later===

==Other versions of Aquagirl==
In ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' Aquagirl is Tula II, the estranged teenage daughter of Garth (now Aquaman, formerly Aqualad) and Deep Blue. She is named Tula after her father's late girlfriend. She is part of a team consisting of the other original Titans' children.

==Aquagirl in other media==
[[Image:BBAquagirl.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Aquagirl appears on ''Batman Beyond'']] 
In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Aquagirl is '''Marina''', a member of a future Justice League and the presumed descendant of Aquaman. The character was created specifically for the ''Batman Beyond'' episodes "The Call: Part 1" (November 11, 2000) and "The Call: Part 2" (November 18, 2000), in which [[Terry McGinnis|Batman]] meets the "Justice League Unlimited," a future version of the [[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]. Aquagirl was voiced by [[Jodi Benson]], the actress who provided the voice of [[Princess Ariel|Ariel]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''.

When Batman is going over her file on the computer, it is shown that she is the daughter of Aquaman, with powers including control over water. She later reappears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series (which showcases the present-day lineup of the JLU) in "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]". Her costume varies; she is usually portrayed as wearing a one-piece swimsuit of various colours, and fights with bare arms and legs.

Aquagirl has not appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series. However, ''Teen Titans Go!'', the comic series based on the animated series, featured an aquatic superheroine named "[[Gill Girl]]" that could be seen as a combination of Aquagirl and [[Lagoon Boy]].

In season 2 of [[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]], [[Mandy Moore]] is slated to play Aquagirl in the Aquaman movie that exists in the Entourage fictional universe. The storyline has Moore, who was playing herself as the character Vince's ex-girlfriend, get ultimately dropped from the project due to the turmoil involved in their personal relationship. It is not known what actress, "real" or fictional, replaced Moore on that movie within the TV show's continuity.
