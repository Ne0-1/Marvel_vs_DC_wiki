'''Edward''' "'''Ned'''" '''Leeds''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supporting character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A supporting character of [[Spider-Man]], he was a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', and the husband of [[Betty Brant]]. He was also the third character to take on the '''[[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]''' mantle after being brainwashed as a stand in.

[[Jacob Batalon]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).

==Publication history==
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], Ned Leeds made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #18 (November 1964). His character is killed off in the 1986 one-shot ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'', written by then Spider-Man editor [[Jim Owsley]]. [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Ron Frenz]], and [[Peter David]] (of the creative teams on the ongoing Spider-Man books) found this objectionable, saying that Owsley gave them no warning that he was going to kill Leeds, then a regular cast member in the Spider-Man books. Frenz remarked:

{{quote|Owsley let Tom [DeFalco] and I continue with our plans without telling us in advance that he was going to kill Ned. We had no heads up until ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'' came out that Ned Leeds was killed in that story. I can't speak to why he did it, but I can speak to the way he did it. He kept it a big secret until we felt screwed.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 18|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==

Ned Leeds was a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. He and [[Peter Parker]] compete for the affections of ''Daily Bugle'' secretary [[Betty Brant]], but Parker drops out of the running due to realizing that Brant won't be able to accept the double identity as Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> He would win outright when Betty went into stress induced shock after [[J. Jonah Jameson]] was attacked at the Daily Bugle by the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. Leeds and Brant are married shortly after. However, the couple's marriage is often strained.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #156. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man battles the Hobgoblin, Ned follows the Hobgoblin to a hideout. When the Hobgoblin realizes Ned is present, [[Roderick Kingsley]] captures and brainwashes him as a scapegoat in case of being unmasked.<ref>''Hobgoblin Lives'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wanting to find out about the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], Ned approaches [[Richard Fisk]]. Discovering that Richard hates the Kingpin, Leeds helps create Richard's secret identity as the Rose. Kingsley, wanting to be the new crime boss, wants Ned to remove the Kingpin from the scene.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #253. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ned's regular brainwashings by Kingsley cause his marriage with Betty and professional relationships to fall apart. Increasingly mentally unstable, Ned drives Betty to seek solace in [[Flash Thompson]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} While Flash makes statements about the Hobgoblin and Kingsley stages events so Flash is revealed as the enigmatic villain, Ned and Richard reach a disagreement and Ned decides to turn in Richard's Rose identity to the Kingpin, and Kingsley decides in turn that Ned is no longer needed as Hobgoblin. After Flash is cleared of being framed, Kingsley lets the New York underworld empire know that Ned is actually Hobgoblin and that he would soon be traveling to [[Berlin]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} Ned and Peter go on an assignment in Berlin, and Leeds is murdered by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] at [[Jason Macendale]]'s request as a replacement as Hobgoblin.<ref>''Spider-Man versus Wolverine'' (February 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kingpin presents to Spider-Man photos of Ned in the Hobgoblin costume, which was had obtained via the Foreigner.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, Peter reflected on Ned's death and that Ned must have been framed as Hobgoblin as the Foreigner's non-superhuman operatives would never have been able to defeat the original as a fully powered Hobgoblin. Around this time, the original Hobgoblin returns to eliminate Macendale, and reveals to his successor of the deception of Leeds being the goblin before killing him. Spider-Man and Betty subsequently provoked the Hobgoblin into confessing to framing Ned on tape.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, a clone of Ned Leeds is created by [[Ben Reilly]] (posing as [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Jackal]]) and is seen in New U Technologies' facility area called Haven.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The clone is revealed to have survived the end of the event and disguised himself as a hobo to continue watching over Betty. It is shown that Betty still cares for Ned. While still unaware of his survival, Ned feels that he is proud of Betty's accomplishments.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #42. Marvel Comics.</ref> The clone later dies during a conflict between Spider-Man, [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady|Black Ant]] and tries to warn Spider-Man of something after Betty in the near future.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ned Leeds had a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism, and was a master of deductive reasoning and investigation. He was a normal man who engaged in regular exercise, which increased to more intensive levels after assuming the Hobgoblin role. When brainwashed, Ned wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used his glider and equipment. His equipment includes Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. Since Leeds did not take the Goblin Formula as Roderick Kingsley did, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Ned Leeds is a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle'' and an alcoholic with an antagonistic relationship with [[Betty Brant]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane''===
Ned Leeds appears in the dramatic comic book ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]''. In this continuity, the characters are high school students, and Ned is Mary Jane's boyfriend, who breaks up with her to reunite with his ex-girlfriend Betty Brant.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' #6-7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ned Leeds appeared in several episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]. This version was mainly a reporter of the ''Daily Bugle'' and did not go through his comic depiction's background due to the fact the Hobgoblin's [[Jason Macendale|identity]] had already been revealed prior to his introduction.
* The character is renamed '''Ned Lee''' in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Andrew Kishino]]. This iteration is Korean-American but still has a similar portrayal to his comic book counterpart as a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle''. He is convinced that he can crack [[Spider-Man]]'s mystery identity, and that the Green Goblin is connected. [[J. Jonah Jameson]] thinks he's wasting his time and nearly hands the assignment to [[Frederick Foswell]], but [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] tells him to "run with it". When Venom outs Spider-Man's true identity, Ned interviews people that Peter Parker and Spider-Man both know, like [[Aunt May|May Parker]], the Connors family, [[Norman Osborn]], [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]], [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Eddie Brock]]. He eventually concludes that Peter cannot be Spider-Man, since Peter wore Spider-Man's costume unmasked on [[Halloween]] night, a risky move the real Spider-Man would not make and continues with his investigation. He is also shown to have an attraction to his co-worker [[Betty Brant]] whom he asks on a date while interviewing about Peter.

===Video games===
Ned Leeds is mentioned in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]''. One of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s questions asks the player to see if Spider-Man is controlled by the symbiote is "Whose killer did we track in Berlin?": Ned is the correct answer, with Spider-Man expressing frustration and grief at Wolverine bringing up such a painful memory.

===Theme park===
The Ned Leeds version of Hobgoblin can be seen in the [[Islands of Adventure]] ride ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]''. This version appears as a member of [[Doctor Octopus]]'s [[Sinister Syndicate]]. A wanted poster for him may be seen during the waiting period of the ride, which identifies him by his full name Edward Leeds. At one point in the ride, he attacks guests with a pumpkin bomb that almost hits them, but stops thanks to the intervention of Spider-Man who attacks Hobgoblin and stops him from further hurting guests. During the climax, he and Scream grab onto Spider-Man (who was webbing onto guests) and sends them through the city, before he is defeated when the ride vehicle crashes into his glider. He is last seen webbed up with the rest of the Syndicate.
