He was also the third character to take on the '''[[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]''' mantle after being brainwashed as a stand in.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #18 (November 1964)]

Leeds is killed off in the 1986 one-shot ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'', written by then Spider-Man editor [[Jim Owsley]]. [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Ron Frenz]], and [[Peter David]] (of the creative teams on the ongoing Spider-Man books) found this objectionable, saying that Owsley gave them no warning that he was going to kill Leeds, then a regular cast member in the Spider-Man books. Frenz remarked:

{{quote|"Owsley let Tom [DeFalco] and I continue with our plans without telling us in advance that he was going to kill Ned. We had no heads up until ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'' came out that Ned Leeds was killed in that story. I canâ€™t speak to why he did it, but I can speak to the way he did it. He kept it a big secret until we felt screwed."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 18|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Ned Leeds was a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. He and [[Peter Parker]] compete for the affections of ''Daily Bugle'' secretary [[Betty Brant]], but Parker drops out of the running due to realizing that Brant won't be able to accept the double identity as Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37-39</ref> He would win outright when Betty went into stress infused shock after [[J. Jonah Jameson]] was attacked at the Bugle by [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. Leeds and Brant are married shortly after. However, the couple's marriage is often strained.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

When Spider-Man battles the Hobgoblin, Ned follows Hobgoblin to his hideout. When the Hobgoblin realizes Ned is present, [[Roderick Kingsley]] (the true identity of the Hobgoblin) captures and brainwashes him as a scapegoat in case of being unmasked.<ref>''Hobgoblin Lives'' #3</ref>

Wanting to find out about the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Ned approaches [[Richard Fisk]]. Discovering that Richard hates his father, Leeds helps Richard create a secret identity as the crime boss known as the Rose. Kingsley, wanting to become the new crime leader, wants Ned to remove the Kingpin from the scene.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #253</ref>

Ned's regular brainwashings by Kingsley cause his marriage and professional relationships to fall apart. Increasingly mentally unstable, Ned drives Betty to seek solace in [[Flash Thompson]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} Flash makes statements about Hobgoblin, and Kingsley stages events so Flash is revealed as the enigmatic villain. Meanwhile, Ned and Richard reach a disagreement and Ned decides to turn in Richard's identity as the Rose to The Kingpin, and Kingsley decides in turn that Ned is no longer needed as Hobgoblin. After Flash is cleared of being Hobgoblin, Kingsley lets the New York underworld empire know that Ned is actually Hobgoblin and that he would soon be traveling to [[Berlin]].{{issue|date=December 2011}}

Ned and Peter go on an assignment in Berlin, and Leeds is murdered by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] at [[Jason Macendale]]'s request as a replacement as the Hobgoblin.<ref>''Spider-Man versus Wolverine'' (February 1987)</ref> The Kingpin presents to Spider-Man photos of Ned in the Hobgoblin costume, which he had obtained via the Foreigner.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289</ref>

Years later, when the original Hobgoblin returns to eliminate Macendale, Peter reflected on Ned's death and that he must have been framed as Hobgoblin, as the Foreigner's non-superhuman operatives would never have been able to defeat a fully powered Hobgoblin. Spider-Man and Betty subsequently provoked Hobgoblin into confessing in framing Ned on tape.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #3</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, a clone of Ned Leeds is created by [[Ben Reilly]] (posing as Jackal) and is seen in New U Technologies' facility area called Haven.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ned was a normal man who engaged in regular exercise, which increased to more intensive levels after assuming the role of the Hobgoblin. When brainwashed, he wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used his glider and equipment. Hobgoblin's equipment includes Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. Since Ned Leeds did not take the Goblin Formula as Kingsley did, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength.

Ned had a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism, and was a master of deductive reasoning and investigation.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Ned Leeds is a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle'' just like his mainstream version. Here, he is a drunk and he and Betty Brant cannot stand each other.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #121</ref>

===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===
Ned Leeds also appeared briefly in the comic book drama ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' issues #6 and #7. In this continuity, Ned was a senior who dated Mary Jane when she was a junior and she soon began to think he was "the one". Although, ironically, after she confessed this, Ned broke up with her in favor of his old girlfriend [[Betty Brant]]. This break-up sent Mary Jane into a deep depression, which only ended upon seeing the real grief Peter Parker went through after the death of his uncle.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ned Leeds appeared in several episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]. This version is mainly a ''Daily Bugle'' reporter, as the series did not go into his background from the comics due to the fact the Hobgoblin's identity had already been revealed prior to his introduction, and Betty Brant did not appear in the series.
* Ned Leeds appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Andrew Kishino]]. This iteration was renamed '''Ned Lee''' and is Korean-American in this continuity, but still has a similar portrayal to his comic counterpart as a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle''. He is convinced that he can crack Spider-Man's mystery identity, and that the Green Goblin is connected. [[J. Jonah Jameson]] thinks he's wasting his time and nearly hands the assignment to [[Frederick Foswell]], but [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] tells him to "run with it". When Venom outs Spider-Man's true identity, Ned interviews people that [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and Spider-Man both know, like [[Aunt May]], the Connors family, [[Norman Osborn]], [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]], [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Eddie Brock]]. He eventually concludes that Peter cannot be Spider-Man, since Peter wore the costume unmasked on [[Halloween]] night, a risky move the real Spider-Man would not make, and continues with his investigation. He is also shown to have an attraction to his co-worker [[Betty Brant]] whom he asks on a date while interviewing about Peter.

===Film===
[[Jacob Batalon]] portrays a supporting character named Ned in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''. He is Peter Parker's best friend who finds out that Peter is Spider-Man. The character, who does not have a last name in the film and is not necessarily guaranteed to be Ned Leeds, was inspired by him and is an amalgamation of various Spider-Man characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/03/17-things-we-learned-on-the-set-of-spider-man-homecoming?page=2|title=17 Things We Learned On The Set Of Spider-Man: Homecoming Page 2 of 2|last=Collura|first=Scott|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pSFp1tdn|archivedate=April 3, 2017}}</ref> Batalon will reprise his role as Ned in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/37237-spider-man-homecoming-nycc-ned-leeds-infinity-war|title='Spider-Man: Homecoming' Star Wants Ned to Become a Villain|last=Francisco|first=Eric|work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 9, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6u63QQLeI?url=https://www.inverse.com/article/37237-spider-man-homecoming-nycc-ned-leeds-infinity-war|archivedate=October 10, 2017|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref>

===Video games===
* In ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', one of the questions Wolverine will ask the player to see if Spider-Man is controlled by the symbiote is "''Whose killer did we track in Berlin?''". The correct answer is Ned Leeds with Spider-Man expressing frustration and grief at [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] bringing up such a painful memory.

===Theme park===
Ned Leeds as the Hobgoblin can be seen in the [[Islands of Adventure]] ride ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]''. He appears as a member of [[Doctor Octopus]]' [[Sinister Syndicate]]. A wanted poster for him may be seen during the waiting period of the ride, which identifies him by his full name, Edward Leeds. At one point in the ride, he attacks guests with a pumpkin bomb that almost hits them, but stops thanks to the intervention of Spider-Man, who attacks Hobgoblin and stops him from further hurting guests. During the climax, he and Scream grab onto Spider-Man, who was webbing onto guests, and sends them through the city, before he is defeated when the ride vehicle crashes into his glider. He is last seen webbed up with the rest of the Syndicate.
