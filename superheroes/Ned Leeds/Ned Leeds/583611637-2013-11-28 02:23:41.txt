'''Ned Leeds''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], part of the supporting cast of ''[[Spider-Man]]'', first introduced in 1964 in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #18, by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==

{{See also|Hobgoblin (comics)|l1=Hobgoblin}}
'''Edward "Ned" Leeds''' appeared early in Peter Parker's life as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. Frequently, he and Peter would struggle for the affections of ''Bugle'' Secretary [[Betty Brant]], and eventually Ned won and married her. However the couple's marriage was often strained.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

When Spider-Man battled the [[Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley)|Hobgoblin]], Ned followed him to the villain's hideout. When Kingsley realized Ned was present, he captured and brainwashed the unlucky reporter, deciding it would be better to have a scapegoat in case he became unmasked.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

Ned Leeds approached [[Richard Fisk]], son of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], to find out about his father. Discovering that Richard hated his father, Leeds helped him create a secret identity as the crime boss the Rose. Kingsley, wanting to become the new crime leader, wanted Ned to knock the older Fisk off his throne so he could have it.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

Ned's regular brain washings by Kingsley caused his marriage and his professional relationships to fall apart. Increasingly mentally unstable, Ned caused Betty to find solace in [[Flash Thompson]], a former rival to Peter Parker.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

Eventually Flash made statements about the Hobgoblin, and Kingsley staged events so Flash was revealed as the enigmatic villain. Meanwhile, Ned and Richard Fisk reached a disagreement and Ned decided to turn in Richard Fisk's identity as the Rose to his father,The Kingpin, and Kingsley decided in turn that Ned was no longer needed as the Hobgoblin. After Flash was cleared of being the Hobgoblin, Kingsley let the New York underworld empire know that Ned was actually the Hobgoblin and that he would soon be traveling to Berlin.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

Ned and Peter Parker were on an assignment in Berlin, when Leeds was murdered by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] at the request of [[Jason Macendale]] who could now become a new incarnation of the orange hooded villain.<ref>''Spider-Man versus Wolverine'' (February 1987)</ref> Ned died still separated from his former wife.
Soon after that, the Kingpin revealed to Spider-Man that Ned was the Hobgoblin by presenting substantial photo evidence of Ned in the Hobgoblin costume, which he had obtained via the Foreigner. Leeds was strangled to death in Berlin by the Foreigner's men, assigned by Macendale, who was following the orders of Richard Fisk aka the Rose. He also informs him that Macendale is the new Hobgoblin.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

In time after the murder of Jason Macendale by the original Hobgoblin. Peter Parker was able to deduce there was no logical way Ned could be Hobgoblin. Having fought Hobgoblin several times, Spider-Man could testify to Hobgoblin's augmented strength; Foreigner at that time was not using superhuman operatives, and the true Hobgoblin would have killed Foreigner's men. Eventually following the clues, and with the help of Ned's widow Betty Brant, Spider-Man was able to discover that Kingsley was the true Hobgoblin and eventually defeat Kinglsley, thus clearing Ned's name.

==Powers and abilities==
Ned was a normal man who engaged in regular exercise, which increased to more intensive levels after assuming the role of the Hobgoblin. When brainwashed, he wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used his glider and equipment. Hobgoblin equipment includes Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats, and electrical shock gloves. Since Ned Leeds did not take the Goblin Formula as Kingsley did, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength. However, Leeds was actually more effective in his role than his successor, Jason Macendale, despite that Macendale used more sophisticated equipment and had augmented strength.

Ned Leeds was a highly intuitive and effective investigative reporter as evidenced by his ability to locate the Goblin Lair and discover the identity of the Hobgoblin, a feat which had eluded Spider-Man.

Ned had a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism, and was a master of deductive reasoning and investigation.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===

Ned Leeds also appeared briefly in the comic book drama ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' issues #6 and #7.

===Animated series===
* Ned Leeds appeared in several episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]. Used mainly as a ''Daily Bugle'' reporter, the series did not go into Leeds' background from the comics due to the fact the Hobgoblin's identity had already been revealed prior to his introduction, and Betty Brant did not appear in the series.

* Ned Leeds appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Andrew Kishino]]. He was renamed '''Ned Lee''' and is Korean-American in this continuity. A crackerjack young reporter, he is convinced that he can crack the mystery of who Spider-Man really is, and that the [[Green Goblin]] is connected. [[J. Jonah Jameson|Jameson]] thinks he's wasting his time and nearly hands the assignment to [[Big Man|Foswell]], but [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] tells him to "run with it." When [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] outs Spider-Man's true identity, Ned interviews people that Peter Parker and Spider-Man both know, like Aunt May, the Connors, Norman Osborn, [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]], [[Flash Thompson]], and Eddie Brock. He eventually concludes that Peter cannot be Spider-Man, since he wore his costume unmasked on [[Halloween]] night, a risky move the real Spider-Man would not make, and continues with his investigation. He is also shown to have an attraction to his co-worker, Betty Brant, whom he asks on a date while interviewing her about Peter.

===Film===
