A [[supporting character]] in stories featuring the superhero [[Spider-Man]], he has been a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', and the husband of [[Betty Brant]]. He was also the third character to take on the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|'''Hobgoblin''']] mantle after being brainwashed as a stand in, and subsequently killed before he could reveal who had framed him.

Since his inception, the character has made several appearances in other forms of media, including [[Feature film|feature films]] and [[Television show|television series]]. [[Jacob Batalon]] portrays a heavily modified version of [[Ned Leeds (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ned Leeds]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', and is set to reprise his role in [[Untitled Spider-Man: Far From Home sequel|the third ''Spider-Man'' film]] (2021).<ref name="sequel filming">{{cite web|last=Marnell |first=Blair |publisher=SuperHeroHype |url=https://www.superherohype.com/movies/488894-tom-holland-confirms-that-spider-man-3-has-started-filming |title=Tom Holland Confirms That Spider-Man 3 Has Started Filming |date=November 6, 2020}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], Ned Leeds made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #18 (November 1964). His character is killed off in the 1986 one-shot ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'', written by then Spider-Man editor [[Jim Owsley]]. [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Ron Frenz]], and [[Peter David]] (of the creative teams on the ongoing Spider-Man books) found this objectionable, saying that Owsley gave them no warning that he was going to kill Leeds, then a regular cast member in the Spider-Man books. Frenz remarked:

{{quote|Owsley let Tom [DeFalco] and I continue with our plans without telling us in advance that he was going to kill Ned. We had no heads up until ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'' came out that Ned Leeds was killed in that story. I can't speak to why he did it, but I can speak to the way he did it. He kept it a big secret until we felt screwed.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|author-link= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 18|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==

Ned Leeds was a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. He and [[Peter Parker]] compete for the affections of ''Daily Bugle'' secretary [[Betty Brant]], but Parker drops out of the running due to realizing that Brant won't be able to accept Spider-Man's double identity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> He would win outright when Betty went into stress induced shock after [[J. Jonah Jameson]] was attacked at the Daily Bugle by the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. Leeds and Brant are married shortly after. However, the couple's marriage is often strained.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #156. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man battles the Hobgoblin, Ned follows the Hobgoblin to a hideout. When the Hobgoblin realizes Ned is present, Ned is captured and brainwashed as a scapegoat in case of being unmasked.<ref name="SMHL">''Hobgoblin Lives'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wanting to find out about the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], Ned approaches [[Richard Fisk]]. Discovering that Richard hates the Kingpin, Leeds helps create Richard's secret identity as the Rose. The Hobgoblin manipulates Ned to remove the Kingpin from the scene.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #253. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ned's regular brainwashing cause his marriage with Betty and professional relationships to fall apart. Increasingly mentally unstable, Ned drives Betty to seek solace in [[Flash Thompson]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} While Flash makes statements about the Hobgoblin and events are staged so Flash is revealed as the enigmatic villain, Ned and Richard reach a disagreement and Ned decides to turn in the Rose to the Kingpin, and thus Ned is no longer needed as Hobgoblin. After Flash is cleared of being framed, the New York underworld empire is known that Ned is actually Hobgoblin and that he would soon be traveling to [[Berlin]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} Ned and Peter go on an assignment in Berlin, and Leeds is murdered by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] at [[Jason Macendale]]'s request as a replacement Hobgoblin.<ref>''Spider-Man versus Wolverine'' (February 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=161}}</ref> The Kingpin presents photos of Ned in the Hobgoblin costume (which was obtained via the Foreigner) to Spider-Man in an attempt to get Spider-Man to go after the Foreigner.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289.

Peter reflected on Ned's death years later, believing Ned must have been framed as Hobgoblin as the Foreigner's non-superhuman operatives would never have been able to defeat the real Hobgoblin. Around this time, the original Hobgoblin returns to eliminate Macendale, revealing the deception of Leeds being a stand-in. Spider-Man and Betty subsequently provoked [[Roderick Kingsley]] into confessing to Ned's framing on tape.<ref name="SMHL"/>

During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, a clone of Ned Leeds is created by [[Ben Reilly]] (posing as Jackal) and is seen in New U Technologies' facility Haven.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The clone is revealed to have survived the end of the event and disguised himself as a hobo to continue watching over Betty. It is shown that Betty still cares for Ned. While still unaware of his survival, Ned feels that he's proud of Betty's accomplishments.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #42. Marvel Comics.</ref> The clone later dies during a conflict between Spider-Man, [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] and tries to warn Spider-Man of something after Betty in the near future.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

By the time Spider-Man meets [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] in person, he finds that Kindred had dug up the bodies of Ned Leeds, [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], [[George Stacy]], [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Jean DeWolff]], and Marla Jameson and sat them around a dinner table.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #50. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While brainwashed, Ned wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used the glider and equipment which included Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. However, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength.
