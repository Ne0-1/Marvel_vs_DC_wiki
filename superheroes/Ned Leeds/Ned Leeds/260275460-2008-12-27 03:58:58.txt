'''Ned Leeds''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], part of the supporting cast of ''[[Spider-Man]]'', first introduced in [[1964]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #18, by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. He was a reporter at the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', where [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] also works. 

==Fictional character biography==
{{see also|Hobgoblin (comics)|l1=Hobgoblin}}
Ned Leeds appeared early in Peter Parker's life as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. Frequently, he and Peter would struggle for the affections of ''Bugle'' Secretary [[Betty Brant]], and eventually Ned won and married her. Ned became city editor for the paper, and hints were dropped that the couple's marriage was anything but happy.

When Spider-Man battled the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]], Ned followed him to the villain's hideout to see the villain unmasked as Roderick Kingsley. When Kingsley realized Ned was present, he captured and brainwashed the unlucky reporter, deciding it would be better to have a scapegoat in case he became unmasked.

Ned Leeds approached [[Richard Fisk]], son of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], to find out about his father. Discovering that Richard hated his father, Leeds helped him create a secret identity as the crime boss The Rose. Kingsley, wanting to become the new crime leader, wanted Ned to knock the older Fisk off his throne so he could have it.

Ned's regular brain washings by Kingsley caused his marriage and his professional relationships to fall apart. Increasingly mentally unstable, Ned caused Betty to find solace in [[Flash Thompson]], a former rival to Peter Parker.

Eventually Flash made statements about the Hobgoblin, and Kingsley staged events so Flash was revealed as the enigmatic villain. Meanwhile, Ned decided to turn Richard Fisk's identity as the Rose to his father, and Kingsley decided in turn that Ned was no longer needed as the Hobgoblin. After Flash was cleared of being the Hobgoblin, Kingsley let the New York underworld empire know that Ned was actually the Goblin.

Ned and Peter Parker were on an assignment in [[West Germany]] when Leeds was murdered by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] at the request of [[Jason Macendale]] who could now become a new incarnation of the orange hooded villain.<ref>''Spider-Man versus Wolverine'' (February 1987)</ref>

Ned died still separated from his former wife.

==Trivia==
Ned Leeds was the main suspect when the [[Green Goblin|Green Goblin's]] identity was still a secret, but in the end, [[Norman Osborn]] was revealed to be Spider-Man's archenemy. The reason Ned wasn't chosen to be the Goblin was because [[Stan Lee]] thought that it wouldn't be very realistic if yet another ''Daily Bugle'' character became a superhuman.

Later on, when the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] was introduced, fans speculated that Ned was the man behind the mask, but once again, they were wrong.

The third character many suspected to be Leeds was the Hobgoblin, and due to author changes, he became the Hobgoblin, only later to be recognized to be just a pawn of the real Hobgoblin, Roderick Kingsley.

==Powers and abilities==
Ned was a normal man who engaged in regular exercise, which increased to more intensive levels after assuming the role of the Hobgoblin. When brainwashed, he wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used his glider and equipment. Hobgoblin equipment includes Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats, and electrical shock gloves. Since Ned Leeds did not take the Goblin Formula as Kingsley did, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength.

Ned Leeds was a highly intuitive and effective investigative reporter as evidenced by his ability to locate the Goblin Lair and discover the identity of the Hobgoblin, a feat which had eluded Spider-Man. Leeds was actually more effective in his role than his successor, Jason Macendale, despite that Macendale used more sophisticated equipment and had augmented strength.

Ned had a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism, and was a master of deductive reasoning and investigation.

==Other versions==
===[[Ultimate Marvel]]===
Ned first appearance was in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #121. He is a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle'' just like his mainstream version, but here he is a drunk and he and Betty Brant can't stand each other.

===''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]''===
Ned Leeds also appeared briefly in the comic book drama ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' issues #6 and #7. In this continuity, Ned was a senior who dated Mary Jane when she was a junior and she soon began to think he was "the one". Although, ironically, after she confessed this Ned broke up with her in favor of his old girlfriend [[Betty Brant]].

==In other media==
===Animated series===
* Ned Leeds appeared in several episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]. Used mainly as a ''Daily Bugle'' reporter, the series didn't go into Leeds' background from the comics due to the fact the Hobgoblin's identity had already been revealed prior to his introduction, and Betty Brant did not appear in the series. 

* Ned Leeds appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Andrew Kishino]]. He was renamed Ned Lee to accentuate that fact that he is Korean in this continuity.

===Theme park===
Ned Leeds as the Hobgoblin can be seen in the [[Islands of Adventure]] ride ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'' as a member of [[Doctor Octopus]]' [[Sinister Syndicate]]. A wanted poster for him may be seen during the waiting period of the ride, which identifies him as '''Edward Leeds'''. At one point in the ride, he attacks guests with a pumpkin bomb that almost hits them, but stops thanks to the intervention of Spider-Man, who attacks Hobgoblin and stops him from further hurting guests. During the climax, he and Scream grab onto Spider-Man, who was webbing onto guests, and sends them through the city, before he is defeated when the ride vehicle crashes into his glider. He is last seen webbed up with the rest of the Syndicate.
