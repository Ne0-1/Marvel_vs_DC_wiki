'''Ned Leeds''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], part of the supporting cast of ''[[Spider-Man]]'', first introduced in [[1964]] in [[The Amazing Spider-Man]] # 18, by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. He was a reporter at the [[Daily Bugle]], where [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] also works. 

==Fictional character biography==
{{see also|Hobgoblin (comics)|l1=Hobgoblin}}
Ned Leeds appeared early in Peter Parker's life as a reporter for the [[Daily Bugle]]. Frequently, he and Peter would struggle for the affections of Bugle Secretary [[Betty Brant]], and eventually Ned won and married her. Ned became city editor for the paper, and hints were dropped that the couple's marriage was anything but happy.

When Spider-Man battled the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Ned followed him to the villain's hideout to see the villain unmasked as Roderick Kingsley. When Kingsley realized Ned was present, he captured and brainwashed the unlucky reporter, deciding it would be better to have a scapegoat in case he became unmasked.

Ned Leeds approached [[Richard Fisk]], son of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], to find out about his father. Discovering that Richard hated his father, Leeds helped him create a secret identity as the crime boss The Rose. Kingsley, wanting to become the new crime leader, wanted Ned to knock the older Fisk off his throne so he could have it.

Ned's regular brainwashings by Kingsley caused his marriage to fall apart, and his professional relationships as well. Increasingly mentally unstable, Ned caused Betty to find solace in [[Flash Thompson]], a former rival to Peter Parker.

Eventually Flash made statements about the Hobgoblin, and Ned staged events so Flash was revealed as the enigmatic villain. Ned decided to turn Richard Fisk's identity as the Rose to his father, and Kingsley decided in turn that Ned was no longer needed as the Hobgoblin. Kingsley let the New York underworld empire know that Ned was actually the Hobgoblin, and [[Jason Macendale]] had Ned assassinated by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] so he could become a new incarnation of the orange hooded villain. Ned died still separated from his former wife. Ned is still considered deceased.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=October 2007}}
Ned Leeds was the main suspect when the [[Green Goblin|Green Goblin's]] identity was still a secret, but in the end, [[Norman Osborn]] was revealed to be Spider-Man's archenemy. The reason Ned wasn't chosen to be the Goblin was because [[Stan Lee]] thought that it wouldn't be very realistic if yet another Daily Bugle character became a superhuman.

Later on, when the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] was introduced, fans speculated that Ned was the man behind the mask, but once again, they were wrong.

The third character many suspected to be Leeds was the Hobgoblin, and due to author changes, he became the Hobgoblin, only later to be recognised to be just a pawn of the real Hobgoblin, Roderick Kingsley.

==Powers and abilities==
Ned was a normal man who engaged in regular exercise, which increased to more intensive levels after assuming the role of the Hobgoblin. When brainwashed, he wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used his glider and equipment. Hobgoblin equipment includes Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats, and electrical shock gloves. Since Ned Leeds did not take the Goblin Formula as Kingsley did, he had no healing factor or super strength.

Ned Leeds was a highly intuitive and effective investigative reporter as evidenced by his ability to locate the Goblin Lair and discover the identity of the Hobgoblin, a feat which had eluded Spider-Man. Leeds was actually more effective in his role than his successor, Jason Macendale, despite that Macendale used more sophisticated equipment and had augmented strength.

==Other versions==
===[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]===
Ned Leeds also appeared briefly in the comic book drama [[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]] issues #6 and #7. In this continuity, Ned was a senior who dated Mary Jane when she was a junior and she soon began to think he was "the one". Although, ironically, after she confessed this Ned broke up with her in favor of his old girlfriend [[Betty Brant]].

==In other media==
===Animated series===

*Leeds had appeared with a little cameo in [[Guilty (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|an episode]] of ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', played by [[Bob Bergen]]. Peter Parker and Ned had no rivalry to win over Betty Brant, as in the series, she never appeared and her place was taken by Glory Grant. And also, Ned didn't become hypnotized by the Hobgoblin into becoming a villain.

*Ned Leeds, renamed Ned Lee, will appear in [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''The Spectacular Spider-Man]]. According to [[Greg Weisman]], he will be Korean-American to add diversity to the cast.

===Theme park===

Ned Leeds as the Hobgoblin can be seen in the [[Islands of Adventure]] ride ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'' as one of the villains.  A wanted poster for him may be seen during the waiting period of the ride, which identifies him as '''Edward Leeds''' ("Ned" is a common nickname for people with the name "Edward.").
