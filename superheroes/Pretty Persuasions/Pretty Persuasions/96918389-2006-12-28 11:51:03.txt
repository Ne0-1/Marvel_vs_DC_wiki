'''Pretty Persuasion''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[mutate (fictional)|mutate]] character. 

==History==
Nothing is known about Pretty Persuasion's past before joining up Psionex. She used to be an exotic dancer until being operated upon by Genetech, a company that created super-beings. Genetech is responsible for [[Psionex]]' powers, and later on frequently fought against and with the [[New Warriors]]. After their last battle, Pretty Persuasion had temporarily had enough of the super-villain/hero lifestyle and returned back to her life as a dancer.
