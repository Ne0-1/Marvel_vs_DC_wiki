'''Pretty Persuasions''' ('''Heidi P. Franklin''') is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[mutate (fictional)|mutate]] character who first appeared in ''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #4. She was a member of [[Psionex]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nothing is known about Pretty Persuasions's past before joining up with Psionex. She used to be an exotic dancer until being operated upon by Genetech, a company that created super-beings. Genetech had trouble keeping her in line as she tended to seduce her minders, both male and female. She fought against the [[New Warriors]] with her team and they were soundly defeated. Later, feeling like they are nothing more than lab speciments, the team escapes Genetech and Persuasions goes to work at a New York City strip club. [[Nova (comics)|Richard Rider]] and Vance Astrovik make a trip to check on her. 

After their last battle, Pretty Persuasions had temporarily had enough of the super-villain/hero lifestyle and returned back to her life as a dancer.

She later joins a new version of Psionex, which reforms under the villain known as Darkling. This teams dedicates itself to crime-fighting but falls apart after a civllian with a heart condition dies during an encounter. Persuasions returns to Genetech for observation but later appears again as an exotic dancer. 

===''Civil War''===

During the Civil War event, Pretty Persuasions was apprehended by Baron Zemo and his [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. She faces the 'choice' of working as an agent of the government, or going to jail for not registering with the Superhuman registration Act and her past crimes. Persuasions, along with many other recruits, is forced into aiding the Thunderbolts and Earth's heroes in a battle against the Grandmaster and dozens of super-powered opponents. The recruits are seen being overwhelmed and their final fate is not yet made clear.
