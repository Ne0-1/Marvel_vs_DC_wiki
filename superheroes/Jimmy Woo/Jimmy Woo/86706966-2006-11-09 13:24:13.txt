'''Jimmy Woo''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[Asian-American]] [[secret agent]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic-book]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Created by [[Entertaining Comics|EC Comics]] great [[Al Feldstein]] and artist [[Joe Maneely]] in ''[[Yellow Claw]]'' #1 (Oct. 1956) from [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the [[1950s]] predecessor of Marvel.

"Jimmy Woo" is also the name of an unrelated [[nightclub]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[The Netherlands]].

Jimmy Woo was the hero of an [[spy fiction|espionage]] series named for his [[antagonist]], a "[[yellow peril]]" [[Communist]] [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] known only as the Yellow Claw. While the short-lived series named after that villain ran only four issues (Oct. 1956 - April 1957), it featured art by industry legends Maneely, [[Jack Kirby]], and [[John Severin]]. Woo would be re-introduced a decade later by [[writer]]-[[artist]] [[Jim Steranko]] in his landmark Marvel Comics feature "[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]", in the company's first integration of Atlas characters into mainstream Marvel continuity.

Kirby took over as writer-artist with issue #2 — [[inker|inking]] his own [[penciller|pencil art]] there and in the following issue, representing two of the very rare occasions on which he did so. On the final issue, Kirby's bold lines and dynamic compositions were given uncharacteristic grittiness by the scratchy inks of [[Western fiction|Western]]- and [[war-comics]] veteran Severin. Also unusually for a Kirby book, other artists drew the covers: Severin on #2 and #4, [[Bill Everett]] on #3.

Well-regarded for its relatively mature storyline and in particular for Maneely's exquisitely atmospheric art, the book nevertheless failed to find an audience. Its influence rippled, however, as ''wunderkind'' Steranko brought the Yellow Claw, Woo and other characters from it into the Marvel universe, beginning with the "[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] " story in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #160 (Sept. 1967). Woo went on to join that espionage agency in ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #2 (July 1968).

Woo went on to be featured in the 1977-1979 Marvel series ''[[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]]'' and the 2006-07 Marvel series ''[[Agents of Atlas]]''. Before the cancellation of the 1990s [[alternate universe]] Marvel imprint [[Razorline]], as produced but unpublished titles of its various series were preparing to blend the Razorline into primary Marvel continuity, Woo as well as [[Nick Fury]] and other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents guest-starred in ''Wraitheart'' #5.<!--sources for previous sentence include:

Woo starred as the leader of a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives code-named [[Agents of Atlas]], in the 2006-2007 series of that name.

== Fictional character biography ==
James Woo is an [[Asian-American]] [[FBI]] agent assigned primarily to investigate and apprehend the [[Chinese]]-national mandarin known as the Yellow Claw, a [[Fu Manchu]] manqué. (Indeed, author [[Sax Rohmer]] had a Fu Manchu novel titled ''The Yellow Claw''.) The Yellow Claw, who attempts world domination, claimed in 2000s comics that his American rubric is a mistransliteraion of the Chinese characters for "Golden Claw". Complicating matters, the Claw's grandniece, Suwan, was in love with Woo in the 1950s series.

In [[retcon]] stories,<ref>'[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' Vol. 1, #9 (June 1978) and in the 2000s miniseries ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]''.</ref> Woo is the FBI agent assigned in 1958 to oversee the [[1950s]] superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a short-lived predecessor of the later, more estabished team of that name.

As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Woo went on to join its "Godzilla Squad" to hunt down the giant monster [[Godzilla]] (the character from the long-running series of films from the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[movie studio]] [[Toho]]). This unit, led by [[Dum Dum Dugan]], employed such weapons as a [[Mecha|giant robot]] called [[Red Ronin]], and was headquartered in a smaller version of the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], known as the Behemoth.

Woo was temporarily replaced by a [[Life Model Decoy]] (a form of  [[android|artificial human]] utilized by S.H.I.E.L.D.) of the self-aware, renegade "Deltan" class,<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1 (June 1988)</ref> and went through five such bodies before dying with out with other repentant LMDs.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6 (Nov. 1988)</ref> Woo reemerged, at some point becoming a high-ranking agent within the S.H.I.E.L.D. Directorate.

In 2006-2007 stories, Woo attempted a secret raid of a group identified as [[Atlas|The Atlas Foundation]]. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, he infiltrated an Atlas Foundation location, resulting in all the recruits being killed. Woo was critically burned and lost higher brain function. The former 1950s Avenger [[Gorilla-Man]], by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gave the organization a classified record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no prior knowledge. Gorilla-Man rescues Woo with the aid of fellow 1950s teammates [[M-11]] and [[Marvel Boy]], who restores Woo to his 1958 self.
