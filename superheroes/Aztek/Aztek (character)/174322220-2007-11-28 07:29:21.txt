'''Aztek''' was a superhero in the [[DC Universe]]. He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]].  Aztek's series was critically acclaimed, but only lasted ten issues.  He also appeared in several issues of [[Justice League|JLA]] also written by Morrison.  In 2004, he became a recurring minor supporting character on the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series.

==Character history==

A young man named Uno was raised by the Q Society, a secret organization, to be the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca]].  He was at the peak of human abilities both physically and mentally.  He was given a magical suit of armor that bestows super strength, super speed, super hearing, telescopic vision, x-ray vision, infrared vision, invisibility and flight upon the wearer.  His base of operations was the city of [[Vanity (comics)|Vanity]], a strange town that had bizarre architecture, and the highest suicide rate in the [[DC Universe]] version of the United States.

Aztek later became a member of the [[Justice League]], but felt he had to resign when it was revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society was [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]]. He was later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine [[Mageddon]], which, apparently, was the 'Tezcatlipoca' that the cult was referring to all along.  Finally he sacrificed himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] saga, which ended Grant Morrison's run on JLA.

==Powers and abilities==
One of the most powerful heroes of his time, Aztek was at the peak of physical and mental perfection.  He wore an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "4-dimensional mirror"), from which he derived flight, superhuman physical abilities, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation.

==Other versions==
A younger [[African-American]] female Aztek was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during "''The Rock of Ages''" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an [[alternate future]] overrun by [[Darkseid]]. She had the same abilities and her existence may imply that the Q Society is not defunct despite the death of the original. However, it could also be concluded that in the time of "''Rock of Ages''", Mageddon had simply not yet appeared, and therefore another Aztek was needed.

==Other media==
Aztek first appeared among scores of new Justice League members in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'''s premiere, and continued to appear in brief cameos throughout the series. He had brief, uncredited speaking parts in the episodes "Question Authority" and "[[I Am Legion (Justice League Unlimited)|I Am Legion]]."
