'''Aztek''' was a superhero in the [[DC Universe]]. He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]]. Aztek's series was critically acclaimed, but only lasted ten issues. He also appeared in several issues of [[Justice League|JLA]] also written by Morrison.

{{spoiler}}

A young man named Uno was raised by a secret society (the Q Society) to be  the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca]]. He was at the peak of human abilities both physically and mentally. He was armed with a magical suit of armor that had several powers including flight, invisibility, super strength etc. His base of operations was Vanity City, a strange town that had bizarre architecture and the highest suicide rate in the DC Universe.

Aztek later became a member of the [[Justice League]] but felt he had to resign when it was revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q society was [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]]. He was later blinded helping the league save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine Maggedon, which, apparently, was the 'Tezcatlipoca' that the cult was referring to all along. Finally he sacrificed himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca.
