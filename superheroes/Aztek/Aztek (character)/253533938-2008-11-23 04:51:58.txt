==Fictional character biography==
Uno is raised from childhood by the Q Society, a secret organization, to be the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god, [[Tezcatlipoca (DC Comics)|Tezcatlipoca]].  He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Aztek later joins the [[Justice League]]<ref>Aztek: The Ultimate Man # 10</ref>, but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]]. He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine [[Mageddon]], (apparently, the 'Tezcatlipoca' that the cult was referring to all along).  Aztek, ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the [[World War III (comics)#JLA|World War III]] <ref>  JLA #41</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning.  He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "4-dimensional mirror"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels.  The 4-dimensional power source could self destruct in a highly explosive manner.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
A younger black female Aztek was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during "''The Rock of Ages''" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an [[alternate future]] overrun by [[Darkseid]]. She had the same abilities and her existence may imply that the Q Society is not defunct despite the death of the original. However, it could also be concluded that in the time of "''Rock of Ages''", Mageddon had simply not yet appeared, and therefore another Aztek was needed.

==Collected editions==
The original run of the [[eponym]]ous title has been collected as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:
