==Fictional character biography==
Uno is raised from childhood by a secret organization named the Q Society to be the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca (DC Comics)|Tezcatlipoca]]. He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities.<ref name="dc-ency"/> After his training is completed, he enters the United States and assumes the identity of recently deceased physician Curt Falconer.<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #1 (August 1996)</ref>

Aztek later joins the [[Justice League]],<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref> but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''JLA'' #15 (February 1998)</ref> He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine [[Mageddon]] (apparently the Tezcatlipoca that the cult was referring to all along). Aztek ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] story arc.<ref>''JLA'' #41 (May 2000)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning. He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "four-dimensional mirror"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels. The helmet could feed information directly into his brain even after he was blinded in his first confrontation with Mageddon. The four-dimensional power source could self-destruct in a highly explosive manner.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
===The Rock of Ages===
A younger black female Aztek, with the same abilities, was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during "''The Rock of Ages''" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an [[alternate future]] overrun by [[Darkseid]]. She sacrifices her life to destroy Darkseid's lunar facilities.

===Television===
*Aztek appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', mostly appearing in brief cameos throughout the series.  After making a very brief appearance in "Question Authority" (voiced by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]]), he made a more significant appearance in "I Am Legion" (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) where he helped Superman and [[Shayera Hol]] investigate where Lex Luthor had gone after escaping prison.
