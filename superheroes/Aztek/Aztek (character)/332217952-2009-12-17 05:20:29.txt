==Fictional character biography==
Uno is raised from childhood by a secret organization named the Q Society to be the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god, [[Tezcatlipoca (DC Comics)|Tezcatlipoca]]. He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Aztek later joins the [[Justice League]],<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10</ref> but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]]. He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine [[Mageddon]], (apparently, the 'Tezcatlipoca' that the cult was referring to all along.) Aztek, ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the [[World War III (comics)#JLA|World War III]]<ref>''JLA'' #41</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning.  He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "four-dimensional mirror"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels.  The four-dimensional power source could self destruct in a highly explosive manner.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
A younger black female Aztek, with the same abilities, was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during "''The Rock of Ages''" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an [[alternate future]] overrun by [[Darkseid]].

Aztek first appeared among scores of new Justice League members in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'''s premiere, and continued to appear in brief cameos throughout the series. He had brief, uncredited speaking parts in the episodes "[[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|Question Authority]]" and "[[I Am Legion (Justice League Unlimited)|I Am Legion]]", portrayed by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]] and [[Corey Burton]], respectively. In "Question Authority", he and [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]] have [[Superman]] hold a very large object while they make adjustments on it. In "I Am Legion", he, Superman and [[Shayera Hol|Shayera]] try to find out what happened to [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]], as he had escaped into a wall. Superman asks Aztek to scan the wall to see if he can find out where he went, but when he finishes, he has no luck on finding out where he went. [[King Faraday]] then appears behind the trio and introduces himself to Aztek.<br> Aztek also made brief, non-speaking appearances in "The Greatest Story Never Told," "Ultimatum," "Dark Heart," "The Balance," "Panic in the Sky," "Divided We Fall," and "Destroyer." An action figure in Aztek's animated likeness was first produced in 2005 in [[Mattel|Mattel's]] [[DC Superheroes: Justice League Unlimited (toy)|JLU toyline]], and Aztek made several appearances in the Justice League Unlimited tie-in comic book.
