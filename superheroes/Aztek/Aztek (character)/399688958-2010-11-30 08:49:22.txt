==Fictional character biography==
Uno is raised from childhood by a secret organization named the Q Society to be the champion of the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] to battle their enemy, the Aztec god, [[Tezcatlipoca (DC Comics)|Tezcatlipoca]]. He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities.<ref name="dc-ency"/>.

Aztek later joins the [[Justice League]]<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref>, but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is [[supervillain]] [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''JLA'' #15 (February 1998)</ref> He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet-destroying machine [[Mageddon]], (apparently, the 'Tezcatlipoca' that the cult was referring to all along.) Aztek, ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the [[World War III (comics)#JLA|World War III]].<ref>''JLA'' #41 (May 2000)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning. He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a "four-dimensional mirror"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels. The four-dimensional power source could self destruct in a highly explosive manner.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
A younger black female Aztek, with the same abilities, was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during "''The Rock of Ages''" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an [[alternate future]] overrun by [[Darkseid]]. She sacrifices her life to destroy Darkseid's lunar facilities.

===Television===
*Aztek appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', mostly appearing in brief cameos throughout the series. He had brief, uncredited speaking parts in the episodes "Question Authority" and "I Am Legion", portrayed by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]] and [[Corey Burton]], respectively. After making a very brief appearance in "Question Authority", he made a more significant appearance in "I Am Legion" where he helped Superman and [[Shayera Hol]] investigate where Lex Luthor had gone after escaping prison. Superman asked Aztek to scan the scene to see if he could find out where Luthor went, but had no luck after finishing his scan. [[King Faraday]] then appeared behind the trio and introduced himself to Aztek.

===Toys===
*An action figure in Aztek's animated likeness was first produced in 2005 in [[Mattel|Mattel's]] [[DC Superheroes: Justice League Unlimited (toy)|JLU toyline]], and Aztek made several appearances in the Justice League Unlimited tie-in comic book. An Aztek figure was also included as part of the ''Justice League'' expansion to the miniatures game [[HeroClix]].
