'''Texas Twister''' is a fictional [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Biography==
'''Drew Daniels''' was working on a cattle ranch when he was caught up in a [[tornado]]. At the same time, he was bombarded with [[radiation|radioactive]] particles that had been released from a nearby [[nuclear reactor]]. The net effect was to give him the power to generate tornadoes at will.

Calling himself Texas Twister, he answered a newspaper ad placed by [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|The Wizard]] to fill a vacancy in the [[Frightful Four]]. When he discovered they were criminals, Twister declined membership and instead applied to join the Super-Agent program being developed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. However, two of the four super-agent trainees turned out to be traitors and the program was disbanded.

Twister decided to use his powers to earn a living and joined a [[rodeo]]. There he met [[Shooting Star (comics)|Shooting Star]], who would become his partner both professionally and personally. Trying to garner publicity for themselves, Star and Twister answered a summons from [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], seeking the help of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] in containing a rampage by the [[Incredible Hulk|Hulk]]. The pair met up with [[Firebird (comics)|Firebird]], [[Phantom Rider|Night Rider]] and [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]], and the five decided to continue to work together as [[Rangers (comics)|The Rangers]]. However, because of the geographical separation among the members, the Rangers didn't last long.

At some point, Shooting Star was replaced by a demon working on behalf of [[Master Pandemonium]]. Following that revelation, Texas Twister embarked on a search for her.

==Powers==
Texas Twister has the [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] ability to accelerate air molecules to high velocity, forming tornadoes. Although he usually creates the tornado with himself at the center, he can create tornadoes up to 100 feet away from his body. He can create a tornado 200 feet in diameter with outer winds moving at speeds up to 225 MPH. By surrounding himself with tornado-force winds, he can fly.

Texas Twister is an expert rodeo rider.
