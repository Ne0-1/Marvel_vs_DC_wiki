'''Texas Twister''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] who appears in books published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Drew Daniels''' was born in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. He is working at a cattle ranch when a [[tornado]] and radiation from a nearby [[nuclear reactor]] affect him at the same time. The net effect was to give him the power to generate tornadoes at will.

Calling himself Texas Twister, he answers a newspaper ad placed by [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|The Wizard]] to fill a vacancy in the [[Frightful Four]]. When he discovers they would not pay him to join, Twister declined membership and instead accepts the offer to join the Super-Agent program being developed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. However, two of the four super-agent trainees ([[Blue Streak (comics)#Blue Streak I|Blue Streak]] and the [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp]]) turn out to be traitors and the program was disbanded. 
Twister decides to use his powers to earn a living and joined Cody's [[Rodeo]] Extravaganza. There he meets [[Shooting Star (comics)|Shooting Star]], who would become his partner both professionally and personally. Trying to garner publicity for themselves, Star and Twister answer a summons from [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], seeking the help of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] in containing a rampage by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The pair meet up with [[Firebird (comics)|Firebird]], [[Hamilton Slade (Rangers)|Night Rider]] and [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]], and the five decided to continue to work together as The [[Rangers (comics)| Rangers]]. However, because of the geographical separation among the members, the Rangers did not last long.

Shooting Star's identity was at some point taken over by an unnamed demon in the employ of [[Master Pandemonium]], who believed Firebird to be one of the possessors of his fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to him before he had completed his study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatches the demon to take Shooting Star's place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with her guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes. This serves to bring the demon out of hiding. The demon claims that Shooting Star was a human guise it had taken long before, that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium. For his own unrevealed reasons, the Texas Twister did not accompany them. 

Soon, however, Texas Twister returns to the Avengers Compound at a time when [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declares his love for the demon, which turns back into Shooting Star. Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to him months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making him afraid that he'd lose Shooting Star if their rodeo act broke up on account of his lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for his soul, and the Twister agreed, but after his powers were restored he begged to be spared. The demon then takes over Shooting Star instead. The demon proceeds to cast a spell that prevents Twister from telling anyone about this. The spell did not prevent Twister from researching the occult on his own; this is how he finds a way to break the demon's original spell.

The demon then possesses Twister himself and battles Hawkeye and Shooting Star. Ultimately, Star threatens to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisons itself in a statue. Texas Twister and Shooting Star were finally reunited.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
During the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Texas Twister was recruited by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to help round up un-registed superheroes as a way of working off the public properties he accidentally destroyed when he was drunk.<ref>Civil War Files</ref>

Weeks after the conclusion to the Civil War event, Texas Twister was seen as a member of Texas' new government-sponsored superhero team, the revived [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]], as part of the [[50 States Initiative]] Program.

Using a floating base called a 'Terrorcarrier', [[HYDRA]] attacks [[Crawford, Texas]], a vacation spot for the President of the United States. In ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #2 he and his fellow Rangers join a large group of heroes in attacking the carrier. Twister is injured in the firefight.

==Powers and abilities==
Texas Twister has the [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] ability to accelerate air molecules to high velocity, forming tornadoes. Although he usually creates the tornado with himself at the center, he can create tornadoes up to 100 feet away from his body. He can create a tornado 200 feet in diameter with outer winds moving at speeds up to 225 MPH. By sustaining a stable column of fast rotating air around the lower half of his body, he can fly.

Texas Twister is an expert rodeo rider.

==In other media==
Texas Twister appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "The Cure" as one of the heroes auditioning to fill in for [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].  He ended up accidentally destroying the headquarters when he triggered one of his twisters.
