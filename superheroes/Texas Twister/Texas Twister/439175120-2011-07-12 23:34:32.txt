'''Texas Twister''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] that appears in publications from [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Drew Daniels''' was born in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. He is working as a cattle hand at a ranch when a [[tornado]] and radiation from a nearby [[nuclear reactor]] affect him at the same time. The net effect was to give him the power to generate tornadoes at will.

Calling himself Texas Twister, he answers a newspaper ad placed by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] to fill a vacancy in the [[Frightful Four]]. When he discovers they would not pay him to join, Twister declined membership.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #177</ref> He instead accepts the offer to join the Super-Agent program being developed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. When he tries out for the program, he spars with [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #217</ref> He was later seen sparring with Captain America again; however, two of the four super-agent trainees ([[Blue Streak (comics)#Blue Streak I (Don Thompson)|Blue Streak]] and the [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp]]) turn out to be traitors, so the Texas Twister quits and the program was disbanded.<ref>''Captain America'' #229</ref>

Twister decides to use his powers to earn a living and joined Cody's [[Rodeo]] Extravaganza as a rodeo performer. There he meets [[Shooting Star (comics)|Shooting Star]], who would become his partner both professionally and personally. Trying to garner publicity for themselves, Star and Twister answer a summons from [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], seeking the help of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in containing a rampage by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The pair meet up with [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]], [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Night Rider]] and [[Red Wolf (comics)#William Talltrees|Red Wolf]], and after they rescued Rick Jones from the [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]], the five decided to continue to work together as the team of adventurers known as the [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]].<ref name="IH">{{Cite comic

Shooting Star's identity was at some point taken over by a demon named Riglevio in the employ of [[Master Pandemonium]], who believed Firebird to be one of the possessors of his fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to him before he had completed his study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatches the demon to take Shooting Star's place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with her guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes. This serves to bring the demon out of hiding. The demon claims that Shooting Star was a human guise it had taken long before, and that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium. For his own unrevealed reasons, the Texas Twister did not accompany them.<ref> {{Cite comic  | Writer = Steve Englehart  | Penciller = Al Milgrom | Inker = Joe Sinnott  | Story = A Bird In The Hand | Title = West Coast Avengers  | Volume = 2  | Issue = 8  | Date = May 1986  | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  | Page =   | Panel =   | ID =  }}</ref>

Soon, however, Texas Twister returns to the Avengers Compound at a time when [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declares his love for the demon, which turns back into Shooting Star. Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to him months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making him afraid that he'd lose Shooting Star if their rodeo act broke up on account of his lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for his soul, and the Twister agreed, but after his powers were restored he begged to be spared. The demon then takes over Shooting Star instead. The demon proceeds to cast a spell that prevents Twister from telling anyone about this. The spell did not prevent Twister from researching the occult on his own; this is how he finds a way to break the demon's original spell. After exorcising the demon from Shooting Star, the demon then possesses Twister himself and battles Hawkeye and Shooting Star. Ultimately, Star threatens to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisons itself in a statue. Texas Twister and Shooting Star are finally reunited.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #18</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Texas Twister was recruited by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to help round up un-registered superheroes as a way of working off the public properties he accidentally destroyed when he was drunk.<ref>''Civil War Files''</ref>

Weeks after the conclusion to the Civil War event, Texas Twister was seen as a member of Texas' new government-sponsored superhero team, the revived [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]], as part of the [[50 States Initiative]] Program.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Mark Millar | Penciller = Steve McNiven | Inker = Dexter Vines | Story =  | Title = Civil War | Volume = 1 | Issue = 7  | Date =  | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

Using a floating base called a 'Terrorcarrier', [[HYDRA]] attacks [[Crawford, Texas]], a vacation spot for the President of the United States. He and his fellow Rangers join a large group of heroes in attacking the carrier. Twister is injured in the firefight. The carrier is destroyed and the President is unharmed. <ref>{{Cite comic  | Writer = Dan Slott  | Penciller = Stefano Caselli | Inker = Stefano Caselli  | Story = Hero Moment  | Title = Avengers: The Initiative | Volume = 1 | Issue = 2 | Date = June 2007  | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Texas Twister was with the Rangers when they, [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]], and [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]] were fighting a Skrull that was posing as Lobo.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanks to bombardment by radioactive particles during a tornado, Texas Twister has the [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] ability to accelerate air molecules to high velocity, thereby creating a tornado-like mass of swirling wind around him. Although he usually creates the tornado with himself at the center, he can create tornadoes up to {{convert|100|ft|m}} away from his body. He can control the size of the tornado at will and can create a tornado {{convert|200|ft|m}} in diameter with outer winds moving at speeds up to {{convert|225|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Such a wind swirling about his body is capable of lifting him off the ground and supporting him in midair. He has superhuman reflexes, and various abilities enabling him to withstand the rigors of motion inside a tornado, such as denser skin to prevent unwanted heat loss, friction burns, and particle abrasions, enhanced eyesight, and a high degree of resistance to dizziness and motion sickness.

Texas Twister is an expert rodeo rider, lasso thrower, and sharpshooter.  He has also undergone [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] unarmed combat training.
