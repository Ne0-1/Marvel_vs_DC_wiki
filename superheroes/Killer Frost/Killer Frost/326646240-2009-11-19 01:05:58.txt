'''Killer Frost''' is the name of two [[fictional characters]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe. They are both [[supervillain]]s that appear mainly as foes of the [[superhero]] [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].

==Crystal Frost==
'''Crystal Frost''' first appeared in ''Firestorm'' #3 (June 1978). While Crystal Frost was studying to be a scientist in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher, Martin Stein. While working on a project in the Arctic, Frost was upset to learn that Stein didn't reciprocate her feelings. Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber, but somehow survived. She was transformed in a way that she was able to absorb heat from a living being and project cold and ice. Calling herself Killer Frost, she began her murderous crusade against men and clashed with Firestorm on many occasions.<ref name="dc-fire">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Firestorm | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 123  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Frost eventually died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.

Crystal has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. Her body is later revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

==Louise Lincoln==
===Origin===
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' first appeared in ''Firestorm (vol. 2)'' # 21 (March 1984). She was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend died, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the new Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm, whom she blamed for Frost's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron]] for more power.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Killer Frost attacked Hawaii, freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (comics)|Knockout]].

Killer Frost was later freed by [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]] and the two had a brief flirtatious partnership before she was apprehended by [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]].

===D.C. and Chicago===

Killer Frost was one of many [[supervillain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by President [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], whom he considered treasonous. This takes place in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc. She teams with [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes in Washington D.C., but all four were defeated. They attack in a second wave, along with more villains such as [[Giganta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] but a similar backup of superheroes batter them all into submission. It was later discover that this ice-themed team of villains was being mind controlled by [[Gorilla Grodd]] in ''[[Superman/Batman]] #3''. 

[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] hires Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)|Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] is being held. Green Arrow stops Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she is soundly defeated by ''Green Arrow'' (Volume 3) #54-55.

===One Year Later and Countdown===
Killer Frost was later seen in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', battling the [[Firestorm (Jason Rusch)|new Firestorm]], until [[Lex Luthor]], [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] arrived, subdued Firestorm, and invited her to join the new [[Injustice League]]. She is currently seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.

In DC Universe #0 she can seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains. She is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

==Powers and abilities==
Both versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold. Using these powers Killer Frost can create an ice-sheen across her entire body, and generate objects composed completely of ice, such as projectiles (ice daggers) and defensive walls. She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact. In the [[video game]] ''[[Justice League Chronicles]]'', [[Eclipso]] noted that Killer Frost was the only one with a heart dark enough to free him from his prison.

==Other versions==
* Killer Frost (Crystal Frost) appeared along with [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Captain Cold]], [[Minister Blizzard]], [[Cryonic Man]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], [[Polar Lord]], and [[Snowman (comics)|Snowman]] in ''[[Justice League Adventures]]''.
* Killer Frost has appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' spin-off comic book. Her appearance is in issue #21.

==Other media==
===Television===
Killer Frost appears in the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. She is motivated by a base desire to kill people, and doesn't seem to care who she serves so long as she is afforded the opportunity to do so. She joins [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] in the episode of the same name, relishing the chance to kill [[Morgan Edge]] when the rest of the team is distracted examining the canisters containing the Secret Society's latest recruit, [[Clayface]] (Matt Hagen). They were eventually defeated.

In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', she rejoined Grodd's Secret Society. She was sent with [[Black Manta#In Other Media|Devil Ray]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], and [[Giganta]] to a mountain to steal a [[Viking]] ship frozen in a glacier. The ship held the remains of a Viking prince that were believed to hold the key to invincibility. When an avalanche threatened a nearby lodge, she was forced by the [[Martian Manhunter]] to save the people there. Later, when the Secret Society rioted on the way to Brainiac's former lair, she joined the faction loyal to Grodd, but was defeated by [[Toyman]]. After the rioting subsided, Luthor demanded "one good reason" why any of the rebellious faction should be allowed to live. With no hesitation, she froze the half of the Secret Society that had opposed Luthor. Satisfied, Luthor replied, "You've got a future." She subsequently appears as one of the Legion members who survive [[Darkseid]]'s resurrection and ends up fighting alongside the Justice League in their struggle against Darkseid's forces.

A possible version of Killer Frost appears in ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. Here, Dora Smithy, the sister of [[Nora Fries]], was very close to her until her sister married [[Mr. Freeze|Victor Fries]]. She tried to be happy for them until Nora got sick. Dora felt that her sister should be allowed to die in peace. Victor, on the other hand, would not allow it. This, combined with his later transformation into Mr. Freeze, led her to desire to put away all costumed villains for good. Her eventual plan led to her falling into a chemical bath at an abandoned ice cream factory. She was then put into "cold storage". It's unclear however if the bath made her like Freeze or Frost. However some fans believe that Dora is the JLU's version of Killer Frost due to the explanation of Frost's powers, similar vicious personalities, and having the same voice actress.

===Film===
[[Jennifer Hale]] reprises her role of Killer Frost in the Direct To Video Animated Film [[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]. It should be noted that this version of Killer Frost is not the same as the DCAU one mentioned above, although she is based upon the same incarnation from the comics that her DCAU version was.

===Video games===
Killer Frost is featured in the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'', played by [[Nika Futterman]]. Killer Frost is also set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

==Notes==
* The [[comic book]] reference series, ''Who's Who: The Definitive Guide to the DC Universe (Volume 1) #12'' erroneously lists Louise Lincoln's first appearance as taking place in ''Firestorm'' Volume 2 #20. In fact, Louise Lincoln did not appear until issue #21 of the series. She did not begin using the name "Killer Frost" until issue #34.
