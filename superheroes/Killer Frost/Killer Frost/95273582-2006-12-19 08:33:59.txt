'''Killer Frost''' is the name of two [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s, mainly as foes of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].

==Crystal Frost==
'''Crystal Frost''' first appeared in ''Firestorm #3'' (June 1978). While Crystal Frost was studying to be a scientist in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher, Martin Stein. While working on a project in the Arctic, Frost was upset to learn that Stein didn't like her in that way. Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber, but somehow survived. She was transformed in a way that she is able to absorb heat from a living being and project the cold and ice. Now calling herself Killer Frost, she began her murderous crusade against men and has clashed with Firestorm on many occasions. Frost died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.

==Louise Lincoln==
===Origin===
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' first appeared in ''Firestorm (vol. 2)'' # 20 (March 1984). She was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend died, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the new Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm, who she blamed for Frost's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron]] for more power.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Killer Frost attacked Hawaii, freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (modern)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (comics)|Knockout]].

Killer Frost was later freed by [[Effigy (comics)|Effigy]] and the two had a brief flirtatious partnership before she was apprehended by [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]].

===Recent activities===
{{spoiler}}

Killer Frost was one of many [[super-villain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by President [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], whom he considered treasonous. She teamed with [[Mister Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes, but all four were defeated. It was later discover that this ice themed team of villains was being mind controlled by [[Gorilla Grodd]]. ''[[Superman/Batman]] #3''. 

[[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] hired Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where [[Doctor Light (DC Comics superheroine)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] was being held. Green Arrow stopped Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she was soundly defeated by ''Green Arrow'' (Volume 3) #54-55.

==Other media==
* Killer Frost has appeared in episodes of the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. She joined [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] only because she wanted to kill. She was the one responsible for freezing and killing [[Morgan Edge]] when the Secret Society were looking in Morgan Edge's mansion for the canisters containing the Secret Society's latest recruit...[[Clayface]] (Matt Hagen). They were eventually defeated, though.

* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', she rejoined Grodd's [[Legion of Doom]]. She was sent with [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], and [[Giganta]] to a mountain to steal a [[Viking]] ship frozen in a glacier that contain a Viking Prince that may held the key to immortality. When an avalanche threatened a nearby lodge, she was forced by the [[Martian Manhunter]] to stop the snow from killing the people there. Later, when the Legion rioted on the way to [[Apokolips]], she joined the faction loyal to Grodd, but was defeated by [[Toyman]]. After the rioting subsided, she froze the half of the Legion that had opposed Luthor, who replied "You've got a future."
* A possible version of Killer Frost appears in [[Gotham Girls]].
* Killer Frost is featured in the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'', played by [[Nika Futterman]].

==Notes==
* The [[comic book]] reference series, ''Who's Who: The Definitive Guide to the DC Universe (Volume 1) #12'' erroneously lists Louise Lincoln's first appearance as taking place in ''Firestorm'' Volume 2 #20. In fact, Louise Lincoln did not appear until issue #21 of the series. She did not begin using the name "Killer Frost" until issue #34.
