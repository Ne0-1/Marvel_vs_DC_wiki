'''Killer Frost''' is a name used by several fictional [[supervillainess|supervillainesses]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character has appeared in various incarnations, with several different individuals in the [[DC Universe]] assuming the Killer Frost persona. Killer Frost appears mainly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].

==Fictional character biographies==

===Crystal Frost===
'''Crystal Frost''' was the first incarnation, appearing in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' #3 (June 1978). While Frost was studying to be a [[scientist]] in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher, Martin Stein. While working on a project in the [[Arctic]], Frost was upset to learn that Stein did not reciprocate her feelings (for his part, Stein told a fellow researcher that he had noticed that Crystal was a withdrawn student of his and he merely tried to draw her out of her shell, which Crystal completely misinterpreted). Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber but survived, being transformed in a way in which she was able to absorb heat from a living being and project cold and ice. Calling herself "Killer Frost", she began her murderous crusade against men and clashed with Firestorm on many occasions.<ref name="dc-fire">{{Citation|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Firestorm|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 123|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Killer Frost eventually died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) # 21</ref> Crystal has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1</ref> Her body was reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

===Louise Lincoln===
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' is the second incarnation; she first appeared in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #21 (March 1984) and used the "Killer Frost" name in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 1985). Lincoln was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend's death, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the new Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm, whom she blamed for Frost's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]] for more power.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Killer Frost attacked [[Hawaii]], freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]].

After a group of mobsters put out a hit on [[Lois Lane]], Killer Frost rescued her from [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], only to then leave the reporter bound and gagged on a set of train tracks, hoping to take the credit and reward for Lane's death. Her plan was foiled by [[Superman]] who rescued Lois before the train could hit her.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #182</ref>

Killer Frost was later freed when the DEO refrigeration truck transporting her crashed. [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]] happened upon the crash and she discovered the heat from his pyrokinetic abilities enabled her to kiss him without freezing him over. The two had a brief flirtatious partnership that dissolved when Effigy lost patience with her lecturing him on how to defeat [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]]. After Green Lantern buried them both under a mountain of snow, Effigy escaped and abandoned her to be apprehended again.<ref>'''Green Lantern''' (vol. 3) #127</ref>

In the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc, Killer Frost was one of many [[supervillain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction Superman and [[Batman]], whom he considered treasonous. She teamed with [[Mr. Freeze|Mister Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] (Cameron Mahkent) and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes in Washington D.C., but all four were defeated. They attacked in a second wave, along with more villains such as [[Giganta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]], but a similar backup of superheroes battered them all into submission. It was later discovered in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 that this ice-themed team of villains was being mind controlled by Grodd.

[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] hired Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] was being held. Green Arrow stopped Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she was defeated in ''Green Arrow'' (Volume 3) #54-55.

Around this time, Lincoln discovered that she had contracted cancer, and tricked Jason Rusch, the new Firestorm, into curing her. With her health and powers restored Killer Frost went on a rampage, only to be defeated when Jason used his abilities to reverse his alterations to Lincoln's body, returning her cancer.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #9–10</ref>

Killer Frost returned during the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', where she had apparently entered into a relationship with Mr. Freeze. Together, the two villains went on a killing spree in [[Manhattan]], hoping to draw Firestorm into an elaborate trap. Once the hero arrived, Killer Frost used a device to send both of them into space, where she sought to absorb the heat energy of the sun. Firestorm narrowly managed to stop her plan, and both Killer Frost and Mister Freeze were taken into custody by Batman. As they were being sent away, Killer Frost angrily revealed to Mister Freeze that she had only been using him as a pawn, and had no romantic interest in him.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #24–25</ref>

Killer Frost was later seen battling Firestorm in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'' until Lex Luthor, [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] arrived, subdued Firestorm, and invited Killer Frost to join the new [[Injustice League]]. She then appeared in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where she was sent to the Prison Planet after having been defeated and captured by the [[Suicide Squad (comics)|Suicide Squad]].

In DC Universe #0, she was seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. She is later seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], and ultimately helped deal the killing blow to the crazed supervillain Junior and the troubled vigilante known as the [[Catalina Flores|Tarantula]].<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #6–7</ref> A short time after this encounter with the Secret Six, Killer Frost appeared as one of the participants in a metahuman fighting tournament in Tokyo. She was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Black Canary]], who had disguised themselves as villains in order to take down the tournament from the inside.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #35</ref>

===<span id="CaitlinSnow"></span>Caitlin Snow===
In September 2013, as the "Villains Month" part of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline during ''[[The New 52]]'', Killer Frost was featured in the one-shot ''[[Justice League#Justice League of America (vol. 3)|Justice League of America]]'' #7.2, also titled ''Killer Frost'' #1.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Bryan|title=Exclusive: Which Villains Are Taking Over the Justice League?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-young/exclusive-which-villains-_b_3385124.html?utm_hp_ref=tw|publisher=Huffington Post|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref> She can also be seen on the cover of ''[[Forever Evil]]'' #1, which hints at her involvement in that series. The issue revealed this is yet another version of Killer Frost, '''Dr. Caitlin Snow''', a scientist sent to S.T.A.R. Labs Outpost #72 in the [[Arctic]] to work on a thermodynamic engine whose creator had committed suicide. Snow soon discovered the place had been infiltrated by [[H.I.V.E.]] agents. When they tried to kill her inside the engine, Snow frantically ripped off the coolant system, merging her body with ice. Transformed into a heat vampire, she killed the H.I.V.E. agents and continued to search for other sources of heat, eventually discovering that Firestorm's blasts can temporarily heal her condition. When he was declared dead by the Crime Syndicate, she lost hope for a cure.<ref>''Justice League of America: Killer Frost'' Vol. 3 #7.2 (November 2013)</ref>

In [[DC Rebirth]], Caitlin Snow is taken to Belle Reve Penitentiary where she is introduced to the Suicide Squad and offered a place on the team by [[Amanda Waller]]. She accepts and joins the team. She helps the Suicide Squad in their fight against the [[Justice League]]. Afterwards she will be joining the new Justice League of American made up of [[Batman]], [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|the Atom]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], [[Black Canary]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|the Ray]].

==Powers and abilities==
All versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold. Using these powers, Killer Frost can create an ice-sheen across her entire body and generate objects composed completely of ice, such as projectiles and defensive walls. She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact, and is unable to touch a normal person without freezing them. Her weakness is the need to absorb external heat sources to generate ice: she can be imprisoned in cold surroundings such as being locked in a refrigeration truck or buried under a mountain of snow.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Louise Lincoln version of Killer Frost appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].

In the latter series, Killer Frost rejoins Grodd's Secret Society and was sent with [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Giganta]] to a mountain to steal a [[Viking]] ship frozen in a glacier.

When an avalanche threatened a nearby lodge, Killer Frost was forced by the [[Martian Manhunter]] to save the people there. Later, when the Secret Society mutinied on the way to [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s former lair, she joined Grodd's faction but was defeated by [[Toyman]].

In season one, she and [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] are part of the [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]-based [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] team which supports [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as the Flash. In season one, she struggles with her fiancee [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]]'s apparent death in the particle accelerator blast which created the Flash and other meta-humans, but later discovers Ronnie survived and became part of the powerful fire-based superhero Firestorm. Caitlin and Ronnie marry in season one's finale, but Ronnie apparently dies shortly after in the season two premiere, helping close a destructive singularity over Central City. During season two, Caitlin grieves for Ronnie a second time and grows closer to the Flash of [[Earth-Two]], Jay Garrick, before the later revelation that he is in fact the evil Earth-2 speedster [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]] posing as the real [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]. She also meets her Earth-Two doppelganger, an ice-based supervillain named Killer Frost who is later killed by Zoom, and wonders at what this means for her own capacity to do evil. In the "Flashpoint" timeline of the Season 3 opening episode, Caitlin is a children's eye doctor with no connections to Team Flash. Barry restores the original timeline but with subtle variations and Caitlin appears to be the least affected. However, she is revealed to be developing [[cryokinetic]] abilities that she is keeping secret from the team, and subsequent episodes reveal that she also is developing a [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity]]. In the episode ''The New Rogues'', she uses her powers for the first time to get Barry out of being trapped in a mirror by [[Mirror Master]].

Later, her mother advises her not to use her powers or her transformation will become irreversible.<ref>The Season 3 episode 5</ref> She eventually reveals her powers to Cisco, who uses his powers and sees the two of them fighting each other in the future as Vibe and Killer Frost. Cisco forces her to reveal her powers to the rest of Team Flash to avoid hiding it until the time comes. Barry tells Caitlin that her powers are a result of the changed timeline, which angers her.<ref>The Season 3 episode 6</ref> In "Killer Frost", Caitlin nearly gives into her Killer Frost persona and threatens the lives of Barry, Cisco, and multiple others in order to find Doctor Alchemy, hoping he can take away her powers. After imprisoning her, Barry tells Caitlin she can leave only if she kills him, knowing that the real Caitlin is underneath the cold exterior. Caitlin returns to normal self and puts herself in the meta-human cuffs to restrain her evil side from coming out. Barry sacrifices his job as a forensic scientist in order to keep her secret from the police.

She also finds Mister Freeze's gun and uses it briefly to fight Batman, but has trouble lifting it and ends up leaving it behind after the fight. Later, Killer Frost is one of the Suicide Squad members who has her bomb defused by the Riddler. Only [[King Shark]] (who Frost formed a relationship with) and Black Spider (who wasn't with the Squad because of Batman) are killed by Waller, when she learns what they've done.
