'''Killer Frost''' is a name used by several fictional female supervillains and superheroes appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character has appeared in various incarnations, with several different individuals in the [[DC Universe]] assuming the Killer Frost persona. Killer Frost appeared formerly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] but is now a member of the new Justice League of America that started with the [[DC Rebirth]] in 2016.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Crystal Frost===
'''Crystal Frost''' was the first incarnation, appearing in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' #3 (June 1978). While Frost was studying to be a [[scientist]] in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher, Martin Stein. While working on a project in the [[Arctic]], Frost was upset to learn that Stein did not reciprocate her feelings (for his part, Stein told a fellow researcher that he had noticed that Crystal was a withdrawn student of his and he merely tried to draw her out of her shell, which Crystal completely misinterpreted). Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber but survived, being transformed in a way in which she was able to absorb heat from a living being and project cold and ice. Calling herself "Killer Frost", she began her murderous crusade against men and clashed with Firestorm on many occasions.<ref name="dc-fire">{{Citation|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Firestorm|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 123|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Killer Frost eventually died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) # 21</ref> Crystal has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1</ref> Her body was reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

===Louise Lincoln===
[[File:Killer Frost (Louise Lincoln).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Louise Lincoln as Killer Frost. {{Descript-inner-art|Underworld Unleashed: Patterns of Fear|1|1|November 1995 |art = [[Tom Grummett]]|pub=DC}}]]
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' is the second incarnation; she first appeared in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #21 (March 1984) and used the "Killer Frost" name in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 1985). Lincoln was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend's death, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the new Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm, whom she blamed for Frost's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] for more power.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Killer Frost attacked [[Hawaii]], freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]].

After a group of mobsters put out a hit on [[Lois Lane]], Killer Frost rescued her from [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], only to then leave the reporter bound and gagged on a set of train tracks, hoping to take the credit and reward for Lane's death. Her plan was foiled by [[Superman]] who rescued Lois before the train could hit her.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #182</ref>

Killer Frost was later freed when the DEO refrigeration truck transporting her crashed. [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]] happened upon the crash and she discovered the heat from his pyrokinetic abilities enabled her to kiss him without freezing him over. The two had a brief flirtatious partnership that dissolved when Effigy lost patience with her lecturing him on how to defeat [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]]. After Green Lantern buried them both under a mountain of snow, Effigy escaped and abandoned her to be apprehended again.<ref>'''Green Lantern''' (vol. 3) #127</ref>

In the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc, Killer Frost was one of many [[supervillain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction Superman and [[Batman]], whom he considered treasonous. She teamed with [[Mr. Freeze|Mister Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] (Cameron Mahkent) and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes in Washington D.C., but all four were defeated. They attacked in a second wave, along with more villains such as [[Giganta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]], but a similar backup of superheroes battered them all into submission. It was later discovered in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 that this ice-themed team of villains was being mind controlled by Grodd.

[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] hired Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] was being held. Green Arrow stopped Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she was defeated in ''Green Arrow'' (Volume 3) #54-55.

Around this time, Lincoln discovered that she had contracted cancer, and tricked Jason Rusch, the new Firestorm, into curing her. With her health and powers restored Killer Frost went on a rampage, only to be defeated when Jason used his abilities to reverse his alterations to Lincoln's body, returning her cancer.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #9–10</ref>

Killer Frost returned during the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', where she had apparently entered into a relationship with Mr. Freeze. Together, the two villains went on a killing spree in [[Manhattan]], hoping to draw Firestorm into an elaborate trap. Once the hero arrived, Killer Frost used a device to send both of them into space, where she sought to absorb the heat energy of the sun. Firestorm narrowly managed to stop her plan, and both Killer Frost and Mister Freeze were taken into custody by Batman. As they were being sent away, Killer Frost angrily revealed to Mister Freeze that she had only been using him as a pawn, and had no romantic interest in him.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #24–25</ref>

Killer Frost was later seen battling Firestorm in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'' until Lex Luthor, [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] arrived, subdued Firestorm, and invited Killer Frost to join the new [[Injustice League]]. She then appeared in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where she was sent to the Prison Planet after having been defeated and captured by the [[Suicide Squad (comics)|Suicide Squad]].

In DC Universe #0, she was seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. She is later seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], and ultimately helped deal the killing blow to the crazed supervillain Junior and the troubled vigilante known as the [[Catalina Flores|Tarantula]].<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #6–7</ref> A short time after this encounter with the Secret Six, Killer Frost appeared as one of the participants in a metahuman fighting tournament in Tokyo. She was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Black Canary]], who had disguised themselves as villains in order to take down the tournament from the inside.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #35</ref>

===<span id="CaitlinSnow"></span>Caitlin Snow===
[[File:Killer Frost (Caitlin Snow).jpg|thumb|upright|Caitlin Snow as Killer Frost. {{Descript-cvr-art|Justice League of America: Killer Frost|1|1|January 2017|pub=DC|art=[[Ivan Reis]]}}]]
In September 2013, as the "Villains Month" part of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline during ''[[The New 52]]'', Killer Frost was featured in the one-shot ''[[Justice League#Justice League of America (vol. 3)|Justice League of America]]'' #7.2, also titled ''Killer Frost'' #1.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Bryan|title=Exclusive: Which Villains Are Taking Over the Justice League?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-young/exclusive-which-villains-_b_3385124.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref> She can also be seen on the cover of ''[[Forever Evil]]'' #1, which hints at her involvement in that series. The issue revealed this is yet another version of Killer Frost, '''Dr. Caitlin Snow''', a scientist sent to S.T.A.R. Labs Outpost #72 in the [[Arctic]] to work on a thermodynamic engine whose creator had committed suicide. Snow soon discovered the place had been infiltrated by [[H.I.V.E.]] agents. When they tried to kill her inside the engine, Snow frantically ripped off the coolant system, merging her body with ice. Transformed into a heat vampire, she killed the H.I.V.E. agents out of revenge. She then wandered out into the cold until she came across a Norwegian camp and took their heat too. Hijacking a helicopter, she made it back to her hometown [[Pittsburgh]]. She even created a suit that helped her retain heat for longer. She later encountered the superhero [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and discovered that his powers could temporarily heal her mutation. She tried recreating the Firestorm Nuclear Matrix several times, only to fail with each attempt. When Firestorm and the Justice League were declared dead by the Crime Syndicate, she lost hope for a cure to her condition.<ref>''Justice League of America: Killer Frost'' Vol. 3 #7.2 (November 2013)</ref>

Killer Frost later has a scientist named Byte track down [[Martin Stein]], the original creator of the Firestorm Matrix, to his secluded cabin while he had gone into hiding during the Crime Syndicate's takeover of Earth. She encountered [[Steve Trevor]] who was sent there on a mission to try to find the Justice League who were imprisoned inside Firestorm. Learning he was alive, Snow allied herself with the two men to find them. Soon they were attacked by supervillains [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]], [[Black Bison]], [[Hyena (comics)|Hyena]], [[Tempest (DC Comics)|Tempest]] and [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]] for betraying the Syndicate. While fighting them off, Stein, Trevor and Frost teleported to another A.R.G.U.S. base where they learned that to free the Justice League, they needed [[Wonder Woman]]'s Lasso of Truth. Discovering [[Cheetah (DC Comics)|Cheetah]] was keeping it as a trophy, they found her and her Menagerie, but were subdued. [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)]] suddenly appeared and blasted everyone except Frost and Trevor unconscious. After defeating him, they managed to deliver the Lasso of Truth to [[Cyborg (DC Comics)|Cyborg]] who successfully used it to free his teammates.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #1-6</ref>

====DC Rebirth====
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
In [[DC Rebirth]], Caitlin Snow is taken to Belle Reve Penitentiary where she is introduced to the Suicide Squad and offered a place on the team by [[Amanda Waller]]. She accepts and joins the team. She helps the Suicide Squad in their fight against the [[Justice League]], but subsequently assists them against [[Maxwell Lord]] when he is possessed by [[Eclipso]], whose attempt to tap into her 'darkest desire' only unlocks her desire to make a difference. Afterwards, Waller is forced to release Snow into Batman's custody.<ref>''Justice League vs. Suicide Squad'' #6</ref> She then joined the new Justice League of America made up of [[Batman]], [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Atom]] IV, [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], [[Black Canary]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|Ray]] II.

==Powers and abilities==
All versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold. Using these powers, Killer Frost can create an ice-sheen across her entire body that grants her increased durability, cause intense blizzards that can instantly freeze the target and generate objects composed completely of ice, such as projectiles in the form of ice shards and defensive walls or shields. She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact and is unable to touch a normal person without freezing them.

Her weakness is the need to absorb external heat sources to generate ice: although heat based weapons such as flamethrowers only make her stronger, she can be imprisoned in cold surroundings such as being locked in a refrigeration truck or buried under a mountain of snow. The Caitlin Snow version of Killer Frost is constantly plagued by a hunger for heat, which can only be sated by absorbing the heat from a living being, a process which inevitably kills the victim. However, in recent stories she seems to have finally gotten it under control by only absorbing a tiny amount of heat from every person she touches, sparing them and leaving them otherwise unharmed. The Caitlin Snow and Louise Lincoln versions of the character have, albeit inconsistently, demonstrated the ability to fly, either by riding Arctic winds or through an unknown manner of self-propulsion.

While the exact limits of her abilities have yet to be established, how much power Frost can channel at once seems to depend on how much heat she has absorbed and stored in her body. For example, when she absorbed all the heat from Superman (whose body is supercharged by yellow solar energy) during a stand-off between the Justice League and the Suicide Squad, she was able to flash-freeze the entire League in a single blast.

It also seems that using up all the heat energy she has stored up at once can put Frost's life in danger. If she does not feed in time, she even risks dying of "starvation".

The Caitlin Snow version of Killer Frost also boasts a genius-level intellect, being S.T.A.R. Labs' youngest and brightest scientist prior to her transformation. She could solve complex equations easily, operate heavy energy generating machinery and appeared particularly skilled in the field of physics and research about energy. She once managed to create an ice prism with her powers that converted Superman's heat vision into a bright burst of sunlight to defeat Eclipso.

====Arrowverse====
[[File:Killer Frost (Danielle Panabaker).png|thumbnail|right|200px| Killer Frost, portrayed by [[Danielle Panabaker]] in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash'']].]]
[[Danielle Panabaker]] portrays Dr. Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost, a series regular on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' TV series, set within [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]] family of related shows. Caitlin debuted on ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and makes occasional guest appearances in that series and as well as ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''. In season one, she and [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] are part of the [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]-based [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] team which supports [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as the Flash. In season one, she struggles with her fiancée [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]]'s apparent death in the particle accelerator blast which created the Flash and other meta-humans, but later discovers Ronnie survived and became part of the powerful fire-based superhero Firestorm. Caitlin and Ronnie marry in season one's finale, but Ronnie apparently dies shortly after in the season two premiere, helping close a destructive singularity over Central City.

During season two, Caitlin grieves for Ronnie a second time and grows closer to the Flash of [[Earth-Two]], Jay Garrick, before the later revelation that he is in fact the evil Earth-2 speedster [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]] posing as the real [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]. She also meets her Earth-Two doppelganger, an ice-based supervillain named Killer Frost who is later killed by Zoom, and wonders at what this means for her own capacity to do evil.

In the "Flashpoint" timeline of the Season 3 opening episode, Caitlin is a children's eye doctor with no connections to Team Flash. Barry restores the original timeline but with subtle variations and Caitlin appears to be the least affected. However, she is revealed to be developing [[cryokinetic]] abilities that she is keeping secret from the team, and subsequent episodes reveal that she also is developing a second, villainous identity. In the episode "The New Rogues", she uses her powers for the first time to free Barry after he is trapped in a mirror by [[Mirror Master]]. By the end of the episode, Caitlin begins to physically transform into Killer Frost.<ref>The Flash Episode The New Rouges</ref> She goes to see her mother, Dr. Carla Tannhauser, who studies her powers, but is attacked by a crazed scientist and briefly assumes her Killer Frost persona while defending herself. Later, her mother advises her not to use her powers or her transformation will become irreversible.<ref>The Season 3 episode 5</ref> She eventually reveals her powers to Cisco, who uses his powers and sees the two of them fighting each other in the future as Vibe and Killer Frost. Cisco forces her to reveal her powers to the rest of Team Flash to avoid hiding it until the time comes. Barry tells Caitlin that her powers are a result of the changed timeline, which angers her.<ref>The Season 3 episode 6</ref> In "Killer Frost", Caitlin nearly gives into her Killer Frost persona and threatens the lives of Barry, Cisco, and multiple others in order to find Doctor Alchemy, hoping he can take away her powers, culminating in a confrontation with Julian Albert before Barry captures her. After imprisoning her, Barry tells Caitlin she can leave only if she kills him, knowing that the real Caitlin is underneath the cold exterior. Caitlin returns to normal self and puts herself in the meta-human cuffs to restrain her evil side from coming out. Barry sacrifices his job as a forensic scientist in order to keep her secret from the police, but he eventually gets his job back after they learn about Julian Albert's split-personality identity as Doctor Alchemy. When Barry takes a look six months into the future to learn more about Iris's death at the hands of speedster devil Savitar, he witnesses a headline that states 'Killer Frost still at large', reinforcing the team's goal of changing the future they witnessed. In the season 3 episode "Abra Kadabra", Catlin becomes a fully powered Killer Frost at the end of the episode<ref>http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/28/flash-killer-frost-return/</ref> While trying to save her life, Julian takes the power-suppressing necklace he gave her off her body, triggering the transformation. In episode 19, Savitar reveals who he is to Killer Frost, and once she sees his true face, she immediately becomes willing to listen to his offer. Also Killer Frost in the future tells Barry of this meeting. In the episode "I know who you are", Killer Frost displays a new ability to form an ice ramp, and attacks both Tracy Brand and Joe West's girlfriend to help Savitar. She also wounds The Flash but had to be saved by Savitar.<ref>http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/flash-finally-unmasks-savitar-it-worth-wait-254617</ref> When Team Flash try to stop Barry from making new memories it affects Savitar as well. Killer Frost goes to help the team get his memories back. She does help Barry gets his memories back and feels something of a change of heart as Killer Frost leaves Star Labs<ref>http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/05/03/the-flash-new-photos-barry-allen-3x21-cause-and-effect/</ref> In the season finale, Killer Frost battles the team again alongside Savitar, but in the end, turns against him rather than allow him to kill her former teammates. After Savitar is defeated, she tells the others that she is not Killer Frost, but is also no longer the Caitlin she was before, and is not yet ready to return to the team, leaving to rediscover herself.

When season 4 begins Catlin is working at a bar that has some underworld connections. Cisco asks her to help get Barry back. She does and then quits the bar showing her Killer Frost side ala Jekyll and Hyde when Catlin meets resistance.<ref>http://ew.com/recap/the-flash-season-4-premiere/</ref> In episode 5 Iris asks her to be her maid on honor. In that same episode, Caitlin finally comes to terms with her dual personalities, giving her the ability to switch between her two personas at will as well as the Killer Frost persona showing a more heroic side as she agrees to use her powers to help them. In the crossover [[Crisis on Earth X]], Killer Frost joins forces with the rest of the heroes against the Nazis from Earth X. During the battle Frost, alongside Vixen and Zari, board the Earth X Waverider to disable it's shields and destroy it.

She also finds Mister Freeze's gun and uses it briefly to fight Batman, but has trouble lifting it and ends up leaving it behind after the fight. Later, Killer Frost is one of the Suicide Squad members who has her bomb defused by the Riddler. Only [[King Shark]] (who Frost formed a relationship with) and Black Spider (who wasn't with the Squad because of Batman) are killed by Waller, when she learns what they've done. After the "Black Spider" with the Squad is exposed as Batman, and after the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] breaks free and sets all the inmates of Arkham loose, Frost tries to escape from Arkham by stealing a police car.
