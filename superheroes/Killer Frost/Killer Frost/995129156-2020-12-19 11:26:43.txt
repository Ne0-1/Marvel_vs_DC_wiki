'''Killer Frost''' is a name used by several fictional female [[supervillains]] and [[superheroes]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]: '''Crystal Frost''', '''Louise Lincoln''', and '''Caitlin Snow'''. Each different individual in the [[DC Universe]] assuming the Killer Frost persona is usually as an adversary (or acquaintance, ally, love interest) of the [[superhero]] [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].

Various iterations (Crystal Frost and Louise Lincoln) have appeared in various animated projects and video games with most of them having the character voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. [[Danielle Panabaker]] portrays [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] on the shared DC ''[[Arrowverse]]'' shows, where she is a main character on the television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.

== Fictional character biographies ==

=== Crystal Frost ===
'''Crystal Frost''' was the first incarnation, first appearing in ''Firestorm'' #3 (June 1978).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=168}}</ref> While Frost was studying to be a [[scientist]] in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher Martin Stein. While working on a project in the [[Arctic]], Frost was upset to learn that Stein did not reciprocate her feelings; Stein told a fellow researcher that Crystal was a withdrawn student and that he had merely tried to draw her out of her shell, which Crystal completely misinterpreted. Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber but survived, being transformed in a way in which she was able to absorb heat from a living being and project cold and ice. Calling herself "Killer Frost", she began her murderous crusade against men and clashed with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] on many occasions.<ref name="dc-fire">{{Citation|last = Wallace|first = Dan|contribution = Firestorm|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 123|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Killer Frost eventually died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) # 21</ref> Crystal has been identified as one of the deceased villains entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1</ref> Her body was reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

=== Louise Lincoln ===
[[File:Killer Frost (Louise Lincoln).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Louise Lincoln as Killer Frost. Art by Tom Grummett]]
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' is the second incarnation; she first appeared in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #21 (March 1984) and used the "Killer Frost" name in ''Firestorm'' vol. 2 #34 (April 1985).<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=174–175}}</ref> Lincoln was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend's death, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the second Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm whom she blamed for Crystal's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] for more power.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Killer Frost attacked [[Hawaii]], freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]].

After a group of mobsters put out a hit on [[Lois Lane]], Killer Frost rescued Lois from [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], only to then leave the reporter bound and gagged on a set of train tracks, hoping to take the credit and reward for Lane's death. Her plan was foiled by [[Superman]] who rescued Lois before the train could hit.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #182</ref>

Killer Frost was later freed when the DEO refrigeration truck transporting her crashed. [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]] happened upon the crash and she discovered the heat from Effigy's pyrokinetic abilities enabled her to kiss Effigy without him freezing over. The two had a brief flirtatious partnership that dissolved when Effigy lost patience with her lecturing on how to defeat [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]]. After Green Lantern buried them both under a mountain of snow, Effigy escaped and abandoned her to be apprehended again.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #127</ref>

In the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc, Killer Frost was one of many [[supervillain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction Superman and [[Batman]]. She teamed with [[Mr. Freeze|Mister Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] (Cameron Mahkent) and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes in Washington D.C., but all four were defeated. They attacked in a second wave, along with more villains such as [[Giganta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]], but a similar backup of superheroes battered them all into submission. It was later discovered that this ice-themed team of villains was being mind controlled by Grodd.<ref>''Superman/Batman #3''</ref>

[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] hired Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] was being held. Green Arrow stopped Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she was defeated.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #54-55</ref>

Around this time, Lincoln discovered that she had contracted cancer, and tricked Jason Rusch, the new Firestorm, into curing her. With her health and powers restored, Killer Frost went on a rampage, only to be defeated when Jason's abilities reversed the alterations to Lincoln's body, returning her cancer.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #9–10</ref>

Killer Frost returned during the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', where she had apparently entered into a relationship with Mr. Freeze. Together, the two villains went on a killing spree in [[Manhattan]], hoping to draw Firestorm into an elaborate trap. Once the hero arrived, Killer Frost used a device to send both of them into space, where she sought to absorb the heat energy of the sun. Firestorm narrowly managed to stop her plan, and both Killer Frost and Mister Freeze were taken into custody by Batman. As they were being sent away, Killer Frost angrily revealed to Mister Freeze that she had only been using her lover as a pawn, and had no romantic interest.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #24–25</ref>

Killer Frost was later seen battling Firestorm in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'' until Lex Luthor, [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] arrived, subdued Firestorm, and invited Killer Frost to join the new [[Injustice League]]. She then appeared in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where she was sent to the Prison Planet after having been defeated and captured by the [[Suicide Squad (comics)|Suicide Squad]].

In ''DC Universe'' #0, she was seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. She is later seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], and ultimately helped deal the killing blow to the crazed supervillain Junior and the troubled vigilante [[Catalina Flores|Tarantula]].<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #6–7</ref> A short time after this encounter with the Secret Six, Killer Frost appeared as one of the participants in a metahuman fighting tournament in Tokyo. She was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Black Canary]] who had disguised themselves as villains in order to take down the tournament from the inside.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #35</ref>

The "[[DC Rebirth]]" version of Louise Lincoln debuts in the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]." While Firestorm considers "The Superman Theory" as a hoax, Killer Frost claims that Captain Atom, Firehawk, Moonbow, and Typhoon are the government's creations.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Killer Frost later accompanied Black Adam in his attack on the White House.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #11. DC Comics.</ref>

=== Caitlin Snow ===
==== The New 52 ====
[[File:Killer Frost (Caitlin Snow).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caitlin Snow as Killer Frost. Artwork for the cover of ''Justice League of America: Killer Frost'' #1 (January 2017 DC Comics). Art by Joshua Oyerokun.]]
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity; Killer Frost is reintroduced in September 2013, as the "Villains Month" part of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' – she was featured in the one-shot ''[[Justice League#Justice League of America (vol. 3)|Justice League of America]]'' #7.2, also titled ''Killer Frost'' #1.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Bryan|title=Exclusive: Which Villains Are Taking Over the Justice League?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-young/exclusive-which-villains-_b_3385124.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=June 5, 2013|access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> She can also be seen on the cover of ''[[Forever Evil]]'' #1, which hints at her involvement in that series where she's revealed to be '''Dr. Caitlin Snow''', a scientist sent to S.T.A.R. Labs Outpost #72 in the [[Arctic]] to work on a thermodynamic engine whose creator had committed suicide. Snow soon discovered the place had been infiltrated by [[H.I.V.E.]] agents. When they tried to kill her inside the engine, Snow frantically ripped off the coolant system, merging her body with ice. Transformed into a heat vampire, she killed the H.I.V.E. agents out of revenge. She then wandered out into the cold until she came across a Norwegian camp and took their heat too. Hijacking a helicopter, she made it back to her hometown [[Pittsburgh]]. She even created a suit that helped her retain heat for longer. She later encountered the superhero Firestorm and discovered that his powers could temporarily heal her mutation. She tried recreating the Firestorm Nuclear Matrix several times, only to fail with each attempt. When Firestorm and the Justice League were declared dead by the Crime Syndicate, she lost hope for a cure to her condition.<ref>''Justice League of America: Killer Frost'' Vol. 3 #7.2 (November 2013)</ref>

Killer Frost later has a scientist named Byte track down Martin Stein, the original creator of the Firestorm Matrix, to his secluded cabin while he had gone into hiding during the Crime Syndicate's takeover of Earth. She encountered [[Steve Trevor]] who was sent there on a mission to try to find the Justice League who were imprisoned inside Firestorm. Learning he was alive, Snow allied herself with the two men to find them. Soon they were attacked by supervillains [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]], [[Black Bison]], [[Hyena (comics)|Hyena]], [[Tempest (DC Comics)|Tempest]] and [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]] for betraying the Syndicate. While fighting them off, Stein, Trevor and Frost teleported to another A.R.G.U.S. base, where they learned that to free the Justice League, they needed [[Wonder Woman]]'s Lasso of Truth. Discovering [[Cheetah (DC Comics)|Cheetah]] was keeping it as a trophy, they found her and her Menagerie, but were subdued. Doctor Light (Arthur Light) suddenly appeared and blasted everyone except Frost and Trevor unconscious. After defeating him, they managed to deliver the Lasso of Truth to [[Cyborg (DC Comics)|Cyborg]] who successfully used it to free his teammates.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #1-6</ref>

==== DC Rebirth ====
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
In [[DC Rebirth]], Caitlin Snow is taken to Belle Reve Penitentiary, where she is introduced to the Suicide Squad and offered a place on the team by [[Amanda Waller]]. She accepts and joins the team. She helps the Suicide Squad in their fight against the [[Justice League]], but subsequently assists them against [[Maxwell Lord]] when he is possessed by [[Eclipso]], whose attempt to tap into her "darkest desire" only unlocks her desire to make a difference. She then has to save all the Suicide Squad and the Justice League by absorbing the energy out of Superman and using it against [[Maxwell Lord]]. Afterwards, Waller is forced to release Snow into Batman's custody.<ref>''Justice League vs. Suicide Squad'' #6</ref> She then joined the new Justice League of America made up of [[Batman]], the [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Atom]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], [[Black Canary]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and the [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|Ray]].

== Powers and abilities ==
All versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold. Using these powers, Killer Frost can create an ice-sheen across her entire body that grants her increased durability, cause intense blizzards that can instantly freeze the target and generate objects composed completely of ice, such as projectiles in the form of ice shards and defensive walls or shields. She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact and is unable to touch a normal person without freezing them.

Her weakness is the need to absorb external heat sources to generate ice: although heat-based weapons such as flamethrowers only make her stronger, she can be imprisoned in cold surroundings such as being locked in a refrigeration truck or buried under a mountain of snow. The Caitlin Snow version of Killer Frost is constantly plagued by a hunger for heat, which can only be sated by absorbing the heat from a living being, a process which inevitably kills the victim. However, in recent stories she seems to have finally gotten it under control by only absorbing a tiny amount of heat from every person she touches, sparing them and leaving them otherwise unharmed. The Caitlin Snow and Louise Lincoln versions of the character have, albeit inconsistently, demonstrated the ability to fly, either by riding Arctic winds or through an unknown manner of self-propulsion.

While the exact limits of her abilities have yet to be established, how much power Frost can channel at once seems to depend on how much heat she has absorbed and stored in her body. For example, when she absorbed all the heat from Superman (whose body is supercharged by yellow solar energy) during a stand-off between the Justice League and the Suicide Squad, she was able to flash-freeze the entire League in a single blast.

It also seems that using up all the heat energy she has stored can put Frost's life in danger. If she does not feed in time, she even risks dying of "starvation".

The Caitlin Snow version also boasts a genius-level intellect, being S.T.A.R. Labs' youngest and brightest scientist prior to her transformation. She could solve complex equations easily, operate heavy energy generating machinery and appeared particularly skilled in the field of physics and research about energy. She once managed to create an ice prism with her powers that converted Superman's heat vision into a bright burst of sunlight to defeat Eclipso.

Several adaptations of the villain have also depicted the Crystal Frost and Louise Lincoln incarnations as having basic skills in melee combat which they use in conjunction with their powers as well as impressive agility, being able to perform maneuvers such as leaps or cartwheels with ease.

They were eventually defeated by the [[Justice League]]. In the latter series, Killer Frost rejoins Grodd's Secret Society. She was sent with [[Giganta]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]] to a mountain to steal a [[Viking]] ship frozen in a glacier. The ship held the remains of a [[Viking Prince|Viking prince]] believed to hold the key to invincibility. When an avalanche threatened a nearby lodge, Killer Frost gets forced by the [[Martian Manhunter]] to save the people there. When the Secret Society mutinied on the way to [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s former lair, she joined Grodd's faction but was defeated by [[Toyman]].

She is part of the breakout attempt alongside [[Captain Cold]], Mister Freeze and both versions of [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]]. She freezes the undercover [[Miss Martian]] for stopping Killer Frost from finishing off a guard, but is stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]. In the episode "Coldhearted", Killer Frost and the other ice-based villains were suspected of being behind the ice fortresses that attacked the United States. However, [[Hugo Strange]] told [[Batman]] and the Flash that none of the ice-based villains left their cells. In the episode "Into the Breach," Killer Frost is taken down by [[Infinity, Inc.]] as part of Lex Luthor's plot to make them popular than the Outsiders.

* Killer Frost appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced again by Jennifer Hale. This version is identified as Louise Lincoln, but wears Crystal Frost's attire. Louise is portrayed as Ronnie Raymond's vengeful ex-girlfriend. In the teaser of "Darkseid Descending!", she crashes Raymond's class for vengeance until [[Batman]] interferes.

Firestorm frees her, and Killer Frost stops the crashing aircraft. She freezes Mr. Freeze in a block of ice when the latter tries to kill her, Firestorm, and Batman. After knocking out Firestorm again, Killer Frost escapes.

* Killer Frost makes a non-speaking [[cameo appearance]] in the ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'' episode "The Runaway Bridesmaid", attending [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Kite Man]]'s wedding and later fighting [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] officers when the wedding gets busted by [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon]].

==== Arrowverse ====
{{main|Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)}}
[[File:Killer Frost (Danielle Panabaker).png|thumbnail|upright|[[Danielle Panabaker]] as Caitlin Snow/Killer Frost in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'']]
[[Danielle Panabaker]] portrays [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Dr. Caitlin Snow/Killer Frost]], a series regular on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' TV series, set within [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]] family of related shows. Her character also makes occasional guest appearances on ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' (where she debuted), ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''. In ''The Flash'', she is a part of the [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]-based [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] team alongside [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon/Vibe]] and [[Harrison Wells]] which supports [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen/The Flash]] and has a friendship with [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West]].

In [[The Flash (season 1)|season one]], she struggles with her fiancé [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]]'s death in the particle accelerator blast which created various meta-humans, but later discovers Ronnie survived as part of the fire-based superhero Firestorm. Caitlin and Ronnie later marry but shortly thereafter Ronnie, while helping the Flash, disappears into a destructive singularity over Central City. During [[The Flash (season 2)|season two]], Caitlin grieves for Ronnie, but grows closer to [[Hunter Zolomon]] (disguised as [[Jay Garrick]]). She then develops the Velocity serum with Harry Wells to cure Hunter's revealed illness, before the revelation that the so-called Flash of [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] is in fact the evil Earth-2 speedster Zoom. She also meets her Earth-2 doppelganger, the ice-based supervillain Killer Frost who is later killed by Zoom, and wonders what this means for her own capacity to do evil.

Caitlin experiences [[Flashpoint (comics)|timeline changes]] in [[The Flash (season 3)|season three]].<ref>http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/28/flash-killer-frost-return/</ref><ref>http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/flash-finally-unmasks-savitar-it-worth-wait-254617</ref><ref>http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/05/03/the-flash-new-photos-barry-allen-3x21-cause-and-effect/</ref> After the original timeline is restored with subtle variations, Caitlin is shown to have cryokinetic abilities which she is keeping secret from the team, and also develops a second villainous personality. She also develops a relationship with [[Doctor Alchemy|Julian Albert]]. Caitlin is advised by her mother Dr. Carla Tannhauser to not to use her powers or her transformations will become irreversible. Catlin's abilities fully manifest when Julian takes a power-suppressing necklace off so her healing abilities could save her, triggering her Killer Frost transformation. Acting as [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]]'s personal enforcer, Killer Frost battles Team Flash alongside him. After a fight with Vibe, she turns against Savitar after being given a cure developed by Julian. She defends her former teammates from Savitar, rather than allow them to be killed. After Savitar's defeat, she tells the others that she is not yet ready to return, leaving to rediscover herself.

In [[The Flash (season 4)|season four]], Caitlin and Killer Frost are like Jekyll and Hyde.<ref>http://ew.com/recap/the-flash-season-4-premiere/</ref><ref>http://www.itsjustaboutwrite.com/2018/04/the-flash-4x18-review-lose-yourself.html</ref> She works at a bar that has some underworld connections until Cisco asks her to help get Barry back, and she agrees. Caitlin eventually comes to terms with her dual personalities, giving her the ability to switch between her two personas at will as well as the Killer Frost persona showing a more heroic side as she agrees to use her powers to help. In the crossover "[[Crisis on Earth X]]", Killer Frost joins forces with the rest of the heroes against the Nazis of Earth-X. Eventually Caitlin learns that Killer Frost was already a part of her as a child, therefore she did not get her powers from the particle accelerator explosion. In [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]], Caitlin discovers her father is alive, but has developed a split personality called [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]]. During [[The Flash (season 6)|the sixth season]], Caitlin experiments with allowing Killer Frost some time in control outside a crisis situation, allowing her other self to basically have her own life.

=== Film ===
* The Louise Lincoln version of Killer Frost appears in ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', with [[Jennifer Hale]] reprising her role (for the second time [albeit uncredited]). In this film, she teams up with fellow cold-based villains (Mr. Freeze, [[Captain Cold]] and Icicle) to capture [[Superman]] due to a bounty placed by President Lex Luthor. After a brief fight with Batman, they are defeated by Superman.
* The Louise Lincoln version of Killer Frost appears in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', voiced again by [[Jennifer Hale]] (for the fifth time).<ref name="btva"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/04/first-trailer-batman-assault-arkham-animated-movie.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140420041808/http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/04/first-trailer-batman-assault-arkham-animated-movie.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-04-20|title=First trailer for Batman: Assault on Arkham animated movie|author=Gary Collinson|work=Flickering Myth}}</ref> This version appears as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] chosen to break into [[Arkham Asylum]] to retrieve stolen data, though [[Amanda Waller]] assigns Killer Frost the secret task of killing the [[Riddler]]. She forms a friendship with [[King Shark]] after she fends off an attempt to eat her; King Shark respects her ferocity and she uses the metahuman's strength to her advantage. She briefly uses Mister Freeze's gun when the Squad is attacked by Batman, but has trouble lifting the weapon which she discards. Under Waller's secret orders, Killer Frost slips away after the battle and locates Riddler but decides not to kill when she learns of Waller's true motive: Riddler found a way to disable the bombs implanted in the Suicide Squad members. The pair rejoin the Squad and Killer Frost is one of the four Squad members whose bomb is defused by Riddler; King Shark's bomb remains undamaged and is quickly executed by Waller, but Killer Frost's anger at this death evaporates when [[Black Spider]] is exposed as Batman. After the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] sets all of Arkham's inmates loose, Killer Frost tries to flee Arkham by stealing a police car. However, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] grabs and throws the car, which then explodes. Her fate is unknown.
* The Crystal Frost version of Killer Frost appears as one of the main characters in ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]'', voiced by [[Kristin Bauer van Straten]].<ref name="btva"/> Much like Louise Lincoln in ''Batman: Assault on Arkham'', this iteration appears as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and with a flashback revealing she was a "tough girl" when her powers manifested and she used them to kill her abusive parents. Killer Frost is one of the many Squad members assembled by Waller to retrieve a mystical black playing card which allows the user to bypass [[Hell]] and go directly to [[Heaven]]. After the Squad leave Denver, Colorado after fleeing from [[Vandal Savage]], Killer Frost is kidnapped by Professor Zoom's henchmen [[Silver Banshee]] and Blockbuster. Killer Frost's nano-bomb is removed from her neck thanks to Zoom's powers, convincing her to join Zoom's crew and betraying the Squad in the process. After the Squad manages to find Savage's lair, Zoom's crew later arrive and Killer Frost traps her former teammates in ice (and also freezes [[Harley Quinn]]'s mouth shut as she was bored of hearing Harley talk). After Zoom removes the mystical card from Savage's chest, Killer Frost then double-crosses Zoom by killing Silver Banshee and Blockbuster and then takes the card for ransom, since she doesn't believe in the afterlife. [[Copperhead (comics)|Copperhead]] then manages to free himself and fights Killer Frost and Waller detonates Copperhead's bomb during the struggle with Killer Frost, killing them both.
