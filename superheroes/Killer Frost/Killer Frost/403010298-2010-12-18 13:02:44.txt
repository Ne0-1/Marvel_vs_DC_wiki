'''Killer Frost''' is the name of two [[fictional characters]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe. They are both [[supervillain]]s that appear mainly as foes of the [[superhero]] [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].

==Fictional character biographies==
===Crystal Frost===
'''Crystal Frost''' first appeared in ''Firestorm'' #3 (June 1978). While Crystal Frost was studying to be a scientist in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher, Martin Stein. While working on a project in the Arctic, Frost was upset to learn that Stein didn't reciprocate her feelings. Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber, but somehow survived. She was transformed in a way that she was able to absorb heat from a living being and project cold and ice. Calling herself Killer Frost, she began her murderous crusade against men and clashed with Firestorm on many occasions.<ref name="dc-fire">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Firestorm | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 123  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Frost eventually died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.

Crystal has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. Her body is later revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

===Louise Lincoln===
====Origin====
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' first appeared in ''Firestorm (vol. 2)'' # 21 (March 1984). The [[comic book]] reference series, ''Who's Who: The Definitive Guide to the DC Universe (Volume 1) #12'' erroneously lists Louise Lincoln's first appearance as taking place in ''Firestorm'' Volume 2 #20. In fact, Louise Lincoln did not appear until issue #21 of the series. She did not begin using the name "Killer Frost" until issue #34. She was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend died, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the new Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm, whom she blamed for Frost's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron]] for more power.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Killer Frost attacked Hawaii, freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (comics)|Knockout]].

After a group of mobsters put out a hit on [[Lois Lane]], Killer Frost rescued her from [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], only to then leave the reporter bound and gagged on a set of train tracks, hoping to take the credit and reward for Lane's death. Her plan was foiled by Superman, who promptly rescued Lois before the train could hit her.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #182</ref>

Killer Frost was later freed by [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]] and the two had a brief flirtatious partnership before she was apprehended by [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]].

====D.C. and Chicago====
Killer Frost was one of many [[supervillain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by President [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], whom he considered treasonous. This takes place in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc. She teams with [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes in Washington D.C., but all four were defeated. They attack in a second wave, along with more villains such as [[Giganta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] but a similar backup of superheroes batter them all into submission. It was later discover that this ice-themed team of villains was being mind controlled by [[Gorilla Grodd]] in ''[[Superman/Batman]] #3''. 

[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] hires Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)|Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] is being held. Green Arrow stops Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she is soundly defeated by ''Green Arrow'' (Volume 3) #54-55.

Around this time, Lincoln discovered that she had contracted cancer, and tricked [[Jason Rusch]], the new Firestorm (who had gained the previous Firestorm's abilities after is death during ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]''), into curing her by posing as a normal young woman. With her health and powers restored, Killer Frost went on a rampage, only to be defeated when Jason used his abilities to reverse his alterations to Lincoln's body, thus returning her to her sickly state.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #9-10</ref>

====One Year Later and Countdown====
Killer Frost returned during the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', where she had apparently entered into a relationship with [[Mr. Freeze]]. Together, the two villains went on a killing spree in Manhattan, hoping to draw Firestorm into an elaborate trap. Once the hero arrived, Killer Frost used a device to send both of them into space, where she sought to absorb the heat energy of the sun. Firestorm narrowly managed to stop her plan, and both Killer Frost and Mr. Freeze were taken into custody by [[Batman]]. As they were being sent away, Killer Frost angrily revealed to Freeze that she had only been using him as a pawn, and had no romantic interest in him.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #24-25</ref>

Killer Frost was later seen in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', battling Firestorm, until [[Lex Luthor]], [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] arrived, subdued Firestorm, and invited her to join the new [[Injustice League]]. She then appeared in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where she was sent to the Prison Planet after having been defeated and captured by the [[Suicide Squad (comics)|Suicide Squad]].

In DC Universe #0 she was seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains. She is later seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], and ultimately helped deal the killing blow to the crazed supervillain Junior and the troubled vigilante known as [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Catalina Flores|the Tarantula]].<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #6-7</ref> A short time after this encounter with the Secret Six, Killer Frost appeared as one of the participants in a metahuman fighting tournament in Tokyo. She was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Black Canary]], who had disguised themselves as villains in order to take down the tournament from the inside.<ref>''Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #35</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold. Using these powers Killer Frost can create an ice-sheen across her entire body, and generate objects composed completely of ice, such as projectiles (ice daggers) and defensive walls. She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact. In pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] appearances, she had the ability to make men fall under her control with a kiss.

In the [[video game]] ''[[Justice League Chronicles]]'', [[Eclipso]] noted that Killer Frost was the only one with a heart dark enough to free him from his prison.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Killer Frost appears in the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. It was never stated which version of Killer Frost it is. She is motivated by a base desire to kill people, and doesn't seem to care who she serves so long as she is afforded the opportunity to do so. She joins [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] in the episode of the same name, relishing the chance to kill [[Morgan Edge]] when the rest of the team is distracted examining the canisters containing the Secret Society's latest recruit, [[Clayface]] (Matt Hagen). They were eventually defeated.

* In the sequel series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', she rejoined Grodd's Secret Society. She was sent with [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], and [[Giganta]] to a mountain to steal a [[Viking]] ship frozen in a glacier. The ship held the remains of a [[Viking Prince|Viking prince]] that were believed to hold the key to invincibility. When an avalanche threatened a nearby lodge, she was forced by the [[Martian Manhunter]] to save the people there. Later, when the Secret Society rioted on the way to Brainiac's former lair, she joined the faction loyal to Grodd, but was defeated by [[Toyman]]. After the rioting subsided, Luthor demanded "one good reason" why any of the rebellious faction should be allowed to live. With no hesitation, she froze the half of the Secret Society that had opposed Luthor. Satisfied, Luthor replied, "You've got a future." She subsequently appears as one of the Legion members who survive [[Darkseid]]'s resurrection and ends up fighting alongside the Justice League in their struggle against Darkseid's forces.
