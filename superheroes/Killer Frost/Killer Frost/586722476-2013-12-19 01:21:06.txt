'''Killer Frost''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe. They are [[supervillain]]s that appear mainly as foes of the [[superhero]] [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]].

==Fictional character biographies==
===Crystal Frost===
'''Crystal Frost''' was the first incarnation of Killer Frost. She appeared in ''Firestorm'' #3 (June 1978). While Crystal was studying to be a scientist in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher Martin Stein. While working on a project in the Arctic, Frost was upset to learn that Stein did not reciprocate her feelings. Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber but somehow survived. She was transformed in a way that she was able to absorb heat from a living being and project cold and ice. Calling herself 'Killer Frost', she began her murderous crusade against men and clashed with Firestorm on many occasions.<ref name="dc-fire">{{Citation|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Firestorm|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 123|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Frost eventually died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm. Crystal has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1</ref> Her body was reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

===Louise Lincoln===
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' is the second incarnation of Killer Frost. She first appeared in ''Firestorm (vol. 2)'' # 21 (March 1984) (but the [[comic book]] reference series ''Who's Who: The Definitive Guide to the DC Universe (Volume 1) #12'' erroneously lists this character's first appearance as taking place in ''Firestorm'' Volume 2 #20) and used the name "Killer Frost" in issue #34. Lincoln was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend died, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the new Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm, whom she blamed for Frost's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron]] for more power. 

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' event, Frost attacked Hawaii, freezing part of the islands before being stopped by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]].

After a group of mobsters put out a hit on [[Lois Lane]], Frost rescued her from [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], only to then leave the reporter bound and gagged on a set of train tracks, hoping to take the credit and reward for Lane's death. Her plan was foiled by [[Superman]], who promptly rescued Lois before the train could hit her.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #182</ref>

Killer Frost was later freed by [[Effigy (DC Comics)|Effigy]] and the two had a brief flirtatious partnership before she was apprehended by [[Ion (comics)|Green Lantern]].

Killer Frost was one of many [[supervillain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction Superman and [[Batman]], whom he considered treasonous. This takes place in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc. She teams with [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], and [[Captain Cold]] in an attempt to ambush the two heroes in Washington D.C., but all four were defeated. They attack in a second wave, along with more villains such as [[Giganta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] but a similar backup of superheroes batter them all into submission. It was later discover that this ice-themed team of villains was being mind controlled by Grodd in ''[[Superman/Batman]] #3''. 

[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] hires Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)|Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] is being held. Green Arrow stops Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she is soundly defeated by ''Green Arrow'' (Volume 3) #54-55.

Around this time, Lincoln discovered that she had contracted cancer, and tricked [[Jason Rusch]], the new Firestorm (who had gained the previous Firestorm's abilities after his death during ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''), into curing her by posing as a normal young woman. With her health and powers restored, Frost went on a rampage, only to be defeated when Jason used his abilities to reverse his alterations to Lincoln's body, thus returning her to her sickly state.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #9-10</ref>

Killer Frost returned during the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', where she had apparently entered into a relationship with Mr. Freeze. Together, the two villains went on a killing spree in [[Manhattan]] [[New York]], hoping to draw Firestorm into an elaborate trap. Once the hero arrived, Killer Frost used a device to send both of them into space, where she sought to absorb the heat energy of the sun. Firestorm narrowly managed to stop her plan, and both Frost and Freeze were taken into custody by Batman. As they were being sent away, Frost angrily revealed to Freeze that she had only been using him as a pawn, and had no romantic interest in him.<ref>''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #24-25</ref>

Frost was later seen in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', battling Firestorm, until Lex Luthor, [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] arrived, subdued Firestorm, and invited her to join the new [[Injustice League]]. She then appeared in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where she was sent to the Prison Planet after having been defeated and captured by the [[Suicide Squad (comics)|Suicide Squad]].

In DC Universe #0 she was seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. She is later seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], and ultimately helped deal the killing blow to the crazed supervillain Junior and the troubled vigilante known as [[Catalina Flores|the Tarantula]].<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #6-7</ref> A short time after this encounter with the Secret Six, Killer Frost appeared as one of the participants in a metahuman fighting tournament in Tokyo. She was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Black Canary]], who had disguised themselves as villains in order to take down the tournament from the inside.<ref>''Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #35</ref>

===Loren Fontier===
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), the history of Firestorm is rebooted so that Jason Rusch and Ronnie Raymond are two high school classmates who gain their powers at the same time. A terrorist cell attacks the kids' school and female terrorist '''Loren Fontier''' goes after Ronnie and Jason in hopes of killing them and taking the Firestorm Matrix. Just as she is about to pull the trigger, Jason opens the Matrix, transforming both himself and Ronnie into Firestorm and badly injuring Loren. When one of the other gunmen attempts to dig Loren out of the rubble, he is horrified to discover that her skin has turned blue and is now apparently inhumanly cold, causing her to strongly resemble both of the previous Killer Frosts.<ref>''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men'' #1 (September 2011)</ref>

===Caitlin Snow===
In September 2013 as part of the "Villains Month" part of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline during ''[[The New 52]]'', Killer Frost was featured in the one-shot ''[[Justice League#Justice League of America (vol. 3)|Justice League of America]]'' #7.2, also titled ''Killer Frost'' #1.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Bryan|title=Exclusive: Which Villains Are Taking Over the Justice League?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-young/exclusive-which-villains-_b_3385124.html?utm_hp_ref=tw|publisher=Huffington Post|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref> She can also be seen on the cover of ''[[Forever Evil]]'' #1 which hints at her involvement in that series. However, the issue revealed this is yet another version. '''Dr. Caitlin Snow''' is a scientist sent to S.T.A.R. Labs Outpost #72 in the Arctic to work on a thermodynamic engine whose creator has committed suicide. However, she soon discovers the place has been infiltrated by [[H.I.V.E.]] agents, when they tried to kill her inside the engine Caitlin frantically ripped of the coolant system merging her body with ice. Transformed in a heat vampire, she killed the H.I.V.E. agents and continued to search for other sources of heat eventually discovering Firestorm blasts can temporarily heal her condition. When he was declared dead by the Crime Syndicate, she loses hope to a cure.<ref>''Justice League of America Vol 3 #7.2: Killer Frost'' (November 2013)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold. Using these powers, Killer Frost can create an ice-sheen across her entire body. She can then generate objects composed completely of ice, such as projectiles (ice daggers) and defensive walls. She can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact. In pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] appearances, she had the ability to make men fall under her control with a kiss.

==Other versions==
===DC Super Friends===
Based in the [[DC Super Friends]] universe, Killer Frost is part of a group of ice-themed villains called the "Ice Pack" that encased a city in ice and snow. The Ice Pack appear in ''DC Super Friends'' #16 (August 2009).<ref>''DC Super Friends'' #16</ref>
