'''Killer Frost''' is either of two [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s and one of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'s foes.

==Killer Frost I==
'''Crystal Frost''' first appeared in ''Firestorm #3'' (June 1978). While Crystal Frost was studying to be a scientist in [[Hudson University]], she fell in love with her teacher, Martin Stein. While working on a project in the Arctic, Frost was upset to learn that Stein didn't like her in that way. Frost accidentally locked herself in a thermafrost chamber, but somehow survived. She was transformed in a way that she is able to absorb heat from a living being and project the [[cold]] and [[ice]]. Now calling herself Killer Frost, she began her murderous crusade against men and has clashed with Firestorm on many occasions. Frost died after she absorbed too much energy from Firestorm.

==Killer Frost II==
===Origin===
'''Dr. Louise Lincoln''' first appeared in ''Firestorm (Volume 2) #21'' (March 1984). She was a colleague and friend to Crystal Frost. After her friend died, she decided to repeat the experiment as a last respect to her former mentor, and became the new Killer Frost. She became just as ruthless as her predecessor and began her own personal vendetta against Firestorm, who she blamed for Frost's death. She briefly served as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and sold her soul to [[Neron]] for more power.

===Recent activities===
{{spoiler}}

Killer Frost was one of many [[super-villain]]s seeking to earn a $1 billion reward offered by President [[Lex Luthor]] to sanction [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], whom he considered treasonous. Frost and the others failed to stop either of them. ''[[Superman/Batman]] #3''. 

[[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] hired Killer Frost and [[Mirror Master]] to attack [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Lightning]] at a hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where [[Doctor Light (DC Comics superheroine)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] was being held. Green Arrow stopped Killer Frost by firing an arrow filled with [[Greek fire]] into her thigh. Unable to absorb the heat from the arrow, she was soundly defeated ''Green Arrow'' (Volume 3) #54-55.

==Other media==
* Killer Frost has appeared in episodes of the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. She joined [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Supervillains|Secret Society]] only because she wanted to kill. She was the one responsible for freezing [[Morgan Edge]] when the Secret Society were looking in Morgan Edge's mansion for the canisters containing the Secret Society's latest recruit...[[Clayface]] (Matt Hagen). They were eventually defeated, though.

* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', she rejoined Grodd's [[Legion of Doom]]. She was sent with [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], and [[Giganta]] to a mountain to steal a [[Viking]] ship frozen in a glacier that contain a Viking Prince that may held the key to immortality. When an avalanche threatened a nearby lodge, she was forced by the [[Martian Manhunter]] to stop the snow from killing the people there. 

==Notes==
* The [[comic book]] reference series, ''Who's Who: The Definitive Guide to the DC Universe (Volume 1) #12'' erroneously lists '''Killer Frost II's''' first appearance as taking place in ''Firestorm (Volume 2) #20''. In fact, Louis Lincoln did not appear until issue #21 of the series. She did not begin using the name ''Killer Frost'' until issue #34.
