The '''Black Flash''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] from [[DC Comics]]. Created by writers [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]], and artist [[Ron Wagner]], the character had cameos in ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #138 (June 1998),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=61784 |title='&#39;Flash'&#39; #138 at the Grand Comics Database |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> before appearing in full in ''The Flash'' #141 (September 1998).

==Fictional character background==
=== Original depiction ===
The Black Flash essentially fulfills the same role as [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]] for those who possess super-speed in the DC Universe, returning the speedster to their power source: the [[Speed Force]]. It is reportedly seen before the deaths of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Johnny Quick]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Max Mercury]], having had several near-death experiences, has also seen the Black Flash.

It is not clear whether the Black Flash exists because speedsters are simply too fast for traditional Death to capture, or as some sort of bizarre side-effect to their Speed Force connection.

It came for [[Wally West]] to draw back to the Speed Force, but instead took [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]. Having seen portents of Wally's death, Max Mercury and [[Jesse Quick]] intercepted Wally before reaching the museum where Linda was waiting, with Linda thus being struck by the lightning that was meant to kill Wally. It later returns to try to take Wally again, freezing time except for those who possess a connection to the Speed Force. Max Mercury, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and Jesse Quick all attempt to assist Wally by distracting the Black Flash; Wally finally defeats the Black Flash by racing the creature to the end of time, to a point where Death would have no meaning, causing the creature to dissipate.

The Black Flash appears to [[Bart Allen]] when the Flash loses his powers while battling the Rogues at the [[Getty Center]]. Despite a clash with [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] (another possible candidate for the Black Flash), Bart is killed shortly thereafter by the panicked Rogues when it appears Bart would win, even without powers.

Most recently, the Black Flash is revealed to represent the dark aspect of the Speed Force, which is responsible for the empowerment of Wally's children. His connection to death is limited to those connected to the Speed Force. While an issue{{Issue|date=April 2009}} of ''[[Captain Atom]]'' suggests Death of the Endless, the Black Racer, and Nekron are all aspects of the same force, [[Neil Gaiman]] (creator of Death of the Endless) disagrees with this idea, stating that his creation is the ultimate personification of Death{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

During the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Wally theorizes that the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] pursuing himself and Barry is in fact the Black Flash.

A charred corpse, appearing to be the Black Flash, was found in [[Iowa]] by two boys in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref>

=== Barry Allen ===
Later when discovering the body, '''[[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]''' is transformed into the next Black Flash, but the state is reversed.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #2 (May 2009)</ref> It's revealed that Professor Zoom has altered the Speed Force which results in Barry's Black Flash transformation.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #3 (June 2009)</ref><ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #4 (August 2009)</ref>

=== Eobard Thawne ===
The broken-necked corpse of '''[[Eobard Thawne]]''' is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. Equipped with a [[Power ring (weapon)|black power ring]], Thawne declared himself as the Black Flash,<ref>''[[Blackest Night: The Flash]]'' #1 (December 2009). DC Comics</ref><ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010). DC Comics</ref><ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010). DC Comics</ref> until Thawne's corpse is brought back to life.<ref>[[Johns, Geoff]] (w). [[Reis, Ivan]] (p), Albert, Oclair (i). ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #8 (March 2010). DC Comics</ref>
==Other versions==
* The [[Ame-Comi Girls]] universe version of Black Flash is '''[[Jesse Quick]]'''. <ref>''Ame-Con Girls: Featuring Duela Dent'' #3</ref>
* A demonic Black Flash (also known as the Speed Demon and [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]]) appears in ''[[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]]'' [[Smallville Season 11|season 11 comics]].<ref>''Smallville Season 11 #9''</ref>  This version seeks to siphon off [[Bart Allen|Bart Allen/Impulse]]'s speed but comes into conflict with Impulse and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Superman]]. It's learned that the Black Flash needs the souls of both Impulse and the retired [[Jay Garrick]] as they belong to the Speed Force. As Bart is the fastest usurping Jay as he's given up trying to battle the Black Flash, the demon craves his speed more. In the final battle over [[Las Vegas]], Impulse gives the demon his full speed and that ends up killing them both, leaving the classic Flash symbol in the desert.<ref>''Smallville Season 11 #12''</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
A different depiction of Black Flash appears on two of [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]] series: the live-action series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-flash-the-race-of-his-life-review|title=The Flash: "The Race of His Life" Review|date=May 24, 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}</ref> and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.<ref name="BlackFlashArrowverse">{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/01/08/the-flash-black-flash-returns-teddy-sears-season-3/|title=The Flash's Zoom to Resurface as Black Flash, on Multiple CW Shows|publisher=TV Line|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|date=January 8, 2017|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Schedeen|first1=Jesse|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow: "Aruba" Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/05/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-aruba-review|website=IGN.com|date=April 4, 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}</ref> The version is '''[[Hunter Zolomon]]''' ([[Teddy Sears]]) transformed into the Speed Force's Grim Reaper-esque enforcer. In season two of the latter series, the Black Flash, able to sense active speedsters, pursues a time-aberration of [[Eobard Thawne|Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash]], and eventually manages to erase his target from existence. In [[The Flash (season 3)|season three]] of the former series, the Black Flash goes after [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]] but [[Killer Frost]] freezes and shatters him before he can erase the time-remnant from existence. 

===Video Games===
* The Black Flash appears in ''[[Justice League Heroes: The Flash]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. When the player dies, the [[Wally West|Flash]] is chased by the Black Flash. If the player avoids being caught, the Flash is rewarded with a chance at continuing the game, coming back with low health and without losing the current life. After each death, escape from the Black Flash gets increasingly difficult.
* The Eobard Thawne version of Black Flash is featured in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' as a playable alternate skin for the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] as part of a limited exclusive challenge. 
* The Black Flash (identified as the '''[[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]]''') is mentioned in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' in the Reverse-Flash's fight dialogue. The character is mentioned when the Reverse-Flash faces his own doppelganger, [[Deadshot]] and [[Doctor Fate]] in battle; the Reverse-Flash says "the Black Racer is coming".
