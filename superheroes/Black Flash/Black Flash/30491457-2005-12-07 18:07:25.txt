The '''Black Flash''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] from [[DC Comics]]. The Black Flash essentially fulfils the same role as [[Death (DC Comics)| Death]] for those who possess super-speed in the DC Universe, returning them to the source of their powers: the [[Speed Force]].

It came for [[Wally West]] ([[Flash (comics)|Flash III]]) to draw back to the Force, but it got [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda]], Wally's girlfriend, instead.

He should not be confused with the other personfications of death in the DCU: The [[Black Racer]] and [[Death (Sandman)|Death]] of the [[Endless]].
