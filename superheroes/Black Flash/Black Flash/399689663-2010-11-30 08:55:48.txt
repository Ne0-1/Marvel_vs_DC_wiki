The '''Black Flash''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] from [[DC Comics]]. Created by writers [[Grant Morrison]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and [[Mark Millar]], and artist [[Ron Wagner]], the character first appeared in ''Flash (vol. 2)'' # 138 (June 1998).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=61784 ''Flash'' #138 at the Grand Comics Database]</ref>

==Fictional character background==
The Black Flash essentially fulfills the same role as [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]] for those who possess super-speed in the DC Universe, returning them to the source of their powers: the [[Speed Force]]. It is reportedly{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} seen before the deaths of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Johnny Quick]]; [[Max Mercury]], having had several near-death experiences, has also seen the Black Flash.

It is not clear whether the Black Flash exists because the speedster characters are simply too fast for traditional Death to capture, or as some sort of bizarre side-effect to their connection to the Speed Force.

It came for [[Wally West]] to draw him back to the Speed Force, but instead took [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda]], Wally's girlfriend; having seen portents of Wally's death, Max Mercury and [[Jesse Quick]] intercepted him before he could reach the museum where Linda was waiting for him, with Linda thus being struck by the lightning that was meant to kill Wally. It later returns to try to take Wally again, freezing time except for those who possess a connection to the Speed Force. Max Mercury, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and Jesse Quick all attempt to assist Wally by distracting the Black Flash; Wally finally defeats the Black Flash by racing it to the end of time, to a point where Death would have no meaning, causing it to dissipate.

The Black Flash appears to [[Bart Allen]] (at the time serving as the Flash) when the Flash loses his powers while battling the Rogues at the [[Getty Center]]. Despite his clash with [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]]- his clone, and, as another speedster, another possible candidate for the Black Flash-, Bart is killed shortly thereafter by the panicked Rogues when it appears he would win, even without his powers.

Most recently, the Black Flash is revealed to represent the Dark Aspect of the Speed Force, which is responsible for the empowerment of Wally West's children. His connection to death is limited to those connected to the Speed Force. While an issue{{Issue|date=April 2009}} of ''[[Captain Atom]]'' suggests Death of the Endless, the Black Racer, and Nekron are all aspects of the same force, [[Neil Gaiman]] (creator of Death of the Endless) disagrees with this idea, stating that his creation is the ultimate personification of Death{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

During the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Wally West theorizes that the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] pursuing himself and Barry is in fact the Black Flash.

A charred corpse, appearing to be the Black Flash, was found in [[Iowa]] by two boys in the pages of ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> Later when the resurrected Barry Allen discovers the body he is transformed into the 'next' Black Flash, but the state is reversed.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #2 (May 2009)</ref> It's revealed that [[Professor Zoom]] has altered the Speed Force to transform Barry Allen into the new Black Flash.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #3 (June 2009)</ref><ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #4 (August 2009)</ref>

==In other media==
The Black Flash appears in ''[[Justice League Heroes: The Flash]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. When the Flash dies, he is chased by the Black Flash. If the player avoids being caught, they are rewarded with a chance at continuing the game, coming back with low health and without losing the current life. After each death, escape from the Black Flash becomes increasingly difficult.
