== Biography ==
'''Phantazia''' (real name Eileen Harsaw) is a fictional [[mutant]] super villain in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appeared in [[X-Force]] #6.  She was recruited into [[Toad (comics)|Toad's]] [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].  She was one of the more powerful members of the group, with the ability to project bio-energy in the forms of blasts that could disrupt an individual's bioelectric field, toy with one's sense of sight, taste, touch, hearing, or smelling, and the power to levitate.  Her first mission with the Brotherhood led her to battle the mutant strike force called [[X-Force]].  There, she easily shut off [[Cable (comics)|Cable's]] weaponry, and disrupted [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball's]] blast field, allowing [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] to stab him in the chest.

After [[Thornn (comics)|Thornn's]] defeat, Phantazia felt overwhelmed and fled, leaving [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] to be killed by [[Shatterstar|Shatterstar's]] sword.  Other missions set the Brotherhood up against [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[Darkhawk]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]].  Eventually, Phantazia was invited to [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]], a mutant sanctuary, by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].  She rejected the offer and stayed with the Brotherhood.  [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro's]] sickness was getting to him, so they stayed with the mutant [[Empyrean (comics)|Empyrean]], who could ward off Pyro's pain.  The [[X-Men]] eventually found out what was going on and during the battle, Phantazia was stabbed in the head by [[Psylocke|Psylocke's]] psychic dagger.  She recuperated, but after the Brotherhood split up, Phantazia disappeared.  

She was most recently seen as one of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] elite guards in the [[House of M]] mini-series.  She is currently being held in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|SHIELD's]] psychological ward, apparently having gone insane.  She was also one of the many mutants who lost their powers on [[M-Day]]. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Maria Hill states in a conversation with Iron Man (Tony Stark) that Eileen has been muttering the words "House of M" repeatedly in her cell for some time after losing her powers. This is deemed very odd by fans, as only those heroes who were "cured" by Layla Miller and protected by Dr. Strange's magics and Emma Frost's psychic powers have any recollection of the House of M events.

==Powers==
Phantazia is a mutant who formerly possessed the ability to sense, manipulate, and disrupt various fields and wavelengths of electromagnetic energy (she has referred to her power as 'harmonizing'). Though the upper limits of her powers were never clearly defined, it is assumed that Phantazia could use her power to disrupt anything of an electromagnetic nature. She was able to disrupt the bioelectric energy fields of other living beings, resulting in pain, paralysis, loss of physical coordination, and in the case of superhumans, the inability to control their powers, causing them to fluctuate in strength, cease functioning altogether, or spew out uncontrollably. She could generate some form of antigravity field, allowing her to levitate. By disrupting the electrical fields of machinery, Phantazia could short them out completely, or even control them to some degree, opening computer-locked doors, jamming weapon and targeting systems, etc. She could generate a masking effect as well, rendering herself and others near her undetectable to human senses and electronic surveillance. Her power also granted her the ability to sense various forms of energy in her environment, including electronics and atmospheric distortion that precedes a teleportation effect.

==Alternate versions==

Phantazia had a very brief appearance in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline, in which she was also member of the Brotherhood. She had been a captive of Dark Beast, who had experimented on her and her teammates to the point the she had no hair and her powers ceased to function. She escaped with the other Brotherhood members, but was quickly recaptured, being too weak to defend herself. She and the rest of the Brotherhood were returned to [[Dark Beast]], who killed them by dissolving them into his genetic "soup".
