'''Elizabeth Allan''', who usually goes by the name '''Liz Allan''' (commonly misspelled, even in the published comics themselves, as '''Liz Allen'''), is a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], part of the supporting cast of [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker). She was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

In the character's earliest appearances, she was an attractive, popular girl at the [[high school]] of the nerdy Peter Parker, who is secretly Spider-Man. She was an early love interest of Peter but differences in their levels of social acceptance kept them apart. Since then, she has been seen semi-frequently in various Spider-Man series and has had ties to his adversaries the [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] and [[Molten Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Liz Allan was a high school classmate of Peter Parker when they attended [[Midtown High School]] together, and a minor love interest of Parker and [[Flash Thompson]].

An unnamed blonde female high school student in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August [[1962]]) appears to be Liz Allan. Liz Allan is first named in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (September 1963), the same issue in which [[Betty Brant]] first appears. Initially, Peter likes Liz. However, she is [[Flash Thompson]]'s girlfriend and initially considers Peter Parker something of a loser, even taking part in the general ridicule that Pete endures on a daily basis. Her earliest appearances depict her as flighty and rather thoughtless - not outright cruel, but lacking the empathy necessary to detect Peter's good points.

Over time, however, she begins to admire Peter's intelligence and develops some degree of affection for the former "bookworm" (specifically, after issue 12: "Unmasked by Doctor Octopus"). By this time, ironically, Peter's interest has waned considerably: noting that Liz never showed any real interest in him until he began dating Betty Brant, Pete assumes that Liz's feeling are little more than a schoolgirl crush. Amusingly, Betty and Liz clash several times over Peter; Betty thinks of Liz as a blonde tramp.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28 (September 1965), Peter and Liz graduate from high school. At the graduation ceremony, Liz admits her feelings to Peter, but tells him that they cannot be together and left shortly afterwards.  In the same issue, Spider-Man battled the [[Molten Man]], who in later issues is revealed to be Liz's step-brother Mark Raxton. 

She does not reappear in the comics for a few years, during which time Peter developed relationships with [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]].

When Liz returns, she dates then marries [[Harry Osborn]], who she met at Betty Brant's wedding to [[Ned Leeds]], becoming '''Liz Allan Osborn'''. The couple have a son, [[Normie Osborn]]. Their family history turns tragic, however, after Harry Osborn becomes the [[Green Goblin]] and later dies.

In the [[graphic novel]] ''Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil'', Harry attempts to pass the legacy of the Green Goblin down to Normie Osborn but fails due to the efforts of Spider-Man, Mark Raxton and [[Ben Urich]].

Later, Liz Allan dates lawyer [[Foggy Nelson]], the legal partner of [[Matt Murdock]], a.k.a. Daredevil. The couple breaks up after [[Mysterio]] manipulates Foggy into having an affair in a plot to drive Daredevil insane. Like so many of the men in her life, Liz feels like Foggy has let her down and ends their relationship.

She has recently been seen to be extremely upset when Spider-Man unmasked, blaming Peter for bringing so much death into their lives.

==Other versions==

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] continuity, Liz Allan married [[Foggy Nelson]] after the death of Harry Osborn.  She developed a fatal illness (of a non-specified nature), which contributed to her son Normie's breakdown and finally choosing to adopt the mantle of the Green Goblin.


===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===
Liz Allan is portrayed as [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s ditzy and feisty best friend. Liz is a cheerleader and has recently reconciled with her boyfriend [[Flash Thompson]] after breaking up with him because he declared that he loved Mary Jane at homecoming.

===Ultimate Liz Allan===
[[Image:Ulizallen.jpg|thumb|Ultimate Liz Allan.]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Liz Allan goes to the same high school with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. She is close friends with Mary Jane. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4 (February 2001), a [[Drunkenness|drunk]] Liz attempts to make out with Peter, who refuses her advances when Mary Jane sees them. They later have a very personal moment when both students are called to talk about [[The Green Goblin]]'s attack on the school. Otherwise, there is no instance of any relationship between Peter and Liz.  Liz had an uncle who was a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], and this led to his death, though what exactly happened has not been explained. (The ''Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe'' suggested that her uncle may have been killed in [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s attacks during ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', but Bendis has never commented on it.) As a result of this, Liz has a phobia of mutants and super-powered beings, and it has been suggested by other characters that she worries that she herself is a mutant. When [[Johnny Storm]] joined her school briefly, she became extremely attracted to him and they shared a happy date - until he accidentally lit himself on fire, revealing himself as the [[Human Torch]]. Mary Jane reveals to Johnny that Liz believes that ''she'' lit him on fire. Due to her phobia, she refused to see him ever again, and he left the school.

With the arrival of  Kitty Pryde, a publicly known mutant & former X-Man, at Midtown High, Liz has been complaining to anyone that will listen that Kitty should be with her "own kind" and even accused Kitty of thinking she was better than everyone else due to her being a former X-Man, at which point Kitty rebutted Liz's accusations. Liz's best friend, Mary Jane, has also told Liz to keep her mutant phobia to herself when she's around MJ, and that she'd prefer it if Liz kept those thoughts to herself in general.

During the Ulitmate Spider-Man storyline [[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends|"Ultimate Spidey Friends"]], which also stars [[Johnny Storm]] and [[Bobby Drake]], Allen finally begins dating Storm, whom she previously rejected. Solicitations insinuate that she will become Ultimate [[Firestar]]. Magneto will appear and comments at the San Diego Comic-Con by Brian Michael Bendis insinuate that Magneto is her father.
