'''Elizabeth Allan''', who usually goes by the name '''Liz Allan''' (commonly misspelled, even in the published comics themselves, as '''Liz Allen'''), is a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], part of the supporting cast of [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker). She was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

{{spoiler}}

In most [[continuity|continuities]] in which she appears, Liz Allan is a high school classmate of Peter Parker, and a minor love interest.

==History==

An unnamed blonde female high school student appears in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August [[1962]]) who is probably Liz Allan, though there is no proof of this. Liz Allan is first named in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (September 1963), the same issue in which [[Betty Brant]] first appears.

Liz is a high school classmate of Peter Parker. Initially, Peter likes her; however, she is the girlfriend of [[Flash Thompson]] and considers Peter Parker to be too much of a geek and nerd for her to really associate with. Over time, however, she begins to admire Peter's intelligence and develops a crush on him. By this time, however, Peter is already seriously dating Betty. Betty and Liz clash several times over Peter; Betty thinks of Liz as a blonde tramp.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28 (September [[1965]]), it is revealed that her step-brother is Mark Raxton, the [[Molten Man]], a [[supervillain]] whom Spider-Man is forced to battle. In the same issue, Peter and Liz graduate from high school. At the graduation ceremony, Liz admits her feelings to Peter, but tells him that they cannot be together and leaves shortly afterwards.

She does not reappear in the comics for a few years, during which time Peter develops relationships with [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]].

When Liz returns, she dates and marries [[Harry Osborn]], becoming '''Liz Allan Osborn'''. The couple have a son, [[Normie Osborn]]. Their family turns to tragedy, however, after Harry Osborn becomes the [[Green Goblin]] and dies.

In the [[graphic novel]] ''Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil'', Harry's father, [[Norman Osborn]], the original Green Goblin, attempts to pass the legacy of the Green Goblin down to Normie Osborn but fails thanks to the efforts of Spider-Man and [[Ben Urich]].

Later, Liz Allan dates [[Foggy Nelson]] for a period of time. The couple break up after [[Mysterio]] manipulates Foggy into cheating on her.

==Liz Allan in other continuities==

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, '''Liz Allan''' goes to the same high school with [[Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. She is close friends with Mary Jane. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4 (February 2001), a [[intoxicated|drunk]] Liz attempts to make out with Peter, who refuses her advances when Mary Jane sees them. Otherwise, there is no instance of any relationship between Peter and Liz.

In the [[Marvel Age]] continuity, '''Liz Allan''' is [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s best friend. Mary Jane is dating [[Harry Osborn]], and Liz is dating [[Flash Thompson]], but Flash has a crush on Mary Jane.
