'''Lex Luthor''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in [[American comic book|comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].  The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #23 (Apr. [[1940 in comics|1940]]), and was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]. Luthor is described as "a power-mad, evil scientist" of incredible technological prowess.<ref>[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] (w), Sikela, John (p). ''"The Skeletons in Armor''. ''[[Action Comics]]'' #47 (1942).  [[DC Comics]].</ref> His goals typically center on killing [[Superman]], usually as a stepping stone to [[world domination]]. Though he periodically wears a [[powered exoskeleton]], Luthor has traditionally lacked [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s or a [[Secret identity|dual identity]].<ref name="Comics 166">{{cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-24|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/|title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs. Megavillain|work=QuickStopEntertainment.com|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> 

The character was originally depicted as a [[mad scientist]] who, in the vein of [[pulp novel]]s, wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry. In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown with a full head of [[red hair]]; despite this, the character later became [[bald]] as the result of an artist's mistake. A [[1962 in comics|1962]] story by [[Robert Bernstein]] expanded upon Luthor's origin and motivations, revealing him to be a childhood friend of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] who lost his hair in a chemical spill.

Following the [[1985 in comics|1985]] [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the character was [[retcon|re-imagined]] as a [[Machiavellian]] [[Business magnate|industrialist]] and [[white collar crime|white-collar]] criminal, even briefly serving as [[President of the United States]].  In recent years, various writers have revised Luthor's classic persona from the 1970's, most notably in the [[2005 in comics|2005]] series ''[[All Star Superman]]''. [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] magazine rates the character #8 on its "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>McCallum, Pat (July 2006). "100 Greatest Villains Ever".

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
[[Image:Luthor Action Comics 23.png|200px|thumb|left|Luthor's appearance in ''[[Superman]]'' (vol. 1) #4 (1940).  Art by Paul Cassidy.]]
By many accounts, the seeds for Luthor's character first appeared in ''[[The Reign of the Super-Man]]'', also written by Siegel and Shuster.  In the original [[short story]], a bald scientist uses a piece of alien meteor to give Bill Dunn [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities, which Dunn abuses for personal gain. Though the definitive Luthor would not appear until two years after Superman's debut, a central theme to his character&mdash;a dichotomy of science versus superpowers&mdash;was in place.<ref>[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]].  ''Superman: The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Man of Steel''.  Chronicle Books, 1998, pg. 66. ISBN 0811842312</ref><ref name="UGO">[http://superman.ugo.com/enemies/lex_luthor/default.asp Superman Enemies: Lex Luthor].  [[UGO Networks]].  Retrieved on 2008-11-19.</ref>

The villain's original incarnation, as drawn by Joe Shuster, appeared only twice between 1940-1941.  In his debut, "Luthor" (who is referred to only by his [[surname]]) is a wily scientific genius who resides in a flying city suspended by a [[dirigible]], having taken control of several [[Europe]]an countries through his machinations.  He initially tries to provoke a war between the two fictional nations of Galonia and Toran, but is stopped by [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]].<ref>[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] (w), [[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]] (p, i). ''Action Comics'' #23 (1940).  [[DC Comics]].</ref><ref>Daniels (1998), p. 13.</ref>  In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown as a middle-aged man with a full head of [[red hair]].  In [[1941 in comics|1941]], however, an artistic [[goof]] resulted in Luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip.<ref>Siegel, Jerry (w), Novak, Leo (p, i). ''Superman'' (vol. 1) #10 (1941).  DC Comics.</ref>  The original error is attributed to Leo Novak, a studio artist who illustrated for the ''Superman'' dailies during this period.

At that time, Luthor was not the first recurring foe Superman had faced; that role belonged to the [[Ultra-Humanite]], a bald scientist who commits crimes by transplanting his brain into other bodies.  The common belief is that Novak mistook Luthor for the Ultra-Humanite, who is initially depicted as a balding, elderly man; however, other evidence suggests he confused Luthor's design with that of a stockier, bald [[Henchman#In popular culture|henchman]] in ''Superman'' (vol. 1) #4 ([[1940 in comics|1940]]).  Luthor's next appearance occurs in ''Superman'' (vol. 1) #10 (1941), in which Novak depicts him as significantly heavier, with visible jowls.<ref>Cronin, Brian ([[2006]]-[[11-26]]) [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/30/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-79/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #79].  ''[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/ Comic Book Resources]''. Retrieved on 2007-[[July 18|7-18]].</ref>  The character's abrupt hair loss was made reference to several times during the 1960's.  When the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC multiverse]] began to take hold, Luthor's red-haired incarnation was rewritten as Alexei Luthor, Lex's counterpart from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. During the early 1960s, writer [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] altered Luthor's backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin.

In the [[origin story]] printed in ''[[Adventure Comics #271]]'' (1962), Lex Luthor is an aspiring scientist who resides in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], the hometown of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]].  During an attempt to create an artificial form of life, an accidental fire breaks out in Luthor's lab.  Superboy uses his super-breath to extinguish the flames, inadvertently spilling chemicals which cause Luthor to go bald;<ref name="UGO"/> in the process, he also destroys Luthor's priceless life form.  Believing Superboy intentionally caused the accident, Luthor attributes his actions to jealousy and vows revenge.  He first tries to show up Superboy with grandiose inventions which will improve the lives of Smallville's residents, but each goes dangerously out of control and requires Superboy's intervention.  Unwilling to accept responsibility for these mishaps, Luthor rationalizes that Superboy is out to humiliate him.<ref>[[Robert Bernstein|Bernstein, Robert]] (w), Fradon, Ramona (p). ''"How Luthor Met Superboy!" [[Adventure Comics]]'' #271 (1960).  DC Comics.</ref>  This revised origin makes Luthor's fight with Superman a personal one, and suggests that if events had unfolded differently, Luthor might have been a more noble person.  These elements were played up in various stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in [[Elliot S. Maggin]]'s novel ''[[Last Son of Krypton]]''.<ref name="cbr maggin">{{cite web|author=Callahan, Timothy|date=2008-09-04|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=17934&page=article|title=Elliot S!

===1980s-1990s===
[[Image:Mos4.jpg|175px|right|Cover art to ''[[The Man of Steel]]'' #4, by [[John Byrne]].|thumb]]
In the [[1986 in comics|1986]] limited series [[The Man of Steel (comic book)|''The Man of Steel'']], [[John Byrne]] rewrote Lex Luthor from scratch, intending to make him a villain that the 1980s would recognize: an evil [[corporate]] [[Corporate title|executive]]. Initially brutish and overweight, Byrne's Luthor soon evolved into a younger, more refined version of his old self. In a move indicative of Byrne's realistic approach, Luthor is no longer recounted as having lost his hair in a chemical fire; instead, his hairline is shown to be receding naturally over time. Collaborator [[Marv Wolfman]] recalled:

{{cquote|I never believed the original Luthor.  Every story would begin with him breaking out of prison, finding some giant robot in an old lab he hid somewhere, and then he'd be defeated.  My view was if he could afford all those labs and giant robots he wouldn't need to rob banks.  I also thought later that Luthor should not have super powers.  Every other villain had super powers.  Luthor's power was his mind.  He needed to be smarter than Superman.  Superman's powers had to be useless against him because they couldn't physically fight each other and Superman was simply not as smart as Luthor.<ref>Freiman, Barry ([[2005]]-[[11-15]]). [http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/interviews/interviews-intro.php?topic=c-interview_wolfman1 Interview with Marv Wolfman]. [http://www.supermanhomepage.com Superman Homepage].  Retrieved on 2007-[[July 7|7-7]].</ref>}}

The [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] Lex Luthor is a product of [[child abuse]] (a common archetype among supervillains) and early poverty.  Born in the [[Suicide Slum]] district of [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]], he is instilled with a desire to become a self-made man.  As a teenager, he takes out a large insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge, then sabotages their car's brakes, causing their deaths.  Upon graduating from [[MIT]], Luthor founds his own business, [[LexCorp]], which grows to dominate much of Metropolis.

Luthor does not physically appear in ''The Man of Steel'' until the fourth issue, which takes place over a year after Superman's arrival in Metropolis.  When [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]] are invited to a society gala aboard Luthor's [[yacht]], [[terrorist]]s seize the ship without warning, forcing Superman to intervene. <ref>[[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] (w, p), [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]] (i). ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' #4 (1986).  DC Comics.</ref>  Luthor observes Superman in action, and once the gunmen are dispatched, hands the hero a personal check in an attempt to hire him.  But when Luthor admits that he had not only anticipated the attack, but had arranged for it to occur in order to lure Superman out, the Mayor deputizes Superman to arrest Luthor for reckless endangerment.  This, coupled with the indignation that Superman is the only person he could not buy off, threaten, or otherwise control, results in Luthor's pledge to destroy Superman at any cost.

Despite general acceptance of Byrne and Wolfman's characterization, some writers have called for a return to Luthor's original status as a [[mad scientist]].  Regarding the character's effectiveness as a corrupt [[billionaire]], author [[Neil Gaiman]] commented:

{{cquote|It's a pity Lex Luthor has become a [[Multinational corporation|multinationalist]]; I liked him better as a bald scientist.  He was in prison, but they couldn't put his mind in prison.  Now he's just a skinny [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>Neil Gaiman Interview (December 1994) ''Hero Illustrated'' #18</ref>}}

Luthor's romantic aspirations toward Lois Lane, established early on in the series, become a focal point of the stories immediately following it.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #424, January 1987.</ref>  He is shown making repeated attempts to court her during ''The Man of Steel'', though Lois plainly does not return his feelings.<ref>Byrne, John (w), Giordano, Dick (i).

===Modern depictions===
''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', a limited series written by [[Mark Waid]] in [[2004 in comics|2004]], offers an alternate look at Luthor's history, including his youth in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] and his first encounter with Superman.  The story borrows heavily from the 2001 television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'',<ref name="cbr bright">{{cite web|author=Singh, Arune|date=2004-03-11|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3256|title=Super-Stars (Part 1): Mark Waid's "Birthright," The Official Origin|work=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref> which follows [[Clark Kent]]'s life as a teenager and into early manhood; among the elements lifted from the show is Lex Luthor's problematic relationship with his wealthy father, [[Lionel Luthor|Lionel]].  ''Birthright'' also reinvents the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] concept of Luthor befriending Clark Kent as a young man.  During a failed attempt to communicate with [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], an explosion erupts which singes off Luthor's hair.<ref>[[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]] (w), [[Leinil Francis Yu|Yu, Leinil Francis]] (p, i). ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' #8 (2004).  DC Comics.</ref><ref name="scifi"/> 

Waid's original intention was to jettison the notion of Lex Luthor being an evil businessman, restoring his status as a mad scientist.  However, he ultimately conceded that the [[CEO]] Luthor would be easier for readers to recognize.  In ''Birthright'', Luthor remains a wealthy corporate magnate; in contrast to Byrne's characterization, however, LexCorp is founded upon Luthor's study of [[extraterrestrial life]], thereby providing a link between himself and Superman.<ref>Waid, Mark (w), Yu, Leinil Francis (p, i).  ''Superman: Birthright'' #6 (2004).  DC Comics.</ref><ref name="cbr bright"/>  In the retrospective section of the ''Superman: Birthright'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], Waid explains:

{{cquote|Despite my own personal predjudices, I say we leave Lex the criminal businessman he's been for the past 17 years.  The ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'' producers liked it, the [[Superman: The Animated Series|WB cartoon]] guys liked it... so clearly, it works on some level.  My concern is that, at least in my eyes, the fact that Luthor's allowed to operate uncontested for ''years'' makes Superman look ineffectual.<ref>[[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]] (2005).

Luthor's current origin appears to be a synthesis of aspects from the Silver Age continuity and ''The Man of Steel''. Recent changes to the DC Comics continuity are revealed to be a result of the [[2005 in comics|2005]] series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', which created an alternate timeline called "New Earth".

As outlined in a backup proflie in ''52'', the post ''Action Comics'' #850 Lex Luthor of current "New Earth" continuity is the son of business mogul Lionel Luthor and his socialite spouse, Leticia.  As shown previously in ''Superman: Birthright'' and the pre-''Crisis'' stories, he spends part of his adolescence in Smallville, Kansas.  It is here that Luthor comes into acquaintance with Clark Kent, [[Lana Lang]], and [[Pete Ross]].  He is described as having left Smallville "under a cloud of rumor and suspicion."  He later resurfaces in Metropolis and founds LexCorp.  Luthor's rise to the Presidency and his removal from office are also recounted in this biography, however contrary to ''Birthright'' his hair is once again shown to have naturally receded over time, as in ''The Man of Steel''.

Though he is a noted criminal on Earth, Luthor is revered on the alien world of Lexor, where he rediscovered the planet's lost technology and rebuilt society for its inhabitants.  As a result, he becomes a hero in the eyes of Lexor's people, whereas Superman is detested as a villain.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #43, November/December 1946: ''“The Molten World!”''</ref> He eventually marries a local woman named Ardora,<ref>Action Comics # 318, November 1964: ''"The Death of Luthor"''.</ref> with whom he fathers a son.  After its debut,<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (vol. 1) #164.</ref>  Lexor appears sporadically in various Superman comics as Luthor's base of operations, where he wages assaults on Superman.  During one such battle, an energy salvo from Luthor's battle suit accidentally overloads the "Neutrarod"&mdash;a [[spire]] Luthor had built to counter Lexor's geological instability&mdash;resulting in the annihilation of Lexor's inhabitants, including his wife and son.  Luthor eventually returns to Earth, unable to accept his own role in Lexor's destruction and blaming Superman for it.<ref>''Action Comics'' #544, June 1983: ''"Luthor Unleashed"''.</ref>

During the 12-issue limited series ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Luthor allies himself with fellow Superman foe [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] to recruit an army of supervillains spanning the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]], intending to take advantage of the confusion caused by the Crisis.  However, once it becomes clear that it is as much in their interests to save the multiverse as anyone else's, Luthor and Brainiac reluctantly ally their faction with Superman and the other heroes.  At the conclusion of the series, reality is altered so that each of the different universes fall into their proper place, converging into one.  Afterward, Luthor is subsequently returned to prison with all his memories of the alliance forgotten.

As part of the continuity changes which followed ''The Man of Steel'', Luthor is shown actively participating in the creation of two ''Superman'' villains, [[Bizarro]] (the failed result of an attempt to clone Superman) and the [[cyborg]] [[Metallo]]. Upon discovering that Metallo is powered by a 'heart' of [[kryptonite]] rock in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #22, Luthor steals it in order to fashion a kryptonite [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]] for himself.  He wears the alien ore around his finger as a symbol that he is untouchable, even to the man of steel.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #22, February 1987</ref>  Luthor eventually suffers from a severe [[cancer]] brought on by long-term [[Radiation poisoning|radiation exposure]] to the ring;<ref>''Action Comics'' #600.</ref> before this, kryptonite was mistakenly assumed to produce a 'clean' radiation that is harmless to humans.

Luthor decides to fake his own death by boarding a jet on a proposed trip around the world and crashing it in the [[Andes]]; this is merely a cover for the removal of his brain from his cancer-ridden body and the growth of a [[Human cloning|cloned]] body around it, whereupon he passes himself off as his hitherto unknown, illegitimate 21-year-old son and heir, Lex Luthor II.  His deception is benefited by a vibrant new body with a beard and full head of red hair, as well as assuming an Australian accent as part of his fake backstory.<ref>''Action Comics'' #670.</ref>  Luthor II inherits control of LexCorp and seduces the then current [[Supergirl]], [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Matrix]], due to his resemblance to her creator.<ref>''Action Comics'' #677.</ref>  Luthor's clone body eventually begins to deteriorate and age at a rapid rate, a side-effect of a disease that affects all clones.

In the end, Luthor becomes a permanent prisoner in his own body, unable to even blink, and swearing vengeance on Superman.

Aid comes in the form of the demon [[Neron]]; Luthor promptly sells his soul in exchange for Neron restoring his body to vibrant health, though he once more loses his hair and a return to an older age than his 21-year-old cloned form, albeit one that is apparently still younger than before his cancer, or at any rate in far better shape.<ref>''Superman: The Man of Tomorrow'' #1.</ref>  Returning to Metropolis, Luthor freely turns himself over to the police and is put on trial.

====President of the United States====
[[Image:Lex2000.jpg|left|160px|thumb|right|Cover to ''Lex 2000'' #1, featuring Lex Luthor as [[President of the United States]].  Art by [[Glen Orbik]].]]
Deciding to turn to politics, Luthor becomes [[President of the United States]], winning the election on a platform of promoting technological progress. His first action as president was to take a proposed moratorium on fossil-based fuels to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]].

Luthor is assisted by the extreme unpopularity of the previous administration's mishandling of the [[Gotham City]] [[No Man's Land (comics)|earthquake crisis]].  After six months, Gotham is restored and rejoins America.  Ironically, [[Batman]] ultimately learns that the entire debacle was the fault of Luthor alone as he attempted to take control of Gotham by forging deeds for the land in his name, which results in Bruce Wayne severing all commercial ties between the U.S. government and his company, [[Wayne Enterprises]], in protest of Luthor's election as President.  Luthor responds in turn by arranging for the murder of Wayne's lover, [[Vesper Fairchild]], and [[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive|framing Wayne for the murder]]. 

An early triumph of Luthor's first term occurs during the ''[[Our Worlds At War]]'' comic book [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], in which he coordinates the U.S. Army, Earth's superheroes and a number of untrustworthy alien forces to battle the main villain of the story arc, [[Imperiex]].  As it is eventually revealed, however, Luthor knew about the alien invasion in advance and did nothing to alert Earth's heroes to it, leading to [[Topeka]], [[Kansas]] being destroyed by an Imperiex probe.

====Removal from office====
A cadre of superheroes eventually break ranks from the [[Justice League]] to oppose Luthor.  Batman, who had previously forbade any attempt to unseat Luthor from office by force, led the storming of the [[White House]].  This was predicated by an attempt on Luthor's part to link Superman to a kryptonite [[asteroid]] that is hurtling toward Earth. In a desperate gambit, Luthor uses a variant combination of the "super-[[steroid]]" Venom (a chemical associated with the Batman villain [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]), liquid synthetic Kryptonite, and an [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] battlesuit to fight Superman directly. 

The madness that is a side effect of Venom takes hold, and during the ensuing fight with Superman and Batman, Luthor admits he had traded the creature Doomsday to [[Darkseid]] in return for weapons during the ''Our Worlds at War'' crisis; in doing so, he inadvertently provides a confession which is captured on video by Batman. Returning to the LexCorp building to regroup, Luthor finds that the acting [[Chief executive officer|C.E.O.]], [[Talia Head]], has sold the entirety of the company assets to the Wayne Foundation, forcing Luthor to escape and go into hiding.  Following Luthor's bankruptcy and total disgrace, Vice President [[Pete Ross]] briefly assumes his place as President.  Based on the [[Timeline of the DC Universe|official DC timeline]], Luthor serves fewer than three years.

====''Infinite Crisis''====
[[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], the son of Earth-Three's Lex Luthor, returned to the DC Universe along with other survivors from ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' as part of a scheme to create a perfect Earth, under the pretense of restoring Earth-Two.  To this end, he assumed Luthor's identity and created a new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].  In response, the real Luthor took on the identity of  [[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]] and formed a supervillain version of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] in order to counter Alexander's organization.

Luthor confronts his impostor In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #3, but is intercepted by [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]], who is allied with Alexander.  Luthor later visits [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]], who is in recovery at [[Titans Tower]].  He slips Conner a crystal shard which shows the location of Alexander's Arctic Fortress.  At the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, Luthor oversees the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s execution of Alexander.

====''52''====
{{main|52 (comic book)}}
[[Image:52weekthirtynine.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Cover art for ''52'': Week 39, by J.G. Jones.]]
In the opening weeks of ''52'', the [[Gotham City Police Department]] finds what appears to be Luthor's body in an alley.  [[John Henry Irons]] examines the body at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and notes that the corpse was altered postmortem to make it resemble Lex Luthor.  During a press conference, the genuine Luthor publicly states that the body is that of an impostor from another Earth, and the true culprit of the crimes Luthor is being charged with.<ref>''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'': Week 3</ref>  Though Alexander's body had a missing finger and a different appearance from Lex at the time of his death, ''52'' editor Stephen Wacker has confirmed that the body found in Gotham is indeed Alex, and that Luthor had it altered before the police discovered it.<ref>[[Newsarama]] interview with Stephen Wacker [http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/WAcker/Wacker03.html]</ref>

Luthor immediately sets out to rebuild his reputation; he becomes spokesman for a new procedure, created by the [[Everyman Project]], that engineers ordinary citizens to develop [[superpowers]].  During the [[autopsy]] of Alex Luthor, he secretly exposes John to the chemicals involved in his creating his new army of super-heroes, turning John into a literal man of steel.  When approached by John's niece [[Natasha Irons]], Luthor gladly allows her to be one of his first test subjects.  Using Natasha and several other volunteers, Luthor forms his own team of superheroes which are introduced as the new [[Infinity Inc.]] In Week 21, Infinity Inc. is in the midst of a battle with [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]] (which Luthor has created as well), when he demonstrates that he can 'shut off' the powers of each of his agents; this results in the death of his [[Speedster (comics)|speedster]], Trajectory.<ref>''52'': Week 21</ref>

At the stroke of midnight on [[New Year's Eve]], Luthor sets in motion a calculated plot to discredit [[Booster Gold#52 and Supernova|Supernova]], a new hero who has taken over defending Metropolis in Superman's absence.  Luthor triggers a mass-shutdown of the powers of everyone who has undertaken the Everyman program, except for the members of Infinity Inc.  As multiple flight-powered Everymen plummet to their deaths, underground gas mains rupture from the impact, which adds civilians to the death toll.  Luthor's plot ultimately fails when Supernova is able to minimize the disaster with a spectacular rescue.<ref>''52'': Week 35</ref>

While investigating Luthor in order to root out his motive, Natasha Irons discovers that Luthor has been testing himself to see if he is compatible with the artificial meta-gene treatment.<ref>''52'': Week 39</ref>  John Henry Irons leads an assault on Luthor's building; despite the destruction of his armor during the fight, he confronts Luthor - only to find himself badly outclassed, as Luthor demonstrates nearly all of Superman's powers.  However, Natasha uses her uncle's hammer to trigger an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down the synthetic metagene long enough for Steel to knock Lex unconscious.<ref>''52'': Week 40</ref>  Lex is disgraced as a result, and later faces indictment when the members of the Everymen realize they have been used.

====''One Year Later'' and ''Countdown''====
{{main|One Year Later}}
One year after the events of ''Infinite Crisis,'' Luthor has been cleared of over 120 criminal counts ranging from malfeasance to first-degree murder relating to the New Years Eve massacre from ''52''. However, his role in the massacre has permanently ruined his public image and thanks to the machinations of [[Doctor Sivana]], he has lost most of his wealth and all of his control over his newly reformed LexCorp, which is now being run by [[Lana Lang]].  He blames Clark Kent for writing several articles unraveling his schemes and pledges vengeance on Metropolis after an angry mob jeers him on the courthouse steps.  After amassing large quantities of Kryptonite, including kidnapping the supervillains [[Metallo]] and the [[Kryptonite Man]], Lex uses it to power a Kryptonian battleship controlled through a "sunstone" crystal.<ref>''Action Comics'' #839</ref>  Superman manages to destroy the Kryptonite-powered ship and recover the crystal, but Lex manages to escape custody yet again.<ref>''Action Comics'' #840</ref>

Lex later sends Bizarro after the newly arrived "Superboy" only for the creature to be defeated by Superman.  Undaunted, Luthor gathers together a new [[Superman Revenge Squad|Revenge Squad]] to fight against invading Kryptonians led by [[General Zod]].

In JLA, Luthor (alongside Joker and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] III) gathers together a new "[[Injustice League]]" and, outfitted in a new version of his warsuit (although still green and purple, it no longer has clear design derivations from the pre-Crisis warsuit as the McGuinness design did), sets out to destroy the Justice League with them.  On a related note during this section, he was responsible for creating the third [[Shaggy Man (comics)|Shaggy Man]] and the third [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]].

Luthor plays a large role in the ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' tie-in event, ''[[Salvation Run]]''. Having been sent to the prison planet after his Injustice League was defeated, Lex quickly assumes control of the amassed villains, receiving competition only from Joker and [[Gorilla Grodd]], who convince half of the villains to join them.  He does fight the Joker until the battle was interrupted by an attack by [[Desaad]]'s [[Parademon]]s.  After the attack, Luthor manages to get the villains off the planet with a makeshift teleporter, secretly powered by [[Neutron (DC Comics)|Neutron]], [[Aryan Brigade (comics)|Heatmonger]], [[Plasmus (comics)|Plasmus]], [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] and [[Thunder and Lightning (comics)|Thunder and Lightning]].  When called a "monster" by Thunder, Luthor claims it is the ones who sent them there who are the real monsters, and that he is the hero.  He later sets the teleporter to self-destruct after he uses it, killing the attacking Parademons, and his living batteries.

====Final Crisis====
{{main|Final Crisis}}
In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21, Luthor can be seen associating with [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] and placed in its Inner Circle.  Lex Luthor wanted Libra to prove himself, so Libra sends Clayface to blow up the Daily Planet.  As Lex Luthor attempted to ambush Libra after learning that he's a prophet of Darkseid, Lex Luthor soon ends up surrounded by [[Justifiers]]. Libra tells Lex Luthor to make a final choice... swear an oath to Darkseid or become a mindless slave. In ''Final Crisis'' #5, Lex Luthor was seen when Libra blamed Calculator for cracking the computer codes that will help the resistance. Lex Luthor is silent on the matter, but has been picked to lead the rearguard action against the heroes at Blüdhaven. He assumes it's an honor, but he doesn't look very pleased.

==Relationships and family==
In the pre-''Crisis'' continuity, Luthor is shown as having very few personal attachments.  Shamed by his crimes, his parents (Jules and Arlene) disown him, move away and change their name to the [[anagram]] "Thorul".  Luthor has a younger sister named Lena, an [[empath (fiction)|empath]] who grows up unaware of her familial connection with the noted supervillain.  Protective of his sister, Luthor takes measures to hide his fraternity, and is assisted towards this end by both Superman and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. 

In ''The Man of Steel'' contunity, Lex Luthor has been married eight times, though the first seven marriages occurred off-panel in Luthor's past.  His eighth marriage to Contessa Erica Alexandra Del Portenza (aka the "Contessa") is based on mutual greed;<ref>''Superman: The Man of Tomorrow'' #5.</ref> the Contessa buys controlling interest in LexCorp after Luthor is indicted, compelling him to marry her in order to regain control of his company. The Contessa becomes pregnant<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #119</ref> and starts using the [[Lena Luthor|unborn child]] to dominate Lex into doing her bidding.  Luthor's response is to imprison her while she is drugged during childbirth, keeping her in a permanently-unconscious state.  The Contessa later escapes to an island mansion,<ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #77.</ref> but upon being elected President, Luthor targets her home with a barrage of missiles and destroys it.<ref>''President Luthor: Secret Files & Origins'' #1.</ref> 

[[James D. Hudnall]]'s ''Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography'' further expands on Luthor's origin.  The story details how Luthor was sent to live with a foster family following the sabotage of his parents' car.  His foster parents, Casey and Emily Griggs, conspire to embezzle his insurance, and coerce their daughter, Lena, into seducing Lex in order to learn the location of the money.  Due to her own romantic feelings toward Lex, Lena refuses, and is beaten to death by her father.  Lex is absent from the home at the time of the murder, having been talked into going to a football game by his schoolmate [[Perry White]].<ref>''Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography'' (1989)</ref> 

As an adult, this incident motivates Luthor to begin an affair with Perry's wife, Alice, during a period when Perry is missing and assumed dead.  Alice becomes pregnant shortly afterward, though the timing of the conception means an equal possibility of either Luthor or White being the father.  The child, Jerry White, later learns of his true parentage during his late teens, shortly before being killed by a local street gang he is associated with.  The loss of a potential heir weighs heavily on Luthor's mind, particularly when he is dying of cancer; while mulling over his fate, Luthor visits Jerry's gravesite.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #49.</ref>  

Luthor has shown an unusual level of compassion for [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]], a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] clone created from the DNA of Superman and Luthor himself.  After Connor's death at the conclusion of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Luthor is shown visiting a memorial statue of Connor in Metropolis and placing flowers there.<ref>''Action Comics'' #837</ref>  In the alternate future timeline of ''Titans Tomorrow'' <ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #17-19 (2005)</ref>, in which Conner still exists, Luthor acts as a caring, fatherly figure to him.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #51 (2007)</ref>

[[Lyle Talbot]] was the first actor to portray the character in a live-action film, appearing in the [[1950 in film|1950]] [[serial (film)|serial]] ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]''.<ref>Daniels (1998), p. 75.</ref>  The character has appeared in a total of four [[Superman (film series)|''Superman'' films]], with the only exception being ''[[Superman III]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]).  In the original [[Richard Donner]] films, Luthor is a vain, money-hungry gangster who plots outrageous disasters for Superman to try to avert.  He is regularly captured by Superman and sent to prison, only to escape &mdash; in a manner similar to the comics &mdash; at the opening of the next film. Two-time [[Academy Award]] winner [[Gene Hackman]] portrays Luthor in the [[Superman (film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]], along with two of its sequels, ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]) and ''[[Superman IV]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]).  In [[2006 in film|2006]], the role was inherited by Academy Award winner [[Kevin Spacey]] in ''[[Superman Returns]]'', set sometime after the events of ''Superman II''.  Following another stint in jail, Luthor is released on a string of technicalities and inherits a dying widow's fortune.  He immediately sets out to avenge himself on Superman, first by ransacking the Fortress of Solitude, and later through the abduction of [[Lois Lane]] and her son Jason.

Other actors who have portrayed Luthor include [[Scott James Wells]] and [[Sherman Howard]] in the television series ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]''; [[John Shea]] in the 1990s series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''; and [[Michael Rosenbaum]] in the 2000s ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.  He has also been voiced in animation by [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]] in the 1970s/80s ''[[Superfriends]]'' franchise and by [[Clancy Brown]] in the 1990s/2000s [[DC animated universe]] and a 2007 episode of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', among others. Lex Luthor is also a playable character in 2008's ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', sporting his trademark battle armor.
