'''Dream Girl''' (real name '''Nura Nal''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

== Fictional character biography ==

Her home planet is [[Naltor]]. She was romantically involved for many years with fellow Legionnaire [[Star Boy]]. She used Naltorian science — at which she was portrayed as expert — to change [[Lightning Lass]] into [[Light Lass]] by changing Lightning Lass's powers from lightning casting to making objects super lightweight. Partly due to chagrin at her non-combat effective power, she trained to become a skilled martial artist.

She left the Legion temporarily after first joining as she said she had joined under false pretenses as she had foreseen the deaths of some Legionnaires and she proceeded to get those Legionnaires expelled from the Legion on trumped up charges to save their lives. (However the Legionnaires she foresaw dying were actually robot doubles). She was for a time a member of the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]] until she rejoined with Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for killing in self defense Nura's former love, Naltorian Kenz Nahor, who had tried to kill Star Boy over jealousy of his relationship with Nura.

Years later she served as Legion leader, only the second female Legionnaire to do so (after [[Saturn Girl]]). Her sister Mysa, the [[White Witch (comics)|White Witch]], also served as a Legionnaire. Her mother was named Kiwa Nal, who was the High Seer of Naltor (Naltor's leader); the identity of her father was unrevealed.

=== Reboot versions ===
In post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, she claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, which she had changed to Nal because, as she put it, "It just says I'm from Naltor y'know". She also claimed to have been the first [[precognition|precognitive]] to be born on Naltor in seven generations (a claim that was later contradicted by other post Zero Hour Legion stories). 

The post-Zero Hour, Nura was for most of the continuity's tenure not a Legionnaire but merely [[Star Boy]]'s girlfriend. She suffered from [[narcolepsy]] (caused by falling unconscious whenever she had a vision) which was a change from her pre-ZeroHour incarnation. She was no longer the sister of Mysa, who was completely unrelated to her in that continuity. 

Post-Zero Hour, Nura did eventually gain Legion membership under the codename Dreamer shortly before the Legion was rebooted again into its third main continuity in 2005. 

===Threeboot===

In the 2005 reboot, her codename has returned to Dream Girl, but her origins and abilities are still being revealed. She has been portrayed as losing track of events in the present when tracking a future event (she once failed to get involved in a fight because she thought it had already happened).

[[Brainiac 5]] has been shown as resenting her ability to simply "know" things he has to deduce, and has questioned her abilities. Her response was a prediction that they would be married.

In current storylines she appears to have been killed in battle, however Brainiac 5 had her remains in stasis and was working to revive her. Although he has abandoned this, she appears to him in dreams.

She was replaced in the Legion by a male Naltorian named Dream Boy.

===One Year Later/Lightning Saga===
In the new ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' series, the original Dream Girl has appeared, alive, at the end of #4. She is chained down inside [[Arkham Asylum]], inside the cell of [[Doctor Destiny]]. Destiny then manipulates her nightmares to attack the Asylum guards, taking the form of grossly distorted versions of the Legion of Super-Villains and Darkseid. This particular incarnation of Dream Girl is implied to be linked to the realm of [[Dreaming (comics)|the Dreaming]], ruled by [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] of [[the Endless]].

== Powers and abilities ==

Like all natives of Naltor, Nura has the power to see the future in dreams and visions and she is rated one of the most powerful precognitives on the planet. She was skilled in Naltorian science, specializing in biology, and trained with Val Armorr aka [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]. Her hand-to-hand fighting skills, combined with her ability to glimpse the future, made her a formidable short-term opponent in battle, capable of taking on  [[The Persuader]], but the sheer number of expanding possible futures in each second of a battle made it difficult for her to keep the advantage. She is highly charismatic, capable of convincing men and women to do what she wants. Her precognitive abilities also give her an edge in strategic planning.
