'''Dream Girl''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the thirtieth century. Her real name is Nura Nal, her home planet is [[Naltor]]. Like all natives of Naltor, Nura has the power to see the future in dreams and visions. She first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #317 (February 1964). She was romantically involved for many years with fellow Legionnaire [[Star Boy]]. She used Naltorian science to change [[Lightning Lass]] into [[Light Lass]] by changing Lightning Lass's powers from lightning casting to making objects super lightweight.

She left the Legion temporarily after first joining as she said she had joined under false pretences. (she had foreseen the deaths of some Legionnaires and she proceeded to get those Legionnaires expelled from the Legion on trumped up charges to save their lives. However the Legionnaires she foresaw dying were actually robot doubles) She was for a time a member of the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]] until she rejoined with Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for killing in self defence Nura's former love, Naltorian Kenz Nahor, who had tried to kill Star Boy over jealousy of his relationship with Nura.

Years later she served as Legion leader, only the second female Legionnaire to do so (after [[Saturn Girl]]). Her sister Mysa, the [[White Witch (comics)|White Witch]], also served as a Legionnaire. Her mother was named Kiwa Nal, who was the High Seer of Naltor (Naltor's leader); the identity of her father was unrevealed.

In post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, she claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, which she said she had changed to Nal because as she put it "It just says I'm from Naltor y'know". She also claimed to have been the first [[precognition|precognitive]] to be born on Naltor in seven generations. A claim that was later contradicted by other post Zero Hour Legion stories. The post ZH Nura was for most of the continuity's tenure not a Legionnaire but merely post ZH [[Star Boy]]'s girlfriend. She suffered from [[narcolepsy]] which was a change from her pre-ZH incarnation. She was no longer the sister of Mysa, who was completely unrelated to her in that continuity. Post-ZH Nura did eventually gain Legion membership under the codename Dreamer shortly before the Legion was rebooted again into its third main continuity in 2005. 

In the 2005 reboot, her codename has returned to Dream Girl, but her origins and abilities are still being revealed. In current storylines she appears to have been killed in battle, however [[Brainiac 5]] has her remains in stasis and is working to revive her. She was replaced in the Legion by Dream Boy.
