'''Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy''' are the [[Fictional character|fictional twin children]] of [[Norman Osborn]] and [[Gwen Stacy]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Goblinsinspast.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Gabriel Stacy fighting [[Spider-Man]].]]
The story arc "Sins Past" by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514 (August 2004-January 2005) reveals that Osborn fathered twins with Gwen, a boy and a girl to whom were given birth while in [[France]]. Gwen vowed to raise the twins with [[Peter Parker]] and refused to allow Norman access, seeing the disregard for Norman's [[Harry Osborn|eldest son]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} Seeing her as a threat to his potential heirs, Osborn [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|killed]] Gwen. Norman then raised Gwen's two children, a boy named Gabriel and a girl named Sarah. Due to Norman's enhanced blood, the twins [[Progeria|aged about 2-3 times faster than normal and were adults within the span of a few years]] (speculated to be between 5 and 9 years old). Osborn told them that Peter was really their father and was responsible for their mother's death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #513</ref> Gabriel and Sarah then attack [[Spider-Man]], and Spider-Man subsequently deduces their true identities thanks to a note they sent that had been written by Gwen while in Paris. However, seeking to confirm it, Peter goes to Gwen's grave and digs up a sample of Gwen's [[DNA]] to compare to the twin's DNA which was obtained from the envelope of the letter. During a brief confrontation with Sarah just after the DNA analysis completed, Peter learns that she clearly resembles her mother, but is forced to escape when Gabriel attacks. Spider-Man tells [[Mary Jane Watson]] about the initial encounter with Gabriel and Sarah, whereupon Mary Jane reveals of knowing about Norman's involvement with Gwen and tells all to Peter. Mary Jane has kept it from Peter all these years because Gwen was distraught and begged Mary Jane not to say anything, as well as not wanting to taint Peter's memory of the only woman Peter ever loved as much as — if not more than — Mary Jane.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #510</ref> Arranging a press conference, Spider-Man tells the twins to meet Spider-Man on the bridge where Gwen died, telling them the truth about their origins. Sarah believes Spider-Man — concluding that Spider-Man would never have dug up Gwen's grave to acquire a DNA sample if Spider-Man thought there was even a chance of being their father, Spider-Man having never even run his own DNA against theirs because Peter and Gwen never reached that stage in their relationship — but Gabriel does not, resulting in him attempting to attack Spider-Man only to accidentally shoot Sarah. With their metabolisms out of control due to the Goblin formula they inherited from Osborn, Gabriel returns to a secret Goblin base that Osborn told them to travel to after they had completed their mission, taking the Goblin formula and briefly be the '''[[Grey Goblin]]''' - the Goblin formula apparently stabilizing his aging problem at the cost of what remains of his sanity - while Sarah is taken to hospital and is given a transfusion of Spider-Man's blood while in the hospital. Spider-Man's abnormal blood also serving to stabilize her condition, both physically and mentally (with Mary Jane imagining Spider-Man 'kicking Norman's ass' on a cellular level as his blood defeats the anomalies created by the Green Goblin formula in Sarah's system). When Grey Goblin tries to attack the weakened Spider-Man, Sarah shoots Grey Goblin's glider, recognizing that Spider-Man is not responsible for their mother's death, causing an explosion that results in her brother vanishing. Sarah flees from the hospital, while Gabriel is later found washed up on a beach with no memory of what happened.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #514</ref>

A follow-up story to "Sins Past" was published in ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #23-26 (December 2004-March 2005), titled "Sins Remembered" written by Samm Barnes with art by Scot Eaton. Spinning directly out of the events of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514, Spider-Man locates Sarah in [[Paris]], where Sarah has her brother (suffering from [[amnesia]]) restrained in her home. With the help of Spider-Man and [[Interpol]], Sarah helps build a case against a criminal called Monsieur Dupres in exchange for the Interpol's help with her rapid-aging disease which is causing her, and Gabriel, severe headaches. However, during this time Gabriel escapes, prompting Sarah to join Interpol in hopes of finding her brother.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) #23-26</ref> This [[story arc]] was later collected as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] in 2005 as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Vol. 5: Sins Remembered'' ({{ISBN|0-7851-1628-1}}).

J. Michael Straczynski ultimately wished to [[retcon]] the characters out of existence using the events of the "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]" story arc, but was not permitted to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=141756|title=One More (More) Day?

Stacy", yet Spider-Man states that [[Harry Osborn]] is Norman's "only son" (although this may have been metaphorical).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref> It's stated that only a woman who has taken his Green Goblin serum can be impregnated, which contradicts how the twins were conceived.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #599</ref> Lastly, [[Molecule Man]]'s torment of the [[Dark Avengers]] includes Osborn hallucinating Gwen pregnant about to be killed.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #11</ref>

Gabriel officially returned in the ''American Son'' mini-series (although Sarah's whereabouts are still unknown) as the second version of '''[[Iron Patriot|American Son]]'''. He introduces himself to Harry then shoots his half-brother in the chest.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #1</ref> But American Son appears and saves Harry. After his attempt on Harry's life, Gabriel confronts the American Son battle suit and demands to know why "he" interfered.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #2</ref> It is subsequently revealed that Gabriel has stolen the American Son armor and is now suffering from a split personality, committing crimes as himself while American Son undoes the damage he has caused, identifying itself as the part of Gabriel that recognizes that what he is doing is wrong.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #3</ref> Gabriel hears a planned ambush by a police squad and proceeds to attack; before he can do any real damage, however, he is stopped by Spider-Man. Later, after kidnapping reporter [[Norah Winters]] and luring Harry to a vacant warehouse, Gabriel makes another attempt on Harry's life. While locked in combat with Harry, the two discuss their respective views of their father. Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is an evil monster who only craves death and power while Gabriel tells Harry that his brother's a waste of the Osborn bloodline. Saddened by the inability to reach Gabriel, Harry reveals hacking into the American Son armor and quickly over powers Gabriel. After Gabriel is defeated the warehouse is set on fire and the half-brothers are saved by Spider-Man and a police squad. Following his capture, Gabriel is placed in a psychiatric hospital, and informed that the American Son suit is thought to be destroyed. However, a package is soon delivered to his room containing the American Son helmet and a note from Norman telling him of loving Gabriel and missing his son.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to the Goblin formula's enhanced blood, Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy aged about 2-3 times faster than normal and were adults within the span of a few years. Their enhanced blood also gave the twins a slight increase in strength, reflexes, healing and endurance. But the aging causes the twins to suffer severe headaches.

Sarah's condition is stabilized through a blood transfusion from Spider-Man, leaving her significantly more mentally stable (although her precise strength level is unclear).

As the Grey Goblin, Gabriel later took the another Goblin serum to have his condition stabilized which granted him further increased superhuman strength while also driving him insane. He adopts the Green Goblin's Halloween-themed appearance, dressing in a Goblin costume and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, notably grenade-like "Pumpkin Bombs" and a bat-shaped "[[goblin glider]]". Gabriel later acquired the American Son armor which granted him further strength and stamina.

==Other versions==
* During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|2015 Secret Wars]]'' event, a vampiric Grey Goblin can be seen chasing [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref>''Secret Wars: Battleworld'' #2</ref>

==Character development==
J. Michael Straczynski later stated originally wanting Peter Parker to be the father of Gwen Stacy's kids but the editors vetoed the idea, but felt that it would age the protagonist too much if he had two adult children. It was then decided by the whole creative and editorial team that Norman Osborn would be the father.<ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/rage/111497451826808.htm SBC.com (no date): All the Rage (column) - "Don't Panic", by Blair Marnell & John Voulieris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502031042/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/rage/111497451826808.htm |date=2005-05-02 }}</ref>
