'''Kraven the Hunter''' is the name of a fictional [[supervillain]] from the popular [[Spiderman]] [[comic book]].  

He was a maniacal big game hunter who sought to defeat Spiderman to prove that he was the greatest hunter in the world.  He used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spiderman, but even without out the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler.  Eventually, he actually defeated Spiderman.  At this point, having no further purpose, Kraven committed [[suicide]].
