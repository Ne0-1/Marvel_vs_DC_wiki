==Character biography==
Kraven was a maniacal big game [[hunter]] who sought to defeat Spider-Man to prove that he was the greatest hunter in the world.  Unlike other hunters, he typically disdained the use of [[gun]]s or [[archery|bow and arrows]] preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands even though he often made elaborate preparations to weaken a quarry before hand.  He also used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler.  However, Kraven's continual underestimation of the superhero's resourcefulness made him a frustrating quarry.

In the acclaimed story by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Mike Zeck]], "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]," his aggravation with his inability to run the [[superhero]] down further destroyed his sanity.  With that, he hatched a scheme that actually  defeated Spider-Man, and seemingly and uncharacteristically shot him dead.  Considering his enemy effectively dead, Kraven buried him alive.  After this, Kraven donned a copy of Spider-Man's costume and sought to prove that he was superior at his enemy's activities.  This culminated with his successful singlehanded capture of a minor supervillain, [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], whom Spider-Man needed the help of [[Captain America]] to defeat.  After that triumph, Spider-Man revived from the tranquilizer dart he was actually shot with and dug his way out of the grave.  Kraven greeted him and explained that he had made his point about defeating his enemy.  Then he released Vermin and told Spider-Man to pursue him. At this point, having no further purpose, Kraven committed [[suicide]] while Spider-Man captured the villain on his own.

Kraven's alliegances and relatives in life were, for the most part, revealed only after his death.  The [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] was the person who initially gave Kraven the idea of hunting Spider-Man in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #15. After Kraven died, the Chameleon was revealed to be Dmitri Smerdyakov, Kraven's half-brother, personal servant, and the victim of Kraven's abuse, and yet, according to Smerdyakov, the two were best friends nonetheless. Kraven's lover, the [[voodoo]] priestess [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], manipulated the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] against the wall-crawler in the first issues of [[Todd McFarlane]]'s best-selling ''Spider-Man'' series.

Kraven has since had two sons take up his role. The first had a brief career as the "Grim Hunter," and was killed by [[Kaine]], an insane [[cloning|clone]] of Spider-Man. The second, Alyosha Kravinoff (or "Al Kraven") briefly operated as the second "Kraven the Hunter" before retiring from the supervillain scene, moving to [[Hollywood]], and becoming a hero himself.  He had a third son, Ned Tannengarden, who tried unsuccessfully to kill his half-brother Al and was himself killed by the Chameleon, who at this point was so insane he believed himself to be the original Kraven.

==Powers and abilities==
By ingesting mystical potions Kraven was able to grant himself superhuman strength and speed approaching, but not equaling that of Spiderman. These same potions retarded his aging process. At the time of his death he was over 70 years old and he appeared to be in the prime of his life. His agility, reflexes, stamina, and endurance were also enhanced. As he constantly ingested these potions he usually had these abilities, but without the effects of these potions he still possessed physical strength and agility of the level of an olympic athlete.

Aside from the augmentation of the mystical herbs, Kraven was a brilliant tactician and gifted hunter and tracker. He was a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat. He was very familiar with medicine and with exotic poisons and tranquilizers.

==Kraven in other media==
[[Image:Kraven the Hunter.jpg|frame| Kraven from Spider-Man: The Animated Series.]]Kraven was a hunter in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.  He had a fiancee named Dr. Mariah Crawford.  Seigei Kravinoff became Kraven the Hunter when Crawford puts a serum on him, which causes him to become insane.  In the end of his debut episode, Kravinoff was cured by Spider-Man to prevent him from attacking innocent people.  In ''Duel of the Hunters'', he was called by Crawford to cure Spider-Man from his disease, until his hunt was intterupted by [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]], who wanted to kill Spider-Man.  In the end, they work together to cure Spider-Man.  In ''Return of Kraven'', he came back to New York to cure Dr. Crawford from a serum she took that make Kravinoff became Kraven. In the end, Kraven cured Crawford to prevent her to attack innocent people with the serum she took.
