[[image:KravenTheHunter.jpg|thumb|Kraven The Hunter]]'''Kraven the Hunter''' is the name of a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  His real name was Sergei Kravinoff.  He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #15.

He was a maniacal big game [[hunter]] who sought to defeat Spider-Man to prove that he was the greatest hunter in the world.  He used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler.  However, Kraven's continual underestimation of the superhero's resourcefulness made him a frustrating quarry.

Eventually in the acclaimed story by J.M. Dematteis, ''Kraven's Last Hunt'', his aggrevation with his inability to run the [[superhero]] down further destroyed his sanity.  With that, he hatched a scheme that actually  defeated Spiderman, and seemingly and uncharacteristically shot him dead.  Considering his enemy effectively dead, Kraven buried him alive.  Afterwhich, Kraven donned a copy of Spider-Man's costume and sought to prove that he was superior at his enemy's activities.  This culminated with his successful singlehanded capture of a minor supervillain, Vermin, whom Spider-Man needed the help of [[Captain America]] to defeat.  After that triumph, Spider-Man revived from the [[tranquilizer dart]] he was actually shot with and dug his way out of the grave.  Kraven greeted him and explained that he had made his point about defeating his enemy.  Then he released Vermin and told Spider-Man to pursue him. At this point, having no further purpose, Kraven committed [[suicide]] while Spider-Man captured the villain on his own.

Kraven has since had two sons take up his role.  The first had a brief career as the "Grim Hunter"; he was killed by [[Kaine (comics)|Kaine]], an insane [[clone]] of Spider-Man.  The second, Alyosha Kravinoff (or "Al Kraven") briefly operated as the second "Kraven the Hunter" before retiring from the supervillain scene and moving to [[Hollywood]].
