'''Kraven the Hunter''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #15 ([[1964 in comics#August|August 1964]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

==Publication history==
'''Sergei Kravinoff''' is a maniacal [[Big game hunting|big game hunter]] known as Kraven the Hunter who seeks to defeat [[Spider-Man]] to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world. Unlike other hunters, he typically disdains the use of [[gun]]s or [[archery|bow and arrows]], preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands. He also uses a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he is a threat to the wall-crawler. Spider-Man proves a frustrating quarry because Kraven continually underestimates the superhero's resourcefulness.

Kraven finally completes his ultimate objective in the acclaimed 1987 storyline by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and [[Mike Zeck]], "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" and, having no further goals, commits [[suicide]]. Although the story was released in 1987, the story takes place in the Marvel Universe in 2003 according to Amazing Spider-Man issue 567.

Kraven later returns as a ghost in the graphic novel ''[[Kraven's Last Hunt#Soul of the Hunter|Amazing Spider-Man: Soul of the Hunter]]''. <ref> {{Cite comic

===Kraven's connections===
The [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] was the person who initially gave Kraven the idea of hunting Spider-Man in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #15. After Kraven died, the Chameleon was revealed to be Dmitri Smerdyakov, Kraven's half-brother. Kraven's lover, the [[wikt:voodoo|voodoo]] priestess [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], manipulated the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] against the wall-crawler in the first issues of [[Todd McFarlane]]'s best-selling ''Spider-Man'' series. It was later revealed in a story arc concerning [[Ka-Zar]] that Kraven was trained as a hunter largely by a mysterious man named '''Gregor''', a mercenary who battled [[Ka-Zar]].

===Kraven's legacy===
Kraven has also had two sons take up his role; Vladimir Kravinoff took up the name "[[Grim Hunter]]" and decides to hunt down Spider-Man and several of his foes, but is murdered by an insane clone of Spider-Man named [[Kaine]]. Some time after the death of Vladimir, his half brother and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], becomes the newest Kraven. There was a third son as well, Ned Tannengarden, who tries to kill Alyosha, but was murdered by the Chameleon.

===Ana Tatiana Kravinoff===
A third, female Kraven has recently appeared. She tracks Spider-Man to his apartment, but mistakenly believes Peter Parker's roommate Vin Gonzales was him. She then methodically ruins Vin's life, and captures him. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' '#565</ref> Despite Vin's claims that he was not Spider-Man, Kraven prepared to hunt him. At the end it is revealed that her name is Ana Tatiana Kravinoff, that she is only about 12 years old and that she is Kraven's daughter by a woman called Sasha Aleksandra Nikolaevich, also mother of the deceased Vladimir.

===Xraven===
It was revealed during 2009's X-Men/Spider-Man crossover that years ago, Kraven made a deal with [[Mr. Sinister]]. He tracked down the [[X-Men]], and he and the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] fought the united forces of Spider-Man and the original X-Men. He fled after a short battle, but not before wounding each member of the X-Men. Kraven returned to Sinister, with genetic samples from [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Beast (comics)| Beast]]. Furthermore, Sinister requested a sample of his DNA.<ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=10311]</ref>

Years later, after the death of Kraven, an [[Morlocks (comics)|ex-Morlock]] who had kept his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] named Joe Buggs was murdered by a mysterious [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] hunter. His friend, who had lost his powers, went to the X-Men for help. He claimed that the man who killed Buggs was Kraven the Hunter. Although they were skeptical about Kraven's apparent resurrection, the X-Men called on the help of Spider-Man, who had battled Kraven many times over the years. After discussing the battle that they had with Kraven years ago, and the fact that he had given samples of the X-Men's DNA to Sinister for cloning, the lights went out on the wing where they were located. The hunter attacked, and quickly dispatched [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], but was held at bay by Spider-Man's webbing. He broke free, claiming his name is Xraven. The X-Men quickly realize that Xraven has all of the powers of the original X-Men, and he was able to take down Cyclops and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], holding her hostage, giving the ultimatum that he would kill her if they did not surrender. Spider-Man insulted Xraven, claiming that Kraven would never threaten a helpless girl. Xraven was momentarily phased by his comment, but attacked again, claiming that he is the 'favored one'. Cyclops realizes Xraven's weakness, and told him that Sinister sees him as nothing but a pawn. He tells Xraven to read his mind, in order for him to see the kind of a man Sinister really is. He quickly fled after he saw Cyclops' memories, but the X-Men become aware of the fact that he was able to get DNA samples from Shadowcat, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. Returning to Sinister with the samples, Sinister tells him that he planned to clone a new generation of mutants, and that he would unite all mutantkind. After seeing what Sinister's real intentions were in Cyclops' memories, Xraven destroyed the samples, claiming that Sinister would breed slaves as opposed to warriors, and attacks him.<ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=11116]</ref>

The Xraven clone possesses the combined powers of the original X-Men, as well as Kraven the Hunter's fighting techniques, strength, and agility. His telepathic powers are able to block Spider-Man's spider sense, as well as Wolverine's heightened senses. His increased stamina makes it possible for him to be teleported by Nightcrawler repeatedly without suffering from fatigue. He has pale, white-grey skin, red eyes and no hair. Xraven also had a black diamond-shaped mark on his forehead, similar to the one on Mr Sinister.

==Powers and abilities==
By regularly ingesting the potion made from the various unnamed jungle herbs, Kraven grants himself a number of abilities including sufficient superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes to make him a physical threat to [[Spider-Man]], though these powers aren't as developed as those possessed by Spider-Man. Kraven's body is also more durable and more resistant to certain forms of injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human, with little to no injury to himself. The effects of the potion have dramatically altered Kraven's aging process to the point that he has aged little, if at all, over several decades. Despite being over 70 years of age, he has the physical appearance of a 30-year-old man.

The potion enhances Kraven's sight, hearing, and smell to superhuman levels, adding to his already impressive tracking skills. He can see further and with much greater clarity than a normal human. His hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds an ordinary human can't and sounds that a normal human could detect, but at much greater distances. Kraven can use his sense of smell to track a target by scent, much as some animals do, even if the scent has been somewhat eroded by natural factors.

Even without his superhuman powers, Kraven is an Olympic level athlete, a gifted tactician, hunter, and hand-to-hand combatant. He also has great knowledge of pressure points, both in the anatomy of humans and in many animals. He can strike at these nerve clusters with pinpoint accuracy, allowing him to incapacitate more powerful opponents or animals. He is familiar with many exotic poisons and [[sedative|tranquilizers]], which he often uses during his hunts.

==Other versions==
===''What The--?!''===
In ''[[Spider-Ham|What The--?!]]'' #3 Kraven appears as a raven called '''Raven the Hunter'''.

===''Ultimate Marvel''===
In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' series, Sergei Kravinoff is an Australian and the host of his own reality show in which he hunts down dangerous animals, and intends to hunt and kill [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] on live television in order to boost his ratings. He is arrested after being knocked out with a single punch by the superhero (who was trying to help two people out of an overturned car), and his show is canceled. In the [[Ultimate Six]] story arc, Kraven genetically tampers with his DNA, allowing him to become a gruesome werewolf-like monster, with large hands and feet, claw-like fingers, enlarged red veins, darker skin, fang-like teeth and beserk-like, feral behavior. Kraven is taken in S.H.I.E.L.D confinement, where he escapes with other Spider-Man villains. Kraven helps with the attack on the White House, though he is electrocuted by a lightning bolt from [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] when he tries to attack Peter.

===Marvel Noir===
In ''Spider-man Noir'', Kraven is depicted as a former animal trainer in a circus that was taken by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], a mob boss known as "The Goblin", as one of his hitmen and collectors.

He was killed with Osborn when a mass of man-eating spiders covered his body and started eating him.

==Reception==
In 2009, Kraven was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 53rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

Garbed in a lion-themed vest similar to his comic book counterpart, he is the most skilled hunter in the known world, relying only on his natural skills to subdue his prey. Kravinoff arrived in New York with Calypso and his pet lion (who was trained to track anything) and had confronted Spider-Man where, to his credit, he provides a reasonable challenge but is still subdued before too long. However, following his first defeat at the hands of Spider-Man, he becomes convinced that the only reason he lost was due to Spider-Man's genetically altered physiology. As such, Kravinoff enlists the aid of [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Professor Miles Warren]] in securing powers of his own. Using a serum concocted from Warren's own research (and based on [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]' own Lizard formula), Kravinoff is then mutated into a lion/man-like hybrid with elements of leopard, lion and cheetah DNA (similar to the Ultimate Kraven) he then changes his name to Kraven the Hunter.
