'''Kraven the Hunter''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #15 ([[1964#August|August 1964]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

==Publication history==
'''Sergei Kravinoff''' is a maniacal big game [[big game hunting|hunter]] known as Kraven the Hunter who seeks to defeat [[Spider-Man]] to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world. Unlike other hunters, he typically disdains the use of [[gun]]s or [[archery|bow and arrows]], preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands, even though he often makes elaborate preparations to weaken a quarry beforehand. He also uses a mystical serum to give him similar strength to [[Spider-Man]], but even without the serum he is a threat to the wall-crawler. [[Spider-Man]] proves a frustrating quarry because Kraven continually underestimates the superhero's resourcefulness.

Kraven finally completes his ultimate objective in the acclaimed 1987 storyline by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and [[Mike Zeck]], "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" and, having no further goals, commits [[suicide]]. 

Kraven later returns as a ghost in the graphic novel ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Soul of the Hunter]]''. <ref> {{Cite comic

===Kraven's Connections===
The [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] was the person who initially gave Kraven the idea of hunting [[Spider-Man]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #15. After Kraven died, the Chameleon was revealed to be Dmitri Smerdyakov, Kraven's half-brother. Kraven's lover, the [[wiktionary:voodoo|voodoo]] priestess [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], manipulated the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] against the wall-crawler in the first issues of [[Todd McFarlane]]'s best-selling ''Spider-Man'' series. It was later revealed in a story arc concerning [[Ka-Zar]] that Kraven was trained as a hunter largely by a mysterious man named '''Gregor''', a mercenary who battled [[Ka-Zar]].

===Kraven's Legacy===
Kraven has also had two sons take up his role; Vladimir Kravinoff took up the name "[[Grim Hunter]]" and decides to hunt down [[Spider-Man]] and several of his foes, he was later murdered by an insane clone of Spider-Man named [[Kaine]]. Some time after the death of Vladimir, his half brother and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], becomes the newest Kraven. There was a third son as well, Ned Tannengarden, who tries to kill [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha]], but was murdered by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].

===Ana Tatiana Kravinoff===
{{seealso|Kraven's First Hunt}}
A third, female Kraven has recently appeared. She tracks [[Spider-Man]] to his apartment, but mistakenly believes Peter Parker's roommate Vin Gonzales was him. She then methodically ruins Vin's life, and captures him. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' '#565</ref> Despite Vin's claims that he was not Spider-Man, Kraven prepared to hunt him. At the end it is revealed that her name is Ana Tatiana Kravinoff, that she is only about 12 years old and that she is Kraven's daughter by a woman called Sasha Aleksandra Nikolaevich, also mother of the deceased Vladimir.

==Powers and abilities==
By regularly ingesting the potion made from the various unnamed jungle herbs, Kraven grants himself a number of abilities including sufficient superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes to make him a physical threat to [[Spider-Man]], though these powers aren't as developed as those possessed by Spider-Man. Kraven's body is also more durable and more resistant to certain forms of injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to himself. The effects of the potion have dramatically altered Kraven's aging process to the point that he has aged little, if at all, over several decades. Despite being over 70 years of age, he has the physical appearance of a 30 year old man.

The potion enhances Kraven's sight, hearing, and smell to superhuman levels, adding to his already impressive tracking skills. He can see further and with much greater clarity than a normal human. His hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds an ordinary human can't and sounds that a normal human could detect, but at much greater distances. Kraven can use his sense of smell to track a target by scent, much as some animals do, even if the scent has been somewhat eroded by natural factors.

Even without his superhuman powers, Kraven is an Olympic level athlete, a gifted tactician, hunter, and hand to hand combatant. He also has great knowledge of pressure points, both in the anatomy of humans and in many animals. He can strike at these nerve clusters with pinpoint accuracy, allowing him to incapacitate more powerful opponents or animals. He is also familiar with many exotic poisons and [[sedative|tranquilizers]], which he often uses during his hunts.

==Alternate versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
A zombified Kraven is shown in ''[[Marvel Zombies]]: Dead Days''. 

===''Spider-Man: Reign''===
In the dystopian future of ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'', Kraven leads the [[Sinister Six#Spider-Man: Reign|Sinner Six]].

===''What The--?!''===
In ''[[Spider-Ham|What The--?!]]'' #3 Kraven appears as a raven called '''Raven the Hunter'''.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' series, Sergei Kravinoff is an Australian and the host of his own reality show in which he hunts down dangerous animals, and intends to hunt and kill [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] on live television in order to boost his ratings, but is knocked out with a single punch by the superhero, revealing that Kraven is a fraud, and his show is cancelled. In the [[Ultimate Six]] story arc, Kraven genetically tampers with his DNA, allowing him to become a gruesome werewolf-like monster, with large hands and feet, claw-like fingers, enlarged red veins, darker skin, fang-like teeth and beserk-like, feral behaivour. Kraven is taken in S.H.I.E.L.D confinement, where he escapes with other Spider-Man villains. Kraven helps with the attack on the White House, though he is electrocuted by a lightining bolt when he tries to attack Peter.
