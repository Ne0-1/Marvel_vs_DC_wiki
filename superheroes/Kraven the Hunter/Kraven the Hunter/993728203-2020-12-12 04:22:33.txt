'''Kraven the Hunter''' ('''Sergei Kravinoff''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Debuting in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' issue #15 (August 1964) as an adversary to the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], he has since endured as one of web-slinger's most common foes, and is part of the collective of adversaries that make up Spider-Man's [[List of Spider-Man enemies|rogues' gallery]]. However, the character has also been depicted as an [[antihero]], and an ally of [[Squirrel Girl]]. In the comics, Kraven is a renowned [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunter]] who aims to kill Spider-Man to prove himself as the world's greatest hunter, but maintains a code of honor and justice, treating his adversaries as equals. He is also the half-brother of the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]], and one of the founding members of the supervillain team, the [[Sinister Six]].

The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man adaptations, including animated series and video games. He is widely regarded as one of the most formidable enemies among his rogues. The character gained considerable attention from the story "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]". In 2009, Kraven was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 53rd greatest comic book villain of all time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/53.html Kraven The Hunter is number 53] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008200756/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/53.html|date=2013-10-08}}, [[IGN]].</ref>

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' issue #15 (August 1964), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [Stan] Lee and [Steve] Ditko's newest villain, Kraven the Hunter, debuted in this issue.}}</ref> Though he would occasionally appear in other characters' titles, he was most frequently used as a Spider-Man foe. He is killed off in the acclaimed 1987 storyline by [[J. M. DeMatteis]], [[Mike Zeck]], and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]". Although generally considered to be the definitive Kraven the Hunter story, the story originally had a completely different character in Kraven's role. Writer DeMatteis recounted:

{{quote|As I was getting ready to work on the story, I was sitting in my office and looking through a [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|''Marvel Universe Handbook'']] and came across the entry for Kraven the Hunter. To this day, I don't know if this was something that was established in [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], or if whoever was writing the Handbook entry made it up, but they mentioned that Kraven was [[Russians|Russian]]. For me, a total [[Dostoyevsky]] fanatic, the idea that Kraven was Russian and had the same tortured, Russian soul that the great Dostoyevsky characters had, unlocked this door in my head and suddenly I had a new understanding of this character. I thought about Kraven and the forces that had driven him to be who and what he was. This was a character I had never had any interest in whatsoever. I always thought he was one of the stupidest Spider-Man villains ever, but suddenly I had this whole new take on the character.<ref name="Back35">{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= August 2009|title= In Our Sights: Kraven's Last Hunt|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|pages= 3–9|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

Despite Kraven the Hunter being one of Spider-Man's most long-standing archenemies, DeMatteis claims that none of Marvel's editorial staff objected to the proposal to have him killed in the story.<ref name="Back35"/> Kraven later returns as a ghost in the graphic novel ''[[Kraven's Last Hunt#Soul of the Hunter|The Amazing Spider-Man: Soul of the Hunter]]'', also by DeMatteis, Zeck, and McLeod. DeMatteis also wrote "Kraven's First Hunt" for ''The Sensational Spider-Man Annual '96'', a retelling of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15 which incorporated several DeMatteis [[retcon]]s, such as that Kraven was [[Relational aggression|abusive]] towards the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].

==Fictional character biography==

Kraven's real name is Sergei Kravinoff (Сергей Кравинов). He is a [[Soviet]] immigrant, the son of an [[aristocrat]] who fled to the United States with his family in 1917 after the [[Execution of the Romanov family|Russian nobility was decimated by the]] [[February Revolution]] and subsequent collapse of the reign of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

Kraven is a maniacal [[Big game hunting|big game hunter]] who seeks to defeat [[Spider-Man]] to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=101}}</ref> Unlike other hunters, he typically disdains the use of guns or [[archery|bow and arrows]], preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands. He also lives by a code of honor of sorts, choosing to hunt his game fairly.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=182}}</ref> He consumes a mystical serum to give himself enhanced strength and dramatically slow the [[aging]] process. Kraven was trained as a hunter largely by a mysterious man named Gregor, a mercenary who once battled [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>{{Cite comic

He is contacted by his half-brother the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to defeat Spider-Man. He leads Spider-Man to [[Central Park]] with the help of the Chameleon, who disguises himself as Kraven to use himself as a decoy while the real Kraven ambushes the hero. However, despite Kraven having weakened Spider-Man with a poisonous dart, Spider-Man prevails in the end. Spider-Man proves a frustrating quarry because Kraven continually underestimates the superhero's resourcefulness.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kraven becomes a founding member of the [[Sinister Six]] when he accepts [[Doctor Octopus]]'s offer to form a team to fight Spider-Man where they capture [[Aunt May]] and [[Betty Brant]]. He attacks Spider-Man in [[Central Park]] with three [[tiger]]s. Spider-Man easily fights off the attackers and secures the next clue to where Aunt May and Betty Brant are being held. After Aunt May and Betty Brant are rescued, Kraven the Hunter and the rest of the Sinister Six are arrested by the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While in the [[Savage Land]], Kraven the Hunter found [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]] in a spaceship that he stumbles upon. Realizing how useful Gog can be, Kraven the Hunter decides to use him in a plot to conquer the Savage Land. After kidnapping the visiting [[Gwen Stacy]] from a camp in the Savage Land, Kraven and Gog battle the heroes Ka-Zar and Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic

Determined to end his life as he becomes older, frustrated with his failing health and continuing failure to defeat Spider-Man, Kraven sets out a final hunt for Spider-Man. After capturing Spider-Man, he shoots him with a coma-inducing drug and buries him alive on his estate.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #31</ref> To complete his victory, he attempts to become Spider-Man's clear superior by impersonating him in a brutal vigilante campaign and capturing [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], the one foe Spider-Man had never been able to defeat on his own (Spider-Man's last battle with Vermin required [[Captain America]]'s assistance).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #293, ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #131.

After Spider-Man emerges from his grave two weeks later, Kraven explains his actions to him and sets Vermin free, reaffirming to Kraven that his foe is an honorable man.

Kraven is resurrected from the dead by Sasha Kravinoff and the Kravinoff family with a ritual using the blood of Spider-Man.<ref name=AS635>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is shown to now be explosively [[psychopath]]ic and cold towards his family, beating his son Vladimir and daughter Ana and expressing little attention towards his wife. After being stabbed by his daughter Ana, Sergei recovers, stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood which he calls "unlife". They pull off the mask of the corpse of Spider-Man hung in their mantel and discover that [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] is in Spider-Man's costume.<ref name=AS636>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #636. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man, in his black costume, confronts Kraven and the rest of the Kravinoff Family. Spider-Man is tempted to kill Kraven, but he refuses to do so when he is reminded by [[Julia Carpenter]] (who has inherited the powers of [[Madame Web]] after her death) that committing murder is not in his moral code. Following their defeat by Spider-Man, Kraven and his family escape to the Savage Land. While there, Kraven brutally kills Sasha (who complained that Kraven would have to hunt them to prove their place in the Kravinoff family) and euthanizes Vladimir. Alyosha flees in disgust of what his dad did to his stepmom and half-brother afterwards. Kraven and Ana discuss rebuilding the Kravinoff family, which leads to Ana running off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself worthy to Kraven and rebuild the Kravinoff family.<ref name=AS637>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #637. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was later revealed that back in the 1950s, Kraven the Hunter was a member of [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] alongside [[Dominic Fortune]] I, [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Namora]], [[Silver Sable]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and [[Ulysses Bloodstone]], tracking a stolen version of the Super-Soldier Serum combined with the Infinity Formula that had been stolen by a group of Nazis attempting to create their own Captain America.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While he is in the Savage Land, [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] lands in the area on an unrelated mission from the federal government. Mistaking him to be Spider-Man, Kraven attacks him and gains the upper hand before Venom escapes.<ref>''Venom'' (vol. 3) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At one point, Kraven is contacted by a doctor who once treated him when a past hunt went wrong, the doctor requesting that Kraven track down a recent patient of hers - who had been used as a test subject to duplicate another man's electrical abilities — as well as asking that he capture the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] — currently acting as a 'local' vigilante to regain his sense of self after the destruction of [[Wakanda]]'s [[vibranium]] - in return for her help finding a way for him to die. With the aid of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], T'Challa is able to stay ahead of Kraven long enough to convince him that the doctor had lied about being able to kill him, Kraven agreeing to leave T'Challa alone and take the doctor's mutated animal subjects back with him into the wild.<ref>''Black Panther'' #519–#520. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When their identities became fractured after a temporary separation, the [[Hulk]] discovers that Bruce Banner had hired Kraven to find the lost city of the [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]]es. Although the Hulk was uninterested with helping the Sasquatches deal with Kraven, he changes his mind and beats up Kraven.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kaine, in the alias of the [[Scarlet Spider]], later encountered Kraven the Hunter, who was dressed as the Scarlet Spider in order to torment him.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' (vol. 2) #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of Ana, Kraven kidnapped Kaine's friends in order to motivate the Scarlet Spider to fight him. In the end, Kaine delivered Kraven a fatal blow in the chest, which paralyzed his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brought him back to life supposedly still breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappeared.<ref name="Scarlet Spider #23">''Scarlet Spider'' (vol. 2) #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kraven, still claiming to be cursed, next battles [[Squirrel Girl]] at [[Empire State University]], having earned her ire by lashing out at the local squirrels, including [[Squirrel Girl#Tippy-Toe|Tippy-Toe]]. Kraven departs when Squirrel Girl informs him of the existence of sea monsters like [[Giganto#Giganto (Atlantean beasts)|Giganto]] and challenges him to hunt them, instead of limiting himself to going after the same prey he did prior to his resurrection.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 7 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> He later returns to abduct [[Howard the Duck]],<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' (vol. 2) #6</ref> but gets trapped with Howard and Squirrel Girl in a manhunt as the hunted. After surviving, he vows to only "hunt the hunters".<ref>''Howard the Duck'' (vol. 6) #6</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Kraven the Hunter was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. who used [[Kobik]]'s abilities to turn Kraven the Hunter into a [[zookeeper]]. He rallied some of his fellow inmates to help him find Kobik and bring her to [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]].<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Kraven the Hunter is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref> At the time when Manhattan was surrounded by a [[Darkforce]] Dome, Kraven the Hunter raided the ''Daily Bugle'' in order to find information to the identity of Spider-Man. Knowing that J. Jonah Jameson would be in danger, Phil Sheldon's daughter Jennie headed to J. Jonah Jameson's house to warn him. After Kraven the Hunter attacked J. Jonah Jameson, Jennie Sheldon fired a signal flare into the sky. This attracted the attention of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], who defeated Kraven the Hunter. Jennie Sheldon even took pictures of the fight.<ref>''Secret Empire: Brave New World'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] encountered some Dinosaur People in the sewers, Kraven the Hunter followed Venom and killed an ''[[Ankylosaurus]]''-type Dinosaur Person before engaging Venom in battle. He was fended off by Venom, who vowed to fight Kraven again.<ref>''Venom'' #156. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon the news of Dinosaur People being found beneath the streets of New York City, Mayor [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] and NYPD Commissioner Chris Rafferty appointed Kraven the Hunter to lead a SWAT Team into the sewers and eliminate them. When Venom deactivated each trap and confronted Kraven, Venom was caught off-guard when Kraven the Hunter revealed his secret ally [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], who used her attacks on Venom and then collapsed the ceiling over him. Shriek then tells Kraven the Hunter that she can have Eddie Brock's head after the mission is done.<ref>''Venom'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Dinosaur People feed on the rats that enter their lair, Kraven the Hunter sneaks up on some Dinosaur People and kills them. Venom catches up to Kraven the Hunter and fights him and Shriek. With help from Tana, Venom stated that the Dinosaur People were not killing anybody and that they are only surviving underground. Kraven the Hunter and Shriek are arrested by the NYPD, as the captain stated that he never liked Kraven the Hunter anyway.<ref>''Venom'' #158. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kraven the Hunter was hired by the evil organization Rampart to lure [[Captain America]] to them. After a brief struggle with Kraven the Hunter, Captain America was frozen in ice by Rampart's freeze cannon.<ref>''Captain America'' #697. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Squirrel Girl has helped Kraven reform, teaming up with him to fight other villains, even establishing a friendship with him. She helps Kraven realize that Spider-Man is not even ''close'' to being the most dangerous prey in the Marvel Universe.<ref>''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' (vol. 2) #32–35. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a prelude to "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]", Kraven the Hunter reminisces about how Sasha, Vladimir, and Alyosha were killed by him and Ana for not living up to his legacy. After cutting a deal with the [[High Evolutionary]], Kraven the Hunter has 87 clones of him created, trained as the Sons of Kraven, and sent out to prove themselves by being hunted by each other. This motif caused Ana to leave him. The one that hunted and killed the other Sons of Kraven was labeled as the Last Son of Kraven. With help from the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], the [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]], and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], Kraven the Hunter starts hunting various animal-themed characters, like the [[Janice Lincoln|Beetle]], the [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], the [[Serpent Society]], the [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], and the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. In the case of the [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|King Cobra]], the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]], the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]], and the Vulture, they were grouped together as the [[Savage Six]].<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #16">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> While making the final preparations for the "Great Hunt," Kraven the Hunter recaps on his own immortality when it was revealed that the Kraven the Hunter that was stabbed by the Scarlet Spider was actually a clone. Kraven the Hunter sends the Last Son of Kraven to capture Spider-Man for the Great Hunt.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #17">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a Hunter-Bot created by Arcade Industries is demonstrated on the [[Iguana (comics)|Iguana]], Kraven the Hunter and Arcade begin the Great Hunt, where Central Park is surrounded by a dome that is from the same technology as the Planetary Defense System.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is revealed that the moment the individual connects to the Hunter-Bot and if it is destroyed, then the individual is killed, which is what happens when the Vulture destroys Bob's Hunter-Bot. Kraven the Hunter plans this from the beginning to punish the hunters for killing animals for sport.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kraven the Hunter has Arcade tell the Vulture that there is a chance to break the force field by killing more Hunter-Bots.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #20.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a fight between the Hunter-Bots and the animal-themed characters, Kraven the Hunter's secret motive is to force Spider-Man into killing him again so that he can be free from his dreadful curse. He does this by trapping Curt Connors when he tries to rescue his son, Billy. Spider-Man was forced to "kill" Curt by tearing out the implant chip that prevented Curt hurting humans as the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], despite the risk that taking out the chip would kill Curt.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Spider-Man found the dead bodies of the guards that were killed when the Lizard escaped, he was confronted by Kraven the Hunter. During their fight, Spider-Man figured out that Kraven the Hunter was the one who killed the guards to frame the Lizard, as the wounds are too precise for the Lizard's feral claws. In order to guilt Spider-Man into becoming a hunter, Kraven the Hunter attempts to force Spider-Man to watch the Lizard save Billy and the Black Cat from the Last Son of Kraven, but Spider-Man rejects the idea that this can only be accomplished through violence. Upon realizing that he was the beast that he was wanting to kill all along, Kraven the Hunter released all the surviving animal-themed characters and sends Spider-Man to protect Mary Jane. Kraven the Hunter then dons a copy of Spider-Man's black costume to act like him once more. When the Last Son of Kraven was conned into strangling Kraven the Hunter to death, he soon realized that he was fooled when he sees Spider-Man swinging away.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #22">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> His funeral is later attended by the Last Son of Kraven. The Chameleon is revealed to be one of the attendees, as he is pleased that Kraven the Hunter spared him from the Great Hunt. As he walks away, the Chameleon quotes to his dead half-brother to sleep well and states "You needn't worry. The world is no longer your burden. Besides, there won't be much of it left soon...not by the time I've finished".<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #23">''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
By regularly ingesting the potion made from various unnamed jungle herbs, Kraven grants himself superhuman physical abilities, making him a physical threat to Spider-Man, though these powers are not as developed as those possessed by Spider-Man. Kraven's body is also more durable and more resistant to certain forms of injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human, with little to no injury to himself. The effects of the potion have dramatically altered Kraven's aging process to the point that he has aged little, if at all, over several decades. Despite being over 70 years of age, he has the physical appearance of a 30-year-old man.

The potion enhances Kraven's sight, hearing, and smell to superhuman levels, adding to his already impressive tracking skills. He can see farther, and with much greater clarity, than a normal human. His hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds which an ordinary human cannot, or sounds that a normal human could detect, but at much greater distances. Kraven can use his sense of smell to track a target by scent, much as some animals do, even if the scent has been somewhat eroded by natural factors.

Even without his superhuman powers, Kraven is an Olympic-level athlete, and a gifted tactician, hunter and hand-to-hand combatant. He also has great knowledge of [[pressure point]]s, both in the anatomy of humans and in many animals. He can strike at these nerve clusters with pinpoint accuracy, allowing him to incapacitate more powerful opponents or animals. He is familiar with many exotic poisons and [[Sedative|tranquilizer]]s, which he often uses during his hunts.

Due to a flaw in the ceremony that resurrected him, Kraven was given "the ''unlife''... the eternal curse", as he discovered when his daughter stabbed him through the heart. According to Kraven, he can now only die by Spider-Man's hand. However, this curse was apparently broken when Kaine temporarily killed Kraven by stopping his heart and then restarting it with the same move.

==Family==
Kraven the Hunter had several children who have followed in his footsteps:

* '''Vladimir Kravinoff''' took up the name "the [[Grim Hunter]]" and decided to hunt down Spider-Man and several of his foes. During the fight with Spider-Man, he is murdered by an insane clone of Spider-Man named [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. Sasha Kravinoff later sacrifices [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] as part of a ritual that revives Vladimir in a humanoid lion form during the ''Grim Hunt'' story arc. Sasha later stated to Kraven that Vladimir's appearance was the result of a test revival ritual to see if she can bring him back to life. Vladimir was euthanized by Kraven (which he does due to "respect for the dead") in the Savage Land at the conclusion of the story arc.
* Some time after the death of Vladimir, his half-brother and a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], '''[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]]''', becomes the second Kraven the Hunter. Ana Kravinoff later killed him to prove herself to her father after Kraven euthanized Vladimir.
* There was a third son named '''Nedrocci "Ned" Tannengarden''' who tried to kill Alyosha, but he was murdered by the Chameleon (who, during that time, believed himself to be the original Kraven the Hunter).<ref>''Spider-Man's Get Kraven'' #1-6 (2002–2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>
* {{anchor|Xraven}}It was revealed during 2009's ''[[X-Men]]/Spider-Man'' crossover miniseries that years earlier, Kraven made a deal with [[Mister Sinister]]. He and the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] tracked down the X-Men, and they fought the united forces of Spider-Man and the original X-Men. Kraven fled after a short battle, but not before wounding each member of the X-Men. Kraven returned to Sinister, with genetic samples from [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], the [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Furthermore, Sinister requested from Kraven a sample of his [[DNA]].<ref>''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mister Sinister later cut a deal with [[Cletus Kasady|Carnage]] in order to obtain a sample of the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]. After removing the sentience from the Carnage symbiote sample, Mister Sinister combined it with the DNA of the original X-Men and Kraven the Hunter, where he would use this creation at a later date.<ref>''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later after the death of Kraven, an [[Morlocks (comics)|ex-Morlock]] who had kept his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] named Joe Buggs was murdered by a mysterious [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] hunter. His friend Ed (who had lost his powers) went to the X-Men for help. He claimed that the man who killed Buggs was Kraven the Hunter. Although they were skeptical about Kraven's apparent resurrection, the X-Men called on the help of Spider-Man, who had battled Kraven many times over the years. After discussing the battle that they had with Kraven years ago and the fact that he had given samples of the X-Men's DNA to Sinister for cloning, the lights went out on the wing where they were located. The hunter attacked and quickly dispatched [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], but was held at bay by Spider-Man's webbing. He broke free, claiming his name is '''Xraven'''. The X-Men quickly realize that Xraven has all of the powers of the original X-Men, while also sporting claws, big feet, and wings that have a very flexible skeletal structure, enabling him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing. He was able to defeat Cyclops and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], holding her hostage, giving the ultimatum that he would kill her if they did not surrender. Spider-Man insulted Xraven, claiming that Kraven would never threaten a helpless girl. Xraven was momentarily fazed by his comment, but attacked again, claiming that he is the "favored one". Cyclops realizes Xraven's weakness and tells him that Mister Sinister sees him as nothing but a pawn. He tells Xraven to read his mind, in order for him to see the kind of a man Sinister really is. After Xraven sees Cyclops's memories, he flees, but the X-Men become aware of the fact that he was able to get DNA samples from Shadowcat, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

The letter from Kraven the Hunter stated that the Last Son of Kraven was to finally inherit his legacy not as Kraven's son, but as the man himself, since he was cloned from his DNA. The Last Son of Kraven read in the letter "You were forged in fire, born in blood. My spirit made flesh. More than my child—you are me, and I am you. One and the same now." This led to the Last Son of Kraven taking on the aliases of both Sergei Kravinoff and Kraven the Hunter, where he cuts his hair, wipes off his tiger stripes, and dons a copy of Kraven the Hunter's costume.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #23"/>
