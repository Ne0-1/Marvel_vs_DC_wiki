==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
Kraven the Hunter first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #15 (August 1964). Though he would occasionally appear in other characters' titles, he was most frequently used as a Spider-Man foe. He is killed off in the acclaimed 1987 storyline by [[J. M. DeMatteis]], [[Mike Zeck]], and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]". Although generally considered to be the definitive Kraven the Hunter story, the story originally had a completely different character in Kraven's role. Writer DeMatteis recounted: {{quote|As I was getting ready to work on the story, I was sitting in my office and looking through a [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Marvel Universe Handbook]] and came across the entry for Kraven the Hunter. To this day, I donâ€™t know if this was something that was established in [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], or if whoever was writing the Handbook entry made it up, but they mentioned that Kraven was [[Russians|Russian]]. For me, a total [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] fanatic, the idea that Kraven was Russian and had the same tortured, Russian soul that the great Dostoyevsky characters had, unlocked this door in my head and suddenly I had a new understanding of this character. I thought about Kraven and the forces that had driven him to be who and what he was. This was a character I had never had any interest in whatsoever. I always thought he was one of the stupidest Spider-Man villains ever, but suddenly I had this whole new take on the character.<ref name="Back35">{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= August 2009|title= In Our Sights: Kraven's Last Hunt|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|pages= 3-9|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

Despite Kraven the Hunter being one of Spider-Man's most long-standing archenemies, DeMatteis claims that none of Marvel's editorial staff objected to the proposal to have him killed in the story.<ref name="Back35"/> Kraven later returns as a ghost in the graphic novel ''[[Kraven's Last Hunt#Soul of the Hunter|Amazing Spider-Man: Soul of the Hunter]]'', also by DeMatteis, Zeck, and McLeod. DeMatteis also wrote "Kraven's First Hunt" for ''The Sensational Spider-Man Annual '96'', a retelling of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15 which incorporated several DeMatteis [[retcon]]s, such as that Kraven was [[Relational aggression|abusive]] towards the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].

==Fictional character biography==
Kraven's real name is Sergei Kravinoff. He is a [[Russia]]n immigrant, the son of an [[aristocrat]] who fled to the United States with his family in 1917 after the Russian nobility was decimated by the [[February Revolution]] and subsequent collapse of the reign of [[Tsar Nicholas II]].

Kraven is a maniacal [[Big game hunting|big game hunter]] who seeks to defeat [[Spider-Man]] to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world. Unlike other hunters, he typically disdains the use of [[gun]]s or [[archery|bow and arrows]], preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands. He also lives by a code of honor of sorts, choosing to hunt his game fairly. He consumes a mystical serum to give himself enhanced strength and dramatically slow the [[aging]] process. Kraven was trained as a hunter largely by a mysterious man named '''Gregor''', a [[mercenary]] who battled [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].{{cn|date=April 2014}} Kraven was at one point lover of the [[wikt:voodoo|voodoo]] priestess [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #310</ref>

He is contacted by his half-brother, the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], to defeat Spider-Man. 
Spider-Man proves a frustrating quarry because Kraven continually underestimates the superhero's resourcefulness.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15</ref>

Kraven becomes a founding member of the [[Sinister Six]] when he accepts [[Doctor Octopus]]' offer to form a team to fight Spider-Man where they capture [[Aunt May]] and [[Betty Brant]]. He attacks Spider-Man in [[Central Park]] with three [[tiger]]s. Spider-Man easily fights off the attackers and secures the next clue to where Aunt May and Betty Brant are being held. After Aunt May and Betty Brant are rescued, Kraven the Hunter and the rest of the Sinister Six are arrested by the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>

Determined to end his life as he becomes older, frustrated with his failing health and continuing failure to defeat Spider-Man, Kraven sets out a final hunt for Spider-Man. After capturing Spider-Man, he shoots him with a coma-inducing drug and buries him alive on his estate.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #31</ref> To complete his victory, he attempts to become Spider-Man's clear superior by impersonating him in a brutal vigilante campaign and capturing [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], the one foe Spider-Man had never been able to defeat on his own (Their last battle requiring [[Captain America]]'s assistance).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #293, ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #131</ref>

After Spider-Man emerges from his grave two weeks later, Kraven explains his actions to him and sets Vermin free, reaffirming to Kraven that his foe is an honourable man. Spider-Man goes after Vermin to prevent his killing again, giving Kraven the opportunity to leave a final [[Confession (law)|confession]] of his crimes against Spider-Man and then commit [[suicide]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #294</ref> Because of his suicide, his soul is unable to find rest until Spider-Man confronts his risen corpse on Kraven's behalf.<ref>{{Cite comic

Kraven is resurrected from the dead by Sasha Kravinoff and the Kraven family with a ritual using the blood of Spider-Man.<ref name=AS635>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635</ref> He is shown to now be explosively [[psychopath]]ic and cold towards his family, beating his son and daughter and expressing little attention towards his wife. After being stabbed by his daughter Ana, Sergei recovers stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood which he calls "unlife". They pull off the mask of the corpse of Spider-Man hung in their mantel and discover that [[Kaine]] is in Spider-Man's costume.<ref name=AS636>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #636</ref> Spider-Man, in his black suit, confronts Kraven and the rest of the Kravinoff Family. Spider-Man is tempted to kill Kraven, but he refuses to do so when he is reminded by [[Julia Carpenter]] (who has inherited the powers of [[Madame Web]] after her death) that committing murder in not in his moral code.

Following their defeat by Spider-Man, Kraven and his family escape to the [[Savage Land]]. While there, Kraven brutally kills Sasha (who complained that Kraven would have to hunt them to prove their place in the Kravinoff family) and [[Euthanasia|euthanizes]] Vladimir. Alyosha flees in disgust afterwards. Kraven and Ana discuss rebuilding the Kravinoff family, which leads to Ana running off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself worthy to Kraven and rebuild the Kravinoff family.<ref name=AS637>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #637</ref>

It was later revealed that back in the 1950s, Kraven the Hunter was a member of [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] alongside [[Dominic Fortune]] I, [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Namora]], [[Silver Sable]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and [[Ulysses Bloodstone]], tracking a stolen version of the Super-Soldier Serum combined with the Infinity Formula that had been stolen by a group of Nazis attempting to create their own Captain America.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #10</ref>

While he is in the Savage Land, [[Flash Thompson|Venom]] lands in the area on an unrelated mission from the federal government. Mistaking him to be Spider-Man, Kraven attacks him and gains the upper hand before Venom escapes.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 3 #3</ref>

When their identities became fractured after a temporary separation, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] discovers that Bruce Banner had hired Kraven to find the lost city of [[Bigfoot|Sasquatches]]. Although Hulk was uninterested with helping the Sasquatches deal with Kraven, he changes his mind and beats up Kraven the Hunter.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

Kaine in the alias of [[Scarlet Spider]] later encountered Kraven the Hunter who was dressed as Scarlet Spider in order to torment him.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2 #21</ref> With the help of Ana, Kraven kidnapped Kaine's friends in order to motivate the Scarlet Spider fight him. In the end, Kaine delivered Kraven a fatal blow in the chest, which paralyzed his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brought him back to life supposedly still breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappeared.<ref name="Scarlet Spider #23">''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2 #23</ref>

Kraven, still claiming to be cursed, next battles [[Squirrel Girl]] at [[Empire State University]], having earned her ire by lashing out at the local squirrels, including [[Squirrel Girl#Tippy-Toe|Tippy-Toe]]. Kraven departs when Squirrel Girl informs him of the existence of sea monsters like [[Giganto#Giganto (Atlantean beasts)|Giganto]], and challenges him to hunt them, instead of limiting himself to going after the same prey he did prior to his resurrection.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 7 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

===Kraven's legacy===
Kraven has also had two sons take up his role:

* Vladimir Kravinoff took up the name "[[Grim Hunter]]" and decided to hunt down Spider-Man and several of his foes. During the fight with Spider-Man, he is murdered by an insane clone of Spider-Man named [[Kaine]]. Sasha Kravinoff later sacrifices [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] as part of a ritual that revives Vladimir in a humanoid lion form during the ''Grim Hunt'' storyline. Sasha later stated to Kraven that Vladimir's appearance was the result of a test revival ritual to see if she can bring him back to life. Vladimir was euthanized by Kraven (which he does due to "respect for the dead") in the Savage Land at the conclusion of The Grim Hunt arc.

* Some time after the death of Vladimir, his half brother and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], becomes the second Kraven.

* There was a third son named Nedrocci "Ned" Tannengarden who tries to kill Alyosha, but he was murdered by the Chameleon (who during that time believed himself to be the original Kraven the Hunter).<ref>''Spider-Man's Get Kraven'' #1-6 (2002-2003)</ref>

* Also, Kraven once raised an alien creature called [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]] who he found in a spaceship that had crashed in the Savage Land.

* Kraven's wife Sasha Kravinoff and his daughter [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana]], were part of a Gauntlet on Spider-Man's life causing chaos and weakening the web crusader prior to the events that lead to resurrecting Kraven from the grave.

===Xraven===
It was revealed during 2009's [[X-Men]]/Spider-Man crossover that years earlier, Kraven made a deal with [[Mister Sinister]]. He and the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] tracked down the X-Men, and they fought the united forces of Spider-Man and the original X-Men. Kraven fled after a short battle, but not before wounding each member of the X-Men. Kraven returned to Sinister, with genetic samples from [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Furthermore, Sinister requested a sample of his [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=10311 |title=Comic Books &#124; Comics |publisher= Marvel.com |date=2012-03-18 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref>

Years later, after the death of Kraven, an [[Morlocks (comics)|ex-Morlock]] who had kept his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] named Joe Buggs was murdered by a mysterious [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] hunter. His friend Ed (who had lost his powers) went to the X-Men for help. He claimed that the man who killed Buggs was Kraven the Hunter. Although they were skeptical about Kraven's apparent resurrection, the X-Men called on the help of Spider-Man, who had battled Kraven many times over the years. After discussing the battle that they had with Kraven years ago, and the fact that he had given samples of the X-Men's DNA to Sinister for cloning, the lights went out on the wing where they were located. The hunter attacked, and quickly dispatched [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] but was held at bay by Spider-Man's webbing. He broke free, claiming his name is Xraven.

The X-Men quickly realize that Xraven has all of the powers of the original X-Men, and he was able to defeat Cyclops and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], holding her hostage, giving the ultimatum that he would kill her if they did not surrender. Spider-Man insulted Xraven, claiming that Kraven would never threaten a helpless girl. Xraven was momentarily fazed by his comment, but attacked again, claiming that he is the "favored one". Cyclops realizes Xraven's weakness and tells him that Mister Sinister sees him as nothing but a pawn. He tells Xraven to read his mind, in order for him to see the kind of a man Sinister really is. After Xraven sees Cyclops' memories, he flees but the X-Men become aware of the fact that he was able to get DNA samples from Shadowcat, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

Returning to Mister Sinister with the samples, Mister Sinister tells him that he planned to [[cloning|clone]] a new generation of mutants, and that he would unite all mutantkind. After seeing what Sinister's real intentions were in Cyclops' memories, Xraven destroys the samples, claiming that Mister Sinister would breed slaves as opposed to warriors, and Xraven attacks him. Although it is clear that Mister Sinister survived his confrontation with Xraven, it is currently unknown whether Xraven survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=11116 |title=X-Men/Spider-Man (2008) |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref>

The Xraven clone possesses the combined powers of the original X-Men, as well as Kraven the Hunter's fighting techniques, strength, and agility. His telepathic powers are able to block Spider-Man's spider sense, as well as Wolverine's heightened senses. His increased stamina makes it possible for him to be teleported by Nightcrawler repeatedly without suffering from fatigue. He has pale, white-grey skin, red eyes and no hair. Xraven also had a black diamond-shaped mark on his forehead, similar to the one on Mister Sinister.

==Powers and abilities==
By regularly ingesting the potion made from the various unnamed jungle herbs, Kraven grants himself a number of abilities including sufficient superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes to make him a physical threat to Spider-Man, though these powers are not as developed as those possessed by Spider-Man. Kraven's body is also more durable and more resistant to certain forms of injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human, with little to no injury to himself. The effects of the potion have dramatically altered Kraven's aging process to the point that he has aged little, if at all, over several decades. Despite being over 70 years of age, he has the physical appearance of a 30-year-old man.

The potion enhances Kraven's sight, hearing, and smell to superhuman levels, adding to his already impressive tracking skills. He can see farther, and with much greater clarity, than a normal human. His hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds which an ordinary human cannot, or sounds that a normal human could detect, but at much greater distances. Kraven can use his sense of smell to track a target by scent, much as some animals do, even if the scent has been somewhat eroded by natural factors.

Even without his superhuman powers, Kraven is an Olympic-level athlete, and a gifted tactician, hunter and hand-to-hand combatant. He also has great knowledge of [[pressure point]]s, both in the anatomy of humans and in many animals. He can strike at these nerve clusters with pinpoint accuracy, allowing him to incapacitate more-powerful opponents or animals. He is familiar with many exotic poisons and [[sedative|tranquilizers]], which he often uses during his hunts.

Due to a [[Kaine|flaw]] in the ceremony that resurrected him, Kraven was given "the '''unlife'''... the eternal curse", as he discovered when his daughter stabbed him through the heart. According to Kraven, he can now only die by Spider-Man's hand. However, this curse was apparently broken when Kaine temporarily killed Kraven by stopping his heart and then restarting it with the same move.

==Other versions==

===Marvel Noir===
In ''Spider-Man Noir'', Kraven is depicted as a former animal trainer in a circus that was taken by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], a mob boss known as "The Goblin", as one of his hitmen and collectors. He was killed when a mass of man-eating spiders covered his body and started eating him. His final act was to kill Osborn when his mangled spider-ridden corpse lands on him thus spreading the mini man-eaters.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir'' #1â€“4 (2008â€“2009)</ref>

It is later revealed that he was actually infected by the Earth-Z zombie [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], thereby spreading the infection all over the dimension.

===Marvel Zombies Return===
In the first issue, he is seen with his Sinister Six teammates terrorizing Empire State University after the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] hires them to distract a heist.

In the [[Ultimate Six]] story arc, Kraven genetically tampers with his DNA, allowing him to become a gruesome [[werewolf]]-like monster with large hands and feet, claw-like fingers, enlarged red veins, darker skin, fang-like teeth and berserk-like feral behavior. Kraven is taken in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] confinement after being taken down by the [[Ultimates]] for tampering with his DNA. Kraven eventually escapes with other Spider-Man villains.

[[Image:KravenSpider-Man tas.jpg|175px|thumb|Kraven the Hunter in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Kraven the Hunter appears in the 1994 ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Gregg Berger]]. When big-game hunter Sergei Kravinoff is attacked and nearly killed by hyenas while saving Dr. Mariah Crawford from them, he is saved by the administration of a miracle drug by Dr. Crawford which, in addition to curing his wounds, grants him heightened senses and physical abilities. Unfortunately, the serum also causes him to become increasingly bestial to the point that he eventually begins 'hunting like a jungle animal' and calling himself 'Kraven the Hunter'. By the end of the episode "Kraven the Hunter", Kravinoff is cured of his insanity. During the second season, Kraven makes a cameo appearance in the episode "Morbius" when he is informed of the mutative disease that is afflicting Spider Man. He returns in the episode "Duel of the Hunters" during which he is called in to hunt Spider Man who has, by this point, mutated into the monstrous Man-Spider. His hunt is initially interrupted by the [[Punisher]] intending to kill Spider-Man, but the two eventually work together to track down Spider-Man and restore him to his human form with Dr. Crawford's help. In the fourth season episode "The Return of Kraven", Kraven returns to New York and takes the same serum that caused his initial transformation in an effort to track down a mysterious creature that has been attacking people in Central Park. He encounters Spider-Man several times before being subdued. Kraven then explains that when Dr. Crawford contracted an African plague, he makes the decision to save her life by giving her a dose of the same miracle-drug that had caused his transformation. It worked to cure her, but later caused her to turn into the feline-like monster he currently hunts. By combining their efforts, Spider-Man and Kraven manage to restore Dr. Crawford's sanity, though she retains the mutated body and enhanced abilities gained from the serum. Kraven and Crawford depart together to an unknown location.

* In the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' episode "Enter the Hunter!", the Hunter (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]) is the [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of Kraven the Hunter. He is one of a few humans that the [[High Evolutionary]] allows to live in the upper parts of the city. He works as a mercenary for both the rebels and the High Evolutionary and is hired by the latter to hunt and kill, and/or capture Spider-Man. Upon breaking into his lair, Spider-Man discovered that the Hunter was using a toxic formula that when mixed with certain animal pheromones gives traits of that animal to the drinker, but also poisons bone marrow, screws up the liver, and cuts your lifespan in half to which the Hunter stated it's a necessary sacrifice for the power it brings. Spider-Man defeats him by trouncing him and turning his security system against him stating that he now knows the Hunter's secret and if he comes after the Rebels or him again, he will use this knowledge to beat him into the ground.

* Kraven the Hunter appears in the two-part ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' episode "Mind Games", voiced by [[Michael Dorn]]. The version killed the Gaines wife and husband by poisoning them with a serum but the couple spawned two fraternal children (Roxanne Gaines and Roland Gaines) who got hypnotizing powers from the serum's effects. The Gaines Twins could not use their powers on Kraven as his senses were too keen for their abilities. In the first part, the Twins hypnotized Spider-Man into thinking Kraven killed [[Mary Jane Watson]] and the Twins used this moment to have Spider-Man kill Kraven. In the second part, Spider-Man and Kraven fight inside a warehouse in which Spider-Man almost kills Kraven by hanging him. Luckily, Spider-Man snaps out of the hypnosis and spares Kraven's life in time learning Kraven did not kill Mary Jane. Kraven was handed over to Officer Barr and sent back to jail.

* Sergei Kravinoff appears in the ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by Eric Visbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/21/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> Garbed in a lion-themed vest similar to his comic book counterpart, he is the most skilled hunter in the known world, relying only on his natural skills and using his bare hands to subdue his prey. In the episode "Destructive Testing", Kravinoff arrived in New York with Calypso and his pet lion (that was trained to track anything) and had confronted Spider-Man where, to his credit, he provides a reasonable challenge but is still subdued before too long. However, following his first defeat at the hands of Spider-Man, he becomes convinced that the only reason he lost was due to Spider-Man's genetically altered physiology. As such, Kravinoff enlists [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Professor Miles Warren]]'s aid in securing powers of his own. Using a serum concocted from Warren's own research (and based on [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]'s Lizard formula), Kravinoff is then mutated into a humanoid black-maned [[lion]]-like creature with elements of [[leopard]] and [[cheetah]] DNA (similar to his Ultimate Marvel version). After the mutation, he then changes his name to 'Kraven the Hunter' and goes after Spider-Man. With his new form, he easily outruns and overpowers Spider-Man several times throughout their fight (actually forcing Spider-Man to use up all his web fluid against him) and only being narrowly subdued after being tied up with most of Spider-Man's webs. After his second defeat, Kraven is rescued by Calypso on behalf of the Master Planner who asks him if he would like to hunt in [[Sinister Six|a pack]]. This does occur in the episode "Reinforcement" when he is sent to spring [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] from Ravencroft. He only got away with Electro as Doctor Octopus did not want to leave. Thus, Master Planner managed to form the second version of the Sinister Six with him, [[Mysterio]], [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], Electro, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. After Vulture, Electro, Sandman and Rhino were defeated, he and Mysterio attacked Spider-Man where their fight led to a mall. He was knocked out by an exploding Mysterio robot. Though Mysterio was arrested, Kraven alongside the other four villains were extracted at the last minute by Master Planner. In the episode "Gangland", Doctor Octopus tries to call Kraven for backup, but Doctor Octopus's phone becomes jammed by the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]].

He fought the first [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Hector Ayala) to claim the White Tiger amulet and gain its power for himself. Although he kills Hector, the amulet is passed on to the second [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Ava Ayala). Years later in his self-titled episode "Kraven the Hunter", Kraven arrives in New York to hunt White Tiger where he uses a mystical drum to drive White Tiger berserk. At Central Park, Kraven uses high-tech hunting weapons and traps to try to kill White Tiger and Spider-Man. Spider-Man works to keep White Tiger alive, using his webbing to set off Kraven's sound grenade to get away. White Tiger is then attacked by Kraven at the zoo and manages to swipe the White Tiger Amulet and dons it in order to continue attacking Spider-Man and White Tiger as all the animals in the zoo go berserk. Kraven chases Spider-Man and White Tiger out of the zoo & up into some trees. The power of the White Tiger Amulet proves too much for Kraven as it turns him into a humanoid [[white tiger]] with the ability to control the zoo's white tigers. After a tactic that enables White Tiger to reclaim the amulet, Kraven is regressed back to normal. Spider-Man then webs Kraven as he convinces White Tiger not to avenge her father. White Tiger decides not to take Kraven's life as Kraven breaks free. White Tiger and Spider-Man double-team Kraven and knock him out as White Tiger calls up S.H.I.E.L.D. to pick up Kraven.

Kraven is given a lion-themed armor with razor-sharp mechanical claws. Kraven fights Spider-Man and then White Tiger once again. He also assists in the group's gang assault on [[Norman Osborn|Iron Patriot]]. Eventually, Spider-Man was able to defeat Kraven along with the other Sinister Six members. In the episode "The Savage Spider-Man", Kraven teams up with [[Taskmaster]] in a plan to lure [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] to New York by kidnapping [[Zabu]] so that Taskmaster can recruit Ka-Zar to his side. During Taskmaster and Kraven's fight with Spider-Man, Ka-Zar and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Kraven uses a dart with a special poison in it on Spider-Man which transforms him into the Man-Spider. Upon being pursued to Manhattan by Spider-Man, Wolverine and Ka-Zar, Kraven seeks to perform a ritual to become immortal by sacrificing Zabu at sunset (with the ritual occurring once every thousand years) while Taskmaster plans to get Ka-Zar on his side. With help from Wolverine who deals with Taskmaster, Spider-Man and Ka-Zar defeat Kraven who tries to knock Zabu off the bridge only for Spider-Man and Ka-Zar to catch Zabu before he can fall into the river. Kraven is later arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. In "Contest of Champions" Pt. 1, Grandmaster pairs up Kraven the Hunter with [[Molten Man]] and [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] King in the game of "Last Man Standing" against Collector's team of Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Hulk during. Kraven the Hunter coordinated Molten Man and Wendigo in the battle while using some of his traps. When chased by Hulk, Kraven used a special pollen that knocked out Hulk removing him from the game.

Spider-Man promptly escaped, but Kraven has a piece of the Tablet of Order and Chaos which has given him enhanced speed to the point where most of Spider-Man's attacks are easily dodged. Spider-Man must get it and in a twist to the usual Kraven/Spider formula, Spider-Man hunts the Kraven through Kraven's jungles. Spider-Man defeats Kraven at the top of the temple and claims the piece of the Tablet of Order and Chaos.
