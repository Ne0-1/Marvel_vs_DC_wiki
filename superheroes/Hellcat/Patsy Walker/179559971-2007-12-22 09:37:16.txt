'''Patsy Walker''' (also known by the moniker '''Hellcat'''), is a [[fictional character]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Unusually for a [[superhero]], she premiered as the star of a [[teen]] [[romantic fiction|romantic]]-[[comedy]] series, and was later integrated into Marvel superhero franchises such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

Created by [[Ruth Atkinson]], Patsy Walker first appeared in ''[[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] Magazine'' #2 (Nov. 1944), published by Marvel precursor [[Timely Comics]], and became Hellcat in ''The Avengers'' (vol. 1) #144 (Feb. 1976).

==Publication history==

Redheaded Patsy Walker, her parents Stanley and Betty, her boyfriend Robert "Buzz" Baxter, and her raven-haired friendly rival Hedy Wolfe appeared from the 1940s through 1967 in issues of ''Miss America'', ''Teen Comics'', ''Girls' Life'', and namesake series ''Patsy Walker'' and its spin-offs: ''Patsy and Hedy'', ''Patsy and Her Pals'' and the single-issue ''A Date with Patsy''.  These were popular teen-humor comics from Marvel's 1940s and 1950s predecessors, [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], respectively. Attesting to its quiet popularity, ''Patsy Walker'' (along with ''[[Millie the Model]]'' and ''[[Kid Colt|Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'') was among the very few titles published continuously by Marvel from the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. 

Future ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' [[cartoonist]] and "Fold-In" creator [[Al Jaffee]] wrote and drew most of the early issues — which, given the tone and the target audience, oddly included ''Mad'' founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s bizarre "Hey Look!" one-pagers in several.  Jaffee was succeeded by [[Al Hartley]], who would go on to [[Archie Comics]] and produce many [[Christian]] comic books starring Archie characters and others.  [[Morris Weiss]] drew ''Patsy and Her Pals''.  Millie (the Model) Collins made guest appearances in #92 and 98.

In 1964, following Patsy's high-school graduation, the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure.  ''Patsy Walker'' lasted through issue #124 (Dec. 1965), with ''Patsy and Hedy'' outlasting it to its own #110 (Feb. 1967).

Patsy and Hedy make a cameo appearance in ''[[The Fantastic Four]] (vol. 1) [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 (1965), establishing them in the [[Marvel Universe]].  Subsequent comics portray the earlier stories as fictional within the Marvel Universe itself, as having been written by mom Betty Walker though based upon Patsy's own life and friends. The Patsy Walker profile in [[Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook]] establishes that Patsy did indeed experience many of the events from these stories.

==Fictional character biography==
===Hellcat===
[[Image:Avengers 144.jpg|thumb|left|Patsy Walker assumes the identity of Hellcat in ''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #144]]
Walker embarks on a new career in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' (vol. 2) #13 (July 1973).  There, she meets Hank McCoy, one of the original [[X-Men]], in his alter ego as the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].  She has become dissatisfied with married life with Baxter, and helps the injured Beast in return for "just a costume, with some power, or a serum, or something," wanting to become a superheroine.

Shortly afterward, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], with the Beast and Walker tagging along, invade the complex of buildings belonging to the Brand Corporation.  Now a subsidiary of [[Roxxon]], a [[multinational]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], Brand is also where Walker's estranged husband, an Air Force colonel, is posted.  There they find one of superheroine '''Greer Nelson's''' [[Tigra|Cat]] costumes. Walker immediately dons the yellow cat-suit and dubs herself Hellcat. (Baxter later becomes the [[supervillain]] [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]].)

When the Avengers are later captured, Walker breaks free and forces her husband to release them. "This suit seems to know what to do all by itself!" she thinks. "I always was pretty coordinated, with my [[surfing]] and [[skiing]] — but now I'm Olympic material!" This thought is later echoed by Nelson, when Walker lends her the suit while Nelson is temporarily deprived of the ability to become [[Tigra]]. "This wonderful suit was designed to extend any woman's strengths," claims Greer. Not long after, the Cat costume is contaminated with radioactivity in the Chernobyl-like nuclear disaster engineered by the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]], and Walker creates a similar outfit of her own. She substitutes ordinary blue clawed gloves and talon-toed boots, retaining only the cable-claws strapped to each wrist. The new costume has a blue cowl instead of yellow.

Although Walker is offered membership in the Avengers, [[Moondragon]] persuades her to decline and instead accompany her to the moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]] for training in [[psychic]] ability, and advanced [[martial arts]]. Her all-too-brief training period is abbreviated, however, when she dons the Hellcat costume once more, and has to return to Earth to assist [[Doctor Strange]]. She befriends and joins the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and is a long-standing member of that team. During her time there, Moondragon revokes her psychic abilities, citing Patsy's ineffective use of them as the cause. She eventually meets her next husband, [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], and the pair retire from superheroics.  Ultimately, Hellstrom's demonic inheritance takes possession of him and drives Patsy insane. She is institutionalized and later driven to [[suicide]] by the otherworldly being called [[Deathurge]].

Trapped in [[Hell]], Patsy's spirit is used in a series of gladiatorial-like combat scenarios.  There, she learns to develop and use her psychic powers.  [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], then the leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], is tricked into returning her spirit to Earth by Daimon; Hawkeye believes he is retrieving his wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s realm. Patsy retains the powers that she has developed while in Hell.  Now able to manifest a costume at will, Patsy uses a reversed version of the Cat costume in her limited series, with a blue cat-suit and cowl with yellow gloves and boots. In this new guise, Patsy focuses her efforts on combating [[occult]] evils, notably [[Nicholas Scratch]] (who had based himself in her hometown, Centerville) and [[Dormammu]]. 

She later returns to her first costume. She joins the new team of Defenders, and remains with them until their dissolution.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
During the [[Civil War (comics)|"Civil War"]] event, Patsy willingly registers under the Superhuman Registration Act.

Patsy has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

===Ultimate Hellcat===

In [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Patsy Walker has several small but notable appearances.  In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', she first appears as a spokeswoman for a security firm (#11), then as a swimsuit model for ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine (#14), a talk show hostess, presenting a biography on [[Doctor Strange]] (#70), and finally interviewing Norman Osborn (#113).  Patsy has taken her "Hellcat" identity in [[Ultimates]] and was a founding member of the ill-fated [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].
