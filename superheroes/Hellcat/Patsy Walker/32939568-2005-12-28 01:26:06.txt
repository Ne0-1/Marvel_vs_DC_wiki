'''Hellcat''', real name '''Patsy Walker''', is a [[fictional character]] and [[superhero]] who has appeared in various [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].  She is a former member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]].  Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Ruth Atkinson Ford]], Patsy Walker first appeared in ''[[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] Magazine'' #2 (November 1944), and became Hellcat in ''Avengers'' volume 1 #144 (February 1976).

Redheaded Patsy Walker, her parents Stanley and Betty, her boyfriend Robert "Buzz" Baxter, and her raven-haired friendly rival Hedy Wolfe appeared from the 1940s through 1967 in issues of ''Miss America'', ''Teen Comics'', ''Girls' Life'', and her own ''Patsy Walker'' and its spinoffs: ''Patsy and Hedy'', ''Patsy and Her Pals'' and the single-issue ''A Date with Patsy'' . These were popular teen-humor comics from Marvel's 1940s and 1950s predecessors, [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], respectively. Attesting to its quiet popularity, ''Patsy Walker'' (along with ''[[Millie the Model]]'' and ''[[Kid Colt|Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'') was among the very few titles published continuously by Marvel from the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. 

Future [[MAD Magazine]] [[cartoonist]] and "Fold-In" creator [[Al Jaffee]] wrote and drew most of the early issues â€” which, given the tone and the target audience, oddly included ''Mad'' founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s bizarre "Hey Look!" one-pagers in several. Jaffee was succeeded by [[Al Hartley]] who would go on to [[Archie Comics]] and produce many [[Christian]] comic books starring Archie characters and others. [[Morris Weiss]] drew ''Patsy and Her Pals''. Millie (the Model) Collins made guest appearances in #92 and 98.

In 1964, following Patsy's high-school graduation, the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure. ''Patsy Walker'' lasted through issue #124 (December 1965), with ''Patsy and Hedy'' outlasting it to its own #110 (February 1967).

Patsy and Hedy made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Fantastic Four]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 (1965), establishing them in the [[Marvel Universe]].  Subsequent comics would portray the earlier stories as fictional within the Marvel Universe itself, as having been written by her mother though based upon Patsy's own life and friends.

==Hellcat==

Patsy embarked on a new career in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' Vol. 2 #13 (July 1973).  There, she met Hank McCoy, one of the original [[X-Men]], in his alter ego as the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].  She had become dissatisfied with married life with Buzz, and helped the injured Beast in return for "just a costume, with some power, or a serum, or something," wanting to become a superheroine.

Shortly afterward, [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], with the Beast and Patsy tagging along, invaded the complex of buildings belonging to the Brand Corporation.  Now a subsidiary of [[Roxxon]], a [[multinational]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], Brand was also where her estranged husband Buzz, an Air Force colonel, was posted.  There they found one of the [[Cat (comics)|Cat]] costumes from Malcolm Donalbain's collection.  Patsy immediately donned the yellow catsuit and dubbed herself Hellcat.  Buzz himself would later become the [[supervillain]] [[Mad-Dog]].

When the captured Avengers were later placed in an electro-incinerogram, it was Patsy who broke free and forced Buzz to release them.  "This suit seems to know what to do all by itself!" Patsy thought.  "I always was pretty coordinated, with my surfing and skiing -- but now I'm Olympic material!"  This thought was later echoed by Greer Nelson, when Patsy lent her the suit while Greer was temporarily deprived of the ability to become [[Tigra]].  "This wonderful suit was designed to extend any woman's strengths," claimed Greer.  Not long after, the Cat costume was contaminated with radioactivity in the Chernobyl-like nuclear disaster engineered by the [[Presence (comics)|Presence]], and Patsy created a similar outfit of her own. She substituted ordinary blue gloves and boots for the clawed gloves and taloned boots, retaining only the cable-claws strapped to each wrist.  Her new costume had a blue cowl, instead of the yellow cowl of the original.

Although Patsy was offered membership in the Avengers, [[Moondragon]] persuaded her to decline and instead accompany her to the moon Titan for training in [[psychic]] ability and [[martial arts]].  Her training was abbreviated, however, when she had to return to Earth to assist [[Doctor Strange]].  She befriended and joined [[Defenders (comics)|the Defenders]] and through them met her next husband, [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], and the pair retired from superheroics.  Eventually, his demonic inheritance took possession of him and drove Patsy insane.  She was institutionalized and later driven to [[suicide]] by the otherworldly being called Deathurge.

Trapped in Hell, Patsy's spirit was used in a series of gladiatorial-like combat scenarios.  There, she learned to develop and use her psychic powers.  [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], then the leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], was tricked into returning her spirit to Earth by Daimon; Hawkeye thought he was retrieving his wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s realm.  Patsy retained the powers that she had developed while in Hell.  Now able to manifest a costume at will, Patsy uses a reversed version of the Cat costume, a blue catsuit and cowl with yellow gloves and boots.  She joined the new team of Defenders, and remained with them until their dissolution.

==Ultimate Hellcat==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Patsy Walker has several small, but notable appearances. In [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], she has had three appearances - once as a spokeswoman for a security firm (#11), then as a swimsuit model for [[Maxim]] magazine (#14), and finally presenting a biography on [[Doctor Strange]] (#70). Patsy has since taken her "Hellcat" identity in [[Ultimates]] and was a founding member of the ill-fated [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].
