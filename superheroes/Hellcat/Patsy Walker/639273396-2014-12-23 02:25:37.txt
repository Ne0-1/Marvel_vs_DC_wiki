==Publication history==
===Teen-humor heroine===

Created by [[Ruth Atkinson]], Patsy Walker first appeared in ''[[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] Magazine'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Nov. 1944), published by Marvel precursor [[Timely Comics]]. Redheaded Patsy Walker, her parents Stanley and Betty, her boyfriend [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Robert "Buzz" Baxter]], and her raven-haired friendly rival Hedy Wolfe appeared from the 1940s through 1967 in issues of ''Miss America'', ''Teen Comics'', ''Girls' Life'', and the namesake [[Teen humor comics|teen-humor]] series ''Patsy Walker'' and its spin-offs: ''Patsy and Hedy'', ''Patsy and Her Pals'', and the single-issue ''A Date with Patsy''.  Attesting to its quiet popularity, ''Patsy Walker'' (along with ''[[Millie the Model]]'' and ''[[Kid Colt|Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'') was among the very few titles published continuously by Marvel from the 1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], through Marvel's 1950s iteration as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], and into the 1960s [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].

Future ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' [[cartoonist]] and "Fold-In" creator [[Al Jaffee]] wrote and drew most of the early issues, several of which included ''Mad'' founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s highly stylized "Hey Look!" one-page humor strips. Jaffee was succeeded by [[Al Hartley]], who would go on to [[Archie Comics]] and produce many [[Christian]] comic books starring Archie characters and others.  [[Morris Weiss]] drew ''Patsy and Her Pals''.  Millie (the Model) Collins made guest appearances in #92 and 98.

Following Patsy's high-school graduation, in issue #116 (Aug. 1964), the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure.  ''Patsy Walker'' lasted through issue #124 (Dec. 1965), with ''Patsy and Hedy'' outlasting it to its own #110 (Feb. 1967).

Patsy and Hedy made a cameo appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 (1965), establishing them in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The superhero-team comic ''The Defenders'' #89 (Nov. 1980) further established that the earlier stories were fictional works published within the fictional Marvel Universe itself, and written by Patsy's mother Dorothy Walker though based upon Patsy's own life and friends.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Miller|first= Jonathan|title= Beware the Claws of Patsy Walker: The Hellcat Cometh|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 40|page= 66|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= May 2010}}</ref> The Patsy Walker profile in ''Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook'' #1 (2006) establishes that Walker indeed experienced many of the events from these stories.

''Patsy Walker'' #95 and the [[science-fiction]] anthology ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #69 (both June 1961) are the first modern comic books labeled "Marvel Comics", with each showing an "MC" box on its cover.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/brand/36/ Marvel : MC (Brand)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

===Hellcat===
[[Image:Avengers 144.jpg|thumb||Patsy Walker becomes Hellcat in ''The Avengers'' #144 (Feb. 1976)]]
''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' vol. 2, #13 (July 1972) introduced the concept of Walker as a superheroine. Writer [[Steve Englehart]] recalled that Walker's cameo in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3 had
{{blockquote|struck my fan's eye by including her in the Marvel Universe. ...I thought it would be cool to bring her in as a real character, with things to do. Part of my 'training' as a Marvel writer was writing romance stories and [[Western comics|Westerns]], but ''Patsy [Walker]'' was defunct as a comic by the time I got there.... Still, as a fan, I had collected everything Marvel, including ''Patsy Walker'' and ''Patsy and Hedy'' ... so I knew them as characters....<ref>Englehart in Miller, p. 62</ref>}}

Walker was reintroduced in ''The Avengers'' #141 (Nov. 1975), having resumed her maiden name of Walker, and accompanied the Avengers on a couple of adventures. Shortly thereafter in ''The Avengers'' #144 (Feb. 1976), she adopted the name Hellcat, taking on superheroine [[Tigra|Greer Grant Nelson]]'s costume from her discontinued identity as The Cat. The name "Hellcat" itself had originally been proposed for Nelson.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|date= August 2006|title= Talking About Tigra: From the Cat to Were-Woman|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 17|pages= 26–33|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The suit's look was later adapted slightly.

Recalled Englehart in 2010,
{{blockquote|I wasn't real interested in the Cat. I read the books and they seemed like pandering, frankly — not very good stories written to appeal to a demographic. Once [Patsy] entered the [Marvel Universe], met the Beast, confronted her husband — all that began to change the Patsy I had inherited to someone a little more savvy. By the time she became the Hellcat, she could stand back far enough to see the ironies in her taking over a feminist creation. But she was really more about jumping into the superhero pool than standing back.... She didn't muse on the irony; she wanted to be a heroine.<ref>Englehart in Miller, p. 63</ref>}}

Hellcat joined the superhero team ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' in issue #44 (Feb. 1977). After many adventures with the group, she met the supernatural adventurer [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], in ''The Defenders'' #92 (Feb. 1981). They marry in ''The Defenders'' #125 and become husband-and-wife occult investigators, but Hellstrom's demonic nature asserts itself, and Walker is driven first mad and then, in ''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' #14 (May 1994), to [[suicide]]. Through Hellstrom's manipulation of the superhero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], she was resurrected, in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts 2000]]'', a summer Annual of the superhero-team comic ''Thunderbolts'', and returned to Earth with new abilities acquired while in [[Hell]]. (The story which began in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts 2000]]'' concluded in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers 2000]]''.) A three-issue ''Hellcat'' (Sept. - Nov. 2000) series takes place immediately following the events in the Thunderbolts and Avengers 2000 Annuals. Briefly adopting a new costume and then returning to her traditional yellow outfit, she rejoined the Defenders in a short-lived revival series, ''The Defenders'' vol. 2, #1-12 (March 2001 - Feb. 2002).

After appearing in occasional guest roles, Hellcat starred in the [[miniseries]] ''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' #1-5 (Sept. 2008 - Feb. 2009). Following this, she was an ensemble star and narrator, alongside the superheroines [[Firestar]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], and [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]], in the miniseries ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2009), which writers [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and Tonci Zonjic had pitched it to Marvel editors as "''[[Sex and the City]]'' in the Marvel Universe".<ref name="marveldivas">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960|title=MyCup o' Tea | first = Dan | last= Abnett |first2 = Andy | last2= Lanning | authorlink = Dan Abnett | authorlink2 = Andy Lanning | date=2009-04-09|publisher=MySpace Comic Books|accessdate=2009-04-10 | archivedate = 29 April 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090413195242/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960}}</ref>

She meets her future husband [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of Satan, during the course of her Defenders adventuring. After learning that her mother had promised her soul to Satan, and briefly being lied to by the Devil that he was her father, Walker reunites with her real father and marries Hellstrom.

During the superhero "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" over the federal [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], Hellcat willingly registers.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} She serves as one of the young superheroes' instructors at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10</ref> She was then assigned as an official superhero in [[Alaska]],<ref>''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' #1-5</ref> but eventually returned to [[New York City]].<ref>''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1-4</ref>

Patsy Walker has appeared in Marvel Comics' [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint]]. In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', she first appears as a spokeswoman for a security firm (#11), then as a swimsuit model for ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine (#14), a talk show hostess, presenting a biography on [[Alternative versions of Doctor Strange#Ultimate Doctor Strange|Doctor Strange]] (#70), and finally interviewing [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Norman Osborn]] (#113).

Additionally, [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] has (within the pages of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'') constructed a costume visually similar to the 616 Hellcat's, differing in color and mask design only.
