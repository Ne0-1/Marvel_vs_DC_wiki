'''Hellcat''' ('''Patricia "Patsy" Walker''') is a [[fictional character]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  She premiered as the star of a [[teen]] [[Romance comics in the United States (1946–1975)|romantic]]-[[comedy]] series and was later integrated into Marvel [[superhero]] franchises such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

Created by [[Ruth Atkinson]], Patsy Walker first appeared in ''[[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] Magazine'' #2 (Nov. 1944), published by Marvel precursor [[Timely Comics]], and became Hellcat in ''The Avengers'' #144 (Feb. 1976).

==Publication history==
===Teen-humor heroine===

Redheaded Patsy Walker, her parents Stanley and Betty, her boyfriend [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Robert "Buzz" Baxter]], and her raven-haired friendly rival Hedy Wolfe appeared from the 1940s through 1967 in issues of ''Miss America'', ''Teen Comics'', ''Girls' Life'', and namesake series ''Patsy Walker'' and its spin-offs: ''Patsy and Hedy'', ''Patsy and Her Pals'' and the single-issue ''A Date with Patsy''.  These were popular teen-humor comics from Marvel's 1940s and 1950s predecessors, [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], respectively. Attesting to its quiet popularity, ''Patsy Walker'' (along with ''[[Millie the Model]]'' and ''[[Kid Colt|Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'') was among the very few titles published continuously by Marvel from the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. 

Future ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' [[cartoonist]] and "Fold-In" creator [[Al Jaffee]] wrote and drew most of the early issues — which, given the tone and the target audience, oddly included ''Mad'' founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s bizarre "Hey Look!" one-pagers in several.  Jaffee was succeeded by [[Al Hartley]], who would go on to [[Archie Comics]] and produce many [[Christian]] comic books starring Archie characters and others.  [[Morris Weiss]] drew ''Patsy and Her Pals''.  Millie (the Model) Collins made guest appearances in #92 and 98.

In 1964, following Patsy's high-school graduation,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure.  ''Patsy Walker'' lasted through issue #124 (Dec. 1965), with ''Patsy and Hedy'' outlasting it to its own #110 (Feb. 1967).

Patsy and Hedy make a cameo appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 (1965), establishing them in the [[Marvel Universe]].  Subsequent comics portray the earlier stories as fictional works published within the Marvel Universe itself, as having been written by Patsy's mother Betty Walker though based upon Patsy's own life and friends.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Patsy Walker profile in ''[[Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook]]'' establishes that Patsy did indeed experience many of the events from these stories.

==Fictional character biography==
===Hellcat===
[[Image:Avengers 144.jpg|thumb|left|Patsy Walker assumes the identity of Hellcat in ''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #144]]
Walker embarks on a new career in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' (vol. 2) #13 (July 1973).  There, she meets Hank McCoy, one of the original [[X-Men]], in his alter ego as the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].  She has become dissatisfied with married life with Baxter, and helps the injured Beast in return for "just a costume, with some power, or a serum, or something," wanting to become a superheroine.

Shortly afterward, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], with the Beast and Walker tagging along, invade the complex of buildings belonging to the Brand Corporation.  Now a subsidiary of [[Roxxon]], a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], Brand is also where Walker's estranged husband, an Air Force colonel, is posted.  There they find one of superheroine '''[[Tigra|Greer Grant]]'s''' spare Cat costumes. Walker immediately dons the yellow cat-suit and dubs herself Hellcat. (Baxter later becomes the [[supervillain]] [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]].)

When the Avengers are later captured, Walker breaks free and forces her husband to release them. "This suit seems to know what to do all by itself!" she thinks. "I always was pretty coordinated, with my [[surfing]] and [[skiing]] — but now I'm Olympic material!" This thought is later echoed by Grant, when Walker lends her the suit while Grant is temporarily deprived of the ability to become [[Tigra]]. "This wonderful suit was designed to extend any woman's strengths," claims Greer. Not long after, the Cat costume is contaminated with radioactivity in the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster engineered by the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]], and Walker creates a similar outfit of her own. She substitutes ordinary blue clawed gloves and talon-toed boots, retaining only the cable-claws strapped to each wrist. The new costume has a blue cowl instead of yellow.

Although Walker is offered membership in the Avengers, [[Moondragon]] persuades her to decline and instead accompany her to the moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]] for training in [[psychic]] ability, and advanced [[martial arts]]. Her all-too-brief training period is abbreviated, however, when she dons the Hellcat costume once more, and has to return to Earth to assist [[Doctor Strange]]. She befriends and joins the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and is a long-standing member of that team. During her time there, Moondragon revokes her psychic abilities, citing Patsy's ineffective use of them as the cause. She eventually meets her next husband, [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], and the pair retire from superheroics.  Ultimately, Hellstrom's demonic inheritance takes possession of him and drives Patsy insane. She is institutionalized and later driven to [[suicide]] by the otherworldly being called [[Deathurge]].

Trapped in [[Hell]], Patsy's spirit is used in a series of gladiatorial-like combat scenarios.  There, she learns to develop and use her psychic powers.  [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], then the leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], is tricked into returning her spirit to Earth by Daimon; Hawkeye believes he is retrieving his wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s realm. Patsy retains the powers that she has developed while in Hell.  Now able to manifest a costume at will, Patsy uses a reversed version of the Cat costume in her limited series, with a blue cat-suit and cowl with yellow gloves and boots. In this new guise, Patsy focuses her efforts on combating [[occult]] evils, notably [[Nicholas Scratch]] (who had based himself in her hometown, Centerville) and [[Dormammu]]. 

She later returns to her first costume. She joins the new team of Defenders, and remains with them until their dissolution.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
During the [[Civil War (comics)|"Civil War"]] event, Patsy confronts the supervillain [[Ruby Thursday]]. Ruby attempts to escape in her car, with Patsy riding on the bumper. She-Hulk breaks up the fight and shows Patsy the result of the fight, namely destruction and traumatized citizens. Patsy willingly registers under the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]]. Ruby herself is captured by the [[Two-Gun Kid]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10, Oct. 2006</ref>

She is later seen as one of instructors at [[Camp Hammond]]. She was seen among the group fighting the [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] clone, K.I.A.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10</ref>

She wasn't considered by the Initiative higher-ups as an option for the Defenders, despite Nighthawk's request for her on his team, but it is revealed that she will be acting as an official superhero in [[Alaska]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=152620 New Patsy Walker: Hellcat Series Coming? - Newsarama<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===''Patsy Walker: Hellcat''===
In this 5-part limited series, Patsy Walker is sent to Alaska as its registered superhero.

===Marvel Divas===
Patsy returned in the limited series ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' (which began as a pitch of ''[[Sex and the City]]'' in the Marvel Universe).<ref name="marveldivas">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960|title=MyCup o’ Joe Tea, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning |date=2009-04-09|publisher=MySpace Comic Books|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> She was the main character and narrator, alongside [[Firestar]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]]. The series was written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and Tonci Zonjic.<ref name="marveldivas"/>

==Powers and abilities==
She can sense mystical phenomena or those items or persons touched by mystical energy. She can use a force field that deflects mystical attacks. She is able to summon her costume at will.  Patsy is a well-trained martial artist, having been taught by both [[Captain America]] and [[Moondragon]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Hellcat===

In [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Patsy Walker has several small but notable appearances.  In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', she first appears as a spokeswoman for a security firm (#11), then as a swimsuit model for ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine (#14), a talk show hostess, presenting a biography on [[Doctor Strange]] (#70), and finally interviewing Norman Osborn (#113). In addition she appeared in ''Ultimate Marvel Team-up'', hosting an instructional video for the Baxter Building, although this issue is not necessarily canonical.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}  Patsy has taken her "Hellcat" identity in [[Ultimates]] and was a founding member of the ill-fated [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Additionally, the Ultimate incarnation of [[Kitty Pryde]] has (within the pages of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'') constructed a costume visually similar to the 616 Hellcat's, differing in color and mask design only.
