'''Professor Andre Thorton'''<ref>http://marvel.wikia.com/Truett_Hudson_%28Earth-616%29</ref><ref>http://www.comicvine.com/professor-thorton/29-9392/</ref> (real name '''Truett Hudson'''; also known as '''The Professor''') is a character in [[Marvel Comics]], an enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].

==History==
In 1972, nearly twenty years before [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]] was romantically involved and abducted with [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] at Windsor snow lodge{{citation needed|article|date=September 2012}}, Thorton experimented on numerous mutants including [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Mastodon (comics)|Mastodon]]. He hired Carol Hines as his assistant and the scientist [[Abraham Cornelius]]. He experiments on Wolverine and is responsible for his adamantium-laced skeleton. He is also connected to the creation of [[Alpha Flight]] on to developing super-soldiers for the US government. During the adamantium-lacing process, the pain of past memories awakes Wolverine, enabling him to break through the chamber after the process was completed. In the ensuing rampage, Wolverine cuts off Professor Thorton's hand and supposedly kills him in a mad rage. However, an ending scene clarifies to the reader that this was a virtual reality simulation of an escape attempt by Wolverine. 

Sometime later, Professor Thorton and Carol Hines lure Wolverine into an abandoned warehouse in Canada which was once the secret location for the Weapon X program. Codenamed Project X, Wolverine soon discovers Weapon X was funded by the CIA and sheltered in Canada. Professor Thorton's secret weapon, a robotic android named Shiva, is activated to destroy him. Wolverine discovers the apartment complex is not a Pest control outlet but a trap for revenge. Silver Fox (who works for another secret organization called [[HYDRA]]) is revealed to be behind the entire plan. In the end, the missing character and cohort Silver Fox surprises them amidst the fighting there by killing the professor.<ref>''Wolverine'' #50</ref>
