'''''Dial H for Hero''''' is a [[comic book]] feature published by [[DC Comics]] about a magical dial that enables an ordinary person to become a [[superhero]] for a short time, such as an hour, by selecting the letters H-E-R-O in order. Each time it is used, the dial causes its possessor to become a superhero with a different name, costume, and powers. These superheroes are usually new, but on one occasion the dial caused its user to become a duplicate of existing superheroes like [[Plastic Man]].<ref name=hom160>''House of Mystery'' #160 (July 1966)</ref> Some versions of the dial, like the original, contain additional letters, allowing other kinds of transformations.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Dial "H" for Hero | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 101  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Original series==
[[Image:Dial H for Hero 1.2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Cover of ''House of Mystery'' #156 (January 1966). Art by [[Jim Mooney]].]]
The original series debuted in ''[[House of Mystery]]'' #156 (January 1966), and continued until issue #173 (March–April 1968). The art was by [[Jim Mooney]] (though he did not finish the run), with scripts by [[Dave Wood (comics)|Dave Wood]]. 

The original owner of the dial is Robert "Robby" Reed, a highly intelligent teenager with a penchant for exclaiming "Sockamagee!" He lives in the fictional town of Littleville, [[Colorado]] with his grandfather "Gramps" Reed and their housekeeper Miss Millie. During a camping trip, Robby accidentally falls into a [[cavern]] and discovers the dial in one of its alcoves. The origins of the dial and how it came to be in the cavern are never revealed. 

Resembling a [[Rotary dial|rotary telephone dial]], the device is hand-held with unknown symbols inside the dial's finger- openings and along its outer rim, which Robby deciphers into modern English letters. In Mark Waid's "Silver Age" mini-series, it is revealed that the symbols on the dial are [[Interlac]].<ref name="SilverAgeDialHfoHERO">''Silver Age: Dial H for Hero'' Vol.1 #1 (July, 2000)</ref> Each time he dials the letters H-E-R-O, Robby transforms into a different super-powered being; dialing O-R-E-H reverts him to his normal form. Robby soon uses the dial to protect Littleville under the guises of numerous superheroes

The H-Dial came with certain limitations. Typically, Robby could transform from one hero to another immediately, but occasionally he would have to wait an unspecified length of time after being one hero before using the dial again to become another. In ''House of Mystery'' #165, a "freak electrical storm" in space affects his H-Dial, changing him temporarily into oddly-shaped "freak" super-heroes dubbed "Whoozis", "Whatsis", and "Howzis". In ''House of Mystery'' #173, certain high-pitched frequencies from a villain's supersonic motor affect Robby's hero forms, causing them to rob the criminals and keep the loot for themselves. Only after the motor is destroyed does Robby realize what is happening to him, enabling him to recover the stolen items.

Robby's H-Dial could also be used by others, transforming them into unique superhuman forms. The dial was once used by Robby's adversary Daffy Dagan in ''House of Mystery'' #158 (April 1966)- he briefly became a supervillain known as Daffy the Great after dialing V-I-L-L-A-I-N. In ''House of Mystery'' #169 (September 1967), Robby's girlfriend Suzie discovers Robby's secret and dialed H-E-R-O-I-N-E to temporarily transform into Gem Girl in order to help defeat Toymaster. At the end of the story, Suzie receives a blow to the head that causes her to forget about the secret of the device.

After the series ceased its run in ''House of Mystery'', Robby appeared in ''Plastic Man'' #13 (June–July 1976). Recovering from an attack of [[amnesia]], Robby retrieves his dial which has become corroded with rust. The corrosion causes Robby to turn into an evil version of Plastic Man and he attacks the real Plastic Man. After defeating Robby and returning him to normal, Plastic Man confiscates the dial from Robby for using it irresponsibly. It is never explained how Robby is seen with the dial in later stories.

==1980s series==
[[Image:Dial H for Hero 2.jpg|frame|right|Cover of ''Adventure Comics'' #479, featuring Chris King and Vicki Grant. Art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Bob Smith (comics)|Bob Smith]].]]
The second ''Dial H for Hero'' series debuted in the 1980s, in a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #272 (February 1981),<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 192|quote =Within a sixteen-page preview in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #272...was "Dial 'H' For Hero," a new feature that raised the bar on fan interaction in the creative process.  The feature's story, written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Carmine Infantino, saw two high-school students find dials that turned them into super-heroes.  Everything from the pair's civilian clothes to the heroes they became was created by fans writing in.  This concept would continue in the feature's new regular spot within ''Adventure Comics.''}}</ref> then ran in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #479–490 and continued in ''[[New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #28–49; the duo also appeared alongside [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #44. A new feature of this series was that the readers could submit new hero and villain characters, which were then used in the stories. The submitters were given credit for their creations (and a T-shirt with the series logo), but the characters became DC Comics' property. Some, however, only made cameo 1-panel appearances. The original writer and artist in the series were [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Carmine Infantino]].

In this series, two other dials are discovered years later by teenagers Christopher "Chris" King and Victoria "Vicki" Grant of the [[New England]] town of Fairfax in a "[[haunted house]]." These dials — disguised as a [[watch]] and a [[necklace]] — only have the letters H-E-R-O on them, and work only for an hour, after which they will not work for another hour. King and Grant begin protecting Fairfax from a number of menaces. Unknown to them, most of these villains are created by a mysterious [[villain]] known only as The Master (who is obsessed with the H-dials for reasons unknown for most of the series) who creates them from the cell samples of unknown people.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

While anyone could use Chris and Vicki's H-dials, they always turned the user into a hero, regardless of his or her personality; even The Master was temporarily made good by one. This fact has been ignored in later stories. On one occasion, a hero's persona overwhelmed the heroic Chris' own personality; as "Ragnarok, the Cosmic Viking", he possessed no awareness of Chris King's memories and acted with disregard for others' property and safety, going so far as to threaten police officers and swat away Vicki (as the miniature heroine "Pixie") when she attempted to talk him down, failing to recognize her as an ally.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' #488 (December 1981)</ref> On a side note, it was a matter of contention with Chris when he first started using the dial that while Vicki changed into useful heroes with applicable powers, Chris's powers tended to be obscure and not particularly useful to defeat his opponent, such as when he changed into a super hero that could duplicate things and he outright began complaining about his useless ability. Indeed, it was that issue where Vicki showed Chris to think "outside the box" and use his temporary gifts creatively so they could be useful, at which point he helped defeat that issue's bad guy. Once this lesson was learned, Chris's super-hero changes became more relevant to the situation, but no explanation was given as to why this was.

Eventually Chris and Vicki discover that a fellow student named Nick Stevens has been drawing up superheroes as a hobby — and somehow, the dials turn them into those heroes. With Nick's help, they find out that their dials were created by a being called The Wizard (not to be confused with the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|DC Comics villain of the same name]]), whom the Master thought he'd killed years before. In truth, The Wizard faked his death while he looked for the original Hero Dial. With it, he merges with The Master — and transforms into Robby Reed, who explains that years before, he had used the dial to split in two (dialing "S P L I T") so that he could disarm a [[Dead man's switch#Miscellaneous uses|dead man's switch]], while his other self, the Wizard, defeated the villain who set it. However, the Wizard carried all of Robby's inherent goodness, while the Robby that remained possessed only evil impulses; the original Hero Dial was lost when this Robby, renaming himself The Master, dialed "hide yourself", causing the dial to vanish along with The Master's and The Wizard's memories of their former life as Robby Reed. While The Master learned genetic techniques that allowed him to create his army of super-villains, the Wizard was driven to create the new H-dials, unconsciously designing limitations into them to prevent what happened to Robby from recurring (only heroic identities, a time limit, and the exclusion of letters other than H-E-R-O; the latter, however, did not prevent Chris from experimenting on one occasion and dialing H-O-R-R-O-R, with disastrous results<ref>''DC Comics Presents'' #44 (April 1982)</ref>). With Nick developing the ability to actively influence the dials' results (rather than subconsciously as before), Robby passes his dial to Nick, and retires as a hero.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''New Teen Titans'' #45 (June 1988), Victoria and Chris' history after the end of their series is revealed. After the two teens graduated from high school, they found they had gained the ability to transform without the dials — apparently because of their extensive use — but as a side-effect Vicki began experiencing mental problems. Vicki later joined a cult called the Children of the Sun, where she was physically and mentally abused, deranging her even more. She sought out her former partner Chris in order to kill him. With help from the [[Teen Titans]], Chris rescued her (in ''New Teen Titans'' #46). Chris now finds that he changes into a new superhero every hour, without the dial, and remains that way until he expends an unspecified amount of energy. He decides to continue his superhero career, using a suit provided by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to monitor his changes.

In ''[[Superboy]] and the Ravers'' #5 (January 1997), [[Hero Cruz]] finds Vicki's H-dial in the lair of [[Scavenger (comics)|Scavenger]], and uses it to gain superpowers. A still deranged Vicki returns in ''Superboy and the Ravers'' #13 (September 1997) to get her dial back from Hero, but she regains her sanity once she uses the device. She is last seen in the care of the Forces, a family of metahumans.

==''Silver Age'' event==
During the 2000 ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics Title)|Silver Age]]'' cross-over event, Robby encountered his old ''House of Mystery'' co-star [[Martian Manhunter]], in ''Silver Age: Dial H for Hero'' #1. Believing that he and the rest of the [[Justice League]] had gone bad, Robby turns into a superhero to stop him. Actually, Martian Manhunter has been mind-swapped with [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] (the other Justice League have undergone similar mental transpositions, but those seen here are only Light's illusions). Subsequently, in ''Silver Age [[80-Page Giant]]'' #1 (July 2000), Robby lends the H-Dial to the now mind/body restored Justice League, allowing several of its members to transform themselves into new superheroes to defeat [[Agamemno]]'s [[Injustice League]] at a time when they had learned how to defeat the Justice League members in their normal forms:

* [[Superman]] becomes '''Doc Fission'''
* [[Batman]] becomes '''Minuteman'''
* [[Wally West|Flash]] becomes '''Marionette'''
* [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] becomes '''Mod-Man'''
* [[Black Canary]] becomes '''Miss Fortune'''
* [[Aquaman]] becomes '''Terra-Firma'''
* [[Green Arrow]] becomes '''Poltergeist'''
* [[Martian Manhunter]] becomes '''Go-Go'''.

In these new forms, the Justice League were able to defeat the Injustice League.

==2003 series==
{{main article|H.E.R.O. (comics)}}
DC relaunched the series again in 2003, this time simply titled ''[[H.E.R.O. (comics)|H.E.R.O.]]''. The new series, written by [[Will Pfeifer]] with art by [[Kano (comics)|Kano]], focused on the effect the H-Dial has on a series of average people, whose lives are usually ruined by the pressures of superherodom. Robby Reed, now grown old and bitter, is searching for the missing dial, determined to retrieve it and keep a serial killer from getting his hands on it. The series lasted 22 issues with it ending with the H-Dial's powers internalized into Robby Reed and some other people who have come across it after the serial killer that was using it was stopped. The H-Dial ends up being sent back in time to 50,000 BC. [[Superman]] is featured in one of the stories.

==2012 series==
{{main article|Dial H}}
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, DC began publishing a reboot of the series titled ''Dial H'', written by [[China Miéville]] with art by Mateus Santolouco. The series focuses on Nelson Jent, an out-of-shape, unemployed middle-age man who accesses superpowers by dialing seemingly random numbers in an old phone booth. Another main character is an older woman named Roxie Hodder who takes the identity of "Manteau" regardless of what powers the dial calls up and acts as an advisor to Nelson. Following the fight against Ex Nihilo and Abyss, Nelson and Roxie work to figure out the secrets of the H-Dials.

Later issues of the series introduces the S-Dial which turns anyone who uses it into a superhero sidekick to match the person's superhero form.

When it comes to Nelson and Roxie's encounter with the Fixer (who is associated with the different dials), both of them have an encounter with a group of superheroes called the Dial Bunch who have fought the Fixer before. There is also an introduction to the J-Dial (which enables the user to jump through worlds), the G-Dial (which can summon any technological gadget), the Dial-Tapper (which can copy any H-Dial in range), and the Auto-Dialer.

To tie-in with DC's ''Villain's Month ''event, DC published ''Justice League #23.3: Dial E'', a coda to the series. It featured the Q-Dial in which a person must be evil to use it. The Q in Q-Dial is for "Qued" which is an old word for bad.

==2019 series==
A 2019 ''Dial H for Hero'' series written by [[Sam Humphries]] will be released in March 27, 2019.<ref>https://www.dccomics.com/comics/dial-h-for-hero-2019/dial-h-for-hero-1</ref>

When he was 10 years old, Miguel Montez fell into a swimming pool and hit his head after trying to do the backflip. When he was pulled out and resuscitated, someone shouted to call 911. This attracted the attention of Superman whose X-ray vision saw no damage and flew him to the hospital. Some years later, Miguel works at his Uncle Brant's food truck called Mayo Madness. He meets a runaway named Summer Pickles who he gives a sandwich to. While riding his bicycle across a gap, he falls and a H-Dial shows up with the operator telling him to "Call H." Miguel does so as its powers are sensed by [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Snapper Carr]], [[Angel and the Ape]], and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] who calls up Batman about him sensing the H-Dial resurfacing. Miguel is turned into a superhero called Monster Truck. The next morning, Miguel wakes up surrounded by crushed cars and sirens blaring in the background, Summer shows up in the Mayo Madness food truck and offers him a ride out of town. The H-Dial rings as the Operator talks to Miguel stating that he is calling from the Heroverse. Miguel is advised by the operator to beware of the Thunderbolt Club.<ref>''Dial H for Hero'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

As Miguel and Summer are at a diner, a man named Barnaby is contacted by Mister Thunderbolt who is informed that the H-Dial is in Miguel and Summer's possession. He is instructed to seize it and give it to a police officer that is approaching the location. Miguel answers the H-Dial as the Operator informs him that the Thunderbolt Club knows his location and to make his way to Gemworld. After Miguel throws the H-Dial into the river, Barnaby goes in after it. Back at the diner, Summer is approached by a police officer named Corrine Benson who wants to know where the H-Dial is. After seeing Barnaby emerge from the river as Jobu the Zonkey King, Miguel jumps on Jobu. When Corrine catches up to Jobu, Summer runs into Jobu as Miguel uses the H-Dial to transform into Iron Deadhead who fights Jobu. After being subdued, Jobu warns that he can't hold on to the H-Dial forever as there are a thousand members of the Thunderbolt Club that are after it. As Jobu regresses back to Barnaby, Miguel states that they are heading to Metropolis only to find that Officer Benson has the H-Dial. Mister Thunderbolt advises her not to use the H-Dial or they will find her.<ref>''Dial H for Hero'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

In a flashback, Robby Reed is attending a field trip when [[Gorilla Grodd]] attacks looking for [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] causing Robby to use his H-Dial. In the present in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], Miguel and Summer try everything to attract Flash. Three years ago, Summer was shown to have some issues with her mother who was not pleased with her shaving half her head. Back in the present, Officer Benson is at a motel where she contacts the Operator who claimed that Mister Thunderbolt is an old friend of his. Miguel detects the H-Dial's powers as they find that Officer Benson has transformed into the Bluebird of Happiness whose powers causes Summer to relive a memory of her mother two years ago where she was locked in the closet for a certain amount of time. Another memory one year ago had Summer breaking out of the closet while her mother was asleep. When Summer grabs the H-Dial, she becomes Lo-Lo Kick You where she defeats Bluebird of Happiness. Before falling unconscious, Bluebird of Happiness informs Mister Thunderbolt that he is coming for him. Then Lo-Lo Kick You drives Miguel to Detroit. Back in the Heroverse, the Operator is revealed to be Robby Reed who plans to stop Mister Thunderbolt.<ref>''Dial H for Hero'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>

In Detroit, Miguel and Summer find themselves at the Justice League's Detroit headquarters where they encounter a Batman robot. Once inside, they meet Snapper Carr who mentions his encounter with the H-Dial while managing the Justice League robots. In the Heroverse, Robby talks to himself how he is surrounded by the energies of many extraordinary beings with nobody to talk to as he approaches a stasis pod containing Mister Thunderbolt as his spirit roams Earth. As Snapper Carr is trying to contact the Hall of Justice, the Justice League robots are reprogrammed by Mister Thunderbolt to attack Miguel, Summer, and Snapper. Using the H-Dial, Summer transforms into Chimp Change, Snapper turns into Alien Ice Cream Man, and Miguel turns into Lil' Miguelito. As Chimp Change and Alien Ice Cream Man subdue the Justice League robots, Lil' Miguelito keeps changing forms as Mister Thunderbolt works to tempt Miguel into dialing S for Sockamagee. After Miguel was tricked, Mister Thunderbolt is freed from his prison as Summer and Snapper regress back to normal. As Mister Thunderbolt disappears into the portal, Miguel follows him.<ref>''Dial H for Hero'' #4. DC Comics.</ref>

Miguel finds himself in the Heroverse where he sees the origin of Batman. Back in Detroit, Summer and Snapper are still shocked at what happened as Snapper is still not getting through to the Hall of Justice. Summer persuades Snapper to let her borrow the Supermobile so that she go to Metropolis and find Superman. Back in the Heroverse, Miguel sees the secret origins of Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Supergirl, Flash, and Shazam until they run into Robby Reed who Mister Thunderbolt evades through the other secret origins. Arriving at the Pinnacle, Mister Thunderbolt reunites with his body as he plans to bring a transforming evolution to the world. Miguel and Robby arrive at the memory of when Robby found the H-Dial. As Robby wanted to know where the H-Dial came from, he built a "chariot" and explored the Multiverse where he traveled to the Bleed and stopped at the Speed Force. He arrived at Skyland where he passed the trials of [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] who granted him access to the Heroverse. Robby explains that the Heroverse is the grand potential of every hero past, present, and future. Robby learns that the H-Dial can also make anyone a villain. In Gotham City, Summer arrives trying to find her way to Metropolis where she accidentally causes Two-Face's gang to fire on a police blimp. Back in the Heroverse, Robby accesses a memory of Miguel where his parents perished in a plane crash and that Superman wasn't there to save them as Superman apologizes for not making it in time. He comforts Miguel while stating that he can't be everywhere and needs help from others to save the world. Miguel and Robby sense that Mister Thunderbolt is about to begin his plan starting in Metropolis which he dials up. After Summer crashes into the Daily Planet, she is among those who see their cell phones glowing red like the H-Dial. Mister Thunderbolt speaks to all who answer it to Dial H if they want their lives changed.<ref>''Dial H for Hero'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>

When Summer also uses the cell phone's new power, she becomes Lo-Lo Kick You again. As Mister Thunderbolt appears in Metropolis where he is pleased with the new Golden Age, he goes into the Daily Planet stating that he's got to stop talking to himself. Back in the Heroverse, Robby shows Miguel as cyan-colored H-Dial that he discovered during his travel through the Multiverse. In order for these new heroes to find their secret origins and guide them, he gives Miguel the cyan H-Dial stating that this is a job for Superman. Lo-Lo Kick You tries to control the situation as an airplane is going down. After some persuasion from Robby, Miguel uses the cyan H-Dial to become a Superman-like character called Supermiguel. The other heroes see Supermiguel in action as some of them help to save the airplane as they land it in front of the Superman statue. This is seen on TV by Uncle Brant as he wonders where his food truck is. The superheroes work to fix the city and do some good before they all regress back to normal. Underneath the Daily Planet, Mister Thunderbolt still has the H-Dial as he runs into some members of his Thunderbolt Club while being pleased in the construction of a temple to honor the H-Dial. Now that they have one H-Dial, they need to find three more in order to use the powers of the Heroverse to transform Metropolis and the Multiverse. Mister Thunderbolt then considers it weird that he is talking to himself in front of people.<ref>''Dial H for Hero'' #6. DC Comics.</ref>

==Other appearances==
* As an epilogue to the Chris King/Vicki Grant ''Dial H'' series, ''The New Adventures of Superboy'' #50 features a story in which Chris King's watch is stolen from the [[Space Museum (comics)|Space Museum]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]' time period by a thief named Nylor Truggs, who flees with the dial to the ambiguous late 1960s/early 1970s era-[[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] of the original ([[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]]) [[Superboy]] by altering the dial's functions in some unexplained manner, allowing him to travel in time. Truggs further alters the H-dial to break the restriction that users can only transform into heroic identities, changing the "H" in the center of the dial to "V" for "villain". Truggs also makes the dial capable of changing individuals other than himself into villains if he desires; those transformed would then be under Truggs' control. Truggs transforms several of [[Clark Kent]]'s high school friends, and forms a temporary alliance with a teenaged [[Lex Luthor]], in a scheme to plant seismic devices in their time period so that Truggs can use those devices against the people of his own future time upon his return. Truggs' plan is foiled by Superboy, several members of the Legion, and [[Krypto]] the Superdog, the latter of which destroys the stolen H-Dial by crushing it in his jaws. Vicki Grant's H-Dial is also shown to have survived to the Legion's time—it is slated to replace King's dial in the museum display. As this story was published before the events of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] (which erased the Earth-One Superboy from continuity) and the subsequent rebootings of the Legion of Super-Heroes' history, it is unlikely that any elements of this story exist in current continuity.
* In ''Legionnaires'' #69, [[Lori Morning]] uses an H-dial that was given to her by the [[Time Trapper]] to gain superpowers, and becomes a member of [[Workforce (comics)|Workforce]]. Lori gives the H-dial to [[Brainiac 5|Brainiac 5.1]] to use against the Rift; the device is destroyed in the process. This timeline was also erased in the Legion reboot.
* In a [[One Year Later]] storyline, the H-Dial comes into the possession of [[Father Time (DC Comics)|Father Time]], who hopes to clone the device and create an entire [[army]] of "one man Justice Leagues". However the device is stolen, and Johnny Mimic (the reformed [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] villain called to act as a [[Criminal profiler|profiler]]) dupes Alan Scott into killing him while holding the device, destroying it for good.
* In ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #9 (February 2008), Robby Reed teamed up with the Metal Men, even lending the dial to Tin to allow him to transform into a more resilient superhero to defeat the monster conjured by the deranged alchemist Megistus. The dial, due to its transformative abilities, bore an optional part in Megistus' plans to draw the storm that brought about the genesis of Red Kryptonite upon Earth, warping it as to protect it from the events of the ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Dial H appeared again in issue #27 of the same series, this time in a team-up with [[Batman]]. While staying at a hotel in [[Gotham City]], Robby uses the dial to see the future however realizing that something will kill him  while using the dial he decided to let the dial be stolen by a down on his luck young man named Travers Milton. After using the Dial to transform into a [[Superman]]-esque flying hero named the Star, Travers assists Batman in defending Gotham after the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] arranges a series of violent crimes to be committed throughout the city in order to break Batman. After discovering that the final challenge for Batman is a remote-controlled bomb placed over a group of bound and gagged men and women, Travers heroically sacrifices his life by flying out into the night sky while clutching the bomb, saving Batman and the hostages seconds before it detonates. Afterwards, Batman returns the H-Dial to Robby who refused it because even though it prevents his eventual fate he didn't want to let it affect to anyone else  but Batman tells him that it gave Travers what he had always wanted; the chance to be a hero that Robby will do the same thing. There is no indication given as to where either of the "Brave & the Bold" stories fit into Robby Reed's personal timeline however.
* In ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', the H-Dial made a brief appearance when all time periods meld together. A hand can be seen barely clutching it.
* In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Robby Reed's Human Starfish form is among the superheroes that confront [[Doctor Manhattan]] on Mars.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #9. DC Comics.</ref>

As a result of discovering his power source, Robby gave up his dial and signed up for Cyborg's new Teen Titans Training program. His identities in the issue were [[Beast Boy|Changeling]] (the powers came from Beast Boy), [[Lagoon Boy]] (the powers came from [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]]), [[Jesse Quick]] (the powers came from [[Wally West|Kid Flash]]), Power Boy (the powers came from [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]]), and [[Protector (DC Comics)|Protector]] (the powers came from [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]). In ''[[Teen Titans Go]]'' #55, Robby Reed returned in a nightmare sequence of Cyborg's (caused by the villainous [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]]). In the dream after having had his H-Dial taken away, he joined the "New Teen Titans" program under the guise of Protector.
