'''''Dial H for Hero''''' is a [[comic book]] feature published by [[DC Comics]] about a magical dial that enables an ordinary person to become a [[superhero]] for one hour. 

The dial causes its possessor to become a new superhero with a name, costume and powers each time it is used. These superheroes are usually brand-new, but on occasion the dial causes its owner to become a duplicate of an existing superhero, such as [[Plastic Man]].

The original owner of the dial is Robby Reed, a teenager from Littleville, [[Colorado]], who discovers the dial in a cavern and quickly uses it to protect Littleville under the guises of numerous superheroes.

Later, two other dials are discovered by teenagers Christopher King and Victoria Grant of the [[New England]] town of Fairfax. King and Grant thus begin protecting Fairfax from any number of menaces, and eventually they even meet Robby Reed.
