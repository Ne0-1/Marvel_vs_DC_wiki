'''''Dial H for Hero''''' is a [[comic book]] feature published by [[DC Comics]] about a magical dial that enables an ordinary person to become a [[superhero]] for one hour. 

The dial causes its possessor to become a new superhero with a name, costume and powers each time it is used. These superheroes are usually brand-new, but on occasion the dial causes its owner to become a duplicate of an existing superhero, such as [[Plastic Man]].

The original owner of the dial is Robby Reed, a teenager from Littleville, [[Colorado]], who discovers the dial in a cavern and quickly uses it to protect Littleville under the guises of numerous superheroes.  This series appeared in the ''[[House of Mystery]]'' comic book in the late [[1960s]], in issues #156-173.  Robby Reed also appeared in a couple of other DC titles during this time.

Later, two other dials are discovered by teenagers Christopher King and Victoria Grant of the [[New England]] town of Fairfax. King and Grant thus begin protecting Fairfax from any number of menaces, and eventually they even meet Robby Reed, who is later revealed to be the source of the H-dials they find.  This series appeared in the ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #479-490 and ''New Adventures of Superboy'' #28-37,39-49 in the 1980s.  A big feature of this new series was the readers submitted ideas for new hero characters, which were used.  After the series, Victoria joined a cult and became a super-villain.

In the [[1990s]] series ''[[Superboy]] and the Ravers'' [[Hero Cruz (DC Comics)|Hero Cruz]] finds an H-dial in the lair of [[Scavenger (DC Comics)|Scavenger]]. Later in the series, he is attacked for it by Victoria Grant, but manages to talk her down. She was last seen in the care of the Forces, a family of metahumans.

In ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'', at around the same time, [[Lori Morning]] used an H-dial that was given to her by the [[Time Trapper]].

In the early [[2000s]] series ''H.E.R.O.'', a similar dial is found by various other people, who each gain super powers in a similar manner to Reed, King, and Grant.  Eventually, Reed appears in this series as well.
