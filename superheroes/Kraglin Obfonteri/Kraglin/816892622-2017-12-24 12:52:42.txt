He is Yondu's first mate on the Ravagers and is usually seen accompanying him more often than the other shipmates. He joined Yondu when confronting the [[Broker (comics)|Broker]] over the whereabouts of the orb that Peter Quill had stolen and then later joins the chase at [[Knowhere]] when they found him. He, along with Yondu and the Ravagers, help the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians]] battle [[Ronan the Accuser]] on the planet [[Xandar]].

Kraglin later admitted to his mistake, showing deep sorrow and remorse for setting events in motion that caused the mutineers to kill all of his friends (Yondu's loyalists) and helped Yondu, [[Rocket Raccoon]], and Baby [[Groot]] escape the mutineers and later assisted the Guardians against their fight with [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]]. He was present during Yondu's funeral in which [[Star-Lord]] gives him Yondu's signature arrow and becomes part of the Guardians of the Galaxy. In a mid-credits scene, he inadvertently hits [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] with the arrow while practicing how to use it.
