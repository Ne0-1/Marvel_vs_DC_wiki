==Fictional character biography==
Talbot was a military man who hunted [[The Incredible Hulk]] under General [[Thunderbolt Ross]].  He worked as a security chief for Ross' base and was also there to keep an eye on Bruce Banner for the Pentagon.  Talbot tried to prove that Banner was a traitor and also to win the love of [[Betty Ross]]. His romantic efforts redoubled when he discovered that Bruce was the Hulk. He succeeded and married Betty. He attempted to keep her away from Banner and the Hulk.

Then, while on a mission he was taken hostage by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]] and made a mindless husk upon his rescue.  In order to unblock his mind, [[Doc Samson|Doctor Leonard Samson]] had the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state.  However, Talbot's marriage to Betty became strained.

===Divorce===
Later, he returned to the military as a Major.  Yet he did take a leave from Gamma Base and soon divorced Betty. Talbot continued battling the Hulk and tried to have Banner court-martialed. When General Ross had a breakdown, Talbot was promoted to Colonel. His life remained relatively uneventful until the Hulk stormed into Gamma Base, looking for his deceased love [[Jarella]], who was still cryogenically frozen.  It was revealed Talbot had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the [[Microverse|Sub-Atomic universe]].  This caused his relationship with Betty to be further strained. Soon Congress cut funds from Gamma Base and Talbot decided once and for all to stop the Hulk by using the [[War Wagon (comics)|War Wagon]].

===Death and Return===

Glenn Talbot was killed fighting the Hulk in Japan while piloting the War Wagon prototype. Recently, however, he was seen alive and well, in the company of Betty Ross; the circumstances of his resurrection have yet to be revealed.<ref>"Fall of the Hulks: Gamma"</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Glenn Talbot appeared in the 1980s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' [[animated television series]] voiced by [[Pat Fraley]]. In this version Major Talbot's first name was changed from Glenn to "Ned". He was nicknamed by the troops secretly as "''Noodle-head Ned''" because of the fact that he was very clumsy, was somewhat cowardly, he sucked up to General Ross, and is often deceived by the enemy throughout the 13 episodes. 

* Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1996 UPN animated series adaptation of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' voiced by [[Kevin Schon]]. He was shown acting as the right hand man of General "Thunderbolt" Ross and also shown to have a romantic interest in Betty Ross, but she constantly rejects him because he doesn't do a good job of hiding his disdain for either Bruce Banner or the Hulk.

===Film===
* In the 2003 [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' film]], Maj. Glenn Talbot is played by [[Josh Lucas]]. In this version, he is a former military officer-turned-bioscience executiveâ€”at a company that is also a politically powerful [[Defense Department]] contractor. He is a long-lost acquaintance of Betty Ross (who knew him back when she was in college, and he was an officer under Gen. Ross' command). This Talbot is ambitious, pushy, and obsessed with making a big fortune quickly; he targets Betty and Bruce's lab for hostile takeover, if they keep refusing his offers to quit the lab in order to work for his firm. Later in the film, he becomes bent on getting a tissue sample of Hulk for military "super-soldier"-type applications. Throughout the film, his attempts to bully Banner constantly result in his being thrashed by the Hulk. Upon capturing Banner, Talbot begins the tissue extracting process, but fails when Banner manages to break free. Ross orders Talbot to come to him, in order to have a full evacuation of the underground detention center. However, Talbot ignores Ross' orders for a lockdown. Talbot is killed when he fires an explosive missile at the Hulk, and it ricochets off of the Hulk's impenetrable skin and back towards Talbot. In an earlier version of the script, Talbot (instead of [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]) becomes the Abomination and later battles the Hulk. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Video games===
* Major Glenn Talbot appears in the [[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|2008 ''The Incredible Hulk'' video game]] voiced by [[Michael Gannon]]. As in the comics, Talbot views both Banner and Hulk as threats to mankind. Later in the game, he becomes a boss, as his actions against Banner/Hulk escalate to the point where Talbot himself is a danger to civilian safety. When he is defeated, a self-destruct mechanism activates in his Hulkbuster, intending to kill Hulk along with him and the entire city. Hulk manages to toss Talbot in the air when the Hulkbuster armor explodes, killing him.
