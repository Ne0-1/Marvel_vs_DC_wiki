'''Colonel Glenn Talbot''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[antagonist]] and an armed-[[villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was a military man who hunted [[The Incredible Hulk]] under General [[Thunderbolt Ross]].  Talbot was created in 1964 and first appeared in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' as a security chief for Ross' base and to keep an eye on Bruce Banner for the Pentagon.  Talbot was trying to prove that Banner was a traitor and also winning the love of Betty Ross.  When he found out that Banner was the Hulk he tried even harder to win Betty's heart. Eventually, he did just that and married her.  Afterwards, Talbot tried to have Betty stay away from both Banner and the Hulk.

Then, while on a mission he was taken hostage by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]] and made a mindless husk upon his rescue.  In order to unblock his mind, [[Doc Samson|Doctor Leonard Samson]] had the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state.  However, Talbot's marriage to Betty became strained.

Later, he returned to the military as a Major.  Yet he did take a leave from Gamma Base and soon divorced Betty. Talbot became arch-enemy to the Hulk and he still tried to court-martial and destroy Banner. When General Ross had a breakdown, the military promoted Talbot to a Colonel. His life was then uneventful until the day the Hulk came storming to Gamma base to find his deceased love [[Jarella]] still being cryogenically frozen.  Talbot had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the Sub-Atomic universe.  This caused his relationship with Betty to be furthered strained. Soon Congress cut funds from Gamma Base and Talbot decided once and for all to stop the Hulk by using the War Wagon.  Glenn Talbot was killed fighting the Hulk in Japan while piloting the War Wagon.  Glenn's nephew Matthew "Matt" Talbot later became a Major himself and an enemy of the Hulk.

==In other media==
In the 2003 [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' film]] Glenn Talbot is played by [[Josh Lucas]]. In this version, he is a rival scientist of Banner's bent on getting a tissue sample of Hulk for military applications. As comic relief in the film, he is constantly beaten up by the Hulk, probably due to Banner's own dislike of him. He is killed near the end of the film. One critic described this characterization as making Talbot more akin to a bully from an Adam Sandler film. 

Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1980s ''Hulk'' [[animated television series]]. In this version Major Talbot's first name was changed by the to "Ned". He was nicknamed by the troops secretly as "''Noodle-head Ned''" because of the fact he wasn't bright, was somewhat cowardly, he sucked up to General Ross, and is often deceived by the enemy throughout the 13 episodes. 

Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1996 UPN animated series adaptation of the Incredible Hulk, where he was shown acting as the right hand man of General "Thunderbolt" Ross and also shown to have a romantic interest in Betty Ross, but she constantly rejects him because he doesn't do a good job of hiding his disdain for her either Bruce Banner or the Hulk.
