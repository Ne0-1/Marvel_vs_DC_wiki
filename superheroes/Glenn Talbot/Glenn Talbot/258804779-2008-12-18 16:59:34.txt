'''Major (later Colonel) Glenn Talbot''' is a [[fictional character]] and an armed [[villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Talbot was created in 1964 and first appeared in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #61. In the 2003 [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' film]], [[Josh Lucas]] portrays him. 

==Fictional character biography==
Talbot is a military man who hunted [[The Incredible Hulk]] under General [[Thunderbolt Ross]].  He works as a security chief for Ross' base and is also there to keep an eye on Bruce Banner for the Pentagon.  Talbot tries to prove that Banner is a traitor and also tries to win the love of [[Betty Ross]]. His romantic efforts redouble when he discovers that Bruce is the Hulk. He succeeds and marries Betty. He attempts to keep her away from Banner and the Hulk.

Then, while on a mission he was taken hostage by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]] and made a mindless husk upon his rescue.  In order to unblock his mind, [[Doc Samson|Doctor Leonard Samson]] has the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state.  However, Talbot's marriage to Betty became strained.

=== Divorce ===

Later, he returns to the military as a Major.  Yet he did take a leave from Gamma Base and soon divorces Betty. Talbot continues battling the Hulk and tries to have Banner court-martialed. When General Ross has a breakdown, Talbot is promoted to Colonel. His life is relatively uneventful until the Hulk storms into Gamma Base, looking for his deceased love [[Jarella]], who is still being cryogenically frozen.  It is revealed Talbot had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the [[Microverse|Sub-Atomic universe]].  This causes his relationship with Betty to be further strained. Soon Congress cut funds from Gamma Base and Talbot decides once and for all to stop the Hulk by using the [[War Wagon (comics)|War Wagon]].

Glenn Talbot is killed fighting the Hulk in Japan while piloting the War Wagon, as seen in ''Incredible Hulk'' #260. Glenn's nephew '''Matthew "Matt" Talbot''' later became a Major himself and an enemy of the Hulk. He hasn't been seen yet in any other Hulk comics, which states he may be alive, and still angry at Betty and Bruce.

His brother '''Brian Talbot''' became Grey of the [[Gamma Corps]]. In issue #4 of the titular series, it is revealed Brian hated Glenn throughout his life, as Glenn would often beat and humiliate him.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate  Marvel===
In [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, a version of Talbot appeared in [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] as '''General Talbot'''. Talbot is portrayed as a colleague and friend to [[General Ross]], and operates in the [[Baxter Building]] [[think tank]].  His full name is General Glenn M. Talbot.

==Other media==
===Television===
*Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1980s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' [[animated television series]]. In this version Major Talbot's first name was changed from Glenn to "Ned". He was nicknamed by the troops secretly as "''Noodle-head Ned''" because of the fact that he was very clumsy, was somewhat cowardly, he sucked up to General Ross, and is often deceived by the enemy throughout the 13 episodes. 

* Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1996 UPN animated series adaptation of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animatedTV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' voiced by [[Kevin Schon]]. He was shown acting as the right hand man of General "Thunderbolt" Ross and also shown to have a romantic interest in Betty Ross, but she constantly rejects him because he doesn't do a good job of hiding his disdain for her either Bruce Banner or the Hulk.

===Film===
* In the 2003 [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' film]], Maj. Glenn Talbot is played by [[Josh Lucas]]. In this version, he is a former military officer-turned-bioscience executive -- at a company that is also a politically powerful [[Defense Department]] contractor.  He is a long-lost acquaintance of Betty Ross (who knew him back when she was in college, and he was an officer under Gen. Ross' command). This Talbot is ambitious, pushy, and obsessed with making a big fortune quickly; he targets Betty and Bruce's lab for hostile takeover, if they keep refusing his offers to quit the lab in order to work for his firm. Later in the film, he becomes bent on getting a tissue sample of Hulk for military "super-soldier"-type applications. Throughout the film, his attempts to bully Banner constantly result in his being thrashed by the Hulk. Upon capturing Banner, Talbot starts the tissue-sample-getting process but fails when Banner manages to break free.  Ross orders Talbot to come to him, in order to have a full evacuation of the underground detention center.  However, Talbot ignores Ross' orders for a lockdown.  Talbot is killed  when he fires an explosive missile at the Hulk, and it ricochets off of the Hulk's impenetrable skin and back towards Talbot. In an earlier version of the script, Talbot (instead of [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]) becomes the Abomination and later battles the Hulk. {{Fact|date=June 2008}}

===Video games===
* Major Glenn Talbot appears in the [[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|2008 ''The Incredible Hulk'' video game]] voiced by [[Michael Gannon]]. As in the comics, Talbot views both Banner and Hulk as threats to mankind. Later in the game, he becomes a boss, as his actions against Banner/Hulk escalate to the point where Talbot himself is a danger to civilian safety. When he is defeated, a self-destruct mechanism actives in his Hulkbuster, intending to kill Hulk along with him. Hulk manages to toss Talbot in the air when the Hulkbuster armor explodes, killing him.
