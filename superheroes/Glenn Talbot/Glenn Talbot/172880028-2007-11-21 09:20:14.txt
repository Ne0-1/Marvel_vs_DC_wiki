'''Major (later Colonel) Glenn Talbot''' is a [[fictional character]] and an armed-[[villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  

==Fictional character biography==
Talbot was a military man who hunted [[The Incredible Hulk]] under General [[Thunderbolt Ross]].  Talbot was created in 1964 and first appeared in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' as a security chief for Ross' base and to keep an eye on Bruce Banner for the Pentagon.  Talbot was trying to prove that Banner was a traitor and also to win the love of [[Betty Ross]].  When he found out that Banner was the Hulk he tried even harder to win Betty's heart. Eventually, he did just that and married her.  Afterwards, Talbot tried to have Betty stay away from both Banner and the Hulk.

Then, while on a mission he was taken hostage by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]] and made a mindless husk upon his rescue.  In order to unblock his mind, [[Doc Samson|Doctor Leonard Samson]] had the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state.  However, Talbot's marriage to Betty became strained.

Later, he returned to the military as a Major.  Yet he did take a leave from Gamma Base and soon divorced Betty. Talbot became arch-enemy to the Hulk and he still tried to court-martial and destroy Banner. When General Ross had a breakdown, the military promoted Talbot to a Colonel. His life was then uneventful until the day the Hulk came storming to Gamma base to find his deceased love [[Jarella]] still being cryogenically frozen.  Talbot had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the [[Microverse|Sub-Atomic universe]].  This caused his relationship with Betty to be further strained. Soon Congress cut funds from Gamma Base and Talbot decided once and for all to stop the Hulk by using the [[War Wagon (comics)|War Wagon]].

Glenn Talbot was killed fighting the Hulk in Japan while piloting the War Wagon, as seen in ''Incredible Hulk'' #260. Glenn's nephew Matthew "Matt" Talbot later became a Major himself and an enemy of the Hulk.

His brother Brian Talbot became Grey of the [[Gamma Corps]].

==Other media==
===Film===
*In the 2003 [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' film]] Glenn Talbot is played by [[Josh Lucas]]. In this version, he is a rival scientist of Banner's bent on getting a tissue sample of Hulk for military applications. In the film, he is constantly beaten up by the Hulk. Upon capturing Banner, Talbot starts the process but fails when Banner manages to break free.  Ross tells Talbot to come to him in order to have a full evacuation.  However, Talbot ignores Ross' orders that he wants to have a lockdown. He is killed near the end of the film when he tried to fire an explosive shell at the Hulk, which ricocheted off the Hulk's skin and back towards Talbot.

===Television===
*Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1980s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' [[animated television series]]. In this version Major Talbot's first name was changed from Glenn to "Ned". He was nicknamed by the troops secretly as "''Noodle-head Ned''" because of the fact he wasn't bright, was somewhat cowardly, he sucked up to General Ross, and is often deceived by the enemy throughout the 13 episodes. 
*Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1996 UPN animated series adaptation of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', where he was shown acting as the right hand man of General "Thunderbolt" Ross and also shown to have a romantic interest in Betty Ross, but she constantly rejects him because he doesn't do a good job of hiding his disdain for her either Bruce Banner or the Hulk. He was voiced by [[Kevin Schon]].
