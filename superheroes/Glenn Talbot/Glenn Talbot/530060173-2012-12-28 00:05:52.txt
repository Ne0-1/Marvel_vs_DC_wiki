'''Major (later Colonel) Glenn Talbot''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was created in 1964 and first appeared in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #61. 

He was a close compatriot to General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] and an active participant in his operations to kill the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. His most significant blow was discovering and informing his superiors that Dr. Bruce Banner physically transformed into the Hulk, which made the scientist a wanted fugitive.

Talbot appeared in the 2003 film [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'']], portrayed by [[Josh Lucas]].

==Fictional character biography==
Glenn Talbot was a military man who for many years hunted The Incredible Hulk while under the command of [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]]. In addition to hunting the Hulk and being appointed head of security for Gamma Base where Ross was the commanding officer, Talbot was brought to the base for two other reasons, both of which were at the General's own behest: the first was to keep a close eye on civilian scientist [[Robert Bruce Banner]], whom Ross and Talbot suspected not only to being a traitor because of Banner's constant disappearances, which, unknown to them at first, was due to his uncontrollable transformations into the Hulk (the result of Banner's full exposure to Gamma Radiation unleashed from his Gamma Bomb after saving a teenager named [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] from the restricted test area), who prowled the area near the base, but they also both believed there was some mysterious connection between the two. The second reason was for Talbot to win the love of the General's daughter [[Betty Ross]], who was in love with Banner. General Ross, who intensely hated the slim young Banner all together, whether he was a traitor or not, objected to Betty's love for him because he felt that Banner was too timid emotionally and physically. Ross believed that Talbot, a real military man like himself, would be a much better suitor for his daughter. Talbot's romantic efforts later redoubled when he (and the rest of the world) later discovered that Banner and the Hulk were one and the same. He finally succeeded and married Betty all the while attempting to keep her away from Banner and the Hulk.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Then, while on a mission he was taken hostage by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]] and made a mindless husk upon his rescue. In order to unblock his mind, [[Doc Samson|Doctor Leonard Samson]] had the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state. The process was a success. However, Talbot's marriage to Betty later became strained.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Yet he did take a leave from Gamma Base and soon divorced Betty, who later admitted to Rick Jones that she had never stopped loving Bruce Banner. Talbot continued battling the Hulk and tried to have Banner court-martialed. When General Ross had a breakdown, Talbot was promoted to Colonel. His life remained relatively uneventful until the Hulk stormed into Gamma Base, looking for his deceased love [[Jarella]], who was still cryogenically frozen. It was revealed Talbot had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the [[Microverse|Sub-Atomic universe]]. This incident was the final straw in his already deteriorated relationship with Betty. Soon Congress cut funds from Gamma Base and Talbot decided once and for all to stop the Hulk by using the [[War Wagon (comics)|War Wagon]]. 

Glenn Talbot was killed fighting the Hulk in Japan while piloting the War Wagon prototype. <ref>The Incredible Hulk #260</ref> Recently, however, he was seen alive and well, in the company of Betty Ross; at the time, the circumstances of his apparent resurrection were not revealed.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma'' (December 2009)</ref>

As the attempted ''[[coup d'état]]'' of [[Washington, D.C.]] takes place, Major Glenn Talbot appears on national TV as part of the Intelligencia's plan to seize control - only to be revealed as an [[Life Model Decoy|L.M.D.]] himself when the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] decapitates him.<ref>''Hulk''  (vol. 2) #23</ref>

This L.M.D. was so thoroughly reprogrammed that it believed itself to be the resurrected Glenn Talbot, complete with all of Talbot's memories including his love for Betty Ross. The real Talbot is presumed to have remained dead all this time.

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Glenn Talbot returns from the dead after what happened to the death realms.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #619</ref>

When Cable returns from a possible future and starts taking out Avengers, he first believes the Red Hulk to be "Talbot" until realizing it is Thunderbolt Ross who quotes that he is someone that Cable hasn't fought.<ref>''Avengers: X-Sanction'' #3</ref> Also in A+X issue 1, future versions of Wolverine and Hulk (resembling Maestro and Old Man Logan) speak to the President of the United States who resembles a Red Hulk with Talbot's mustache.<ref>''A+X'' #1</ref>

==Family==
Since his "death" two of Glenn's relatives have also appeared.

* Glenn Talbot has a younger brother named Brian Talbot who was a member of the [[Gamma Corps]] as Grey (who sports the DNA of Hulk and Leader). Trained in martial arts. The Leader DNA doesn't make Grey as smart as Prodigy but he's a brilliant military strategist and it seems to have been meant as a way to prevent him from losing control. Brian was often bullied and beaten by his older brother and had actually been delighted to hear of his death. He claimed he joined the Gamma Corps because the Hulk was dangerous but really it was to do what Glenn couldn't....destroy the Hulk.

* Glenn Talbot also has a nephew named Matt Talbot who was also a military man.

During ''Avengers: X-Sanction'', [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] initially mistook the Red Hulk for a foe of his from the future named 'Talbot', suggesting that one of Talbot's relatives will become another Hulk at some future date.

* Glenn Talbot also appeared in the 1996 UPN animated series adaptation of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' voiced by [[Kevin Schon]]. He was shown acting as the right hand man of General "Thunderbolt" Ross. He is also shown to have a romantic interest in Betty Ross, but she constantly rejects him because he doesn't do a good job of hiding his disdain for either Bruce Banner or the Hulk.

===Film===
* In the 2003 [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' film]], Maj. Glenn Talbot is played by [[Josh Lucas]]. In this version, he is a former military officer-turned-bioscience executive—at a company that is also a politically powerful [[Defense Department]] contractor. He is a long-lost acquaintance of Betty Ross (who knew him back when she was in college, and he was an officer under Gen. Ross' command). This Talbot is ambitious, pushy, and obsessed with making a big fortune quickly; he targets Betty and Bruce's lab for hostile takeover, if they keep refusing his offers to quit the lab in order to work for his firm. Later in the film, he becomes bent on getting a tissue sample of Hulk for military "super-soldier"-type applications. Throughout the film, his attempts to bully Banner constantly result in his being thrashed by the Hulk. Upon capturing Banner, Talbot begins the tissue extracting process, but fails when Banner manages to break free. Ross orders Talbot to come to him, in order to have a full evacuation of the underground detention center. However, Talbot ignores Ross' orders for a lockdown. Talbot is killed when he fires an explosive missile at the Hulk, and it ricochets off of the Hulk's impenetrable skin and back towards Talbot. In an earlier version of the script, Talbot (instead of [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]) becomes the Abomination and later battles the Hulk. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Video games===
* Major Glenn Talbot appears in the 2008 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' video game voiced by [[Michael Gannon]]. As in the comics, Talbot views both Banner and Hulk as threats to mankind. Later in the game, he becomes a boss, as his actions against Banner/Hulk escalate to the point where Talbot himself is a danger to civilian safety, his strategies varying from attempting launch missiles in a civlian area to destroy the Hulk to donning a nuclear-powered Hulkbuster suit to fight him directly, intending to pass off civilian casualties as the Hulk's fault once his foe has been dealt with. When he is defeated, a self-destruct mechanism activates in his Hulkbuster, intending to kill Hulk along with him and the entire city. Hulk throws Talbot's suit into the upper atmosphere, then his Hulkbuster armor explodes safely, killing Talbot.
