==Fictional character biography==
Scribe, an [[albino]] mutant, was a member of the Inner Circle of the [[London]] [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. With a special device she would record everything that is said in the Inner Circle’s meetings. Scribe was merged with and possessed by the mutant bodystealer known as [[Mountjoy (comics)|Mountjoy]]. When [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]] became the Black Bishop, the Mountjoy-possessed Scribe confided in him. She told Brian that the Inner Circle knew he used to be Captain Britain and she needed his help. She told Brian about the Inner Circle’s plot to use a demon under London to control the city’s population. When Brian became Captain Britain and confronted the Black Queen [[Ms. Steed|Miss Emma Steed]], Mountjoy revealed himself from Scribe and attacked him. Captain Britain defeated the London Inner Circle, and Scribe, Mountjoy and the others were put in jail.

Scribe, who was still possessed by Mountjoy, was later bailed out of jail by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]. Scribe was taken to Liberty Island to participate in a duel against [[Madelyne Pryor]].
