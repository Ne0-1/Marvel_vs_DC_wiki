Based on the [[Ymir|frost giant of the same name]] from [[Norse mythology]], '''Ymir''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[publications]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #97 (October 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
The character Ymir first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', and considers all other forms of life — with the exception of his kin the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]] of Niffelheim — to be aberrations that must be destroyed. He was among the first Asgardian creatures to be created and spawned the Asgardian gods. The next story depicts an early battle with and subsequent imprisonment by being lured into a trap and imprisoned in a ring of magical fire by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], King of the [[Norse gods]] while attempting to bring eternal winter to Asgard with the other giants.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #97 - 98 (Oct. - Nov. 1963)</ref> Ymir is mentioned in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' in a story set in the [[prehistoric]] [[Hyborian Age]]. [[Barbarian]] hero [[Conan (comics)|Conan]] encounters his daughter, Atali, and slays two of her brutish brothers.<ref>''Savage Tales'' #1 (May 1971). An adaption of the [[Robert Ervin Howard|Robert E. Howard]] short story [[The Frost Giant's Daughter]], first published in ''Weird Tales'' (1932).</ref>

Ymir reappears in a two-part storyline in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Strange]]'' being summoned to Earth with the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] by the cult the [[Sons of Satannish]]. The pair are defeated and banished when the heroes trick the two into fighting one another due to Strange.<ref>''''Avengers'' #61 (Feb. 1969) & ''Doctor Strange'' #177 (Feb. 1969)</ref> Ymir and Surtur reappear in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', and invade the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Both characters, however, are defeated when God of Thunder ''Thor'' uses the ''Odinpower'' to banish the pair to the other-dimensional ''Sea of Eternal Night''.<ref>''Thor'' #425 (Oct. 1990)</ref> Ymir reappears in the publication ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes]]'', and with the Frost and Storm Giants launches attack on Asgard. On this occasion the character and his allies are stopped by Thor and his half-brother, [[Vidar (Marvel Comics)|Vidar]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 3, #5 (Apr. 1991)</ref>

Ymir appears in an issue of the [[limited series]] ''[[X-Men: First Class (comic series)|X-Men: First Class]]'', which is set during the early days of the modern Marvel universe. The original [[X-Men]] encounter a group called the "Sons of the Vanir" who summon Ymir to Earth. After a brief battle Thor uses his mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] to return Ymir to Niffelheim.<ref>''X-Men: First Class'' #5 (Mar. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ymir is a huge ice giant over 1,000 feet (330 m) tall and possesses immense strength and durability greater than most other giants. Ymir is one of the few beings whose power makes him capable of battling [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] and [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] to a standstill. The character can generate intense, deadly cold and regenerate from as little as a particle of ice. Ymir also carries a huge icicle which functions as a club. The character is an ancient being devoted to destruction and little else.
