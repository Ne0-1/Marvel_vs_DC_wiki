Based on the frost giant [[Ymir]] from [[norse mythology]], '''Ymir''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Journey Into Mystery]]'' #97 (Oct 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] & [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Formed shortly after the creation of the Earth, <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #97 - 98 (Oct. - Nov. 1963)</ref> Ymir considers all other forms of life - with the exception of his kin the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]] - to be abhorations that must be destroyed. Chronologically, Ymir is first mentioned in the [[Hyborian Age]] by his apparent daughter, Atali, who together with two of her Frost Giant brothers have an encounter with the barbarian hero [[Conan (comics)|Conan]]. <ref>''Savage Tales'' #1 (May 1971). This was an adaption of the [[Robert Ervin Howard|Robert E. Howard]] short story [[The Frost Giant's Daughter]], first published in ''Weird Tales'' (1932).</ref> 

Thousands of years later, Ymir is summoned back to Earth by a human cult called the Sons of Vanir, and briefly battles the original [[X-Men]] before being banished by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. <ref>''X-Men:First Class'' #5 (March 2007)</ref> Another cult, the [[Sons of Satannish]] briefly summon Ymir - together with fire demon [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]] -before being banished again by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]]. <ref>''Avengers''#61 (Feb. 1969)</ref> Alongside arch-rival Surtur, Ymir later invades Asgard, but is defeated when Thor, wielding the Odin Power, banishes the pair to the Sea of Eternal Night. <ref>''Thor'' #425 (Oct. 1990)</ref>

Despite the final [[Ragnarok]] <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 2004)</ref> and the eventual return of the Norse Gods, <ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2007)</ref> Ymir has yet to return from exile.

==Powers and abilities==
Ymir is a huge ice giant over 1,000 feet tall, and possessing strength and durability exceeding even that of Thor. He has the ability to generate intense, deadly cold and regenerate from as little as a particle of ice. Ymir also carries a huge icicle which functions as a club. Ymir is an ancient being whose thinking is rather limited: his energies are devoted to destruction and little else. 

==Other versions==
===Ultimates===
Together with Surtur, Ymir briefly battles the [[Ultimates]]. <ref>''Ultimates'' vol. 2, #13 (May 2007)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ymir appeared in an episode of ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].

===Video games===
* Ymir appears as a villain in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Paul Eiding]].
