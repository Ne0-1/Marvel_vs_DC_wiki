'''Ymir''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Based on the frost giant [[Ymir]] of [[Norse mythology]], the character is a perennial foe of the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Formed at the beginning of creation, Ymir considers all other forms of life &mdash; with the exception of his kin the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]] &mdash; to be abhorations that must be destroyed. Ymir's actual history in the Marvel universe is complicated by the fact that the mythical [[Hyborian Age]] &mdash; in which the adventures of the barbarian [[Conan (comics)|Conan]] are set &mdash; forms part of the history of [[Earth-616]]. During this time, Ymir is worshipped by proto-Vikings called the [[Ã†sir|Aesir]] and [[Vanir]], who live to the north of a realm called [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmeria]]. In the [[Robert Ervin Howard|Robert E. Howard]] short story [[The Frost Giant's Daughter]], Conan has an encounter with a female called Atali and her two brothers, who are apparently the children of Ymir.<ref>''Savage Tales'' vol. 1, #1</ref> 

Thousands of years later the [[Sons of Satannish]] briefly call Ymir &mdash; and [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]] &mdash; to Earth, before they are banished again by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #61</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The [[Marvel Universe]] version appears as a gigantic being composed of ice and is over 1,000 feet tall. Ymir possesess strength and durability exceeding even that of the Asgardian Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He also has the ability to generate intense, deadly cold and regeneration from as little as a particle of ice. Ymir also carries a huge icicle which functions as a club. Ymir is an ancient being whose thinking is rather limited: his energies are devoted to destruction and little else. This may in fact be Ymir's Achilles Heel, and the reason why [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and his two brother gods, Ville and Ve, are able to first defeat him.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #97</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Ymir===
Ymir makes a cameo in appearance in the Ultimate universe, fighting the Ultimates alongside the fire demon [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]]. <ref>''[[Ultimates]]'' vol. 2, #13</ref>
