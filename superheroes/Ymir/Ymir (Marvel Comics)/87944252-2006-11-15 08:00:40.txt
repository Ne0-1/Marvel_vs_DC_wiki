'''Ymir''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] monster and is based on the frost giant [[Ymir]] of [[Norse mythology]]. 

==Fictional character biography==

Formed at the beginning of creation, Ymir considers all other forms of life - with the exception of his kin the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]] - to be aberrations that must be destroyed. Ymir's actual history in the Marvel universe is complicated by the fact that the mythical [[Hyborian Age]] - in which the adventures of [[Conan (comics)|Conan]] are set - formed part of this Earth's history. During this time Ymir was worshipped by proto-Vikings called the [[Ã†sir|Aesir]] and [[Vanir]], who lived to the north of [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmeria]]. In the [[Robert Ervin Howard|Robert E. Howard]] short story [[The Frost Giant's Daughter]], Conan had an encounter with a female called Atali and her two brothers, who were apparently the children of Ymir.<ref>Savage Tales Vol. 1, #1</ref> 

Thousands of years later the Sons of [[Satannish]] would call Ymir - and [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]] - to Earth.<ref>Avengers Vol. 1, #61</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

The [[Marvel Comics]] version appears as a gigantic being composed of ice and is over 1,000 feet tall. Ymir possesess strength and durability exceeding even [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s. He also the ability to generate intense, deadly cold and regeneration from as little as a particle of ice. Ymir also carries a huge icicle which functions as a club. Ymir is an ancient being whose thinking is rather limited: his energies are devoted to destruction and little else. This may in fact be Ymir's Achilles Heel, and the reason why [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and his two brother gods, Ville and Ve, were able to defeat him.<ref>[[Journey Into Mystery]] Vol. 1, #97</ref>
