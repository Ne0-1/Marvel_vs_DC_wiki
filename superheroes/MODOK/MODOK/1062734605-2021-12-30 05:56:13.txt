'''MODOK''' (also written as '''M.O.D.O.K.'''; an [[acronym]] for '''M'''ental/'''M'''obile/'''M'''echanized '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing) is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The first MODOK is '''George Tarleton''', a former employee of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.), an arms dealing organization specializing in futuristic weaponry, who undergoes substantial [[mutagen]]ic medical experimentation originally designed to increase his intelligence. While successful, the experiments result in him developing a freakishly overdeveloped head and a stunted body, causing the character's signature look and use of a hoverchair for mobility. After the experiments, he kills his creators and takes control of A.I.M. Following Tarleton being split from MODOK, the new independent being dubs himself '''MODOK Superior''', becoming the [[archenemy]] of [[Gwenpool|Gwen Poole]]. Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], MODOK has appeared in over four decades of Marvel continuity, and starred in the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up|Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11]]'' #1–5 (Sept.–Dec. [[2008 in comics|2008]]), the self-titled [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue ''MODOK: Reign Delay'' #1 (Nov. [[2009 in comics|2009]]) and the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''MODOK: Head Games'' (Dec. [[2020 in comics|2020]]–Apr. [[2021 in comics|2021]]), released as promotion for the self-titled [[animated series]] [[M.O.D.O.K. (TV series)|''M.O.D.O.K.'']] (2021), in which MODOK is voiced by [[Patton Oswalt]].

Several incarnations of MODOK have appeared in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]]: '''Anton Ivanov / The Superior''', an arms dealer-turned series of [[Life Model Decoy|'''L'''ife-'''MO'''del '''D'''ecoys '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing]] ('''L-MODOKs''') portrayed by [[Zach McGowan]] in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth]] and [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth seasons]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' (2017–2018); and '''Ernest Vigman''', a municipal employee portrayed by [[Keith David]] in [[New Warriors (TV pilot)|''New Warriors'']] (2018).

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked MODOK as #100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/100.html |title=Top 100 Villains: #100 |publisher=IGN.com |access-date=February 22, 2013}}</ref>

==Publication history==
MODOK first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #93–94 (Sept.–Oct. 1967), and became a recurring foe for the [[superhero]] [[Captain America]], where he was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=245}}</ref> Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated "Inevitably, he (MODOK) returned to plague Captain America, whose physical perfection he so resented."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

MODOK reappeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #112 (April 1969), 120 (Dec. 1969) and 133 (Jan. 1971). The character also featured in a storyline in ''Sub-Mariner'' #49 (May 1972), before becoming the major villain in an extended storyline in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #167–170 (Sept.–Dec. 1973). MODOK also participated in "The War of the Super-Villains" storyline in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #74–75 (May–June 1975).

MODOK had a series of encounters with the superheroine [[Ms. Marvel]] in ''Ms. Marvel'' #5 (May 1977), 7 (July 1977) and 9-10 (Sept.–Oct. 1977). Constant battles against the Marvel heroes followed, including ''Iron Man'' Annual #4 (Dec. 1977); ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #104 (April 1981) and ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #81–82 (Nov.–Dec. 1981). Following a failed bid to use fellow Hulk foe the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] to achieve his ends in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #287–290 (Sept.–Dec. 1983), MODOK is assassinated in ''Captain America'' #313 (Jan. 1986). The character's body makes a ghoulish return in ''Iron Man'' #205 (April 1986).

During the ''Taking A.I.M.'' storyline in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #386–387 (May–June 1995), ''Captain America'' #440 (June 1995), ''The Avengers'' #388 (July 1995) and ''Captain America'' #441 (July 1995), MODOK is resurrected. More typical attempts to better the character's situation followed in ''Iron Man/Captain America'' Annual 1998; ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' vol. 2 #9–10 (Nov.–Dec. 2001); ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #142–143 (Sept.– Oct. 1999); ''Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]'' #9 (Jan. 2005) and ''Cable & Deadpool'' #11 (March 2005).

The character then made three humorous appearances, in ''Wha...Huh?'' #1 (Sept. 2005); ''Marvel Holiday Special 2006'' (Jan. 2007) and ''GLA-Xmas Special'' #1 (Feb. 2006). After appearing briefly in the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] titles ''X-Men'' #200 (Aug. 2007) and ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #488 (Sept. 2007), MODOK was featured in ''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #14–17 (June–Sept. 2007) and appeared in two miniseries: ''[[Marvel 1985]]'' #1–6 (July–Dec. 2008) and ''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1–5 (Aug.–Dec. 2008).

MODOK later gained a counterpart and successor in MODOK Superior, who first appeared in ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #29 and was created by [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] and Gabriel Hardman, who is depicted as the archenemy of [[Gwenpool|Gwendolyn "Gwen" Poole]] in ''The [[Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #1–25 and 0 (June 2016–April 2018), ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' vol. 3 #4 (Feb. 2019), and ''MODOK: Head Games'' (Dec. 2020).

==Fictional character biography==
===George Tarleton===
'''George Tarleton''' was a [[technician]] for the criminal organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.), founded by his father Alvin.<ref name="Head Games">''[[M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games]]'' #3–4 (Feb.–April 2021)</ref> He was born in [[Bangor, Maine]]. Having recently created the [[Cosmic Cube]], the A.I.M. scientists used advanced [[mutagen]]ics to alter Tarleton and created the super-intelligent man-mind '''MODOC''' (an acronym for '''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''C'''omputing) to study and improve upon the object, alongside the JOD1E program.<ref name="Head Games" /> MODOC, however, becomes ambitious, kills his creators and takes control of A.I.M.. Renaming himself '''MODOK''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing), he comes into conflict with the hero [[Captain America]], who is intent on rescuing [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]] from A.I.M.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #93–94 (Sept.–Oct. 1967)</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The Legion of Regrettable Supervillains: Oddball Criminals from Comic Book History |date=2017 |publisher=Quirk Books |isbn=978-1594749322 |pages=178–179}}</ref>

MODOK becomes a recurring foe for Captain America, battling the hero on three more occasions, with the last encounter revealing the villain's origin.<ref>''Captain America'' #112 (April 1969), 120 (Dec. 1969) and 133 (Jan. 1971)</ref> MODOK also battles [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Doctor Doom]], the latter intent on claiming the Cosmic Cube.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #49 (May 1972)</ref>

MODOK reappears and abducts [[Betty Ross]], changing her into the [[Betty Ross#Becoming the Harpy|Harpy]] with gamma radiation at a higher level than that which turned Dr. Robert Bruce Banner into the [[Hulk]] in a bid to destroy the monster. MODOK then follows the Hulk and the Harpy to a floating [[wikt:eyrie|aerie]], where Banner cures Ross of her condition. MODOK and a team of A.I.M. agents arrive in time to kill the creature known as the [[Bi-Beast]], the guardian of the aerie, but not before activating a [[self-destruct]] mechanism, forcing everyone on board to flee.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #167–170 (Sept.–Dec. 1973)</ref> MODOK also accepts the offer of the extra-dimensional mystic the [[Black Lama]] to participate in the latter's War of the Super-Villains,<ref>Chronicled in ''Iron Man'' #68-72 (Dec. 1974–March 1975), 74-75 (May–June 1975), 77 (Aug. 1975) and 80-81 (Nov.–Dec. 1975). The remaining issues - #73 (April 1975), 76 (July 1975), 78 (Sept. 1975) and 79 (Oct. 1975) - are all separate one-issue Iron Man stories that are entirely unconnected to the main storyline.</ref> but fails to gain the prize - a golden globe that is supposed to give the winner of the war ultimate power - after being defeated by [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #74–75 (May–June 1975)</ref>

A.I.M. becomes dissatisfied with the lack of scientific advancement under MODOK's leadership and MODOK's obsession with seeking revenge against [[Metahuman#Marvel Comics|metahuman]]s, ousting him from power as a result. MODOK attempts to regain control of the organization and prove his worth by unleashing a [[nerve agent]] on [[New York City]], which is prevented by [[Ms. Marvel]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #5 (May 1977)</ref> MODOK seeks revenge against Ms. Marvel, first attempting to [[Brainwashing|mentally control]] the heroine<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #7 (July 1977)</ref> and then hiring the [[Shi'ar]] assassin [[Deathbird]] to kill her;<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #9 (Sept. 1977)</ref> Ms. Marvel overcomes both of these obstacles and defeats both Deathbird and MODOK.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #10 (Oct. 1977)</ref>

MODOK's ambitions grow and he seeks world domination, but is thwarted by Iron Man and the superhero team the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]].<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #4 (1977)</ref> After an attempt to plunder the resources of the [[Savage Land]] and a battle with [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] and the Hulk,<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #104 (April 1981)</ref> the character develops a new [[biological agent]] called Virus X. MODOK's attempts to test the agent on the [[Homelessness|homeless]] is prevented by the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]], the Sub-Mariner and Captain America, although the villain escapes and the Thing almost dies when exposed to the virus.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #81–82 (Nov.–Dec. 1981)</ref>

Abandoned by A.I.M. for these failures, the character revives long-time Hulk foe the [[Abomination (character)|Abomination]], planning to use the monster against his superiors. The plan fails when the Abomination is revealed to be mentally unstable, although during the course of the storyline MODOK transforms [[Kate Waynesboro|Dr. Katherine "Kate" Waynesboro]] (an associate of Bruce Banner) into Ms. MODOK, a female counterpart (the first) of himself. Horrified by MODOK's callous disregard for life, Waynesboro demands to be restored to human form and MODOK willingly complies.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #287–290 (Sept.–Dec. 1983)</ref> Wishing to disassociate themselves from MODOK for good, A.I.M. hires the [[Serpent Society]] to assassinate the villain. They succeed, with [[Death Adder (character)|Death Adder]] striking the killing blow.<ref>''Captain America'' #313 (Jan. 1986)</ref> The Serpent Society returns MODOK's body to A.I.M., with the organization using it as a [[supercomputer]]. A rogue A.I.M. agent remotely operates MODOK's body in a bid to destroy Iron Man, with the battle ending with the body's destruction.<ref>''Iron Man'' #205 (April 1986)</ref>

Although MODOK had died, A.I.M. temporarily replaced him with his more loyal, and in some ways more effective, second female counterpart [[MODAM]].<ref>''Quasar'' #9</ref>

During the ''Taking A.I.M.'' storyline, MODOK is resurrected because A.I.M. needs him to assist with the creation of another Cosmic Cube. In one of the attempts to create the Cube, MODAM is killed (or at least disappears). Eventually MODOK is stranded in an alternate dimension, but manages to return with the unintended help of the supervillain team the [[Headmen]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #386–387 (May–June 1995), ''Captain America'' #440 (June 1995), ''The Avengers'' #388 (July 1995) and ''Captain America'' #441 (July 1995)</ref> After attempting to steal a device that boosts mental power,<ref>''Iron Man/Captain America'' Annual 1998</ref> MODOK agrees to aid the Headmen in their plans of conquest, but after taking control of A.I.M. once again, he reneges on the agreement in order to avoid an encounter with the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''The Defenders'' (vol. 2) #9–10 (Nov.–Dec. 2001)</ref> MODOK next clashes with the [[Canada|Canadian]] superhero team [[Alpha Flight]]<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #142–143 (Sept.–Oct. 1999)</ref> before being captured by a group composed of [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|U.S. Naval intelligence]] and a [[drug cartel]]. MODOK is [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]] and employed to infiltrate [[spy satellite]]s and manipulate the [[stock market]], but he recovers and exploits the situation until captured and taken into custody by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>''Captain America & the Falcon'' #9 (Jan. 2005)</ref>

In ''GLX-Mas Special'' #1, MODOK and A.I.M. fought [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and his [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squad, but were defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and her [[squirrel]] sidekick Tippy-Toe.<ref>''GLX-Mas Special'' #1</ref>

MODOK then seeks a sample of the [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] species the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]],<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #11 (March 2005)</ref> and after brief encounters with the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhero team the [[X-Men]],<ref>''X-Men'' #200 (Aug. 2007) and ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #488 (Sept. 2007)</ref> battles Ms. Marvel once again, the heroine aided by fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Wonder Man]] during an elaborate scheme by renegade A.I.M. branches to kill MODOK, with one of the rogues being MODOK's long-lost son, who seeks revenge for his abandonment.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #14–17 (June–Sept. 2007)</ref>

Employing an elaborate scheme and [[wikt:double-cross|double-cross]], MODOK restores his personal wealth and power and re-establishes himself as the leader of A.I.M. once again.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=124}}</ref><ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1–5 (Aug.–Dec. 2008)</ref>

It is also revealed that MODOK was involved in the creation of both the [[Thunderbolt Ross#Red Hulk|Red Hulk]] and the [[Betty Ross#Becoming the Red She-Hulk|Red She-Hulk]] and belongs to the Intelligencia, a secret organization of genius-level supervillains.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #600 (Sept. 2009)</ref>

MODOK was seen in [[Puerto Rico]] attempting to create an army of genetically enhanced monkeys called A.I.Monkeys to eliminate the recession in A.I.M., until he was defeated by [[Mister Fantastic]], the [[Invisible Woman]] and the rookie Puerto Rican hero known as El Vejigante.<ref>''Fantastic Four in Ataque del M.O.D.O.K.'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Fall of the Hulks]]'' storyline, it is revealed that MODOK is a member of the Intelligencia, who had a part in the creation of both the Red Hulk and the Red She-Hulk.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha''</ref> They captured some of the smartest men and brought about the events that would lead up to the ''[[World War Hulks]]'' storyline.

When several heroes are subjected by the Intelligencia to the Cathexis ray, which can transfer [[radiant energy]] from one subject to another, [[Amadeus Cho]] is affected as well. Unlike the others, who become "Hulked-Out Heroes", his mind expands and becomes so powerful that he gains the ability to warp reality within a 10-foot radius. Using this power, he reverses the process that created MODOK, turning him back into George Tarleton, who knows no better than to get away as quickly as possible.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #610</ref>

George Tarleton was taken into custody by the U.S. military and remains confined, where Bruce Banner occasionally calls on him to help defuse the "doomsday plans" that MODOK installed in the possibility that his master plan should fail. However, Tarleton appears to remember next to nothing of his former life as MODOK and, in fact, seems to be either traumatized or just an ordinary man again.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #28</ref>

===MODOK Superior===
Unknown to everyone, the doomsday plans left behind by MODOK actually serve as a distraction. The plans themselves are coordinated by a 'cluster' of brains, cloned from MODOK's own, who act as one non-sentient [[supercomputer]]. This cluster is destroyed by the Red Hulk and the doomsday plans are stopped. However, one of the cloned brains, rather than being utilized as an organic computer, is allowed to develop naturally and then uploaded with MODOK's mind. This new MODOK (who has the appearance, genius-level intelligence and mental powers of the original MODOK, but apparently ''none'' of his weaknesses) calls himself '''MODOK Superior''' and prepares to make his ''own'' mark on the world.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #29</ref>

Cooperating with the Intelligencia once again, MODOK Superior and the Intelligencia attempt to study the body of a [[Spaceknights|Spaceknight]], which had crashed on Earth for unknown reasons. When the Avengers attempt to stop them, the body is revealed to be the latest vessel for the consciousness of Ultron. In the battle with the Avengers, MODOK Superior takes on Thor, claiming he has the power of a god - and being immediately struck down.<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 4) #12.1</ref>

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, MODOK Superior reviews the attacks by Skadi and tells his followers that she is actually the [[Red Skull]]'s daughter [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]], who has tapped into the powers of the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]]. He then views from his surveillance that the Red Hulk is fighting the Thing (in the form of Angrir: Breaker of Souls). When he learns that Zero/One and the Black Fog are also after the Red Hulk, MODOK Superior plans to get to the Red Hulk first.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #37</ref> MODOK Superior prevents the Black Fog from killing the Red Hulk. MODOK Superior becomes intangible to keep himself from getting attacked by Angrir (who shoots down Zero/One's Helicarrier). MODOK Superior has his encounter with Zero/One and both of them declare a truce to help fight the soldiers of the Serpent. During that time, MODOK Superior starts to develop a crush on Zero/One.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #38</ref>

In the prologue to the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, MODOK Superior targets an ex-A.I.M. scientist named Dr. Udaku who was being escorted to the Pentagon by Wakandan forces. Before MODOK Superior could burn Dr. Udaku, the [[Scarlet Witch]] arrives and fights MODOK Superior, while smaller MODOK pawns surround the Scarlet Witch. In the nick of time, [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] arrive and help to defeat MODOK Superior and A.I.M.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0</ref>

MODOK Superior and some rogue A.I.M. Agents joined up with S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to make a deal to take down [[Andrew Forson]] (the then-current leader of A.I.M.).<ref>''Secret Avengers'' (vol. 2) #12</ref>

====Agents of MODOK====
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gwen Poole And MODOK Superior.jpeg|thumb|right|MODOK Superior sulking with his [[personal assistant|personal]] [[Assassination|assassin]] and future [[archenemy]] [[Gwenpool|Gwen Poole]], from ''The [[Unbelievable Gwenpool]]'' #3 (June [[2016 in comics|2016]]).|256px]] -->
After a brief retirement, MODOK Superior returned and opened up a group of assassins called the Agents of MODOK ('''M'''ercenary '''O'''rganization '''D'''edicated '''O'''nly to '''K'''illing) where they killed evil people. However, he made the mistake of recruiting [[Gwenpool|Gwen Poole]] when she killed his top assassin and took credit for his kills.<ref>''Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #2</ref> When he found she was not a superhuman and had no special training, he attempted to eliminate her, but she turned on him and sent him into space with an injured eye and damaged equipment.<ref>''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #4</ref> She then took over his agency for a brief time, but when her plans defeated a group of alien arms dealers and did not get them any money (having turned the client, an old [[Doombot]] who escaped from a fight in the past with Squirrel Girl, against them) the agency was disbanded and everyone went their separate ways.<ref>''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #10</ref> After reuniting, the agency faces off against MODOK Superior when he returns from space, who elects to flee rather than fight.<ref>''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #25</ref>

MODOK Superior and a group of A.I.M. members attacked a HYDRA airship to capture Shiklah, who was in its custody. [[Deadpool]] saved her, and stole MODOK Superior's chair.<ref>''Deadpool: The Gauntlet Infinite Comic'' #7</ref> MODOK Superior was taken to the hospital, where he vowed vengeance on Deadpool for stealing his chair.<ref>''Deadpool: The Gauntlet Infinite Comic'' #8</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, MODOK Superior appears as a member of the Army of Evil and took part in the attack on Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill during "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]."<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0</ref>

MODOK Superior resurfaced in a new form during a confrontation with the newest incarnation of the [[West Coast Avengers]] (of which Gwen is a member), appearing as an attractive, long-haired man, calling himself '''BRODOK''' ('''B'''io-'''R'''obotic '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''verwhelmingly for '''K'''issing) and insisting that he was now reformed.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> The team eventually exposed his scheme to turn various citizens of [[Los Angeles]] into giant mindless monsters<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' (vol. 3) #3</ref> and defeated him, reverting him back to his traditional appearance.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' (vol. 3) #4</ref>

During the "Iron Man 2020" story arc, the War Machine was about to be experimented on by some Deathloks on Lingares when he is saved by someone. When the War Machine catches up to the rest of Force Works and gives them their equipment, they discover that his rescuer is MODOK Superior. He states that he wants to add his brainpower to Force Works as its newest member.<ref>''2020 Force Works'' #2</ref> It turns out that MODOK Superior was the one behind the Deathloks of Lingares and manipulated Force Works into taking out Ultimo's head so that he can take control of it and ultimately become '''Ulti-MODOK'''. After the bearded Deathlok was beheaded by the [[U.S. Agent]], the War Machine temporarily turned into a Deathlok to control the remaining Deathloks into fighting Ulti-MODOK. When Quake briefly opened a lava-filled chasm, Ulti-MODOK fell into it, with the Deathloks following him down into it as well.<ref>''2020 Force Works'' #3</ref>

====Family life====
In the ''[[M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games]]'' storyline, MODOK Superior begins to have vivid hallucinations of a family life with a human wife and son, named Jodie and Lou, and a similarly robot daughter named Melissa. Believing that he is malfunctioning, and threatened with his life by [[Monica Rappaccini]] and the rest of A.I.M., MODOK Superior sets out to "fix" himself. After being briefly killed and resurrected by Gwen, his search for answers leads him to his childhood home where he is reunited with his father, and A.I.M.'s true founder, Alvin Tarleton. Alvin reveals that he forced his son George to undergo the process of becoming the original MODOK against his will as contrary to his origin, George was a rather inept employee at A.I.M. His wife Jodie was a manifestation of a program, called JOD1E, that was meant to sequester him. Now empowered with the knowledge of his true upbringing, MODOK Superior traps his father's consciousness into his phone and uses the bodies of leftover Super-Adaptoids to create solidified and weaponized versions of his imaginary family.<ref>''M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games'' #1-4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
George Tarleton was subjected to a mutagenic process that transformed him into MODOK and granted him [[superhuman]] intelligence, sacrificing his body for the world's largest brain. He possessed enhanced intuition, pattern solving, information storage and retrieval, and logical and philosophical structuring. MODOK's ability to predict probable outcomes of tactical and strategic scenarios was so advanced that it bordered on [[precognition]]. His intuition was heightened to the degree that his hunches were almost always correct. MODOK had a perfect memory with the ability to recall every moment. However, his creativity remains at an average human level.

Courtesy of A.I.M. technology, MODOK wore a headband that enables him to focus his mental power into devastating energy beams. He also has [[Psionics|psionic]] powers enabling him to contact others through telepathy, mentally control individuals or large groups, and generate [[Force shield|force field]]s strong enough to withstand minor nuclear explosions. A side effect of the mutation was the growth of Tarleton's head to the point whereby his body could no longer support its weight, needing to rely on an [[exoskeleton]] and a [[Hovercar|hoverchair]] called the Doomsday Chair for movement. The Doomsday Chair was also equipped with destructive weapons, including missiles and [[laser]]s.

Occasionally, Tarleton had the use of a giant humanoid robot body that was proportionally sized to fit his head and body.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #167–169 (September–November 1973) and ''Iron Man'' #74–75 (May–June 1975)</ref> Tarleton's organs also wore out quickly, necessitating the use of harvested clones, whose organs were used to sustain him.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk'' #1 (March 2010)</ref> As the leader of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], MODOK had advanced technology, vast resources, and a personal army at his disposal.

MODOK Superior has the same appearance, genius-level intelligence and mental powers as the original MODOK, but apparently ''none'' of his weaknesses.

==Other versions==
===''Marvel Adventures''===
A version called "MODOC" ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''C'''onquest) appears in the title ''[[Marvel Adventures: The Avengers]]'', briefly turning the Avengers into (superior) versions of itself before being defeated.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: The Avengers'' #9 (March 2007)</ref>

===''Ms. Marvel''===
Over the course of her two series, [[Carol Danvers]] ([[Ms. Marvel#Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]) had several interactions with A.I.M. and MODOK; among others, she was both saved from being disincorporated by 24 embryonic MODOCs who had been outfitted with reality-altering powers when working in unison and separated into two separate entities to fulfill her fondest wish.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #45</ref> Also, reference was made, by A.I.M. personnel, to many actual MODOCs who, apparently, really ''did'' function in the way that MODOK was originally supposed to have done (namely, as docile organic supercomputers).<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #39</ref>

===MODOT===
'''MODOT''' ('''M'''obile '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''T'''alking), formerly [[Nobel Prize]] hopeful '''Dimitri Smirkov''', appears in the third ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' miniseries and, unlike his predecessor MODOK, can walk without the aid of a hoverchair. He had no designs of world conquest, but instead was only interested in making money; this may be because the branch of A.I.M. that created him did so specifically so he could ''talk'' the head office into increasing their budget. He ended up practically ruling the airwaves, influencing millions of viewers through 100 android hosts, anchormen and reporters, all controlled directly by him.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' (vol. 3) #1–4 (Nov. 2007–Feb. 2008)</ref>

===MODOG===
Iron Man has an encounter with '''MODOG''' ('''M'''obile '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''G'''enocide) in the second volume of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Iron Man dispatches him with ease, dumping him in outer space.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' (vol. 2) #2 (Aug. 2008)</ref>

===Marvel MAX===
The miniseries ''U.S. War Machine'', published under the mature-audience [[Max (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint, showcases another version of MODOK salvaged by S.H.I.E.L.D. when it is discarded by A.I.M., apparently a victim of [[racial prejudice]].<ref>''U.S. War Machine'' #1–12 (Nov. 2001–Jan. 2002)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the character features in the title ''[[Ultimate Vision]]'', experimenting with a [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] probe on an A.I.M. space station. Although he starts the story as the amoral genius cyborg George Tarleton, after he is infected by Gah Lak Tus, he is eventually reduced to a disembodied head.<ref>''Ultimate Vision'' #1-5</ref>

Another version of MODOK appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars|Ultimate Armor Wars]]'' #2, when [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]] revealed that he, too, was a cyborg and harbored a tiny MODOK inside his hollow head.<ref>''Ultimate Armor Wars'' #2</ref>

===Nextwave===
At least four versions of MODOK, apparently based around [[Elvis Presley]], were created by the [[Beyond Corporation]] to defend their secret weapons factory, State 51. They were defeated by the [[Nextwave]] Squad. Their principal mode of attack seemed to involve shooting cheeseburgers at their target.<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #11 (Feb. 2007)</ref>

The following issue revealed that the Beyond Corporation was being run by a disguised infant MODOK, apparently conceived by a MODOK and a MODAM. This MODOK escapes the Nextwave Squad, but it is subsequently killed by its master, [[Devil Dinosaur]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #12 (March 2007)</ref>

===Amalgam Comics===
A version of the character features in ''Iron Lantern'' #1, a one-shot issue (one of 24) that is part of the [[Amalgam Comics]] imprint, which is itself part of the four-issue miniseries ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]''. MODOK is crossed with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Hector Hammond]] to form '''H.E.C.T.O.R.''' ('''H'''ighly '''E'''volved '''C'''reature '''T'''otally '''O'''riented for '''R'''evenge), who is the leader of the Weaponers of A.I.M. (a cross between DC's the [[Qward#Fictional history|Weaponers of Qward]] and Marvel's A.I.M.)<ref>''Iron Lantern'' #1 (June 1997)</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
An alternate version of MODOK is seen being eaten by zombified versions of the [[She-Hulk]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]. Later, it is discovered that this universe's [[Ash Williams]] had watched this MODOK being devoured.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' #3</ref>

===''Earth X''===
An alternate version of MODOK appeared in ''[[Earth X]]''. In recent history, MODOK, like every other telepath on the planet, was killed when the [[Red Skull]]'s powers first manifested. MODOK's hoverchair, ironically, was later recovered by the Skull's army and the Skull used it as his personal throne.<ref>''Earth X'' #2</ref>

===MODORD===
A [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]-centered story, "Disco Highway", in issue #4 of the miniseries ''[[X-Men]]: Serve and Protect'', released in February 2011, features a character named '''MODORD''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''R'''oller '''D'''erby).<ref>''X-Men: Serve and Protect'' #4</ref>

===''MODOK: Assassin''===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the [[Battleworld]] domain of Killville is based on a reality where MODOK killed every known superhero, which resulted in its citizens being in constant danger from every supervillain and murderer in Killville.<ref>''MODOK: Assassin'' #1</ref>

===MODAAK===
In the pages of ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'', which takes place on Earth-65, Captain America fights against '''MODAAK''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''A'''s '''A'''merica's '''K'''ing).<ref>''Spider-Gwen Annual'' #1</ref> The author based this character on American then-U.S. Presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Suebsaeng|first1=Asawin|title=Marvel Artist Who Made a Trump Supervillain Thinks Donald Is a 'Goddamn Idiot'|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/06/marvel-artist-who-made-a-trump-supervillain-thinks-donald-is-a-goddamn-idiot.html|website=The Daily Beast|date=July 6, 2016|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref>

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
Several incarnations of MODOK appear in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]]. The character was first considered as the villain for [[Iron Man (2008 film)|''Iron Man'']] (2008) in a script written by [[Jeff Vintar]] and [[Stan Lee]] for [[20th Century Fox]] before the film began redevelopment at [[Marvel Studios]];<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060503043047/http://www.comics2film.com/IronManArch.shtml</ref> the character was then considered to appear during early development of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014) as the main villain, to be portrayed by [[Peter Dinklage]], before the character was cut from the final draft in favour of [[Alexander Pierce]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Terri Schwartz |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2599259/captain-america-writer-wants-peter-dinklage-as-modok-for-sequel/ |title='Captain America' Writer Wants Peter Dinklage As MODOK For Sequel |publisher=MTV |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2018-05-01}}</ref>
* In early 2017, the live-action series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' was given access from Marvel Studios to use MODOK, with [[Superior (Marvel Comics)|'''Anton Ivanov''']] introduced in the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth season]] with the intent of becoming MODOK by the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth season]]; Marvel ultimately retracted access to referring to the character MODOK, and the character was simply known as '''The Superior''' (in reference to the comic book alias "MODOK Superior"), while referring to their various robotic duplicates (controlled remotely by their bodiless [[brain in a vat]]) as [[Life Model Decoy|'''L'''ife-'''MO'''del '''D'''ecoys '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing]] ('''L-MODOKs''').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-showrunners-reveal-the-plan-1844694196|title=The Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. showrunners reveal the plan behind that grand series finale|last=McLevy|first=Alex|work=[[The A.V.

Following the A-Day disaster, which leaves Tarleton mutated from exposure to the crystal, he takes advantage of the resulting chaos to found A.I.M. and establish a virtual police state in the country over the next five years to ostensibly cure the [[Inhumans]] created in the disaster's wake, with assistance from fellow scientist [[Monica Rappaccini]] and her regeneration formula to keep himself alive as his mutation gradually enlarges his head and grants him technopathy. Having developed a hatred for superheroes, however, Tarleton captures Inhumans to harness their powers so he can create an army of Adaptoids to replace the Avengers and destroy the world, only to eventually discover Rappaccini's formula was derived from [[Captain America]]'s blood and that it accelerated his mutation instead. In rage, he seemingly kills her, takes the name MODOK, and plots to exterminate all Inhumans in the world, including himself. The Avengers ultimately foil his plans while [[Kamala Khan]] defeats him, sending him tumbling into the San Francisco Bay.
