'''MODOK''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  His name is an acronym for '''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing.  The original MODOK first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #94 (October [[1967]]), which was illustrated by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Character history==
There have been three men to assume the MODOK name. In the comic books the MODOK characters did not appear in chronological order. MODOK II first appears and years later is killed. In later issues, MODOK III is created and subsequently lost and later returns to lead AIM. Finally, MODOK I is introduced and since ''according to the story'' MODOK I was created before MODOK II (via [[retcon]]) it is considered the first, even though the story it first appeared in was published over 30 years later than the story in which MODOK II was introduced. There have also been a number of female variants of MODOK: Ms. MODOK (Dr. Katherine Waynesboro) and MODAM (Olinka Barankova).

A MODOC (using the C version of the spelling) was also part of the ''[[Iron Man (animated series)|Iron Man]]'' [[animated television series]], where he served as the unwilling scientific mastermind of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], who promised to return him to his human form upon his domination of the world.

===MODOK II (George Tarleton)===

Scientists at [[AIM (Marvel)|Advanced Idea Mechanics]] created MODOK to analyze and probe the [[cosmic cube]] and to improve the organization's productivity in its scientific endeavors, while still being subservient to the higher echelons of the organization. To that end they mutagenically altered one of their technicians of average intelligence, George Tarleton, into the super intelligent being, '''MODOC''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''C'''omputing). These scientists unwisely did not take into consideration that superior ability naturally leads to superior ambition. 

It did not take long for MODOC to turn on his former masters and overthrow AIM. He adopted the new acronym for his title: MODOK ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing) at this time as he was more of a ruthless killer than a bean counter in his own estimation. MODOK and AIM frequently came into conflict with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and many other [[superhero]]es. 

AIM was not happy with MODOK's meglomaniacal and short-sighted leadership and he was frequently ousted only to return to power again. MODOK was so focused on his personal grudge with various superheroes that he ignored the scientific aspect of the organization and allowed it to become stagnant. The other AIM leaders eventually hired assassins to eliminate him. The George Tarleton variant of MODOK was killed by the [[Serpent Society]] during that group's first mission in ''[Captain America]]'' #313.

===Ms. MODOK and MODAM===
Dr. Katherine Waynesboro, an associate of Bruce Banner (the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]), was briefly transformed into a female MODOK counterpart called '''Ms. MODOK'''. This occurred prior to MODOK's death and she nearly married MODOK until he tried to disintegrate the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], which appalled her. She eventually escaped from AIM and was returned to normal. 

Subsequently, a different female counterpart of MODOK was created.  She was a woman who had been mutated into a large headed creature, and she was believed to be [[Henry Pym]]'s first wife, Maria Troyvana. She first appeared in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #36. Pym took her in, believing she was his late wife, but she was secretly a spy and returned to AIM. There, she was further mutated into a being nearly identical in appearance to MODOK called '''SODAM''' ('''S'''pecialized '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned for '''A'''ggressive '''M'''aneuvers), which later was changed to '''MODAM''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned for '''A'''ggressive '''M'''aneuvers). In ''[[Iron Man]]'' #296, [[Omega Red]] revealed that MODAM was not Maria Troyvana; her real name was Olinka Barankova.

===MODOK III and MODOK I===
Finally, a new MODOK (MODOK III) was created during the "Taking AIM" [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. At the end of this story line this new MODOK was lost in another dimension and MODAM was killed. It was later discovered in the pages of ''Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]'' that there was another MODOK (MODOK I) who existed prior to the time that George Tarleton had been mutated into MODOK (MODOK II). Eventually, the newly created MODOK (MODOK III) found his way back to his dimension of origin and took control of AIM yet again.

==Powers and abilities==
The following description is valid for all incarnations of MODOK, including his female counterparts.

MODOK has superhuman mental [[acumen]]. As a result of the mutagenic process he has undergone he is (''in theory'') capable of knowledge and comprehension beyond the human ability to understand. He is ''potentially'' capable of mastering every worldly subject and capable of adopting concepts completely foreign to his environment. His ability to predict probable outcomes of tactical and strategic scenarios is so advanced that it borders on clairvoyance. 

In addition to his extraordinary intelligence, MODOK has great psionic powers that enable him to mentally control large groups of people (provided they are weak minded), and with the assistance of his armor/flying platform he can use his psionic powers to fire a mind-beam. He is able to operate machinery such as his flying platform/armor with his thoughts alone. 

MODOK has also designed a large number of sophisticated weapons, vehicles, computers, androids, and telescoping limbs for his armor. He even has a giant android body that is proportionally sized for his head. His armor/flying platform is designed based on magnetism.

Despite MODOK's great powers, his effectiveness is greatly hampered by his emotional instability and immaturity, sometimes to the point of making rash and dangerous decisions that bely his great intellect.
