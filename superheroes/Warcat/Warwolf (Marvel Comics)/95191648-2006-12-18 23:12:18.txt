'''Warwolf (Vic Marcus)''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe who first appeared in ''Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos'' #1.

==History==
''Vince Marcus'' is a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]’s [[Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.  He is the field commander.  It is unknown yet when he joined SHIELD or why he is nicknamed Warwolf.

He is able to turn in to a half man half wolf creature when the planet Mars is in the sky.  This means that at night in the Northern Hemisphere and during the day in the south.  He retains his human mind and control of the wolfman form.  It seems that his power comes from the Roman god of war.  He was cursed much like the Juggernaut.  Vincent's life probably started hundreds of years ago and the curse is keeping him alive.  

He has fought with guns and also used his claws to inflitrate the "Lords of Lightning",  a doomsday cult and led the assult on Stonehedge when Merlin and faeries were bringing their world into ours.
