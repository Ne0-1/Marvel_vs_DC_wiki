The '''Unicorn''' ('''Milos Masaryk''') is a [[supervillain]] that exists in the [[fictional]] [[Marvel Universe]]. The character first appears in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #56 (vol. 1, Aug. 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Milos Masaryk''' is a [[Soviet]] [[intelligence agent]] assigned to track down the original [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Crimson Dynamo]], who defects to [[United States|America]] after being tricked by Iron Man. Wearing technology designed by the Dynamo, Masaryk gives himself the alias the "Unicorn" and battles Iron Man. Although Iron Man crashes the Unicorn's plane, the villain manages to escape. <ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #56 (vol. 1, Aug. 1964)</ref>

The Unicorn was among the villains affected by [[Doctor Doom]]'s high-frequency emotion charger, and went to the [[Baxter Building]] to attack the [[Fantastic Four]]. He once fought Iron Man and was defeated with one punch. He teamed with [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and the [[Melter]] against [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], but the resultant combination of their power blasts knocked them all out, and they were sent back to the immediate past by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] with no memory of attack.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3, 1965; ''Marvel: Heroes and Legends'', 1996</ref>

The Unicorn later allies himself with [[Count Nefaria]] for financial reasons, but is stopped by the [[X-Men]]. <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #22 - 23 (vol. 1, Jul. - Aug 1966)</ref> He then  undergoes experimental conditioning to augment his powers and battles Iron Man once more, but is defeated. <ref>Iron Man #4 (vol. 1, Aug.)</ref> Unfortunately, the process leaves the Unicorn with "accelerated cellular deterioration", and he is taunted with a cure by the [[Red Ghost]] in exchange for help against Iron Man. However, once it becomes evident that the Red Ghost has lied, the Unicorn aids Iron Man and later escapes. <ref>Iron Man #15 - 16 (vol. 1, Jul. - Aug. )</ref> He gives up on the Red Ghost after he failed to find cure.<ref>''Defenders'' #8, 1973</ref>

The master villain, the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], makes a similar promise to the Unicorn and deploys him against Iron Man. On two separate occasions Unicorn's battle with Iron Man ends in defeat. <ref>''Iron Man'' #57 - 58 (vol. 1, Apr- May ); #68 - 69 (vol. 1, Jun - Aug (bi-monthly)</ref> Using the alias "The Other" , the [[Titanium Man]] uses the Unicorn against Iron Man who is finally able to capture Masaryk. In a dramatic turn, the very moment of his capture sees Masaryk slip into a life-threatening coma. <ref>''Iron Man'' #113 (vol. 1, Aug. 1978)</ref> Iron Man takes Masaryk to the Avengers' [[Avengers Mansion|mansion]] where team-mate [[Yellowjacket (comics)|Henry Pym]] wakes Masaryk and cures him of his debilitating disease. The process has the unfortunate result of driving Masaryk insane, and a disorientated Unicorn inadvertently activates the hidden robot [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]]. The Unicorn is stunned by the robot - which Iron Man drives off - and then placed in stasis pending a cure for his mental illness. <ref>''Iron Man'' #114 (vol. 1, Sep. 1978)</ref> 

Months later, Masaryk is freed when a fire breaks out at Stark Enterprises, <ref>''Iron Man'' #145 - 146 (vol. 1, Apr - May 1981)</ref>  and assuming the identity of the Unicorn finds and attacks Iron Man once again. Still suffering from insanity, the Unicorn refuses to be believe that "The Other" was a lie, and decides to walk back to the Soviet Union via the ocean to find him. A severely weakened Iron Man is powerless to stop him and can only watch as the Unicorn apparently drowns. <ref>''Iron Man'' #154 (vol. 1, Jan. 1982)</ref> The Unicorn is later revived by the entity the [[Beyonder]] to fight with a new version of the [[Lethal Legion]], and given a true third eye on a stalk with energy projection capabilities in lieu of a suit. <ref>''Marvel Age'' Annual #1 (1985)</ref> This act eventually drives Masaryk insane, who goes on a rampage in [[St. Petersburg]] until captured by the third [[Titanium Man]]. Masaryk's third eye is then amputated and he is incarcerated. <ref>''Soviet Super-Soldiers Special Edition'' #1 (1992)</ref> Masaryk is later freed and recruited into the supervillain group '''Stockpile''' to destroy Iron Man, but they are defeated by the combined efforts of Iron Man and [[War Machine]]. <ref>''Iron Man'' #330-331 (vol. 1, Jul. - Aug. 1996)</ref>

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
During the Civil War event, the Unicorn is approached by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to either join Zemo's team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] or go to jail. Masaryk chooses to join and fights on the team's behalf. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104 (2006) + 107 (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Unicorn has superhuman strength and endurance. The Unicorn's soft tissues are dozens of times harder than those of an ordinary human, making him highly resistant to physical injury. 

He wears headgear equipped with an energy projector that tunes to various frequency and power levels. This allows him to project force beams and thermal beams. It also allows him to project a force field and to levitate objects magnetically. He also wears a rocket belt equipped with twin, high-efficiency electric micro turbines that allow him to fly.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Unicorn===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the Unicorn briefly appears as a participant in the abandoned Russian [[supersoldier]] program. This version is one of many convicts found by the [[Ultimates]] in the [[Tunguska]] base who were altered using [[biotechnology]] torn from the [[Ultimate Vision]], and driven mad by years of isolation. He appears to have the power to project electricity from his horn, to levitate, and enhanced durability. <ref>''[[Ultimate Nightmare]]'' (#1 - 5, Aug. 2004 - Dec. 2004)</ref>
