'''Unicorn''' ('''Milos Masaryk''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Milos Masaryk''' was born in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now capital of [[Slovakia]]).  He was a [[Soviet]] [[intelligence agent]] who was assigned to track down the original [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Crimson Dynamo]] (Anton Vanko) who had defected to [[United States|America]]. There, the Unicorn (Masaryk under his new identity) confronted [[Iron Man]] (who was in fact responsible for Vanko's defection). The Unicorn escaped capture by Iron Man, and returned home.

He later allied himself with [[Count Nefaria]], joining with Nefaria for financial reasons. After this, however, he returned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where he underwent experimental conditioning to augment his powers. An unfortunate side effect left him with "accelerated cellular deterioration." During this time, the Unicorn was numerously used by his Soviet supervisors, [[Red Ghost]], [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]], and [[Titanium Man]], who would agreed to find a cure for Masaryk in return for various "favors." Iron Man, during one such Titanium Man-"favored" battle, captured Masaryk, and cured him of his disease, unfortunately turning the Unicorn insane. Still later, after another battle with Iron Man, the Unicorn was seen headed out into the sea, where he claimed the Titanium Man waited for him.

It has not been revealed what happened to the Unicorn from that time until being released from some secret Soviet project and used as a pawn by Valentin Shatalov, now the current Crimson Dynamo, as a part of his Remont plan to restore Russia to the days of [[Stalin]]. The Unicorn, clearly insane and beyond rationality, was defeated by the [[People's Protectorate]] and placed in another Soviet lab, where his eyestalk/third eye was revealed. Going on a subsequent berserker rampage, he was defeated by Synthesizer and Titanium Man and impressed into the service of Remont-4.

The Unicorn apparently got better, even wearing his headpiece again, and returned to Iron Man's life as part of the Stockpile, a group of [[supervillain|superpowered villains]] hired by [[Morgan Stark]], Tony Stark's "evil cousin." After a battle with Iron Man/Iron Boy (after the Avengers battle dubbed "The Crossing," the older Stark was dead, and a young version of Stark was now Iron Man) the group was basically wiped out, with the Unicorn being the only member of the group who definitely escaped to parts unknown. It has been speculated that this Unicorn was not Masaryk, but rather a successor riding on Masaryk's reputation. He bore an accent that suggested that he was Australian or British in origin. This Unicorn was later seen by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Constrictor (comics)|the Constrictor]], and Titania in the chic supervillain restaurant, the Russian Tea Room.
