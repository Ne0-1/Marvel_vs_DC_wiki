'''Bastion''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], a fusion of the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] [[Master Mold]] and [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]]. He is mainly an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. He first appeared in ''X-Men'' #52 (May 1996).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Bastion started life out as two separate beings, the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] factory, [[Master Mold]], and [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], a Sentinel from an [[alternate future]]. It was on one fateful day that Nimrod came across a piece of Master Mold's body. Master Mold's programming began to co-opt Nimrod. The two of them became one being after being pushed into the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Dazzler]].

Now, a man of flesh and no memory of his past, Bastion was taken in by a woman named Rose Gilberti. Living with Rose, Bastion began to hear about the mutant problem, across America. At some point, Bastion fell into anti-mutant groups, like [[Graydon Creed]]'s [[Friends of Humanity]].

===Operation: Zero Tolerance===<!-- This section is linked from [[J. Jonah Jameson]] -->
In time, Bastion was working his way "up the ladder", in the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]]. Unwittingly, Bastion was able to develop a new type of Sentinel, the [[Prime Sentinels]]. 

Two events, the fallout of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and the death of Graydon Creed, were the ammunition needed to initiate Bastion's [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]], which attacked mutants everywhere. The operation was successful in capturing [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and some members of the [[X-Men]], taking direct control over the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]], and gaining possession of the [[Xavier Protocols]], a list of files containing information on killing the X-Men.

The [[President of the United States|President]] was convinced by [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] to suspend Bastion's  operations. Bastion was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], with help from [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. While in government custody, Bastion regained his memories and escaped custody. He attempted to lead another crusade against mutants, but he was stopped by [[Machine Man]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Bastion was returned to government custody, only to be later beheaded by a brainwashed [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who served as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s Horseman of Death.

===Template===
A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent by the name of Mainspring was heading a project called the Gatekeepers. Their goal was to study and destroy [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] technology. They found the remains of Bastion and rebuilt him, but lost control of him. Bastion with the new body and new programming became known as '''Template''' and killed Mainspring. Bastion fought against the heroes [[Warlock]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] during these incidents.

Some time later, [[Carol Danvers]] contacted the X-Men about the current whereabouts of the remains of Bastion/Template. The X-Men sent [[Shadowcat]], Wolverine, and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] to break into the government facility. Their goal was to reclaim their stolen  computer files. While there, Template showed the three X-Men false holograms of events and lies about their teammates. The X-Men eventually got their files, but they were left with doubts and fears about their teammates.

==Powers and abilities==
As a mystical fusion of the Master Mold and Nimrod, Bastion possessed many abilities including enhanced strength, speed, stamina, and sturdiness. Bastion could fly by means of boot jets, as well as fire concussive energy blasts from his hands. He also proved immune to telepathic probes.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline a Bastion existed, as evidenced when the X-Men are discussing [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] who is the one "rumoured to have replaced Bastion". This Bastion has never been seen in the comic and there is no indication whether or not he is related to the main continuity Bastion.

==In other media==

Bastion is the main villain in the game [[X-Men: Next Dimension]]. Here, he rips information out of [[Forge (comics)|Forge's]] mind and plants devices in his Sentinels that can depower a mutant. At [[Asteroid M]], either [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] or [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] destroys him once and for all.

Bastion appears as one of the [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] in the video game '''''[[X-Men Legends II]]'''''.  He seems to be a mere anti-mutant activist (though his true nature is mentioned in a trivia minigame), yet his ability to control Sentinels is noted, as the mission in question where he attacks the X-Men involved the X-Men teaming up with Sentinels to save civilians. Bastion then took control of the Sentinels to turn them against the X-Men.
