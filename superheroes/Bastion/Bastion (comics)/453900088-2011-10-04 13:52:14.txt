His first full appearance was ''Uncanny X-Men'' #333 (June 1996). He also appears in the video game ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]'' for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 (October 2002). 

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Bastion started life out as two separate beings: the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] [[Master Mold]], and [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], a highly-advanced Sentinel from an [[alternate future]]. While posing as a human construction worker, Nimrod unearthed a module from Master Mold. As soon as Nimrod made physical contact with the module, Master Mold's programming began to co-opt Nimrod's. Shortly after, during a conflict with the X-Men, the two of them, along with the X-Man [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], were blasted through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], a mystical crystal capable of judging any who pass through it and reincarnating them into a new life commensurate in quality with their previous life. It was the Siege Perilous that was responsible for merging Nimrod and Master Mold into a single man of flesh with no memory of his past. Bastion was taken in by a woman named Rose Gilberti. Living with Rose, Bastion began to hear about America's mutant problem. At some point, Bastion fell in with anti-mutant groups, like [[Graydon Creed]]'s [[Friends of Humanity]].

===Operation: Zero Tolerance===
{{main|Operation: Zero Tolerance}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
In time, Bastion worked his way "up the ladder" in the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]]. Unwittingly, Bastion was able to develop a new type of Sentinel, the [[Prime Sentinel]]s. 

Two events, the fallout of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and the death of Graydon Creed, were the ammunition needed to initiate Bastion's [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]], which attacked mutants everywhere. The operation succeeded in capturing [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and some members of the [[X-Men]], taking direct control over the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]], and gaining possession of the [[Xavier Protocols]], a list of files containing information on killing the X-Men.

The [[President of the United States|President]] was convinced by [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] to suspend Bastion's operations. Bastion was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], with help from [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. While in government custody, Bastion regained his memories, and he then escaped. He attempted to lead another crusade against mutants, but he was stopped by [[Machine Man]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. He was returned to government custody, only later to be beheaded by a brainwashed [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who served as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s Horseman of Death.

===Template===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Mainspring headed a project called the Gatekeepers, whose goal is to study and destroy [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] technology. They found the remains of Bastion and rebuilt him, but they then lost control of him. Bastion, with a new body and new programming, became known as '''Template''' and killed Mainspring. Bastion fought against the heroes [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] during these incidents.

Some time later, [[Carol Danvers]] contacted the X-Men about the current whereabouts of the remains of Bastion/Template. The X-Men sent [[Shadowcat]], Wolverine, and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] to break into the government facility, intending to reclaim their stolen computer files. While there, Template showed the three X-Men false holograms of events and lies about their teammates. The X-Men eventually got their files, but they were left with doubts and fears about their teammates.

===X-Force===
Following the events of the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' event, the fundamentalist [[Purifiers]] assaulted a heavily-defended SHIELD installation, breaching the tight security with the aid of several double agents within the organization and recovering Bastion's head. At one of their churches, the Purifiers attached the head to the body of the Nimrod unit recovered from Forge's Aerie, returning Bastion to life. Immediately after his activation, the mutant-hunting robot alerts the Purifiers to the presence of the new [[X-Force]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #1 (2008)</ref> After accessing Nimrod's database, Bastion concludes that the X-Men are the greatest mutant threat to the Purifiers' objectives in this timeline or any other and that there is no terrestrial force in existence that could guarantee the elimination of the X-Men. However, he reveals that he has found something that could: [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #2</ref>

It was later revealed that what Bastion discovered at the bottom of the ocean was not the real Magus, but one of his offspring in a mindless state. Bastion rewrote its programming and infected [[Donald Pierce]] and the [[Leper Queen]], the recovered techno-organic remains of [[Cameron Hodge]] and [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]], as well as the corpses of [[Bolivar Trask]], [[Graydon Creed]] and Reverend [[William Stryker]] with the Technarch transmode virus, declaring them to be the future of humanity and the end of mutantkind.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #3</ref>

His first move was to capture several mutants and inject on them a strain of the Legacy Virus to cause their powers to go berserk and kill themselves and thousands of humans. Current known mutants to have been injected with the virus are [[Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]], [[Fever Pitch (comics)|Fever Pitch]], [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Hellion]] and [[Surge (comics)|Surge]]. This would compel the United Nations to form a Mutant Response Division, which is successful, despite X-Force's efforts.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #12-13, 17-18</ref>

Bastion also had Pierce act as his mole inside the X-Men's headquarters, all the while building several structures that surround Utopia.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #19</ref>

===Necrosha===
{{main|Necrosha}}
Mysteriously, mutants thought deceased are amazingly coming back to life. Bastion soon realizes that someone had gotten hold of the transmode virus. This spurs him onto accelerating his mysterious plan.<ref>''Necrosha'' one-shot</ref>

===Second Coming===
{{main|X-Men: Second Coming}}
Bastion is the primary antagonist in the X-Men: Second Coming storyline. He is seen with [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]], [[Bolivar Trask]], [[William Stryker]], [[Graydon Creed]], and [[Cameron Hodge]] stating that their forces are assembled and at his disposal. Bastion tells them that the Mutant Messiah has returned and gives them orders to kill her.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' one-shot</ref> Later, Bastion attempts to kill [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] on his own, but he is confronted by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and then severely damaged when [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] sacrifices himself. When rebooting, Bastion takes on much of Nimrod's old appearance, but is finally destroyed towards the end of the crossover when Hope manifests a variety of the current X-Men's mutant powers and obliterates him.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #28</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Being a robot, Bastion has super strength, speed, intelligence, and endurance. It can also fly by using jet boots. It is immune to [[psychic reading]] from telepaths and has complete command of all Sentinels. It has an artificial healing factor, like Nimrod, and the ability to turn people into Prime sentinels.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline a character named Bastion existed. When the X-Men are discussing [[Abyss (comics)#Age_of_Apocalypse|Abyss]], they describe him as the one "rumored to have replaced Bastion". This Bastion has never been seen in the comic and there is no indication whether or not he is related to the 616 Bastion.

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Bastion is the main villain in the game ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]'' voiced by [[Don Morrow]]. Here, he rips information out of [[Forge (comics)|Forge's]] mind and plants devices in his Sentinels that can depower a mutant. At [[Asteroid M]], either [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] or [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] destroys him once and for all.

* Bastion appears as one of the [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Alastair Duncan]]. He seems to be a mere anti-mutant activist (though his true nature is mentioned in a trivia minigame), yet his ability to control Sentinels is noted, as the mission in question where he attacks the X-Men involved the X-Men teaming up with Sentinels to save civilians. Bastion then took control of the Sentinels to turn them against the X-Men.

* Bastion appears in the ''[[X-Men: Destiny]]'' video game voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]]. He is said to had killed Professor X in the opening cutscene. Magneto apparently killed him in the same battle. It's revealed that he had uploaded his mind into the Telos orbital satellite where he took control of Lucius Reyes and used him along with the [[Mutant Response Division]], [[Purifiers]] and [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]] to begin hostilities with Mutants.
