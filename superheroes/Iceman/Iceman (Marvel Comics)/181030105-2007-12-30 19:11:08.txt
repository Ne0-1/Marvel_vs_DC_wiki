'''Iceman''' ('''Robert "Bobby" Louis Drake''') is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #1, ([[1963#September|September 1963]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Iceman can freeze [[moisture]] in the air around him and turn his body into [[ice]]. Although he is an [[Omega-level mutant]], Drake has yet to tap his full mutant potential. He has however begun to take more interest over the years in developing his [[abilities]].

One of the original X-Men, Iceman has had a frequent presence in X-Men-related [[comic book|comics]], [[video game]]s, [[animation]], and [[movies]]. Actor [[Shawn Ashmore]] portrays the character of Bobby Drake in the [[X-Men (film)|film series]].

==Publication history==
Iceman has been featured in two self-titled limited comic book miniseries, one in the 1980s by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and another in the 2000s by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett. Both sold poorly.

A mainstay in most X-Men titles, Iceman has been a main character in both ''Uncanny X-Men'' and the second volume of ''X-Men'' and was also featured in the ''Champions'' and ''New Defenders'' as a member. He also was a main character in the first volume of ''X-Factor''. He was also a star in flashback stories when he was a teenager in ''X-Men-The Hidden Years'' and ''X-Men-First Class''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Iceman was born in [[Floral Park|Floral Park, Long Island]], [[New York]], to William Robert Drake and Madeline Beatrice Bass Drake. He is [[Jew]]ish on his mother's side and [[Irish Catholic]] on his father's.<ref>http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Iceman.html</ref> His powers first manifested when Bobby was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight; Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard about what Bobby did, came looking for him in the shape of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own "protection."  While sitting in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a man named Scott Summers ([[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]) walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After turning him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] soon ended. 
[[Image:Uncanny 1 iceman.jpg|Iceman, on the cover of ''X-Men'' vol. 1 #1 (1963).  Art by [[Jack Kirby]].|left|thumb|260px]]
After Xavier sat down and talked with Bobby and his parents, Bobby's parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his "school for gifted youngsters."  Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops, to become the first member of the X-Men. He is later joined by [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], [[Jean Grey]], and [[Warren Worthington III]] as the charter members of the X-Men. Iceman quickly befriends Hank McCoy ([[Beast (comics)|Beast]]), and the two serve as comic relief for the team. However, Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group. During his original stint with the X-Men, Drake pursues a relationship with [[Polaris (comics)|Lorna Dane]], although the relationship does not last. Iceman is among the original X-Men captured by [[Krakoa]], leading to a new incarnation of X-Men of which he is not a part. For a short while, he moves to the American west coast to attend [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and becomes a founding member of [[Champions (comics)|The Champions]] of Los Angeles.<ref>''Champions'' #1, October 1975</ref> After the Champions dissolve, Drake retires from life as a superhero to earn a college degree in accounting - but apparently at a college on the east coast, not UCLA.<ref>X-Men #145, page 10, panel 1,</ref> He returns as a full-time superhero in an incarnation of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] alongside his former teammates, Angel and Beast. After the Defenders disband, Drake embarks on his career as an accountant.

===X-Factor===
The original X-Men, including Iceman, are then reunited to form the superhero team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986)</ref> Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, a category he was once of. Most notably, he and Beast helped [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] gain a more semi-normal life. For a brief while, he also helped supervise the [[New Mutants]] and their sister team, the [[X-Terminators]]. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of [[Infectia]]. 

During his time with the team, the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] trickster god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the [[Frost Giants]]. Loki enhances Bobby's powers to such an extent that he is then forced to wear a power-dampening belt. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he could encase the entirety of the [[Empire State Building]]. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers that he was able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.

Bobby also develops a romantic relationship with Opal Tanaka. After a session of ice sledding, she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox, a precursor to cybernetically enhanced relatives harassing her, something Robert would help out with. 

After the [[Muir Island Saga]], X-Factor rejoins the X-Men.

===Back with the X-Men===
Upon rejoining the X-Men, Iceman becomes a member of the Gold Squadron, under the leadership of Storm. For much of his time, he continues his role as the team's practical joker and comic relief. However, when [[Emma Frost]], the former White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], took over his body and used his powers at levels which he himself had previously been unable to reach, Iceman began to suffer from depression and begins to reassess his life. The White Queen subsequently believes that Iceman has the potential to be one of the most powerful mutants on Earth. At one point, Iceman confronts Emma demanding her to show him how she was able to use his powers in such a manner. Although she first tells him to "figure it out himself," she later goads him into accessing the power all by himself. 

Around this time, Iceman takes a road-trip with fellow X-Man [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. She becomes a danger to herself and others, forcing Iceman into the role of protector. Iceman leaves the X-Men shortly after the incident with the White Queen, only to take an uncharacteristic turn as a leader during [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]].

Not long after the Twelve incident against [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], Iceman, Jean Grey, Mystique, and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] are summoned by the sentient spaceship Prosh who sends the make-shift team on a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Their mission: save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. During their trips through time, Iceman was allowed to experience his abilities to far greater levels than he has ever attempted before. These experiences forced Iceman into the realization that he no longer needs to fear the evolution of his abilities, and he returns to the X-Men intent on exploring his mutant powers to the fullest.

===Secondary Mutation===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:12514-iceman 400.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Iceman with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<br>Art by [[Chris Bachalo]].]] -->
While working with a team of X-Men some time later, Drake undergoes a [[secondary mutation]] that prevents him from transforming a damaged portion of his chest back to flesh. Upon encountering [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and his followers, Iceman's body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.

After [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] breaks up with [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]], Iceman admits that he still has feelings for her. The two engage in mild flirtation, and a relationship between the two develops.

===Decimation===

After the events of the [[House of M]], Iceman finds himself to be flesh and blood again and believes himself to have lost his powers. Shortly after, while being held at gun point by the [[Leper Queen]], Emma Frost "pushes" something in Bobby's mind that forces him to turn to ice. Further examination reveals that Drake had not lost his powers, but rather had unconsciously repressed them on his own. After this, Bobby is once again able to revert from ice to flesh.

===Rogue's Team===

Iceman joins [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member. Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat, a powerful group known as the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men'' #188, July, 2006</ref> The team is successful and during this time, Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again. It was shown several times during the arc. Also during this arc Mystique kisses Bobby and he responds but it is unknown whether it was an actual kiss or if she was performing mouth-to-mouth. 

The next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him. The team again were successful but Rogue was infected with a virus called Strain 88. Cable took the team, including Bobby, to his island so Rogue could get treatment. 

While on Cable's Island the team and Iceman began working to defeat the Shi'ar weapon known as the Hecatomb. During the chaos, he shared a passionate kiss with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Even as he did so, he saved many lives by containing the explosion of the Conquistador, and, later, the Hecatomb itself. 

===Marauders===
In ''X-Men'' #200, as the team recovers from Hecatomb attack in Rogue's childhood home, it appears that Mystique and Iceman begin a romantic relationship. This was a front, however, as Mystique was using Iceman and the X-Men as a [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] spy for [[Mr. Sinister]]. Marauders soon infiltrate the house, they attempt to gain access to the Destiny Diaries on the order of Mr. Sinister (who has been gathering information about the future from anybody and anything having ability to foretell the future). Shortly after, Mystique, showing her true allegiance to the Marauders, shoots Rogue in the chest. It has yet to be shown how her betrayal will affect Iceman's mental stability. Bobby and [[Cannonball (comics)| Cannonball]] escape from the Marauders in the X-Jet, with help from [[Emma Frost]]. They are pursued by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders' plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny's Diaries before the Marauders can. It is revealed that Bobby has the power to prevent Shiro from using his powers on a sub-atomic level during Cannonball's interrogation of Shiro.

In ''X-Men'' 203, Cannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the Destiny Diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Bobby and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell. Iceman attacks Sinister, distracting him, which allows both of the X-Men to escape. Given that Iceman has previously been able to recover after being completely shattered in his ice form, it can be assumed that Bobby will be able to recover from his injuries.

===[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]===
When the [[New X-Men]] team was scattered throughout the country, Iceman volunteered to go look for them

==Physical appearance==
Iceman's appearance while in ice form has changed significantly over the years. In the early X-Men stories, his appearance is more reminiscent of a snowman. The explanation given is that frost formed on his skin when he used his abilities. In ''X-Men'' #8 (1964), at the prompting of team leader [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], Drake learns to cover his body with hardened-but-flexible ice and adopts the hard crystalline appearance familiar to modern readers. After being kidnapped by the Norse God Loki and used as a pawn against his half brother [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Iceman's powers are augmented to uncontrollable levels, through a cryo-condenser. The process nearly kills him, however Loki is defeated, and Iceman is teleported back to his place of origin. (''Thor'' #377, #378). With his powers greatly increased, Iceman temporarily loses control of his powers and is required to wear a bulky, metallic belt designed to keep his powers in control. Iceman later learns to control his augmented powers without the aid of his power dampening belt. Eventually, Iceman develops the ability to actually become organic ice, appearing almost translucent. He is virtually indestructible in this form, as he can reform his shattered body even if part of him is completely destroyed. For a time, Iceman became stuck in this ice form, due to a secondary mutation. However, after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Bobby feared losing his powers and reverts back to his human appearance. In an attempt on his life by the Leper Queen, believing him to be a mutant, Bobby is seconds away from death. Mentally alerting Scott and the others to come to Bobby's aide, Emma reaches out to Bobby through Cerebro to try and help him as quickly as she can. By reaching into his mind, Emma reactivates Bobby's powers through opening a series of mental blocks he has placed on himself, and saves him from near death. As a result of Emma "hacking" into Bobby's mind, Iceman donned a more grotesque transparent appearance, with organic bubbles, large veins, and spiky hair. Since this experience, Iceman has regained control over his powers and refined his appearance with jagged spikes on his limbs, back, and hair.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:X-Factor 27.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Iceman creates an ice slide on the cover of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (Vol. 1) #27 (1988). Art by [[Walt Simonson]].]]
An [[Omega-level mutant]], Iceman's powers have evolved considerably over the years. [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] considers Iceman to be one of the twelve most powerful mutants on Earth. 

Iceman is able to lower his body temperature without causing harm to himself, reaching negative 105°F within a few tenths of a second. He is able to freeze any moisture in the air around him into unusually hard ice to form ice-slides and various projectiles and shields. He can travel rapidly along these ice-slides or ice-bridges by causing ice to form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, pushing him along the slick surface; he can increase his speed by admitting ice through his feet like a propeller and can obtain speeds of modern jets. He is also able to summon moisture from the air and create a flood. Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures and has thermal vision: the ability to detect objects visually by how much heat the objects generate. According to the laws of thermodynamics, cold is defined as the absence of heat. Therefore, Iceman does not actually emanate cold, but rather absorbs and dispels heat. Since heat is a form of energy, Iceman's power can be defined as a psionic ability to manipulate thermal energy. 

Over the years, his mutant [[physiology]] has gone through radical changes. First, he was able to fashion an [[Armour|armor]] of densely packed [[snow]] around his human form when lowering his temperature; later, this became an armor of solid ice. Under the mind control of [[Emma Frost]], his powers were used to a greater potential than he ever had, including being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes. He was also able to transform his body into pure organic ice (similar to the organic steel of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]). In normal human form, he has the strength, agility, and durability of a typical [[wiktionary:athletic|athletic]] male of his size. In his ice-form, his strength and durability were enhanced. When Frost gave up her mind control, Iceman was not able to duplicate what she had done with his own powers, although he now realized that he could push his powers to even greater heights.

At one point, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury and was stuck in his ice-form, afraid of what would happen if he changed back, and went to Emma Frost for help. She merely taunted him, unwilling to help, teasing him that his own self-esteem issues were the only thing holding him back from becoming one of the most powerful mutants on Earth. She hinted that his powers were rooted in the psionic manipulation of energy, and not in manipulation of moisture in the air as previously believed. She was finally able to push Iceman to the point where he lashed out, becoming somewhat malicious, causing her severe pain, and threatening to torture and kill her by slowly freezing the blood flow into her brain. He soon realized what she had been talking about, and he transformed back into his human form, healing the chest wound in the process. From that point forward, Iceman used his organic ice form instead of his ice armor. Sporadically, he would augment his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists.

Among his new-found abilities, Iceman is also able to reconstitute his ice-form if any part of it is damaged or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He is able to temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own to increase his mass, size, and physical power. His strength and durability in his ice-form are enhanced beyond normal human levels. He can survive not only as [[Sentience|sentient]] ice, but as sentient water and [[vapor]]. Drake has developed the ability to transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is taxing both physically and mentally (''X-Men'' #190 & 193, 2006). He has the capacity to manipulate all forms of moisture and possesses all of the abilities to generate [[projectile]]s, slides, and [[shield]]s that he had always possessed, but they have been augmented greatly.

In ''House of M'' #8, it first appeared that Iceman was among the many millions of mutants who lost their powers due to the magic of the [[Scarlet Witch]], having returned to his normal human form and noticeably sweating. However, while repelling an attack of anti-mutant protesters, Iceman's powers reactivated (''X-Men'' #178, November, 2005). It was revealed that Iceman did not lose his powers, but had subconsciously shut them down out of fear due to the aftermath of the [[House of M]] (''X-Men'' #179, December, 2005).

The scope of Iceman's powers has also been suggested in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity (see [[#Ultimate Iceman|Ultimate Iceman]]).

==Other versions==
===1602 Roberto Trefusis===
Iceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', a member of the group of "witchbreeds" founded by Carlos Javier (Professor X) and led by Scotius Summerisle (Scott Summers). He is the nephew of naval commander [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. As in the Marvel Universe, he generates ice and can assume a physical ice form.

===Age of Apocalypse===
{{main|Age of Apocalypse}}
In the ''Age of Apocalypse'' crossover event, Bobby, along with the rest of the X-Men, is trained by [[Magneto (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]]. Because Magneto is harder on his students than [[Professor X]], Bobby lacks his 616-counterpart's sense of humor. Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls "moisture [[Molecule|molecular]] inversion", though it is a painful process for the passengers. Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces. Just before Apocalypse's defeat Colossus stormed right through Iceman, causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister. A couple of months later Iceman, Exodus, Wild Child, and Morph were sent on a secret mission by Magneto and their fate has yet to be revealed.

===Earth X===
During the series [[Earth X]], Bobby had become trapped in his ice form, making him vulnerable to melting. He moves to the [[Arctic]] regions of Earth, and made an ice city for himself and the [[Inuit]]. Due to a series of events where Earth's orbital path moves, Bobby is able to return to the [[United States]] to aid in the battle against the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].

===Mutant X===
[[Image:Icemanmx.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Mutant X Ice-Man by Tom Raney.]]
When [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]] was transported to the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, he found Robert Drake the victim of misfortune. The [[Norse mythology|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] amplified Bobby's powers to a dangerous level, leaving him unable to make contact with any organic thing for fear of killing it. Unfortunately [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] did not invent the power dampening device that was invented in the main Marvel Universe, so Ice-Man's powers remained permanently affected. Now going by Bob and calling himself '''Ice-Man''', he becomes very bitter from his circumstances.

When Havok had a disagreement with [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and decided to leave the X-Men, Ice-Man was one of those who followed him, being a founding member of the Six. Not much is known of the early years of the team, but when Havok began to have an affair with [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], Havok's wife [[Madelyne Pryor|Madelyne]] came running to Ice-Man. Because of his inability to have human contact, nothing physical happened between the two, however a strong friendship developed. Consumed with jealousy at their intimate friendship, Havok sabotaged the [[Brute (Hank McCoy)|Brute's]] experiment to cure Ice-Man, permanently damaging his brain and reducing Brute to a child-like state. When the mental degeneration occurred, Ice-Man made it his duty to protect Brute, especially from the insensitive actions of [[The Fallen (comics)|The Fallen]].

Later, when the [[Madelyne Pryor#Mutant X|Goblyn Queen]] first ascended to power, she manipulated all the members of the Six (with the exception of the Fallen, who joined willingly) into serving her purpose. However, the team broke free of her influence and was able to defeat her, choosing to remain at Havok's side.

In a freak accident where Brute jumped in front of a [[psychic]] blast from a deranged [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] to protect Havok, Brute regained his intellect as a bizarre [[Unintended consequence|side-effect]]. As he felt his intelligence fading away, he wanted to finish the experiment he had begun several years before: to find a cure for Ice-Man's condition. His attempts were successful, allowing Bob to switch from his icy form to his flesh form at will. Brute endeavored to help his friends instead of attempting to stabilize his own condition, leaving Ice-Man to once more feel responsible for his friend's well-being when he reverted to his former mental state. 

In the final epic showdown between all the heroes of Earth and the combined might of the resurrected Goblyn Force, [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], and the [[Beyonder]], Ice-Man was one of the few to survive. What became of him after Havok left that reality is unknown.

===Ronin===
In the alternate reality of ''X-Men:Ronin'' Iceman is a murderous ninja in the employ of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. He works with [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] as part of the 'Shadowcat Clan' and battles the X-Men.

===Shadow-X===
[[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]] battles an evil counterpart of Iceman, who is a member of the [[Shadow-X]], the X-Men of an alternate reality in which Professor X was possessed by the [[Shadow King]]. They are brought to [[Earth-616]] as a result of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].
He died during the final battle against Albion.

===Ultimate Iceman===<!-- This section is linked from [[Rogue (comics)]] -->
{{main|Ultimate X-Men}}
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Bobby Drake is the youngest founding member of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. He ran away from his family at the peak of government-supported [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks, fearing his family would be killed in such an attack.

[[Image:Ultimateiceman.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Ultimate Iceman. Art by [[David Finch (comic book artist)|David Finch]].]]
Ultimate Iceman never had the snowman look of his counter-part, instead generating a flexible ice armor from the beginning and still does so to this day. Bobby establishes himself as a valuable asset, single-handedly taking out the [[Ultimates]] once with a gigantic ice wall (''see [[Ultimate War]]''), as well as single-handedly halting an invasion by Colonel [[Kestrel (comics)|Wraith]] and [[Weapon X]]. He was only able to be stopped by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who was in temporary possession of [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]'s telepathy. Professor X has stated that Bobby is one of the three most powerful X-Men. During the ''World Tour'' arc, after enlarging his armor to form a gigantic ice troll, Bobby is greatly injured by [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]], which resulted in a lawsuit issued by his parents against Xavier. Bobby eventually rebels against his parents, and later returns to the X-Men.

Before Bobby joined the X-Men he had a girlfriend, but [[Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Professor Xavier]] erased all memories of her from Bobby's mind when he told her too much about the X-Men (he presumably also erased the girl's memories). Upon her acceptance into the X-Men, Bobby begins to date [[Rogue (comics)#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]]. The pair date for a considerable amount of time, but eventually break up due to Bobby's growing feelings for [[Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Shadowcat]] and Rogue's feelings for [[Alternate versions of Gambit#Ultimate Gambit|Gambit]]. Eventually Rogue leaves, and Bobby starts to date Kitty until she dumps him after finding Bobby was still emailing Rogue. When Rogue returned to the X-Men, her original powers had been replaced with those of Gambit's. During the ''Date Night'' arc,  Bobby and Rogue have sex with one another (the first time for both of them), due to her being able to touch him now. After this, the two rekindle their relationship, but recently problems have erupted due to the return of Rogue's old powers.

Though Ultimate Iceman is still somewhat clumsy at present, the Ultimate version of [[Hammer (comics)#Ultimate Eisenhower Canty|Hammer]], who hailed from the future, exclaimed upon meeting and subsequently battling him: "Bobby Drake, huh? The Legend! I can't believe you're so inept at this point in your life! It's been an honour to kick your..." only for Wolverine to interrupt him.  [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] also hinted to Bobby that he has a lot of potential, but Iceman shrugs off the acknowledgment. 

It should also be noted that Bishop's explanation for Bobby's powers sound different from the manipulation of thermal energy: In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #80, Bishop talks to Bobby about his potential and comments "With minimal effort you are taking moisture out of the air and slowing water molecules down to make them cold. What else can you slow down?" While this description is different in wording, thermal energy is fundamentally the vibration speed of molecules. Faster vibrations equate to higher temperatures, so Bishop's explanation is essentially no different from the classic Iceman's mutant abilities. He also asks Bobby about exploring the possibilities with his powers, but Bobby merely shrugs him off and continues to play his video game.

===X-Men: Fairy Tales===
In ''[[Marvel Fairy Tales#X-Men Fairy Tales|X-Men: Fairy Tales]]'' (issue #1), Iceman appears as a winter wolf, a magical white-furred wolf whose icy breath can freeze those targeted by it. He goes by the name of Kori (Japanese for ice). Before he is reached by [[Cyclops (comics)#X-Men Fairy Tales|Cyclops]], he appears to have lost faith in friendship.

===X-Men: The End===
In ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', Iceman appears as one of the instrumental characters in the defeat of [[Cassandra Nova]] and [[Khan (comics)|Khan]] and one of the few surviving X-Men.

Bobby is one of the first students to reach out to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and begins a romantic relationship with her. In ''X2'', he has an uneasy friendship with [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]]. His relationship with his family is also strained, and his brother actually turns Bobby in to the police. In ''X3'', his relationship with Rogue appears to be deteriorating, strained by their inability to have physical contact and by his close friendship with [[Kitty Pryde]]. Seeing them both almost kiss prompts Rogue to seek out "the cure" so she can finally touch Bobby without fear of hurting him. He takes part in the X-Men's final confrontation with Magneto's army and shows his true power by fighting Pyro one-on-one. During this battle, Iceman's ability to transform his body into ice is finally shown, giving him the form of Iceman from the comics, being first implied in a previous confrontation between the two former best friends in which Bobby's hand ices over. After the battle, he finds Rogue in her room, having taken the cure. The special version of X-Men 3: The last Stand shows that Rogue did not in fact take the cure. Even so, Iceman chooses Rogue over Kitty Pryde. Unlike his mainstream counterpart, Bobby Drake is more of an [[everyman]] and not a cynical underachiever. Bobby is also portrayed as far younger in the films than his [[comic book]] counterpart.
