'''Iceman''' (Robert Louis "Bobby" Drake) is a  [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and an original and current member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''X-Men'' volume 1 #1 (September, 1963).

==Character biography==
[[Image:Uncanny1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''X-Men'' #1, 1963.]]
Iceman is a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the ability to emanate intense [[cold]] which manifests as [[ice]] formations and the mental ability to shape those ice formations into whatever structure he can imagine.  He is often seen to project cold from his hands in the form of "ice blasts" which can cause an enemy to be completely engulfed in ice in a matter of seconds.  Perhaps his most ingenious use of his abilities is the creation of a sort of ice slide along which he can slide very quickly.

He was born in [[Floral Park]], [[New York]], [[United States]] to William Robert Drake and his wife Madeline Beatrice Bass.  As a teenager, Drake was recruited to [[Professor Charles Xavier]]'s "school for gifted youngsters", where he joined other young mutants as a charter member of the X-Men.  Drake was sometimes self-conscious that he was the youngest member of the original team.  For a short while, he moved to Los Angeles and became a founding member of [[The Champions (comics)|The Champions]]

Iceman's appearance has changed significantly over the years.  In the early X-Men stories, his appearance was more reminiscent of a snowman.  The explanation that was given in those days was that when he used his abilities, he became so cold that frost formed on his skin.  In ''X-Men'' #7 (1964), at the prompting of team leader [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], he learned to cover his body with hardened-but-flexible ice and adopted the hard crystalline appearance familiar to modern readers.  Even more recently, Iceman developed the ability to not only cover his body with ice, but to actually become organic ice.  Though the appearance is similar, Iceman is now actually translucent in his ice form.  Iceman is virtually indestructible in this form: he can reform his shattered body and even if the rest of his body is completely destroyed, his head can form a new body from frozen liquids.  Most recently, Iceman has been trapped in his ice form to the degree that he cannot return to his human form.  Iceman is now considered an [[Omega-Level Mutant]] with his current power level.

Iceman suffers from a chronic poor [[self image]] and is a classic under-achiever.  Bobby's use of his powers has often been lazy and undisciplined.  Iceman has never realized the true potential of his abilities and even went through a period of deep depression after [[Emma Frost]], the former [[White Queen (comics)|White Queen]] of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], took over his body and used his powers at levels which Iceman himself had generally been unable to reach.  The White Queen believed that Iceman had the potential to be one of the most powerful mutants on earth.

[[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] broke up with [[Havok]] and Iceman admitted that he still had feelings for her.  The two have engaged in mild flirtation, but nothing serious has happened yet.  They do seem to be beginning a small relationship, however.

In ''House of M'' #8, it appeared that Iceman was among the many thousands of mutants who lost their powers due to the magic of the Scarlet Witch, having returned to his normal human form and noticeably sweating.

At the end of ''X-Men'' #178, while fighting some anti-mutant attackers, Iceman's powers seemingly reactivate. In ''X-Men'' #179, it was revealed Iceman didn't lose his powers, he was just scared by the events [[House of M]] and mentally turned them off. All he had to do was turn them back on.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:X-Factor 27.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Iceman creates an ice slide on the cover of ''X-Factor'' #27, 1988]]
Iceman's powers have evolved considerably over the years. Originally he had a normal human and an ice-form.  In normal human form, he had the strength, agility and durability of a typical athletic male of his size.  In his ice-form, his strength and durability was enhanced.

Iceman is able to lower his body temperature without harm to himself, reaching -105F within a few seconds.  He is able to freeze any moisture in the air around him into unusually hard ice to form ice-slides and various projectiles and shields.  Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures. Iceman has thermal vision: the ability to detect objects visually by how much heat the objects generate.

Over the years, his mutant physiology has gone through radical changes.  First, he was able to fashion an armor of densely packed snow around his human form when lowering his temperature; later, this became armor of solid ice.  Eventually, he was actually able to transform his body into organic ice in which his strength and endurance were augmented to enhanced levels, but when he turned his body back to normal, he would be an ordinary human.

For a time, Iceman could no longer revert to a human form.  He was constantly in a translucent organic ice-form.  Iceman is also able to reconstitute his ice-form if any part of it is damaged or even if it is completely shattered, without permanent harm to himself.  He is able to temporarilly add the mass of a body of water to his own to increase his mass, size and physical power.  His strength and durability in his ice-form are enhanced beyond normal human levels.  He can survive not only as sentient ice but as sentient water and vapor.  He has the capacity to manipulate all forms of moisture.  He has all of the abilities to generate projectiles, slides and shields that he always has had but they have been augmented greatly.  He can also deposit his bodily mass into a river or stream and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes.

Writers have implied that Iceman's lack of personal initiative has prevented him from discovering the deeper facets of his abilities and has led him instead to focus only on what might be the easiest manifestation of his abilities, the creation of ice.

As of "[[House of M]]" #8, it appeared that Iceman was among the many thousands of mutants who lost their powers due to the magic of the Scarlet Witch. At the end of issue #178 of "X-Men", however, Iceman was attacked by anti-mutant supporters and his powers reactivated. In "X-Men" #179, it was revealed Iceman didn't lose his powers, he was just scared by the events [[House of M]] and mentally turned them off. All he had to do was turn them back on.

==Ultimate Iceman==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Bobby Drake is 15 years old and the youngest founding member of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]].  He ran away from his family at the peak of government-supported [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks, fearing they would kill them if they found out he was a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]].

Bobby established himself as a valuable asset, even single-handedly taking out the [[Ultimates]] once with a gigantic ice wall (''see [[Ultimate War]]''), as well as single handedly halting an invasion by Colonel Wraith and Weapon X; Only to be stopped by Rogue who was in temproary possesion of Marvel Girl's telepathy.  It is also noteable that he seems to acquire more control of his ice powers as time passes.

During the World Tour arc, Bobby was greatly injured by Proteus, which resulted in a lawsuit issued by his parents against Xavier. Luckily Bobby rebelled against his parents and returned to the X-men not a moment too soon.

He has dated both [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], for a longer time and [[Shadowcat (comics)|Shadowcat]], who he recently broke up with.

Iceman was one of the three leads in the [[animated television series]] ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', in which he was voiced by [[Frank Welker]].

He also appeared in the ''X-Men'' [[X-Men (animated series)|animated series]] voiced by [[Dennis Akayama]] in the episode "Cold Comfort" where he gets Jubilee's help to rescue his girlfriend Lorna Dane (not called Polaris here) from a government facility which is housing the X-Factor led by the modern day [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].

He had also appeared in the ''X-Men: Evolution'' animated series played by [[Andrew Francis]].

In the movies ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' and the upcoming ''[[X-Men 3 (film)|X-Men 3]]'' movie he is played by [[Shawn Ashmore]].  Bobby Drake has a dating relationship with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and is a bit jealous over her, evidenced with his interactions with a returning [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who Rogue shows a bit of affection for.

{{wikibooks|Fighting Game Moves/Capcom/Iceman}}
Iceman has appeared in various video game adaptations, such as ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]],'' the subsequent [[Marvel vs. Capcom 2]] and the more recent [[X-Men Legends]] and its sequel [[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]].  In both of the Legends games, he is one of the quickest characters to become extremely powerful in melee combat.  A cursor of his ability to add his icy damage to his melee attacks and to his own defense.

In the [[Capcom]] games, he is especially notorious for his ability to take little to no blocking damage from projectile and beam attacks, special attacks in general, which combined with his powerful ice beam attacks make him an excellent defensive character.  In the competitive scene, he fell out of use as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] players evolved; Iceman's special attacks are vulnerable to Cable's instant super attacks.
