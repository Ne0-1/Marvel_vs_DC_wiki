'''Ice''' ('''Tora Olafsdotter''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in publications from [[DC Comics]]. Created by [[Keith Giffen]], [[J. M. DeMatteis]], and [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]], she first appeared in ''[[Justice League International]]'' #12 (April 1988).

==Publication history==
Ice is a separate character from [[Icemaiden]], although the two are similar in appearance, group affiliation, and powers. When Icemaiden first appeared, she had blue skin, pointy ears, and was named Sigrid Nansen. When the character joined [[Justice League International]], the comic book creators believed that her real name had never been given but were mistaken; it was revealed in the [[Global Guardians]] entry in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]''.

After Ice was killed, the original Icemaiden (Sigrid Nansen) joined the Justice League. A backstory revealed that she was the first Icemaiden, who quit the [[Global Guardians]] when Tora appeared.

==Fictional character biography==
===Global Guardians===
The princess of an isolated tribe of magic-wielding Norsemen, Tora Olafsdotter has the natural ability to create and manipulate ice. She joined the [[Global Guardians]] as Norway's member (replacing [[Icemaiden]] Sigrid Nansen) after they promised to protect her people.<ref name="dc-glob">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Global Guardians | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 138 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> After the Guardians' UN funding was withdrawn in the wake of the [[Justice League]]'s reformation as the Justice League International, her friend Green Flame (later [[Fire (comics)|Fire]]) talked her into walking up to a JLI embassy and asking for a job. Remarkably, in the wake of [[Black Canary]]'s resignation and the abduction of several members, the short-handed JLI took them on.

===Justice League===
[[Image:FireandIce.jpg|thumb|100px|Green Flame and Icemaiden]]
Ice's personality was a mix of girl-next-door wholesomeness and innocent-abroad naivet√©, which served as a contrast to the impulsive, libidinous traits of her friend and teammate [[Fire (comics)|Fire]]. The two changed their names from Green Flame and Icemaiden to Fire and Ice.

Ice served with the Justice League International for years (remaining with the American branch even after a European branch was opened), occasionally dated [[Green Lantern]] [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], and expressed an open crush (albeit unrequited) on [[Superman]] after he joined the team. Ice was present at Superman's death (in ''Superman'' #75). She was one of the few Justice Leaguers still standing after [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Superman's killer, had mauled the team.

She was killed by the [[Overmaster]] while under his mental influence. [[Mark Waid]], who wrote those issues, has admitted that the death was a mistake.[http://www.unheardtaunts.com/wir/c-mwaid.html]

Before her death, Ice displayed enhanced powers. This was after a battle with her brother, who had tried to conquer Ice's homeland.

===Ghost appearances=== 
Ice has appeared on several occasions since her death.
In ''Showcase '96'' #7, Fire and [[Sovereign Seven|Cruiser]] are involved in an accident which leaves them cold, tired, and snowbound. They swap their life stories, and as she begins to drift into unconsciousness, which would be fatal following her concussion, Fire sees a vision of her late friend Ice, who helps her decide to live. It is not revealed if Ice was a ghost or a figment of Fire's imagination, but Fire awoke to a warm burning fire and she and Cruiser had traded sitting positions.

Ice's spirit once again appears in ''JLA Annual'' #2. She and several other deceased JLA members are resurrected by [[Felix Faust]]. In the end, she sacrifices herself again to save the JLA from his dark magic, and recites the same final words she spoke when killed by the Overmaster.

Either the spirit or an illusion of Ice appeared in ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League]]'', in which she was (possibly mistakenly) damned to Hell or a similar dimension. After Fire and Guy Gardner negotiate her release, Fire looks behind to see that Ice is following while they leave, which violates Hell's [[Orpheus]] clause, causing Ice's spirit to vanish. Together Guy Gardner and Fire mourned the again-lost Ice, even though they had never been entirely certain that this manifestation was really her. It is implied that Ice vanished to [[Valhalla]].

===Resurrection===
While on mission in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Barbara Gordon]]'s [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] discover Ice unconscious within a [[Rocket Red Brigade|Rocket Red]] [[powered exoskeleton|exosuit]] which they wrest from the possession of an underworld figure, Kerimov. Kerimov has hired the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] to transport the exosuit, and the Birds of Prey and Secret Six would come to blows after [[Big Barda]] and [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] capture it. Kerimov plans to use the resurrection of a goddess to manipulate the Russian people by playing on their superstitions about ice princesses, and to use her great power to make himself a powerful ruler.

Tora, awakened by a member of the team, is enraged and unleashes her wrath upon both the Birds of Prey and [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]'s Secret Six: she seeks to avenge her own murder. Huntress' mention of [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], in addition to a hard slap, brings Ice back to her senses, while [[Deadshot]] dispatches Kerimov (as her savior, he retained influence over Tora). Ice leaves the country in the company of the Birds of Prey.

She meets up with Fire at a facility belonging to the [[United Nations]]-affiliated intelligence service [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]], where they talk about old times and catch up on current ones.

Although Ice is in the care of Fire and Checkmate, she has ventured out on occasion, helping Earth's heroes during the [[Sinestro Corps War]]. In the aftermath of the war, she decides to ice up [[Times Square]] in order to provide temporary fun for local children. There, Guy Gardner surprises her with a public kiss. She quickly rebukes his advances, indicating she needs more time. Guy agrees, then swiftly sets up a date for one month from that point.

Later Guy blames Bea for Tora's refusal to accept a cohabitation on [[Oa]].

During the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Tora is one of the first [[metahuman]]s infected by the [[Anti-Life Equation]] and turned into a new [[Justifiers|Justifier]]. In such role she attacks [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]], infecting Beatriz and her collaborators. Under the influence of the Equation, they murder anyone who gets in their way.

===Blackest Night===
In spite of earlier events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Tora is described as Guy Gardner's "on-off girlfriend" and is briefly seen in his arms as the former members of Justice League International visit the grave of [[Ted Kord]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (Sep. 2009)</ref> She is one of the heroes who have tried to defend Earth against the universal invasion from the [[Black Lantern Corps]] led by the demon lord [[Nekron]]. Despite being resurrected, Tora's previous deceased status allows a [[Power ring (weapon)|black power ring]] from the Black Lantern Corps to transform her into a Black Lantern.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (Jan. 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In addition to being a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, Ice can project in various forms quantities of ice and snow through her hands just enough to down an opponent. She can create platforms of ice upon which she can skate. Before her initial demise, she was powered-up mysteriously (later revealed to be the result of the Overmaster). She was able to generate larger amounts of ice and snow, and gained [[Superhuman strength|super strength]] and the ability to [[Flight|fly]]. After her resurrection in ''Birds of Prey'', Ice's powers seem incredibly destructive, expelling people from the building she's in as she awakens with bright white eyes, and conjuring a massive icy figure before her as well as controlling the weather to some degree, by causing the beginning of a blizzard far stronger than those known in that area.

==Other versions==

*At [[Toy Fair]] 2007, [[Mattel]] announced Fire and Ice [[action figure]]s would be released as part of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' line [http://www.collectorsquest.com/blog/2007/02/18/toy-fair-2007-mattel/].

*[[DC Direct]] will be releasing a line of Justice League International figures designed by Kevin Maguire. Ice will be included in that set, wearing her Global Guardians costume, which is what she wore during Maguire's run on the title.

*In [[Tangent Comics]] (taking place on Earth-96 of the Old Multiverse and Earth-9 of the New Multiverse) Ice is a female supervillain with cryo-kinetic powers and is a member of the [[Fatal Five]].

==In other media==

*Ice starred in the 1997 live action [[television pilot]] ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]''. She was played by [[Kimberly Oja]]. In this version she was a [[Meteorology|meteorologist]] who gained her powers from exposure to the villain's weather-control machine. She also began a relationship with the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]].

*Ice and [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] have both made several appearances in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]], though only Fire had speaking roles. Fire and Ice are often seen together in the animated series, as is the case in the comics. Ice's costume is a leotard with an iceberg insignia on the chest. She sports short, white hair.
