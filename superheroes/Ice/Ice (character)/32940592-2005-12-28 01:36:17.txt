'''Ice''' (Tora Olafsdotter) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superheroine]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

==Character Biography==
The princess of an isolated tribe of magic-wielding Norsemen, Tora Olafsdotter has the natural ability to create and manipulate ice. She joined the [[Global Guardians]] as Norway's member (replacing [[Icemaiden]] Sigrid Nansen) after they promised to protect her people, but after the Guardians' UN funding was withdrawn in the wake of the [[Justice League]]'s reformation as the Justice League International, her friend Green Flame (later [[Fire (comics)|Fire]]) talked her into walking up to a JLI embassy and asking for a job. Remarkably, in the wake of [[Black Canary]]'s resignation and the abduction of several members, the short-handed JLI took them on.

The comic's writers later admitted having brought her into the League with the intention of killing her off within a year, but were surprised by how popular she quickly became, and decided to keep her. Ice's personality was an amusing mix of girl-next-door wholesomeness and innocent-abroad naivety, which served as an excellent contrast to the impulsive, even libidinous traits of her friend and teammate Fire.

Ice served with the Justice League International for years (remaining with the American branch even after a European branch was opened), occaisonally dated [[Green Lantern]] [[Guy Gardner]] and even pursued a brief romance with [[Superman]] after he joined the team. Unfortuantely, her original editorial fate caught up with her and she was killed while mind-controlled by the [[Overmaster]]. [[Mark Waid]], who wrote those issues, has admitted that that was a mistake on his part.

Before her untimely death, Ice displayed amplified ice-generating powers as well as new ones (flight and limited super-strength) as a result of a battle with her brother.

==Appearances in other media==
Ice appeared in the disastrous 1997 live action made-for-TV movie [[Justice League of America]]. She was played by Kimberly Oja. 
 
Ice and [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] have have both made several appearances in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[animated series]].
