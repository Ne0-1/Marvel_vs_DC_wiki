The '''Enclave''' is a fictional subversive organization of [[dictator]]ially-minded scientists featured in [[comics]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters are a part of the [[Marvel Universe]].  

==Fictional organization history==
The organization that would eventually become known as the Enclave was founded by four scientists, each of whom was a world-class scientist in a different area of expertise:

* Dr. Jerome Hamilton, an American medical biologist (now deceased)
* Maris Morlak, a Lithuanian nuclear physicist
* Professor Wladyslav Shinsky, a Polish geneticist
* Carlo Zota, a Spanish electronics technician.

The goal of the organization was to use advanced technology to establish a benevolent world dictatorship under the rule of the scientists. The four scientists successfully faked their own deaths and disappeared from society, founding the Citadel of Science (a.k.a. the "Beehive"; an island in the North Atlantic Ocean) using both their own technology and abandoned [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] technology they had found. Their operations were initially funded by their own personal fortunes, and they hired mercenaries as additional personnel as needed. The scientists began their advanced scientific research and development, achieving various scientific breakthroughs and creating many advanced inventions. Before long, their level of technology was more advanced than most known on Earth.

The scientists' first major accomplishment was the creation of the superhumanly powerful humanoid being they referred to as "[[Adam Warlock|Him]]" (who would one day become known as '''Adam Warlock'''). The scientists abducted [[Alicia Masters]] to sculpt his likeness.  The scientists lost control of Him, who wrecked their citadel. The [[Fantastic Four]] discovered the scientists' existence and came to rescue Alicia, and as they battled the scientists Jerome Hamilton was killed as a result.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #66-67</ref>

The scientists were not discouraged by their failure with Him or the death of Hamilton, and so created another superhumanly powerful humanoid they called "[[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Paragon]]" (who would later become known as '''Her''' and '''Kismet'''). Although they enlisted [[Doctor Strange]] to perform brain surgery on Paragon, they lost control of her as well, and she destroyed the rebuilt citadel.  The scientists battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Doctor Strange, and Paragon before she departed.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #6</ref>

Taking the name the '''Enclave''', the scientists financed Security College in New York State. The College was actually part of an information-gathering scheme, and the Enclave hired the [[Monocle (Marvel Comics)|Monocle]] to acquire industrial, military, and political information from students. However, the Security College operation was uncovered, and the Monocle was defeated by the [[Human Torch]] and [[Spider-Man]] and then killed by the Enclave who abandoned the operation. Thanks to their efforts though, the Enclave learned of the [[Inhumans]], and abducted [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #207</ref>

The Enclave made an alliance with [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], and successfully infiltrated [[Attilan]] as part of an attempt to conquer the Inhumans' Great Refuge. The Enclave attacked the Inhumans, but were betrayed by Maximus and defeated.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #240</ref> With Maximus again, they launched an attack on Earth from Attilan in an attempt to foment war between Earth and the Inhumans. This plan failed, and they instead battled the Avengers and Inhumans.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #12</ref> Morlak and Zota were captured and imprisoned.

Morlak and Zota were later freed from prison by Shinski. All three were injured in an airplane crash, captured, and hospitalized.<ref>''Avengers'' #262-263</ref>

The Enclave later created a female version of Warlock.<ref>''Warlock'' vol. 5 #1-4 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005), by writer [[Greg Pak]] and artist [[Charles Adlard]]</ref>

==Crucible==
'''Crucible''' is the supervillain identity used by Maris Morlak and Professor Wladyslav Shinsky, two members of the Enclave. Crucible went after [[Mister Fantastic]] in a plot to steal his inventive genius and kick-start the Enclave's genetics program. They wore identical suits of [[powered exoskeleton|power armor]], forged by the same monks who forged [[Doctor Doom]]'s armor, which have the ability to transmute the shape and composition of materials.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Enclave===
In the [[Ultimate Extinction]] miniseries, it was revealed that a group of scientists rented a radio telescope, applied their own algorithms to it, and were able to see a 'processional entity' (the creature known as Gah-Lak-Tus, the Ultimate version of [[Galactus]]) which would arrive within 20 years. To fight the entity when it arrived, they hired Heather Moon, a contract killer (and the Ultimate version of the Avenger [[Moondragon]]), cloned her, and raised the clones to be an army against Gah-Lak-Tus. The clones refer to the scientists as 'the Enclave', but it also operates as the Paragon Corporation.

===Other groups called "The Enclave"===
There is another, unrelated Enclave in Marvel Comics that first appeared in the pages of ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' vol. 2 #2 in December 1979. This Enclave was an organization of occultists dedicated to the worship of the demon [[Asmodeus (Marvel Comics)#Other characters named Asmodeus|Asmodeus]]. They were enemies of the [[Dimensional Man]] and [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' vol. 2 #2</ref>  This group was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==In other media==
===Video games===
* The Enclave appears in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' video game. The leaders of Enclave are depicted as scientists in full high-tech body armor, each with their own private army. Their leaders are referred to as Ceres Leader (voiced by [[Simbi Kali Williams]]), Jupiter Leader (voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]]), Minerva Leader (voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]]), and Vulcan Leader (voiced by [[Dave Wittenberg]]). Ceres Sector is Enclave's chemical weapon and genetic engineering specialists where they try to eliminate [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and set up Earthquake Bombs. Minerva Sector ended up using chemical bombs, mind-control devices, and [[Bi-Beast]] in their plans. Jupiter Sector used Earthquake Generators and orbiting laser satellites to attack Hulk. Vulcan Sector unleashed Kyklops and tried to steal the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] armors. Their soldiers consist of normal soldiers and the mutated soldiers called Barbarias. After the game, bonus levels involved destroying the remaining Enclave bases and defeating their leaders. After the section's headquarters are demolished, the Enclave leaders will attack in different ways besides using the energy attacks emitted from their high-tech staffs. Vulcan will attack Hulk with orbital satellite lasers, Ceres will attack Hulk with Bi-Beast clones, Minerva will clone herself, and Jupiter will call forth lightning.
