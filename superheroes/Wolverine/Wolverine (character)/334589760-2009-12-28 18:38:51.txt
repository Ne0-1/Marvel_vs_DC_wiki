'''Wolverine''' is a [[fictional]] [[Canadian]] [[superhero]] who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Born '''James Howlett'''<ref>[[Bill Jemas]], [[Joe Quesada]] and [[Paul Jenkins]]. ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'' [[Marvel Comics]] 2001-2002</ref> and commonly known as '''Logan''', Wolverine is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, retracting bone claws, and a [[healing factor]] that allows him to quickly recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin, also enabling him to live beyond a normal human lifespan. This healing ability enabled the [[supersoldier]] program [[Weapon X]] to bond the near indestructible metal [[alloy]] [[adamantium]] to his [[human skeleton|skeleton]] and claws without killing him.  He is most often depicted as a member of the [[X-Men]].

The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #180 ([[1974#October|October 1974]]) and was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita Sr.]], who designed the character, and was first drawn for publication by [[Herb Trimpe]].<ref>[http://www.oocities.com/Area51/Chamber/8346/trimpe.interview.2.html Green Skin's Grab-Bag: "An Interview with Herb Trimpe", p. 2]: "That was John Romita's design. I drew him first in ''Hulk-'' #181 [sic]. But it was Romita's vision based on Len's idea".</ref>  Wolverine later joined the X-Men's "All New, All Different" roster in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975). ''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] played a significant role in the character's subsequent development<ref name="Sanderson">Sanderson, Peter. "Wolverine: The Evolution of a Character," ''The Incredible Hulk and Wolverine'' vol. 1, #1 (Marvel Comics, October 1986)</ref> as well as artist/writer [[John Byrne]], who insisted on making the character older than the other X-Men. Artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] collaborated with Claremont and helped to revise the character with a four-part eponymous limited series from September to December 1982 in which Wolverine's catch phrase, "I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do isn't very nice," debuted.

Wolverine was typical of the many tough anti-authority [[anti-hero]]es that emerged in American popular culture after the [[Vietnam War]];<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Johns Hopkins, 2001. Pg. 265</ref> his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for [[comic book]] anti-heroes by the end of the 1980s.<ref>Wright, pg. 277</ref> As a result, the character became the clear favorite for fans of the increasingly popular X-Men franchise.<ref>Wright, pg 263, 265</ref> Wolverine has been featured in his own solo comic since 1988 and has been a central character in every X-Men adaptation, including [[List of animated television series|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and the [[live-action]] [[20th Century Fox]] [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], in which he is portrayed by [[Hugh Jackman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/ |title=X-Men IMDb|accessdate=2007-05-03 }}</ref> In May 2008, Wolverine was ranked #1 out of "[[Wizard Magazine]]'s Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time"<ref>http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05230810thgreatestcharacters3.html</ref> and was ranked #4 of "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters" by [[Empire Magazine]] in July 2008.<ref name="E #50">[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=4 ''Empire Top 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters'', July 2008]</ref>

==Publication history==
[[Image:inchulk181.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Wolverine made his debut in
 the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. ''The Incredible Hulk'' #181 (Nov. 1974). Art by [[Herb Trimpe]].]]
Wolverine first appeared in the final "teaser" panel of ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #180 ([[cover date]] Oct. 1974) written by Len Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications in early July (cover date November) before making his first major appearance in ''Hulk'' #181 (cover date November 1974) again by Wein and Trimpe. John Romita, Sr. designed Wolverine's yellow-and-blue costume. The character's introduction was ambiguous, revealing little beyond his being a [[superhuman]] agent of the [[Canada|Canadian]] government. In these appearances, he does not retract his claws, although Len Wein stated they had always been envisaged as retractable.<ref name="retractable">{{cite news |url=http://woodwardiocom.livejournal.com/326299.html#LenWein |publisher=Jonathan Woodward |title=CONvergence I, Len Wein |date=July 8, 2005}}</ref> He appears briefly in the finale to this story in ''Hulk'' #182.

Wolverine's next appearance was in 1975's ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, written by Wein and penciled by [[Dave Cockrum]], in which Wolverine is recruited for a new squad. [[Gil Kane]] illustrated the cover artwork but incorrectly drew Wolverine's mask with larger headpieces. Dave Cockrum liked Kane's accidental alteration (believing it to be similar to [[Batman]]'s mask) and incorporated it into his own artwork for the actual story.<ref>Brian Cunningham, "Dressed to Kill", ''Wizard Tribute to Wolverine'', 1996.</ref> Cockrum was also the first artist to draw Wolverine without his mask, and the distinctive hairstyle became a trademark of the character.<ref name="Sanderson" />

A revival of ''X-Men'' followed, beginning with ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #94 (Aug. 1975), drawn by Cockrum and written by Chris Claremont. In ''X-Men'' and ''Uncanny X-Men'', Wolverine is initially overshadowed by the other characters, although he does create tension in the team as he is attracted to [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops']] girlfriend, [[Jean Grey]]. As the series progressed, Claremont and Cockrum (who preferred [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]<ref name="X-Men Companion">''X-Men Companion''</ref>) considered dropping Wolverine from the series;<ref name="X-Men Companion"/> Cockrum's successor, artist [[John Byrne]], championed the character, later explaining, as a Canadian himself, he did not want to see a Canadian character dropped.<ref name="Sanderson" /><ref>DeFalco, Tom. ''Comic Creators on X-Men''. Titan, 2006. Pg. 110</ref> Byrne created [[Alpha Flight]], a group of Canadian superheroes who try to recapture Wolverine due to the expense their government incurred training him. Later stories gradually establish Wolverine's murky past and unstable nature, which he battles to keep in check. Byrne also designed a new brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine, but retained the distinctive Cockrum cowl.

Following Byrne's departure, Wolverine remained in ''X-Men''. The character's growing popularity led to a solo, four-issue [[limited series]], ''Wolverine'' (Sept.-Dec. 1982), by Claremont and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], followed by the six-issue ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' by Claremont and [[Al Milgrom]] (November 1984 - April 1985). Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by [[John Buscema]] in November 1988. It ran for 189 issues. [[Larry Hama]] later took over the series and had an extensive run. Other writers who wrote for the two ''Wolverine'' ongoing series include [[Peter David]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Erik Larsen]], [[Frank Tieri (writer)|Frank Tieri]], [[Greg Rucka]], and [[Mark Millar]]. Many popular artists have also worked on the series, including John Byrne, [[Marc Silvestri]], [[Mark Texeira]], [[Adam Kubert]], [[Leinil Francis Yu]], [[Rob Liefeld]], [[Sean Chen]], [[Darick Robertson]], [[John Romita, Jr.]], and [[Humberto Ramos]]. During the 1990s, the character was revealed to have bone claws, after his adamantium is ripped out by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #25, which was inspired by a passing joke of Peter David's.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brian Cronin|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #96|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=29 March 2007| url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-96/| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

In addition to the ''Wolverine'' series and appearances in the various ''X-Men'' series, two other storylines expand upon the character's past: "Weapon X", by writer-artist [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], serialized in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #72-84 (1991); and ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'', a six-issue limited series by co-writers [[Joe Quesada]], [[Paul Jenkins]], and [[Bill Jemas]] and artist [[Andy Kubert]] (Nov. 2001 -  July 2002). A second solo series, ''Wolverine: Origins'', written by [[Daniel Way]] with art by [[Steve Dillon]], [[Spin-off (media)|spun out of]] and runs concurrently with the second ''Wolverine'' solo series.

===Wolverine's first intended origin=== 	
Despite suggestions that co-creator Len Wein originally intended for Logan to be a mutated wolverine cub, evolved to humanoid form by the [[High Evolutionary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/10/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-21/|title=CBR.cc: Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #21|accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref> Wein denies this:
{{cquote|While I readily admit that my original idea was for Wolvie's claws to extend from the backs of his gloves ... I absolutely ''did not'' ever intend to make Logan a mutated wolverine. I write stories about human beings, not evolved animals (with apologies for any story I may have written that involved the High Evolutionary). The mutated wolverine thing came about long after I was no longer involved with the book. I'm not certain if the idea was first suggested by [[Chris Claremont]], the late, much-missed [[Dave Cockrum]], or [[John Byrne]] when he came aboard as artist, but it most certainly ''did not'' start with me.<ref name=saywhat>[http://lenwein.blogspot.com/2009/02/say-what.html#links WeinWords (Len Wein blog), "Say What?"], February 24, 2009</ref>}}

Wein has stated in a conversation with Stan Lee include on the X-Men Origins: Wolverine blu-ray special features that he has read 'Ten things you did not know about Wolverine' which states that he was originally intended to be a mutated wolverine cub, and this re-kindled Wein's frustration. He again stated that he had "always known that Wolverine was a mutant."{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In ''X-Men'' #98 (April 1976), a biological analysis of Wolverine suggests that he was in some way different from the other X-Men, and in ''X-Men'' #103, Wolverine says he does not believe in [[leprechaun]]s, to which the leprechaun replies, "Maybe leprechauns don't believe in talkin' wolverines, either."<ref>''X-Men'' #103 (Feb. 1977), p.14, panel 3</ref>

In an article about the evolution of Wolverine included in a 1986 reprint of ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180-181, titled ''Incredible Hulk and Wolverine'', Cockrum is quoted as saying that he considered having the [[High Evolutionary]] play a vital role in making Wolverine a human.<ref name="Sanderson" /> Writer Wein wanted Wolverine to be the age of a young adult, with superhuman strength and agility similar to [[Spider-Man]]. This changed when Wein saw Cockrum's drawing of the unmasked Wolverine as a hairy 40-year-old.<ref name="Sanderson" /> Wein originally intended the claws to be retractable and part of Wolverine's gloves, and both gloves and claws would be made of adamantium.<ref name=saywhat /> Chris Claremont eventually revealed that they were an integrated part of Wolverine's anatomy in ''X-Men'' #98 (April 1976).

===Wolverine's second intended origin===

John Byrne said in interviews and on his website that he drew a possible face for Wolverine but then learned that John Romita Sr. had already drawn one that Dave Cockrum used in X-Men #98 (April 1976), long before Byrne's run on the series.<ref>http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#42</ref><ref>http://www.oafe.net/yo/mlfo2_ws.php</ref> Later, Byrne used the drawing for the face of Sabretooth, an enemy of the martial artist superhero Iron Fist, whose stories Chris Claremont was writing. Byrne then had the idea of Sabretooth being Wolverine's father.<ref name="loganfiles.com">http://loganfiles.com/w-relationship.html</ref><ref>http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#207</ref> Together, Byrne and Claremont came up with Wolverine being approximately 60 years old and having served in World War II after escaping from Sabretooth, who was approximately 120 years old and had been abusing Wolverine for decades.<ref name="loganfiles.com"/> The plan had been for Wolverine to have been almost crushed in an accident; he would discover, when attempting to stand for the first time after recovering, that his healing factor does not work on bones, and his legs immediately break. He then spends over a decade in a hospital bed, almost going mad, when the Canadian government approaches him with the idea of replacing his skeleton one bone at a time with adamantium, the claws being a surprise. This origin, too, was never used.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Wolverine-first-claws.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wolverine first uses his claws in ''Origin #2.'']]
{{Main|Fictional history of Wolverine}}
As shown in the 2001-2002 miniseries ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'', Wolverine was born as James Howlett in late 19th century [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] to rich plantation owners.

The character grows into manhood on a mining colony in [[British Columbia|Northern British Columbia]], adopting the name "Logan."<ref>''Origin'' #1-6</ref>  Logan leaves the colony and lives for a time in the wilderness among wolves, until returning to civilization, residing with the [[Blackfoot Indians]].  Following the death of his Blackfoot paramour, [[Silver Fox]], he is ushered into a Canadian military unit. Logan then spends some time in [[Madripoor]], before settling in Japan, where he marries [[Itsu (comics)|Itsu]] and has a son, [[Daken]].

During [[World War II]], Logan serves in the [[Devil's Brigade]] and teams up with [[Captain America]] and continues a career as a soldier-of-fortune/adventurer. Logan then serves with the [[1st Canadian Parachute Battalion|First Canadian Parachute Battalion]]<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Marvel Comics|title=''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #34}}</ref> during [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] before being recruited by Team X, a black ops unit.

As a member of Team X, Logan is given false memory implants.  He continues on the team, until he is able to break free of the mental control and joins the Canadian Defense Ministry. Logan is subsequently kidnapped by the [[Weapon X]] program, where he remained captive and experimented on, until he escapes, as shown in [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s "Weapon X" storyline which ran in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''. It is during his imprisonment by [[Weapon X]] that he has unbreakable adamantium forcibly fused onto his bones.

Logan is eventually discovered by [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James]] and [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]], who help him recover his humanity.  Following his recovery, Logan, this time under the supervision of [[Department H]], once again works as an intelligence operative for the Canadian government.  Logan becomes Wolverine, one of Canada's first superheroes. In his first mission, he is dispatched to stop the destruction caused by a brawl between the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #180-181</ref>

Later on, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] recruits Wolverine to a new team of X-Men. Disillusioned with his Canadian intelligence work and intrigued by Xavier's offer, Logan resigns from Department H.<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1</ref> It was later revealed, however, that Professor X had wiped Logan's memories and forced him to join the X-Men after Wolverine was sent to assassinate Xavier.<ref>''House of M'' #1</ref>

In ''X-Men'' #25 (1993), at the culmination of the "[[Fatal Attractions]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]], the [[supervillain]] [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] forcibly removes the adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton.  This massive trauma causes his healing factor to burn out and also leads to the discovery that his claws are actually bone. Wolverine leaves the X-Men for a time, embarking on a series of adventures during which his healing factor returns, greatly increased in speed and efficiency (due to the fact that the adamantium in his bones used a considerable amount of his healing factor on a constant basis). After his return to the X-Men, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s son [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] kidnaps Wolverine and attempts to re-bond adamantium to his skeleton.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #99-100</ref>  This is unsuccessful and causes Wolverine's mutation to accelerate out of control. He is temporarily changed into a semi-sentient beast-like form in which he gains greater physical power than ever before, at the price of part of his humanity. Eventually, the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] captures Wolverine, brainwashes him into becoming the Horseman Death, and successfully re-bonds adamantium to his skeleton.  Wolverine overcomes Apocalypse's programming and returns to the X-Men.

In 2005, author [[Brian Michael Bendis]] had Wolverine join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. After the [[miniseries]] ''[[House of M]]'', Wolverine regains his memories and prepares to seek out and enact vengeance on those who wronged him. In ''Wolverine: Origins'', the character's second solo series, Wolverine discovers that he has a son named [[Daken]] who has been brainwashed and made a living weapon by the villain [[Romulus (Marvel Comics)|Romulus]], the man behind Wolverine's own brainwashing. Wolverine then makes it his mission to rescue Daken and stop Romulus from manipulating or harming anyone again.

During the events of the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' storyline Cyclops orders Wolverine to reform [[X-Force]]. Since then Wolverine and the team, initially consisting of [[X-23]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], have starred in a new monthly title. Currently the team is featured in the ''[[Messiah War]]'' storyline that is a sequel to ''Messiah Complex''.

In 2008, the writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Steve McNiven]] explored a possible future for Wolverine in an eight-issue story arc entitled "[[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Old Man Logan|Old Man Logan]]" that debuted with ''Wolverine'' #66. Millar, the writer for the story, said, "It's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|The Dark Knight Returns]] for Wolverine, essentially. The big, wide, show-stopping series that plays around with the most popular Marvel character of the last forty years, a dystopian vision of the Marvel Universe and a unique look at their futures. The heroes have gone, the villains have won and we're two generations away from the Marvel we know".<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144471 Millar On "Old Man Logan" - Newsarama<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Wolverine is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology. His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant [[healing factor]], that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. This power facilitated the artificial improvements he was subjected to under the [[Weapon X]] program, in which his skeleton was reinforced with the indestructible metal adamantium.

Depictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds,<ref>''X-Men''  #107 (Oct. 1977)</ref> but writers have steadily increased this ability over the years. After several years, Wolverine's healing factor was depicted as healing severe wounds within a matter of days or hours.<ref name="Wolverine vol.1 #2 Oct. 1982">''Wolverine'' vol.1 #2 (Oct. 1982)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents vol.1 #86-90 (1991)</ref> Other writers went on to increase Wolverine's healing factor to the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #92 (Aug. 1995)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #115 (Aug. 1997)</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol.2 #150 (Feb. 2004)</ref> Among the more extreme depictions of Wolverine's healing factor include fully healing after being caught near the center of an [[atomic explosion]]<ref>''Logan'' mini-series #2 (June 2008)</ref> and the total regeneration of his soft body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #43 (Aug. 2006)</ref> It has been stated in the [[Xavier Protocols]], a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to "incredible levels" and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to [[decapitation|decapitate]] him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol.1 #100</ref> It's possible for the efficiency of his healing powers to be suppressed. For example, if an object composed of [[Adamantium#Carbonadium|carbonadium]] is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically though they are not fully suppressed.<ref>"Wolverine: Origins" vol.1#7</ref> His healing factor can also be greatly suppressed by the Muramasa blade, a [[katana]] of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #39 (Oct. 2009</ref> His healing factor also dramatically slows his aging process. Despite being born in the late 1800s,<ref>''Origin'' mini-series</ref> he has the appearance and vitality of a man in his physical prime. Though he now has all of his memories, his healing abilities can provide increased recovery from psychological trauma by suppressing memories in which he experiences profound distress.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #175</ref>  In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins.  However, he still suffers the immediate effects of such substances; he has been shown to become intoxicated after significant dosages of alcoholic beverages,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.1 #3 (Nov. 1982)</ref> and has been incapacitated on several occasions with drugs and poisons.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents vol.1 #87 (1991)</ref>

Although his body heals, the healing factor doesn't suppress the pain he endures while injured.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #65 (Oct. 2007)</ref>  He does not enjoy being hurt and sometimes has to work himself up for situations where extreme pain is certain.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2, #105 (Sept. 1996)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3, #64 (Jun. 2008)</ref>  Wolverine, on occasion, has deliberately injured himself or allowed himself to be injured for varying reasons, including freeing himself from capture,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2, #98 (Feb. 1996)</ref> intimidation,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #184 (Feb. 2003)</ref> strategy,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3, #63 (May. 2008)</ref> or simply indulging his feral nature.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #90 (Feb. 1995)</ref><ref>''Wolverine Annual'' '95 (June. 1995)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2, #186 (Apr. 2003)</ref>

Wolverine's mutation also consists of animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.1 #2</ref> the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #75</ref> The claws are not made of [[keratin]], as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone, and can cut substances as durable as most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone. They can also be used to block attacks or projectiles, as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #91 and #101</ref> Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a moment of intense pain each and every time he does so.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 # 77</ref>

Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, is molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself, and [[Captain America's shield]], which is the only substance in the [[Marvel Universe]] known to be even more durable than adamantium.<ref>''Captain America Comics Annual'' #8 (1986)</ref> Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. The adamantium also weights his blows, increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities.<ref name="Wolverine vol.1 #2 Oct. 1982"/> However, this also makes him exceptionally susceptible to [[Magnetism|magnetic]] based attacks.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.2 #25 (Oct. 1993)</ref>

Wolverine's healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.2 #5</ref> Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #5, ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004''</ref> Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury.<ref name="Wolverine vol.2 #1">''Wolverine'' vol.2, #1 (Nov. 1988)</ref> This, coupled by the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #57</ref> grants him some degree of superhuman strength. Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton.<ref>''Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004'' #1</ref> He has been depicted breaking steel chains,<ref>''X-Men'' #111 (June 1978)</ref><ref>''Wolverine: The Amazing Immortal Man & Other Bloody Tales'' #1 (July 2008)</ref><ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #32 (March 2009)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3, #51</ref> lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall<ref name="Wolverine vol.2 #1"/> and lifting [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] (in grizzly bear form) over his head before tossing him across a room.<ref>''Wolverine: First Class'' #8 (Dec. 2008)</ref>

Wolverine's senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to both hear sounds ordinary humans can't and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify [[List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Shapeshifting|shapeshifting]] mutants despite other forms they may take.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2, # 51 (Feb. 1992)</ref> He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing, through concentration, as a type of natural [[lie detector]], such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent when a lie is told.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #9 (Feb. 2007)</ref>

Due to high level [[psionic]] shields implanted by [[Professor Charles Xavier]], Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault and probing.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3, #46 (Nov. 2006)</ref> Wolverine's mind also possesses what he refers to as "psychic scar tissue" created by so many traumatic events over the course of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a psychic as powerful as [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''X-Men: Original Sin'' #1 (Dec. 2008)</ref>

===Skills and personality=== 	
During his time in Japan and other countries, Wolverine becomes an expert of virtually all forms of [[martial arts]] and is familiar with and experienced in virtually every fighting style on Earth. He is proficient with most weaponry, including firearms, though he is partial to bladed weapons. He has demonstrated sufficient skills to defeat the likes of [[Shang-Chi]]<ref>''X-Men'' vol.2, #62 (March 1997)</ref> and [[Captain America]]<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #4-5</ref> in single combat. He also has a wide knowledge of the body and [[pressure point]]s.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.2, #108 (Jan. 2001)/''Wolverine'' vol.3, #20 (Dec. 2004)</ref> He is also an accomplished [[aviator|pilot]] and highly skilled in the field of [[espionage]] and covert operations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Wolverine will sometimes lapse into a "[[berserker]] rage" while in close combat. In this state he lashes out with the intensity and aggression of an enraged animal and is even more resistant to psionic attack.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2, #168 (Nov. 2001)</ref> Though he loathes it, he acknowledges that it has saved his life many times.  Despite his apparent ease at taking lives, he does not enjoy killing or giving in to his berserker rages. Logan adheres to a firm [[Bushido|code]] of personal [[honor]] and [[morality]].<ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 2, #1 (Nov. 1988) "I'm an X-Man. [...] With them, killing is a last resort. With me, it's second nature. I take the world as it is, and give better than I get. Come at me with a sword. I'll meet you with a sword. You want mercy. Show a little first.  [...] Some of those folks died fighting... some praying... some accepted their fate... some cursed it... some begged for their lives... most were terrified. Details don't matter.  What's important is that they died. And those scales have to be balanced. In kind".</ref>

In contrast to his brutish nature, Wolverine is extremely intelligent. Due to his increased lifespan, he has traveled the world and amassed extensive knowledge of foreign languages and cultures.  He can speak [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Arab language|Arabic]], and [[Lakota language|Lakota]]; he also has some knowledge of [[French language|French]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Indian Language|Hindi]] .<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Wolverine

When [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] monitors Wolverine's vitals during a Danger Room training session, he calls Logan's physical and mental state "equivalent of an Olympic-level gymnast performing a gold medal routine while simultaneously beating four [[chess]] computers in his head."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Marvel Comics|title=''Wolverine'' vol.2, #51 (Feb. 1992)}}</ref>

Wolverine is frequently depicted as a gruff [[loner]], often taking leave from the X-Men to deal with personal issues or problems. He is often irreverent and rebellious towards authority figures, though he is a reliable ally and capable leader. He has been a mentor and father figure to several younger women, especially [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and [[Kitty Pryde]], and has had romantic relationships with numerous women (most notably [[Mariko Yashida]]<ref>''Wolverine''  #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 1982)</ref>), as well as a mutual{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} but unfulfilled attraction to [[Jean Grey]], leading to jealous run-ins with her boyfriend (later husband), [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]]. He also married Viper,<ref>''Wolverine'' #126, 1998</ref> and then later divorced her.<ref>''Wolverine'' #169, 2001</ref>

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternate versions of Wolverine}}
As one of Marvel's flagship characters, Wolverine has seen many adaptations and re-imaginings. For example, an issue of ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' featured a planet of Wolverines. In the ''[[Marvel Mangaverse]]'', Wolverine is even the founder of the X-Men. In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Wolverine appears zombified alongside Marvel's other major players. The [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics sought to ingrain Wolverine into its ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' title from the onset. The latest alternate version is seen in the [[Old Man Logan]] storyline set in an alternate timeline 50 years into the future where the world's superhuman heroes are dead. In this timeline, Wolverine has aged considerably and has become a [[pacifist]].

==In other media==
{{Main|Wolverine in other media}}
Wolverine is one of the very few X-Men characters to be included in every media adaptation of the ''X-Men'' franchise, including film, television, [[Video game|computer and video games]], and is the only one to have starred in his own video games (e.g., ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]], [[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'').

[[Marvel Animation]] has completed the first season of a current animated series, ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', in which Wolverine leads the [[X-Men]] while [[Charles Xavier]] and [[Jean Grey]] are missing. The series has aired the full first season in Canada and is in the middle of the first season in the U.S. (aired on [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]]'s Nicktoons channel, as of May 2009). Season two is in post production and season three has been signed for 26 episodes. The series features a more Manga-styled depiction of Wolverine and select X-Men members.

[[20th Century Fox]], in association with [[Marvel Studios]], released an X-Men spin-off movie based on Wolverine, titled ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', which stars Hugh Jackman returning as the title character. [[Gavin Hood]] directed the film, which was released in North America on May 1, 2009 and on April 29, 2009 in Australia, the UK and France.

[[Troye Mellet]] plays the young Wolverine.<ref>{{cite news | author = Shannon Harvey | title = Perth boy to play young Hugh Jackman in Wolverine movie | publisher = [[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] | date = 29 February 2008 | url = http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,23297937-5012990,00.html | accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> The film is based around Wolverine's time in the army with [[Victor Creed]]/[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and then explores how they gradually came to be enemies. [[William Stryker]] and Victor Creed are the main antagonists in the film and are played by [[Danny Huston]] and [[Liev Schreiber]].

In the game ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance]]'', Wolverine stars as one of the four main heroes, with the others being [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He is also a playable character in the games ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' and many others. (See [[List of X-Men video games]] for more details).
