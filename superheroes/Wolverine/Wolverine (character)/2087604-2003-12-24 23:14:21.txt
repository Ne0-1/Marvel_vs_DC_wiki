'''Wolverine''' (real name possibly James Howlett, often called simply Logan) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[X-Men]].  He first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #180.  [[Len Wein]] is the writer credited with creating the character.  Other writers such as [[Chris Claremont]], [[John Byrne]], and [[Frank Miller]] are also responsible for much of the character's develpment.

<!-- Wish I knew who created him (was it Len Wein and Herb Trimpe?) and what year that comic appeared in. -->

==History==

<!-- This skips over a lot of his history, such as the Origin and Weapon X series.  It'd be nice to work them in here somehow, without too many spoilers. -mhr -->

<!--I decided to skip over alot of the recent stories that seem to contradict each other and don't really reflect the spirit of the character as presented by writers like Chris Claremont and John Byrne . I mainly just stuck to the aspects of the character that are most key.-->

The character who would later become Wolverine made his first appearance as a [[Canada|Canadian]] superhero fighting the [[anti-hero]] known as The Incredible Hulk. Wolverine was originally known as [[Weapon X]]. Since then, he has had a long and varied career, most notably as a member of the X-Men.

His first appearance was in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180, though he only appeared in a single panel, not being fully introduced until the next issue.  He was able to fight both the Hulk and the [[Wendigo]] to a virtual standstill in his first appearance, and his nature and powers remained vague.

Wolverine joined the X-Men in ''Giant Sized X-Men'' #1 ([[1975]]).  It was here that it was revealed that he is a [[mutant]] with an ability to heal rapidly, who has a skeleton and retractable claws both laced with the unbreakable (fictional) metal [[adamantium]]. When working for the Canadian government he was supposed to become the leader of the incipient team of superhuman mutants who would later be known as [[Alpha Flight]]. However, Wolverine instead chose to join the X-Men and left the country.  This decision would come to plague the X-Men as the Alpha Flight would fight the X-men in an effort to kidnap Wolverine and force him to fufill his contract with the Canadian government.

Logan has had some very complicated romantic entanglements. He had a romantic interest in [[Jean Grey]] (who shared the attraction), but as she was already in a relationship with the team leader, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], their love would go unrequited.  This created tension between Wolverine and Cyclops, though the two shared a bond of mutual respect. Wolverine was engaged to Lady Mariko Yashida of a [[Japan]]ese crime family, Clan Yashida, at one time.  He was forced to kill her father, Shingen, in a duel and single-handedly destroyed Shingen's crime cartel. Mariko and Logan became estranged due to the strange honor customs of her family and once they were finally reunited she was poisoned by Reiko, an assassin for the Yakuza, (Japanese Mafia).  She asked Logan to save her from the horrible death and he obeyed by using his claws to end her life.  This changed Wolverine's character significantly making him more disciplined and emotionally distant.

At some point in the [[1990s]] the adamantium in Wolverine's skeleton was forcibly removed by the villain [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Following this, a character known as Genesis kidnapped Wolverine and attempted to re-bond the metal to his skeleton.  This was unsuccessful and caused Wolverine's mutation to accelerate out of control. He was temporarily changed into a semi-sentient beast-like form. In this form Wolverine was physically more powerful than he had ever been before.  Genesis did not survive his error and was dispatched by Logan in his savage manifestation. Finally, the mutant villain known as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] kidnapped Wolverine, brainwashed him, and had the adamantium rebonded to his skeleton successfully.  Wolverine was able to escape Apocalypse's plans for him, however.

Wolverine is renowned for his gruffness and sheer feral savagery.  He is one of the few X-Men who has no compunctions about killing when necessary, and has been frequently at odds with his fellow teammates as a result.  Despite that fact, he does live by a code of honor and does respect life. He has a dark past that involves many secret organizations and even the Canadian government and its superhero team, Alpha Flight, and some of the X-Men's greatest foes. It has been revealed that Wolverine's memories have been tampered with extensively making very little of what he believes is his past credible. 

==Powers==

Wolverine is a mutant with a number of enhancements to his physiology. Wolverine possesses heightened senses, making him capable of seeing things at a maximum distance greater than that of a normal human. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, and he is able to recognize people and objects by scent, even if that person or object is hidden. He can use these enhanced senses to track anyone, with an impressive degree of success.

Wolverine possesses retractable claws that are housed in his forearms. At will Wolverine can release these claws through his skin between the knuckles on each hand. The skin between the knuckles tears and bleeds, but bleeding is quickly halted by his healing factor. This allows Wolverine to be able to cut through almost any material without any fear of damage to the claws.

Wolverine possesses an accelerated healing factor based on his physiology. While most normal humans heal injuries over a long period of time, Wolverine's healing factor speeds up that natural process. Wolverine's natural healing has been advanced to the point where he can heal extensive injuries (such as broken limbs) in a matter of hours to days. This factor gives him a higher resistance to poisons and toxins, and he can recover from almost any injury. The more extensive the injury, the longer the healing time will be. 

Despite Wolverine's chronological age, he is still as healthy and physically fit as a man in his prime.  In fact, resulting from his mutation he is physically about as strong and agile as the hero known as [[Captain America]]. 

==Movies & Television==

His voice was provided by [[Cathal J. Dodd]] in the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' animated television series, and in a series of [[video game]]s through the 1990s. In the animated television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', his voice was provided by [[Scott McNeil]].

In the [[X-Men (movie)|movies]], he was played by [[Hugh Jackman]].

In the movie tie-in computer game ''X2: Wolverine's Revenge'', his voice was provided by [[Mark Hamill]].
