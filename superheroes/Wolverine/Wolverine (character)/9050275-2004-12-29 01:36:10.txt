'''Wolverine''' (a.k.a. Logan; birth name James Howlett) is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], best known as a member of the [[X-Men]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #181 ([[1974]]). 

A [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], Wolverine possesses enhanced senses and the ability to heal rapidly. But his most impressive features are likely his six retractable metal claws,  which extend from the back of each hand. The foot-long claws are made of the unbreakable metal [[alloy]] [[adamantium]], a metal bonded to his entire [[skeleton]].

A gruff and often vicious character, Wolverine helped forge the mold for [[comic book]] [[anti-hero]]es. His willingness to kill, his efforts to come to terms with his shady past and his [[angst]]-filled inner conflicts have become standard for anti-heroes.

Wolverine was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[John Romita Sr.]]. Yet [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], the creative team of ''Uncanny X-Men,'' are more responsible for developing his character. Wolverine has been a part of the X-Men since [[1975]] and has been featured in his own solo series since [[1988]]. He has also been a central part of X-Men [[animated series]] and [[films]].

==Publication history==
[[Image:Hulk181.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''The Incredible Hulk'' #181]]
Wolverine first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #180 ([[October]] [[1974]]), albeit only in the final panel of the issue, which was written by [[Len Wein]] and illustrated by [[Herb Trimpe]].  His full appearance in the next issue - #181 ([[November]] [[1974]]) - is considered by some to be his true [[first appearance]].  Wolverine wore a yellow-and-blue costume - which didn't particularly resemble a true [[wolverine]], and was designed by [[John Romita, Sr.]] - and sported foot-long metal [[claw]]s.  His first story left his nature somewhat ambiguous:  He was an agent of the [[Canada|Canadian]] government with [[superhuman]] powers, but later basic facts about the character - his lack of knowledge about his personal history, or his claws being a part of his body rather than part of his gloves - had not been established.

Wolverine next appeared in ''Giant-Sized X-Men'' #1 ([[1975]]), a special in which he joined the "All-New, All-Different" [[X-Men]].  Written by Wein and drawn by [[Dave Cockrum]] (who changed the headgear in Wolverine's costume somewhat), the issue was successful enough to revive the then-defunct ''X-Men'' comic book series, starting with #94 ([[August]] [[1975]]), drawn by Cockrum but written by [[Chris Claremont]].  Although a part of the team from the start, Wolverine was initially overshadowed by characters such as [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]] and Claremont considered dropping the character later early in the series.

Cockrum's departure from ''X-Men'' and replacement by [[John Byrne]] resulted in Wolverine's character being better fleshed-out.  Himself a Canadian, Byrne balked at the suggestion of dropping a Canadian character from the book and instead offered various story ideas that took advantage of this character.  One of them involved creating [[Alpha Flight]], a group of Canadian superheroes, who tried to recapture Wolverine due to the expense the Canadian government incurred in training him.  Wolverine's murky past was gradually fleshed out, as was his essentially unstable nature, which he tried to keep in check.  He and team leader Cyclops often clashed, and Wolverine had a crush on Cyclops' true love, [[Jean Grey]].  Byrne also designed a new, brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine, though keeping the distinctive Cockrum-designed headgear.  These elements were successful and the readers' interest in the character began to climb significantly.

Following Byrne's departure, Wolverine remained a member of the X-Men, his destiny controlled by Claremont.  By this point he was becoming one of the most popular characters in comics, and appeared in his own [[mini-series]] ''Wolverine'' (#1-4 by Claremont and [[Frank Miller]], [[September]] - [[December]] [[1982]]) and in ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' (#1-6 by Claremont and [[Al Milgrom]], [[November]] [[1984]] - [[April]] [[1985]]).

Wolverine finally graduated to his own ongoing series with ''Wolverine'' #1 (by Claremont and [[John Buscema]], [[November]] [[1988]]).  Since then he has remained an active member of the X-Men, has appeared in his own series, and in several side series.  Most notable of the side stories are ''[[Weapon X]]'' (by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #72-84, [[1991]]), and ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'' #1-6 (by [[Bill Jemas]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Paul Jenkins]] and [[Adam Kubert]], [[2002]]), both of which filled in significant portions of his past.

Many Wolverine stories - with and without the X-Men - have been collected as standalone [[graphic novel]]s.

==Fictional biography==

{{spoiler}}

<!-- I'm going to clean up this section now that I've added the section above; just haven't had time yet... -->

Wolverine first appeared as a [[Canada|Canadian]] superhero fighting the [[monster]]s [[The Incredible Hulk]] and the [[Wendigo]], as an [[agent]] of the [[government]] attempting to stop the rampage of both creatures.  Small, strong, and vicious, Wolverine was able to fight both creatures to a standstill.

Soon after that adventure he was recruited by [[Professor X]] to join the second incarnation of the [[X-Men]], resigning from his position in Canada over his superiors' objections.  Over the following year Wolverine was revealed to be a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] whose [[skeleton]] had been laced with the unbreakable metal [[adamantium]]. With his strong, passionate, and volatile personality, Wolverine often clashed with the X-Men's leader [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].  Given to berserker rages in combat, he slowly learned how to control his animalistic tendencies.  He is, however, more willing to kill his enemies than the other X-Men.

Wolverine was gradually revealed as a man who had forgotten his past:  He had been transformed by a project called [[Weapon X]], who had added the adamantium to his body.  He had then been adopted by James and Heather Hudson into their project which eventually became [[Alpha Flight]].  Intended to eventually lead that team, when he departed to join the X-Men he precipitated James Hudson's adoption of the identity of Weapon Alpha (later Vindicator and then [[Guardian (comics)|Guardian]]), and a lengthy and often hostile effort where Alpha Flight tried to bring Wolverine back to Canada, while Wolverine attempted to retain his freedom.

Bits of Wolverine's nature surfaced over time:  He could read and speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]], he had a strong sense of personal [[honor]], he became close friends with his teammate [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], despite their many differences.  He went by the name "Logan", without a surname, but it was unclear whether this was his real name.

Wolverine became romantically interested in Cyclops' true love, [[Jean Grey]], but the interest was never truly reciprocated.  He later met and became engaged to Lady Mariko Yashida of a [[Japan]]ese crime family.  He was forced to kill her father in a duel and single-handedly destroyed his crime cartel. Mariko and Logan became estranged due to the strange honor customs of her family.  Once they were finally reunited she was poisoned by Reiko, an assassin for the [[Yakuza]].  She asked Wolverine to save her from the horrible death and he obeyed by using his claws to end her life.  This changed Wolverine's character significantly making him more disciplined and emotionally distant.

Wolverine eventually made peace with Alpha Flight and remained a member of the X-Men.

At some point in the [[1990s]] the adamantium in Wolverine's skeleton was forcibly removed by the [[supervillain]] [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Following this, [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] kidnapped Wolverine and attempted to re-bond the metal to his skeleton.  This was unsuccessful and caused Wolverine's mutation to accelerate out of control. He was temporarily changed into a semi-sentient beast-like form. In this form Wolverine was physically more powerful than he had ever been before, and far less stable, killing Genesis in the process. Finally, the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] kidnapped Wolverine, brainwashed him, and had the adamantium rebonded to his skeleton successfully.  Wolverine overcame Apocalypse's brainwashing and returned to the X-Men.

Wolverine's early life has been revealed gradually over time. His time as a captive and subject of the Weapon X project has been revealed as a time when he was entirely at the mercy of his dark, savage side.  Finally, the story of his childhood was told in the miniseries [[Origin_(comics)|Wolverine:Origin]]. He was born James Howlett, the son of a wealthy Canadian.  When his mutant powers - particularly his claws - developed, he was exiled by his grandfather and became a nomad.  It is unclear how much Wolverine recalls about his past, as his memories have been extensively tampered with.

Wolverine remains an integral part of the X-Men, despite having decapitated someone who was believed to be [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for killing [[Jean Grey]], resulting in a rift between himself, Cyclops, and Professor X.  He is also an officer of the mutant law enforcement agency the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]] (XSE).

==Superhuman powers==

Wolverine is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial enhancements to his physiology.  He possesses extremely acute senses; highly-accelerated bodily regeneration and healing factors with unconfirmed secondary consequences such as augmented strength and retarded physical aging; and retractable bone claws in his forearms.  The latter two contributed to his stint in the [[Weapon X]] program, in which he obtained his signature adamantium skeleton.

Wolverine possesses '''retractable claws''' that are housed in his forearms. At will Wolverine can release these claws through the skin between the knuckles on each hand. The skin between the knuckles tears and bleeds, but is quickly healed by his healing factor. The claws are composed of the same dense bone as the rest of his skeleton and are capable of slicing through many types of conventional material with little damage even had they not been augmented with [[adamantium]].

Wolverine possesses [[superhuman]]ly '''acute senses''' that are comparable to those of certain animals.  His vision enables him, for example, to read written words on a paper at a distance of 100 feet.  Wolverine is also able to see perfectly in complete darkness, possibly even into the [[infra-red]] spectrum.  Wolverine's sense of smell is so sensitive, he can detect the distinctive chemical differences in different brands of [[deodorant]] which, seemingly, have the same scent.  He is able to use his keen sense of smell to track targets with scents several days old, even if their scent has been diluted somewhat by natural [[erosion]].  His sense of hearing is only slightly less developed than that of [[Daredevil]].  For example, he is able to detect the normal breathing or [[heartbeat]] of an individual at a distance of 200 feet.

Wolverine possesses an '''accelerated healing factor''' based on his physiology. While most normal humans heal injuries over a long period of time, Wolverine's healing factor speeds up that natural process, at widely varying rates.  During the [[The_Punisher]] story arc "Confederacy of Dunces", for instance, Wolverine's legs and lower torso are entirely regenerated within a day; on several occasions multiple stab and gunshot wounds have been healed within a matter of seconds.  More often internal injuries and serious wounds require days of recouperation.  He has regenerated one of his eyes on more than one occasion.  Wolverine's healing powers are resistant to all but the most potent of diseases and toxins, though sufficient amounts of various drugs, such as certain tranqualizers, can eventually render him unconcious.

Wolverine's body is in a state of constant cellular regeneration, possibly due to or related to his healing factor, that enhances many of his body's natural abilities.  Without the adamantium, Wolverine is roughly as strong as [[Captain America]] (who can lift, or [[military press]], 800 pounds, the maximum amount a human being can lift in the [[Marvel Universe]] without being considered superhuman).  The adamantium has doubtlessly increased the tensile strength of his bones to enable them to handle much greater pressure.  This, combined with his natural strength, should probably allow him to lift somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 pounds. Wolverine's agility and reflexes have also been enhanced to levels which are beyond the reach of ordinary human beings. Due to the effects of his healing powers, Wolverine's body produces considerably less fatigue toxins than that of an ordinary human being. It is theorized that Wolverine can perform at peak capacity for a period of several days before fatigue begins to impair him.  Finally, Wolverine's natural aging process has been considerably suppressed, though not halted.  According to certain reports, he fought in the [[American Civil War]]; according to photographic accounts of the time, he looked virtually identical both then and now.

Finally, Wolverine at one point participated in the Weapon X project, in which, as a result of an undescribed surgical procedure, every bone in his body was molecularly bonded to an artificial alloy known as '''[[adamantium]]''', which is virtually indestructible.  Wolverine's claws, bonded with the alloy, are as indestructible as the rest of his bone structure, and their curvature and shape provides them with a natural sharpness that the adamantium has only enhanced.  Wolverine's claws are capable of slicing through most known materials with ease.  This "upgrade" might not have occurred if not for Wolverine's claws and healing factor; another survivor / victim of the Weapon X project, [[Lady Deathstrike]], has extendable fingernails (now adamantium), and has been shown to possess similar advanced healing powers--though she has alo been shown to be a [[cyborg]], bringing the origin of these particular features into question.

==Special skills==

Wolverine is an extraordinary hand to hand combatant and is highly skilled and familiar with virtually every known fighting style on Earth.  He is also fluent in English, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Lakota, and Spanish.  It is also known that he has knowledge of several other foreign languages.  He is also an accomplished pilot and extremely well trained in espionage and covert operations.
==Television and film==

His voice was provided by [[Cathal J. Dodd]] in the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' animated television series, and in a series of [[video game]]s through the 1990s. In the animated television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', his voice was provided by [[Scott McNeil]].
