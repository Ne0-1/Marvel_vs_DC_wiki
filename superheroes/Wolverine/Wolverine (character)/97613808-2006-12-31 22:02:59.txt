'''Wolverine''', born '''James Howlett''' but more commonly known as '''Logan''', is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] and a member of several teams, including the [[X-Men]] and the [[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]] with some input by ''Incredible Hulk'' illustrator [[Herb Trimpe]], Wolverine first appeared in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #180-181 ([[1974#October|October 1974]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], Wolverine possesses animal-keen senses and reflexes and a [[healing factor]] that allows him to recover from virtually any wound. This healing ability enabled the [[supersoldier]] program [[Weapon X]] to bond the near unbreakable metal [[alloy]] [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] to his skeleton that includes razor-sharp retractable claws. He is also a master of hand-to-hand combat.

Wolverine joined the X-Men's "All New, All Different" roster in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1975#May|May 1975]]). Wolverine was symbolic of the many tough anti-authority [[anti-hero]]es that emerged in American popular culture after the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Johns Hopkins, 2001. Pg. 265</ref> and his willingness to use deadly force and brooding nature became standard characteristics for [[comic book]] anti-heroes by the end of the 1980s.<ref>Wright, pg. 277</ref> As a result, the character became the clear favorite for fans of the increasingly popular X-Men franchise.<ref>Wright, pg 263, 265</ref>. He has been featured in his own solo comic since 1988 and he has been a central character in every X-Men adaptation, including [[animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and the [[live action]] [[20th Century Fox]] [[X-Men (film)|film series]], in which he is played by [[Hugh Jackman]].

==Publication history==
[[Image:Wolvie1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A comic book ad from July 1974 announcing Woverine's first full appearance]] Wolverine first appeared in the final "teaser" panel of ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #180 (published in June [[1974]] though cover dated October 1974) written by [[Len Wein]] and illustrated by penciller [[Herb Trimpe]] and inker [[Jack Abel]]. The character then appeared in a number of comic book advertisements that ran through various Marvel Comics publications in early July 1974 (cover date: Nov. 1974) before making his first major appearance in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #181 (cover date: Nov. 1974) which was again written by Wein and illustrated by Trimpe and Abel. [[John Romita, Sr.]] designed Wolverine's yellow-and-blue costume. The character's introduction was ambiguous, revealing little more than that he was a [[superhuman]] agent of the [[Canada|Canadian]] government. In ''Incredible Hulk'' #180 and 181, he does not retract his claws, although Len Wein stated that the claws had always been conceived of as being retractable.<ref name="retractable">{{cite news |url=http://woodwardiocom.livejournal.com/326299.html#LenWein |publisher=Jonathan Woodward |title=CONvergence I, Len Wein |date=July 8, 2005}}</ref>. He appears briefly in the finale to this story in Hulk #182.

Wolverine's next appearance was 1975's ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, written by Wein and drawn by [[Dave Cockrum]], in which Wolverine joins The X-Men. [[Gil Kane]], who drew the cover of the comic, accidentally drew Wolverine's mask wrong, with larger headpieces. Dave Cockrum liked Kane's alteration (believing it to be similar to [[Batman]]'s mask) and decided to incorporate it into his own artwork for the actual story.<ref>Brian Cunningham, "Dressed to Kill," ''Wizard Tribute to Wolverine'', 1996.</ref>  Cockrum is also the first artist to draw Wolverine without his mask, and the distinctive hairstyle became a trademark of the character.

A revival of the ''X-Men'' series followed, beginning with ''Uncanny X-Men'' #94 (August [[1975]]), drawn by Cockrum and written by [[Chris Claremont]]. In ''Uncanny X-Men'', Wolverine is initially overshadowed by the other characters, although he does create tension in the team as he has a crush on [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops']] girlfriend, [[Jean Grey]]. As the series progressed, Claremont and Cockrum considered dropping Wolverine from the series; however, Cockrum's successor, artist [[John Byrne]], championed the character, later explaining that as a Canadian himself, he did not want to see a Canadian character dropped.<ref>DeFalco, Tom. ''Comic Creators on X-Men''. Titan, 2006. Pg. 110</ref> Byrne created [[Alpha Flight]], a group of Canadian superheroes who try to recapture Wolverine due to the expense the Canadian government incurred in training him. Later stories gradually establish Wolverine's murky past and unstable nature, which he battles to keep in check. Byrne also designed a new brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine that retained the distinctive Cockrum-designed cowl.

Following Byrne's departure, Wolverine remained in ''Uncanny X-Men''. The character's growing popularity led to a solo, four-issue [[limited series]], ''Wolverine'' (Sept.-Dec. 1982), by Claremont and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], followed by the six-issue ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' by Claremont and [[Al Milgrom]] (Nov. 1984 - April 1985). Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by [[John Buscema]] in November 1988. [[Larry Hama]] later took over the series and had an extensive run. Other writers who wrote for the two ''Wolverine'' ongoing series include [[Peter David]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Erik Larsen]], [[Frank Tieri (writer)|Frank Tieri]], [[Greg Rucka]], and [[Mark Millar]]. Many popular artists have also worked on the series, including [[John Byrne]], [[Marc Silvestri]], [[Mark Texeira]], [[Adam Kubert]], [[Leinil Francis Yu]], [[Rob Liefeld]], [[Sean Chen]], [[Darick Robertson]], [[John Romita, Jr]], and [[Humberto Ramos]]. 

In addition to the ''Wolverine'' series and appearances in the various ''X-Men'' series, two other storylines expand upon the character's past: "[[Weapon X]]", by writer-artist [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], which was serialized in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #72-84 (1991);  and ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'', a six-issue limited series by co-writers [[Joe Quesada]], [[Paul Jenkins]], and [[Bill Jemas]] and artist [[Andy Kubert]] (Nov. 2001 -  July 2002). A second solo series, ''Wolverine: Origins'', written by [[Daniel Way]] with art by [[Steve Dillon]], [[spin-off|spun out of]] and runs concurrently with the second ''Wolverine'' solo series.

===Wolverine's intended origin=== 	 
Wolverine co-creator Len Wein had originally intended for Logan to be a mutated wolverine, a wolverine cub that was evolved to humanoid form by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref> http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/10/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-21/ </ref> In ''X-Men'' #98, a biological analysis of Wolverine suggests that he is not a full-fledged mutant, and in ''X-Men'' #103, Wolverine says to a [[leprechaun]] that he doesn't believe in leprechauns, to which the Leprechaun replies, "Maybe we leprechauns don't believe in talking wolverines". This is a reference to Lewis Caroll Through the Looking Glass, the dialog between the Hunter and the talking Unicorn.

In a reprint of ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180-181 titled ''Incredible Hulk and Wolverine'', an interview with Cockrum supports the claim that Wolverine was intended to be a mutated wolverine. Cockrum said he considered having the High Evolutionary play a vital role in making Wolverine a human. He wanted Wolverine to be the age of a young adult, with superhuman strength and agility similar to that of [[Spider-Man]]. This changed when Cockrum saw [[John Romita]] draw a maskless Wolverine as a hairy 40-year-old. Len Wein originally intended the claws to be retractable and part of Wolverine's gloves, and that the gloves and claws as a whole would be made of adamantium.<ref>
''The Best Of Wolverine'' vol.1 Chris Claremont confirms in a brief introduction of the character and why the character appeals to him. </ref> This idea was later nixed by Claremont because he believed that anyone could then become Wolverine by wearing the gloves. The claws are first revealed to be part of Wolverine's anatomy in ''Uncanny X-Men'' vol.1 #99. Shortly after this, it was revealed that [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] is a spider evolved to human form by the High Evolutionary. Marvel Publisher [[Stan Lee]] was disgusted with the interpretation of the character and insisted that her origin be changed.{{fact}} Lee's strong reaction and subsequent demand for a [[retcon]] convinced Cockrum and Claremont that they could never get away with introducing Logan as a mutated wolverine.

==Fictional character biography==
{{spoiler}}
===Early life===
{|style="float: left"
|[[Image:Wolverine-first-claws.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Wolverine first uses his claws in ''Origin'' #2 (December 2001). Pencils by [[Andy Kubert]].]]
|}
After years of complicated [[backstory]] and [[retcon]]s, the 2001 [[limited series]] ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'' finally tells the story of Wolverine's early years. The series, set in 19th century [[Alberta]], Canada, depicts Wolverine as James Howlett, the son of John and Elizabeth Howlett.  In contrast to the quickly healing Wolverine, James is a sickly youth who requires round-the-clock care.  His parents hire a young girl named Rose to watch over James and keep his spirits up.  On the rare days that James is allowed to go outside he and Rose spend their time playing with a young boy they know as [[Dog Logan|"Dog" Logan]], the son of [[Thomas Logan]], groundskeeper of the Howlett Mansion.  Thomas and Dog live together in a small shack on the poor side of town.  Thomas is an abusive alcoholic and is highly resentful of the Howletts, particularly John Howlett.  At first his resentment seems rooted in the fact that he and his son have nothing while John Howlett has everything, but it is later revealed that he has been carrying on a secret affair with the lady of the house since before James was born.  After Dog commits such heinous acts as trying to force himself on Rose and killing James' pet dog, John Howlett fires Thomas and has him thrown off the property.  This only adds to Thomas' hatred and, in a drunken rage, he and his son break into the Howlett Mansion at night armed with rifles.  Thomas finds Elizabeth in her bedroom and tries to convince her to run away with him when they are both confronted by John Howlett who gets into a fistfight with Thomas.  Woken by the noise, James enters the bedroom just in time to see Thomas shoot and kill John.  Enraged by seeing his father murdered, James' claws emerge for the first time.  He kills Thomas, slashes Dog across the face, and passes out.  Elizabeth, upon losing her husband and discovering that her son is a [[mutant (fiction)|freak]], promptly commits suicide.  Rose, blinded by fear and not thinking straight, takes James and runs off into the night.  The police are summoned to the mansion and they question Dog, who blames the killing entirely on Rose.

With Rose blamed for the death of the Howletts and James exiled by his bitter grandfather, the two friends set out for parts unknown.  They join a mining colony in [[British Columbia]] where James (who has lost all memory of his parents, his childhood, and his name) adopts the name "Logan" and struggles under the harsh working conditions of the mining colony.  As his mutant abilities develop, James becomes tall and strong, aquiring the nickname "Wolverine" from his fellow miners.  During his time at the mining colony, James speaks less and less of the past to Rose, often immersing himself in hunting and the physically demanding work of daily life in the colony.  Unbeknownst to James and Rose, Dog has tracked them to British Columbia.  On his deathbed, James' grandfather had a change of heart and asked Dog to find his grandson so that he can see him one last time.  However, Dog is still nursing a deep grudge against James for killing his father and against Rose for spurning his advances.  Following their trail, Dog finds Rose and James at the mining colony and attempts to beat him to death in front of a large crowd.  Just as James prepares to extend his claws and kill Dog, Rose is accidentally knocked into the fray by the crowd.  Impaling herself, she dies in James' arms.  Driven mad with grief, James becomes feral, living in the woods with wolves.

===Early 20th century===
Wolverine returns to civilization, working as a soldier in the Canadian military during [[World War I]]. After the war, Wolverine embarks on a series of adventures leading him around the world. He sees action during [[World War II]], participating in [[Operation Overlord|D-Day]] and the [[Operation Market Garden|liberation of the Netherlands]]. Wolverine spends time in the [[Sobibor]] concentration camp. [[Captain America]] mentions having worked with Wolverine during World War II.

Wolverine has strong memories of loving a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] woman named [[Silver Fox]], and living with her in a cabin before they are recruited into [[Team X (comics)|Team X]], a government [[black ops]] team. On his birthday, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] apparently kills Silver Fox.(''Wolverine'' vol.2 #10)

===Weapon X===
In the serialized story "Weapon X", beginning in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' (April 1991), [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] created a new backstory for Wolverine. Taking place prior to his first appearance, Logan is revealed to be a drifter, aware that something will soon occur to change his life. Unaware of his past and suffering from long-term memory loss, Logan goes to a bar where he is drugged and taken to the [[Weapon X]] facility in Canada. There Wolverine's skeleton is reinforced with adamantium and he is brainwashed into a killing machine.  He later escapes the facility, killing nearly everyone there.  He flees into the wild, and is later found by [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James]] and [[Vindicator|Heather Hudson]], who enroll Logan into [[Department H]].

===First appearance===
Wolverine made his first appearance in one of the last pages of ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180. He is a super-agent of Canada's Department H, dispatched to halt the destruction caused by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], who are locked in a savage fight. His speed and maneuverability prove to be a match for the two plodding powerhouses, and he manages to defeat the Wendigo. The Hulk and Wolverine continue fighting, with no clear winner. Then Department H shows up saying that Wolverine has spent too much time fighting Hulk and they are starting Plan B.

===X-Men===
In ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, [[Professor X]] recruits Wolverine to a new team of X-Men. In subsequent stories, Wolverine frequently clashes with the X-Men's leader, Cyclops. Prone to berserker rages in combat, he slowly learns to control his feral instincts; however, Wolverine is still willing to kill his adversaries.  Wolverine develops a close friendship with his teammate [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], a character whose personality diametrically opposes Wolverine's.

James Hudson, as Guardian, eventually seeks Wolverine out to return him to Department H, but is defeated (''Uncanny X-men'' #109). He later returns as the leader of Canada's first superhero team [[Alpha Flight]], on their first mission to capture Wolverine.(''Uncanny X-men'' #120) They are defeated, but Wolverine later makes peace with Hudson and Alpha Flight.{{issue}}

[[Chris Claremont]] and other writers added layers of complexity to the character over time. For instance, it is revealed that Wolverine can read and speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and that he has a strong sense of personal [[honor]]. 

Romantically interested in Jean Grey, but unable to pursue her, Wolverine falls in love with and becomes engaged to Lady [[Mariko Yashida]], heir to an extremely powerful [[Yakuza]] family in [[Tokyo]] (''Uncanny X-Men'' #118).  Wolverine later travels with [[Kitty Pryde]] to Japan to confront his former mentor, [[Ogun]], who was killed years earlier, and his malicious spirit has since required hosts to inhabit. Ogun possesses Kitty, making her his assassin, but Logan helps her overcome him and force him from her body. Afterwards, Logan and Kitty become very close friends, and she becomes like a daughter to him.

In his first solo limited series, written by Chris Claremont and drawn by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], Wolverine is forced to kill Mariko's father in a duel. Mariko and Wolverine decide to marry, but they are estranged by the customs of her family, assassination plots by [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] and the [[Silver Samurai]], and manipulations by the villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]]. 

In another story (Uncanny X-Men #186) Wolverine takes it upon himself to watch over Amiko Kobayashi, the daughter of a woman killed in the aftermath of a fight between the X-Men and a giant dragon over Tokyo.  In subsequent stories Logan continues to visit Amiko, although she is under the care of his close friend and sometimes lover [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]].

When the X-Men temporarily relocate to the [[Australian Outback]], runaway mutant [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] saves Wolverine's life from an attack by [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. (''Uncanny X-Men'' #244) She eventually becomes, as Kitty Pryde had before her, like a daughter to him. Wolverine also spends a significant amount of time in the seedy areas of [[Madripoor]], under the alias 'Patch.'

Still in Australia, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] tricks Wolverine into journeying to the [[Savage Land]].  While there, Wolverine starts a relationship with the female chieftain, Gahck, of an indigenous tribe.  He puts an end to Apocalypse's experiments performed on the tribe and unknowingly sires a son with Gahck, that she names "Erista." (''Wolverine: The Jungle Adventure'')

After the X-Men return to America, Wolverine returns to the Weapon X base in Canada. There, he learns many of his memories are implants and his personality becomes darker.(''Wolverine'' vol.2 #50)

[[Image:Wolverine57.jpg|thumb|170px|left|''Wolverine'' #57 (mid-July 1992): Mariko's death. Art by [[Marc Silvestri]] and [[Dan Green (comics)|Dan Green]].]]

Wolverine travels back to Japan and reunites with Mariko, who refuses to rekindle her love with him until her clan ceases all illegal activities. However, she is soon poisoned by a [[Yakuza]] assassin working for [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], who bears a grudge against Wolverine. Mariko asks Wolverine to end her life quickly rather than let her die slowly and painfully from the toxin, and he reluctantly complies. This changes Wolverine's character significantly, making him even more disciplined and emotionally distant. Wolverine vows to Matsu'o that on each anniversary of Mariko's death he will visit him and slice off a body part until there is nothing of him left.(''Wolverine'' vol.2 #60)

Shortly after Mariko's death, Wolverine rejoins his former Team X members Sabretooth, Maverick, John Wraith, Mastodon, and Silver Fox, with Jubilee and Hines of the Weapon X Program, in hunting down Aldo Ferro a.k.a "Vole", a powerful psychic who brainwashed many of them for Weapon X. (''Wolverine'' vol.2 #64) Ferro dies soon after forcing Sabretooth to kill Silver Fox.  

Wolverine suffers a mental breakdown due to Weapon X's mental tampering and the deaths of Mariko and Silver Fox. Thinking he is on a prior Team X mission to assassinate "Terry Adams", Wolverine breaks into a Russian space program facility and encounters Epsilon Red, a genetically-engineered cosmonaut with powerful psychic abilities. Red, who is the "Terry Adams" Wolverine is after, breaks down many of the mental blocks in Wolverine's mind in return for help escaping the facility. With this greater knowledge of which memories were true and which were false, Wolverine is finally able to pick up the pieces of his shattered life. (''Wolverine'' vol.2 #68)

This happiness is short-lived, for at the end of the ''Fatal Attractions'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]], the adamantium in Wolverine's skeleton is forcibly extracted by the X-Men's enemy, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. This act injures Wolverine so severely his mutant healing factor burns itself out in order to keep him alive. In fact, most of Wolverine's other natural abilities including his enhanced strength stamina, agility, and reflexes are weakened as well.

[[Image:exadam.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Magneto ripping the Adamantium from Wolverine's bones]]

Unwilling to accept his severely weakened state, Wolverine begins training in the [[Danger Room]]. In a fit of rage and frustration, his claws extrude, now bone, revealing them to be a natural part of his mutation, rather than adamantium implants. Furthermore, each time he extrudes them, they forcibly pierce their way through the skin of his hands and cause severe tissue damage and blood loss. Feeling useless, Logan embarks on a series of solo adventures, leaving a note with Jubilee that explains his views on the matter. (''Wolverine'' vol.2 #75)

During these adventures, he encounters some of his past enemies, such as the adamantium-skinned [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]], the [[Reavers (comics)|Reaver]] Cylla, and the vampiric [[Bloodscream]]. While travelling alone, Wolverine stops for a training session with [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and encounters his Weapon X ally Maverick and his X-Men teammate [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] in Madripoor, before learning that Sabretooth is staying at Xavier's. Wolverine returns and defeats Sabretooth in battle while the X-Men are away. The battle ends with Wolverine puncturing Sabretooth's brain, temporarily altering Sabretooth's vicious personality until the injury is fully healed. (''Wolverine'' vol.2 #90) 

Over the course of the next several issues, ''Wolverine'' vol.2 #91-100, it is revealed through tests and studies jointly conducted by [[Professor Charles Xavier]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], and [[Heather Hudson (comics)|Heather Hudson]] that the mutation that grants Wolverine his mutant powers is an ongoing process. Unlike most other mutants, Wolverine continues to mutate slowly over the course of his life. As a result, Wolverine's mutant powers, particularly his heightened senses and accelerated healing powers, increase at a very slow pace over the course of his life. However, after Wolverine's skeleton is bonded with adamantium by the Weapon X Program, this mutation process is completely halted. The studies also reveal that, aside from suppressing his ongoing mutation, the presence of the adamantium also negated the speed of Wolverine's mutant healing factor. The toxic effects of the adamantium forced Wolverine's healing powers to work constantly to negate the effects, causing him to heal slower from other injuries. After Magneto magnetically rips the adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton, and his body completely heals from the injuries he sustains, the mutation process starts up once more at a greatly accelerated rate. The studies conducted on Wolverine show that accelerated mutation process has increased his powers to much higher levels than at any other point in his life. 

A prime example of just how much his powers have increased is cited in ''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #92. Wolverine is run over by a car and sustains having numerous internal organs destroyed and half the bones in his body broken, injuries that he completely heals from within a matter of seconds. It is also revealed during this time that Wolverine's mutation process will eventually cause him to degenerate physically into a more primitive and beastial state.

===Modern adventures===
Some time later, a maniac named [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]], who is the biological son of Wolverine's ally, and sometime enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], kidnaps Wolverine and attempts to re-bond adamantium to his skeleton in an attempt to transform Wolverine into a Horseman of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. (''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #100) The attempt is unsuccessful, and the process pushes Wolverine's system to the point that he degenerates into a feral state that is dominated by wild, animalistic instincts. In a rage, Wolverine murders the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], including Genesis and flees. With the help of [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], he is able to regain his humanity and reverse the bulk of his regression. (''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #101-110)

Wolverine lives without adamantium for some time before being kidnapped by the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Apocalypse sets up a contest between Wolverine and an adamantium-bonded Sabretooth to determine who would become the new leader of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]].
[[Image:WolDeath.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Wolverine as Death, from ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #145 (December 1999). Pencils by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].]]
Although he knows winning means being brainwashed and turned against his friends, Wolverine supposes that Sabretooth would enjoy being set loose as a killing machine, while he himself might be able to fight it.  Emerging victorious he is made the Horseman Death, and Apocalypse strips the adamantium from Sabretooth and bonds it to Wolverine's skeleton once more.  Made to battle the X-Men, Wolverine overcomes Apocalypse's conditioning with the help of Jubilee. (''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #147)

Wolverine is then captured by a restarted [[Weapon X]] program under the leadership of Director Malcolm Colcord, a soldier Wolverine disfigured when he escaped from the original Weapon X facility. It is revealed that the mental implants installed by the original program are still functional, as Colcord uses them to force Wolverine into tracking down and eliminating former members of the program. However, it seems that during his assassination of the previous director, Wolverine's mental implants are finally destroyed.{{issue}}<br>

[[Grant Morrison]]'s run as writer of the ''X-Men'' (temporarily renamed ''New X-Men'' during Morrison's tenure) reveals that the "X" in "Weapon X" was a Roman numeral, making Wolverine "Weapon Ten" in a sequence of living super-weapons that begins with [[Isaiah Bradley]] and [[Captain America]] (Weapon I). The Weapon X program that experimented on Wolverine spun out of a larger "Weapon Plus" program, leading Wolverine to join Cyclops and the mysterious [[Fantomex]] (himself Weapon XIII) on a mission to bring down Weapon Plus and discover Wolverine's true identity. During the assault on Weapon Plus, Wolverine killed Ultimaton (Weapon XV). (''New X-Men'' #142-145)

Wolverine then gains access to the Weapon X files that describe his genesis, though this happens largely off-panel and it is not clear to the reader precisely what he learns. What is known is that he was intended to be a living [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] and that he was forced to exterminate the populace of the small [[Midwestern]] town of Roanoke as a test of his abilities. This revelation leads Wolverine to believe he is a monster once more and that his only purpose is to kill, but Jean Grey is able to persuade him out of this mentality. (''New X-Men'' #148)

===Recent adventures===
When Wolverine is brainwashed into becoming an agent for [[HYDRA]], he is able to overcome their conditioning with the help of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] In return, Wolverine becomes a temporary S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in order to help put a stop to HYDRA's plans.

Wolverine is then recruited by the [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], because he is willing to "cross the lines they refuse to cross."<ref>New Avengers #6</ref> He serves alongside such notable Marvel heroes as [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Luke Cage]].

At the conclusion of Marvel's 2005 company crossover ''[[House of M]]'', Wolverine's memories are completely restored. This causes a panic for some of the major powers and governments across the Marvel universe, not only because of their involvement in Wolverine's life, but also because of the knowledge Logan has recovered. The United States and Canada purge their records of any trace of Wolverine and Weapon X in anticipation of Wolverine's revenge. 

The fears of the U.S. and Canadian governments prove correct in the "Origins & Endings" arc of his solo series ''Wolverine''.  Wanting to know who else knew about a mysterious weapon called the "Muramasa Blade", he confronts the Silver Samurai, who, in an attempt to redirect Wolverine's anger away from himself, tells Wolverine that he did not escape from Weapon X alone as he has previously believed.

Remembering that [[Bucky]], Captain America's partner, long believed to be deceased (though actually turned into the ''Winter Soldier''), helped him break free, Wolverine travels to Serbia to confront him. After a brief fight, Bucky reveals that, in addition to freeing him from Weapon X, he murdered Logan's previously unrevealed pregnant wife.

Bucky apologizes to Wolverine, telling him that he was not in control of his actions at the time. Wolverine then begins to reminisce about his wife, a Japanese woman named Itsu, and the events that led up to their meeting. After [[World War II]], Wolverine trains under the martial arts master [[Ogun]]. After completing his training, Ogun sends Wolverine to a village where another master, Bando Saburo, teaches men who were made into weapons how to become men once more.

There Wolverine meets Itsu and they fall in love, eventually marrying and conceiving a child together. Saburo's village is surrounded by mountains belonging to the demon swordsmith Muramasa. After Bucky murders Itsu, Wolverine, believing it was the people of the village who killed her, pledges his allegiance to the demon. Muramasa boasts that he will make a sword in honor of Wolverine, one that can defeat even him. Through unknown means, Muramasa begins the process that makes Wolverine into a living weapon.  

After remembering this, Wolverine goes back to Muramasa's mountain and reclaims the Muramasa Blade which belongs to him. Muramasa willingly gives the sword to Wolverine and tells him to "wield it like an angry god". Wolverine wants revenge, and he now remembers who deserves his vengeance.

===Wolverine: Origins===
[[Image:Wolori.jpg|thumb|170px|Right|Cover to ''Wolverine: Origins'' #1 (April 2006). Pencils by [[Joe Quesada]].]]
{{spoiler}}
''Wolverine: Origins'' is a second ongoing series, starring Wolverine in his quest as a result of "Origins & Endings". At the beginning of the series, he encounters a [[Shiva (Marvel Comics)|Shiva]] robot while trying to extract information from a government foe. After defeating the robot with the Muramasa Blade, those in the government hiding from Logan send Frank Simpson a.k.a. [[Nuke (comics)|Nuke]] against him. It is revealed through flashbacks that Wolverine takes Nuke from his family as a child and, during the [[Vietnam War]], is responsible for implanting a trigger word into Nuke that causes him to massacre a [[Vietnam]]ese village. All this is apparently part of an attempt to recreate Wolverine, already a living weapon prior to Weapon X. Exactly who is controlling Wolverine at this point remains unclear at this time.

After defeating Nuke in [[South Vietnam]], he then fights [[Captain America]] who has been sent to stop Wolverine's path of vengeance once and for all. Cyclops, [[Emma Frost]], and [[Hellion]] of the X-Men enter the fray and stop Wolverine (driven berserk by a slash from the Muramasa Blade Captain America managed to take from him) from killing the famous hero.

Emma calms the combatants telepathically and reveals to Wolverine his son is still alive. Emma also warns Wolverine his boy doesn't seem to have any thoughts of his own, similar to how Wolverine has been controlled so many times before. Wolverine remembers when Sabretooth killed Silver Fox all those years ago and how her murder was arranged by those he is seeking vengeance against to bring out the beast in him, turning him to their side. He assumes something similar has been done to his son for his enemies to be able to gain control of him.

Emma advises Wolverine to end his mission of revenge as he has a son to rescue. He entrusts Cyclops with the Muramasa Blade, explaining that the captors of his son will most likely brainwash him if they are able to capture him. Wolverine makes Cyclops promise to use the sword to kill him if that time ever comes. Emma informs Wolverine that, above all else, his son hates him. Wolverine tells her that he hates himself, as well, for all the terrible things he's done under his enemies' control.

Wolverine remembers carbodanium weakened his mutant healing factor and thinking it may provide him with a way to take down his son without killing him, he travels back to America to find [[Maverick (comics)|Maverick]]. Maverick was part of Team X during Wolverine's first encounter with the carbodanium synthesizer and the villainous [[Omega Red]]. He had also been entrusted with by Wolverine a few years back.<!-- That sentence is damaged enough that I can't figure out what it's supposed to mean, so I can't fix it.  Could somebody who knows the story please fix it? --> Wolverine tracks Maverick to a building in New York City where mutants, powered and depowered alike, are taking refuge and is surprised to see [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] there. Their reunion is shortlived, however, as Omega Red mysteriously bursts into the building, nearly killing Jubilee and demanding Maverick tell him where the carbonadium synthesizer is.

Wolverine and Omega Red fight while Maverick and Jubilee evacuate the depowered mutants. Wolverine remembers his first encounter with carbodanium, when his handlers in Team X tested it on him before they rewrote his memories like they did after every one of his missions. As they were taking him to the device that would brainwash him, he fought back, killing one of the scientists with a blow to the throat. He threatened the other scientist, popping his (bone) claws accidentally. Seeing his claws made him remember everything that Team X had taken from him. He asked the scientist who gave the orders and he said he didn't know. Wolverine, smelling that he was not lying, ordered him to tell him what he did know. The scientist is contacted via telephone every time Wolverine needs to be mindwiped. When he completes his task, he tells Wolverine that he barely made it out alive of whatever mission he was on and then gives him a dossier detailing his next mission. Wolverine asks for the dossier he would normally be given. He tells the scientist to tell whoever was in charge that the brainwashing was successful and then leaves, intending to participate in this mission. The mission is in [[Berlin]], where he first encountered Omega Red. 

In the present, Wolverine is overpowered by Omega Red. Red tackles him through a wall where they land on the rooftop of an adjacent building. Wolverine is briefly knocked unconscious, while Omega Red makes his way back to the building where Maverick last was. Wolverine, hearing Jubilee scream for him, rushes back into the building. He finds a wounded Maverick who tells him that Omega Red has Jubilee and that he told the villain who he gave the carbonadium synthethizer to.

With [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and [[SHIELD]] hot on his trail, Wolverine travels to Berlin where he reminisces about his Team X mission there. He had undertaken the mission (to steal the carbonadium synthethizer from a German laboratory), pretending he was still under the control of his handlers, to see if he could get any answers as to who was directing him. Remembering his past with Sabretooth, he intended to use the carbonadium synthethizer on him since it shorted out mutant healing factors. Before he could do so, Omega Red attacked. As Team X fled with a defecting German scientist, Sabretooth realized Woverine had regained control and executed the scientist. The scientist was a woman and Sabretooth was advised to kill any available female targets when Wolverine broke free of his masters' control, since it showed him that whenever he wasn't kept on a tight leash, "pretty things die."

In the present, Wolverine meets up with the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]].

===Civil War===
:''Main article: [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''
[[Image:wolb.jpg|thumb|left|201px|Wolverine being incinerated down to a skeleton, from ''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #43]] 
Soon after discovering [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro's]] murder of over 600 [[Stamford, Connecticut]] residents, Wolverine embarks on a mission to take vengeance on Nitro, much to the disapproval of [[Tony Stark]].  Nitro incinerates Wolverine to his adamantium skeleton, but Wolverine is able to regenerate.  

They fight and Wolverine brutally beats Nitro.  Three mysterious men arrive, one named Janus. Wolverine and Janus fight while the other two subdue Nitro. Janus reveals himself to be an [[Atlantis (comics)|Atlantean]] [[sleeper agent]] charged with avenging the death of [[Namorita]] in the Stamford explosion. [[Namor]], Namorita's cousin and prince of the Atlanteans, then appears.

Wolverine battles Namor briefly, and is knocked unconscious. Upon waking he realizes that Namor and his agents have taken Nitro to Atlantis. Wolverine calls Iron Man and persuades him to lend him an Iron Man suit adapted for underwater survival, so he can confront Namor. Namor allows Wolverine to see Nitro, but Nitro has escaped. Nitro tries to attack but Wolverine disables him. Wolverine leaves him in Atlantis, as Namor's issues with him outweigh his own. Out of gratitude, Namor discloses that Nitro was given [[Mutant Growth Hormone]], a drug that enhances mutant abilities, by Walter Declun, the CEO of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].

Wolverine places a listening device in Declun's office and learns that Damage Control, Inc. had been increasing the number of superhero fights so they would get the cleanup contracts. Wolverine decides to take down Declun's operations.  Declun, however sets a trap for Wolverine involving a squad of robots. Knowingly entering the trap, Wolverine is overwhelmed by the robots and one begins slicing through Wolverine's neck using a buzzsaw with adamantium blades.

However, the armored men fail to finish the job due to the adamantium in Wolverine's skeleton and prematurely begin patting one another on the back for a job well done.  As Wolverine recovers, Janus and the female Atlantean agent comes to his aid.  Together, they make short work of the armored soldiers.  Unfortunately for them, the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] arrives.  Supporting the Superhuman Registration Act, the Sentry quickly defeats Wolverine and takes him to S.H.I.E.L.D. who attempt to talk to him while keeping him in a special "depowering" collar and gauntlets.  Although his healing factor is nullified, Wolverine is still able to unleash his claws (as they are not a mutant "power" but the permanent result of his mutation) and escape. Wolverine removes the collar before slamming into the ground below.

He then appears at the Damage Control meeting where Marie Hoag and Walter Declun are engaged in a heated argument. Declun ingests Mutant Growth Hormone, giving him animalistic strength, agility, and aggression, and fights Wolverine.  The battle spills into the streets where Wolverine gains the upper hand.  Wolverine questions whether true evil is premeditated or spontaneous before killing Declun.  In the last scene, Wolverine is back at ground zero of the Stamford incident talking to [[Miriam Sharpe]].

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:wolhearing.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Wolverine's advanced hearing]] 
Wolverine is a [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology. His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process called a "[[healing factor]]" that regenerates damaged or destroyed areas of his body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human and renders him immune to most toxins and diseases. Depictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary, depending on the story and writer. Originally, this is portrayed as just accelerated healing, but writers increased this ability over years to the point that he can regenerate organs such as eyes and large portions of flesh. In ''Wolverine'' vol3. #43, Wolverine's bodily tissue is incinerated from his skeleton, which rapidly regenerates, due to an explosion caused by [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]. ''Wolverine'' vol3. #48 explains that Wolverine's brain survived the explosion due to the protection offered by his skull. Wolverine's bodily systems, including his [[Nervous system|nervous]] and [[circulatory system]]s, and all the destroyed tissue completely regenerates within a few minutes. In ''Excalibur'' vol. 1 #100, the [[Xavier Protocols]] reveal that the removal of adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton increased his healing factor to "incredible levels" and that the only way to kill him is to remove his head from the vicinity of his body.

In addition to advanced healing, the regenerative qualities of his healing powers cause Wolverine to age much slower than an ordinary human. The ''Origin'' limited series, set in the 19th century, depicts Wolverine as a youth.  However, Wolverine is depicted in modern stories, set well over 100 years later, with the appearance and vitality of a man in his prime.

Wolverine possesses superhumanly acute vision, hearing, and smell, allowing him to track and identify individuals by scent alone and see clearly in near total darkness. Wolverine possesses some degree of  superhuman strength: in ''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #111, Wolverine proves that he is physically strong enough to break steel chains, and in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #1, Wolverine was seen lifting perhaps a dozen men who piled on top of him, throwing them through a wooden wall. Wolverine's mutant healing factor heightens his physical stamina to superhuman levels. In ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #5 Wolverine displays his physical stamina during a fight with [[Omega Red]] that lasts more than 18 hours, despite regular exposure to Omega Red's death spores. Wolverine has also demonstrated that his agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the human body's natural limits, displayed by dodging [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' optic energy beams at point blank range in ''Wolverine'': Origins #5. In ''Wolverine'', vol.3 #46, it is revealed that Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault and probing due to high level [[psionic]] shields implanted in his mind by [[Professor Charles Xavier]]. 
[[Image:WOLVXR.JPG|thumb|left|X-Ray depicting Wolverine's adamantium claws from the film ''X-Men'']]Wolverine's physical appearance displays animal-like mutations, including sharper-than-normal teeth with pronounced canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. The claws are made of bone, unlike the claws of normal mammals which are made of [[keratin]]. The bone claws are sharp and dense enough to slice through substances as durable as most metals, wood, and stone (as seen in ''Wolverine'' #91 and #101). Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, is molecularly infused with [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]], rendering it practically indestructible. The adamantium claws can cut almost any known solid material. The known exceptions are adamantium itself and [[Captain America's shield]], which is the only substance in the Marvel Universe known to be even more durable than adamantium. Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon the thickness of the substance and the amount of force he can exert. The adamantium also weights his blows, dramatically increasing the effectiveness of his punches and kicks. 

[[Image:boneclaw.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Wolverine's Bone claws. Art by Adam Kubert.]] 	 
===Skills and personality=== 	 
During his time in [[Japan]] and other countries, Wolverine became a master of virtually all forms of [[martial arts]] and fighting, both armed and unarmed; as a [[samurai]], he is especially skilled in the use of the [[katana]]. He can also use nearly all types of weapons, traditional or modern, long or close range.  Wolverine is regarded as one of the finest hand to hand fighters in the Marvel Universe, able to defeat the likes of [[Shang-Chi]] (''X-Men'' Vol.2 # 62) and [[Captain America]] in single combat (''Captain America'' # 404/''Wolverine Origins'' # 4-5)  He has a wide knowledge of the body and [[pressure point]]s. (''X-Men'' vol.2 #108/''Wolverine'' vol.3 # 20) He is also an accomplished [[aviator|pilot]] and highly skilled in the field of [[espionage]] and covert operations. 
	 
Due in part to his feral nature as well as the life long psychological trauma he has endured, when angered Wolverine frequently exhibits a mental state widely known as the "berserker rage". While in this state, Wolverine becomes little more than a mindless animal.  Although he hates this part of himself it has saved his life many times, as well as the lives of his friends and fellow X-Men. While in this state, Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to psionics. (''Wolverine'' #168)

Though seemingly brutish, Wolverine is actually highly intelligent. Due to his increased lifespan, he travels the world and amasses an intimate knowledge of foreign languages, customs and cultures. Wolverine speaks fluent [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Lakota language|Lakota]]; he also has some knowledge of [[French language|French]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[German language|German]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Wolverine
|publisher=Marvel Comics|title=List of languages present on Marvel.com (excluding German, mentioned in ''Wolverine'' vol.2  #37)}}</ref> 	 

In the mid-1990s, when [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] monitors Wolverine's vitals during a [[Danger Room]] training session, he says Logan's physical and mental state is the "equivalent of an Olympic-level gymnast performing a gold medal routine whilst simultaneously beating four chess computers in his head."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Marvel Comics|title=''Wolverine'' vol.1 #51}}</ref>

Wolverine is often a gruff individual, but, despite popular belief, he does not enjoy killing or giving into the berserker rage that usually accompanies it. Logan adheres to a firm [[Bushido|code]] of personal [[honor]] and [[morality]], despite often displaying a rebellious and irreverent attitude. He has had many romantic relationships with numerous women throughout the decades, most of which aren't known. His most meaningful have included relationships with Itsu, [[Silver Fox]], [[Mariko Yashida]], and a flirtatious relationship with [[Jean Grey]]. He has found a family in the X-Men and provides a father figure to characters such as [[Kitty Pryde]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]].

==Alternate versions==  	 
===Ultimate Wolverine===
[[Image:UltLogan.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ultimate Wolverine by Ben & Ray Lai]]
Wolverine appears in comics published under the [[Ultimate Marvel]] banner, particularly ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]''. An assassin for Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, Wolverine is assigned to infiltrate the X-Men and assassinate Professor Xavier. As a member of the X-Men, Wolverine finds acceptance, purpose and love. Wolverine and teammate Jean Grey have a sexual affair, but she leaves him upon discovering his connection to the Brotherhood. Wolverine eventually betrays and attacks Magneto, abandoning his initial mission and joining the X-Men outright. 

After Jean begins a relationship with Cyclops, Wolverine allows Cyclops to apparently fall to his death in the [[Savage Land]]. Cyclops survives and returns, shocking the X-Men when he later offers to allow Wolverine to return to the team. After Wolverine saves the X-Men from the [[Weapon X|Weapon X Project]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] goads him into a fight by burning the project's files on Wolverine, the only record of his past. After the death of [[Storm (comics)|Storm]]'s boyfriend [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], Wolverine reluctantly begins a relationship with her. While on a date, the couple are attacked by Sabretooth, who claims that his own memories have begun to return and that he knows Wolverine is his father.  

In the ''Ultimate X-Men/[[Ultimates]]'' crossover miniseries, [[Captain America]] claimed to have worked with Logan during [[World War II]]. According to Cap, prior to the Weapon X project, Wolverine was Corporal James Howlett of the [[Canadian Air Force]].

{{spoiler}}
In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #75, Ultimate [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] reveals a set of Wolverine-like claws, and claims that he doesn't "pop" them for just anyone. He also addresses the character he is speaking to as "Bub." It is revealed in ''Ultimate X-men'' #76 that this Cable is a future version of Wolverine that has come back to kill Professor Xavier. He has apparently lost his healing factor over the years, as he is in a stage of advanced age (Not normally possible with his healing factor), as well as sporting a bionic arm.
{{endspoiler}}

===''Wolverine: The End''=== 	 
In this non-canon series by writer [[Paul Jenkins]] and artist [[Claudio Castellini]]  purporting to be Wolverine's last adventure, Logan is an old man living in the Canadian wilderness making a modest living selling animal pelts. His only friend is a sixty-one year old man called George, who has been delivering Logan's groceries since he was a child. Though Logan has aged incredibly slowly, it seems that the long, long years have finally started to catch up with him. Though still faster than a normal man, he isn't as fast as he used to be and has trouble keeping up with the animals he hunts due to arthritis in his hands. His claws no longer work properly and one of them has even been broken off. Logan knows that, despite his healing factor, he will die soon. He doubts his own sanity and his memories, including the Weapon X program. This doubt is exacerbated by the spirit of Professor X, who lives on (in diminished capacity) in Logan's mind. 	 

[[Image:Sabfun.jpg|200px|Right|thumb|Sabretooth's funeral from ''Wolverine: The End'' #6 (January 2005). Pencils by [[Claudio Castellini]].]] 	 

One day, Wolverine is invited to the funeral of Victor Creed, also known as Sabretooth. After denouncing Sabretooth's faith in God as a fear of death, Wolverine receives a letter from Creed's attorney. He has George drive him to an ancient and destitute mansion in Alberta. After quickly walking through the mansion, George notices that a crest above the fireplace is the same as on the letter given to him by Creed. Wolverine finds the grave of John Howlett and a book entitled ''Ghosts of Japan: Lost Rituals of the Kanaguri''. Someone had left the book on the grave earlier that day, knowing that Wolverine had lived both in Japan and in that region of Alberta. Paranoid, Wolverine goes to a port on the West Coast and stows away on a ship headed for Japan. Before he leaves, he has George go back to his home, asking him to check a stack of magazines in his cabin, saying "one of them ain't right. It ain't...me, if ya follow". 	 

While working as a galley assistant on the voyage to Japan, Logan reads ''Lost Rituals of the Kanaguri'', and learns that it is a factual account of a supposedly extinct evil Shinto sect. When he arrives at his destination, he breaks up a Kanaguri ritual. He asks the participants if they are working for Weapon X. The leader of the group declares his allegiance to the White Ghost, before being killed by a shadowy figure. Logan follows the figure up the mountain, where he is attacked and left for dead. Just before Logan passes out, the White Ghost says, "I could have killed you, old man. Any time in the last two hundred years, I could have killed you."

Back in Canada, George sifts through the magazines. Among ''Popular Mechanics'' and ''Custom Bikes'', he finds an issue of ''Wine Lover''. George recognizes the title is an [[anagram]] of "Wolverine". A note in the magazine gives George the [[login]] information to access Logan's computer. George finds instructions from Wolverine and is given the location of a large amount of cash, which he is to use to purchase a list of items. He is told to keep whatever money is left over as a tip (a joke that refers to a conversation in the first issue of the series, in which George complains that in fifty years of grocery deliveries, Logan has never given him a tip).

In Japan, Logan awakes. He discovers that the White Ghost is none other than John Howlett Jr., his brother, presumed dead during Logan's childhood. He is a mutant, with Logan's claws and healing factor, but also the power of invisibility and intangibility (similar to [[Shadowcat]]). He used these in a successful career as a spy, which in combination with his share of the Howlett fortune, has made him rich. He became involved in the Weapon X program (somehow aquiring his own set of adamantium claws), and watched Logan all through his life. He promises to tell Logan everything as soon as he completes his scheme: to teleport an atomic weapon into the atmosphere over Las Vegas. With this act, the American economy will collapse, and mutants will ascend in the resulting chaos. They struggle, falling out of a window. As they land, John is impaled on Logan's claws. With his dying breath, he tells Logan he's sorry that he doesn't have enough time to tell him about Rose. John dies in Logan's arms, just as Japanese attack helicopters arrive with orders to destroy the compound and all its occupants, Logan included.

===Age of Apocalypse=== 	 
Wolverine is never actually called "Wolverine" in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] time line, that name later being given to one of [[Dark Beast|Dark Beast's]] creations. Instead, Logan retains his code name of "Weapon X." In this reality he never had his Adamantium ripped out, and it is Magneto that helps him to control his feral rages. Weapon X was a loner and initially an unwilling recruit to the X-Men. He reconsidered after meeting the team’s telepath, Jean Grey. The two had an instant connection and eventually became lovers. 	 

[[Image:weaponx1.jpg|Cover to ''Weapon X'' #1 (1995), featuring Weapon X and Jean Grey in the Age of Apocalypse. Pencils by [[Adam Kubert]].|left|thumb|170px]] 	 

Logan trained Magneto’s newer recruits, including [[Shadowcat]]. Unbeknown to the rest of the X-Men, Magneto had asked Weapon X to train the girl as an assassin. Weapon X taught Shadowcat everything he knew and even crafted a pair of claws similar to his own for her with Magneto’s help. 	 

One of the main differences between Weapon X and the [[Earth 616]] Wolverine is that Weapon X’s left hand is missing and he has a number of facial tattoos. The hand was blasted off by the Prelate [[Scott Summers]], a villain in this universe, when Weapon X tried to rescue Jean from [[Mr. Sinister]]. He succeeded and gouged one of Summers' eyes out in return. Not willing to return to the X-Men, Logan and Jean worked on their own. 	 

After months of guerrilla warfare, they were contacted by Sinister who revealed Apocalypse’s plan to attack the humans in Europe. Logan and Jean delivered this information to the Human High Council and learned of the Council’s plan to launch nuclear missiles on America to stop Apocalypse. In the end, Jean was killed by the Prelate [[Havok|Alex Summers]], but Logan avenged her. 	 

Logan's relationships with some of his old enemies are different in the Age of Apocalypse universe, such as Sabretooth being his ally instead of his nemesis. In the recent 2005 mini-series of the Age of Apocalypse, Logan learned from Magneto that Jean is still alive, but mind-controlled by Mr. Sinister. Eventually, the X-Men face Sinister and manage to bring Jean back, and she and Logan become lovers again. Logan also learns that he now has a "daughter" of some-sorts in the form of the X-Man Kirika, who can be compared to [[X-23]]. Kirika's mother is revealed to be Mariko Yashida, Logan's former lover.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
[[Image:Newmangaverse2.jpg|Cover to ''New Mangaverse'' #2, featuring Wolverine and [[Lady Deathstrike|Deathstrike]], art by Tommy Ohtsuka.|right|thumb|150px]] 	 

In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] reality Wolverine, not [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], formed the X-men (Wolverine, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]] and Jean Grey forming the core of the group, with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] living with them). 

Wolverine has one set of long metal claws--most likely adamantium and shaped like [[katana]]s on his left hand, and another set, on his right hand, composed of red energy (like Cyclop's optic beams) and shaped like [[lightsaber]]s. Wolverine has incredible strength (He is clearly stronger than [[Spider-Man]] in this reality). He has white hair (it is later changed to black in the new mangaverse) and a strange tattoo on his face, possibly meant to be the Greek symbol Omega. 

In this reality, he and Cyclops are brothers. Wolverine cost Cyclops one of his eyes, while it is hinted that Cyclops cost Wolverine one of his hands. (This seems to be why one of Wolverine's sets of claws is energy while the other is metal. Throughout this story with the exception of a pair of panels, Wolverine was depicted with two flesh and blood hands, but his right hand had claws of energy, not adamantium. The flesh and blood appearance of both hands continued in the final issue of the first arc of Mangaverse). He is also hinted to have had a relationship with Jean Grey, who had begun to favor Cyclops. 

In the New Mangaverse, Wolverine is one of the only mutants to survive the Hand / SHIELD bio-engineered virus targeting mutants thanks to his healing factor.
Jean Grey's rejection of him has clearly left him with some issues since he said he had a thing for redheads and flirts with [[Spider-woman]] ([[Mary Jane Watson]]) in ''New Mangaverse #2''. Spider-man becomes angry and tries to fight him but proves to be no match for Wolverine and it is ultimately the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] that stops him. He flirts with the Black Cat throughout the New Mangaverse miniseries, saying "I've always been a sucker for a girl with a nice set of... CLAWS."  It is also hinted that at some point in the past he was [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s lover.
In the New Mangaverse, Wolverine teams up with the Black Cat, [[Captain America]] ([[Carol Danvers]]), [[Iron Man]], Spider-Man, Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson), and [[Torchie]] (Jonatha Storm, [[Sue Storm|Sioux Storm]]'s little sister, this reality's [[Human Torch]]) to fight the Hand (some of the organization's more prominent members being Lady Deathstrike, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], and a (brainwashed) [[Sharon Carter]]).

===''X-Men: The End''=== 	 
In the alternate future of ''X-Men: The End'', Wolverine is caring for a crippled [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and has given up his life as an X-Man. However after being attacked by a [[Warskrull]], Wolverine and Storm return to the X-Men only to find a crater where the mansion stood. Wolverine along with [[Rachel Summers]], X-23 and a few others were sent to find out what happened to [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and his team. Wolverine and Jean Grey/Phoenix meet up again. Jean helps Logan break free of the Lady Mastermind and later helps him heal. They are shown as lovers (at least in their minds) and very much in love.

===''Earth X''=== 	 
According to the information in the [[Earth X]] [[miniseries]] ''Paradise X: Heralds'', the second child of the Howletts died in childbirth and the Howletts found and adopted an infant member of the Moon Clan, a bestial race which has co-existed with humanity for hundreds of thousands of years. This Clan,which is also dubbed wolf clan, were mortal enemies of the Bear Clan, to which Sabretooth belongs. Supposedly, it is this Moon Tribe child who was named James Howlett and would grow up to become Wolverine explaining the enmity between Wolverine and Sabretooth in this alternate reality.

It is also revealed that this seemingly divergent sub-species is in fact what the "true" human species would have become if not for the Celestials' intervention and genetic tampering.

===Wolverine: Snikt!=== 	 
In this comic by [[Tsutomu Nihei]], Wolverine is sent into an alternate future, arriving there by the hand of the humans of that age in need for a weapon to fight against a race of engineered viruses that grow up to be sentient beings, and who can only be destroyed with adamantium. Though whether this is the future of the Marvel universe or whether it is a crossover into another universe is not completely made clear. This is mainly because Marvel has so many alternate futures and universes, making it difficult to place this particular world within them.

===Days of Future Past=== 	 
In this alternate reality the [[X-Men]] fail to prevent the assassination of [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]], which results in [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] ruling the [[United States of America]] by 2013 AD. Mutants fall one by one at the hands of the Sentinels, until only Wolverine, Storm, Colossus and Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat) are left. They are confronted by a group of Sentinels and Wolverine lunges at one, ready to slice off the Sentinel's head, but his flesh is burned off by the Sentinel's hand laser. Wolverine dies and his charred Adamantium skeleton falls onto the ground. Later on in the Earth X: Heralds storyline, Wolverine is revived by X-51's machine.

===Exiles & Weapon X===
Another version of Wolverine, originating from Earth-172, was revealed by Sabretooth to have joined an alternate, more sinister version of Weapon X in the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] series.

===Other comic series===
Based off the animated series of the same name, ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' #5 introduces a Beastial version of Wolverine and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].  When the Chameleon assumes Spider-Man's form, Wolverine is able to sense the phony due to the scent.

In the [[MC2]] universe, Wolverine and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] have a daughter named Rina Logan, who inherits her father's healing factor and senses and possesses "psychic claws" which resemble [[Psylocke]]'s telepathic "psychic knife". She becomes a superheroine called [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]]. He also has a son with another woman. His son's name is [[Sabreclaw|Sabreclaw (Hudson Logan)]], and he looks like a short version of [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] with Wolverine's hair color.

In the alternate future that the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] come from, Wolverine's great-great-granddaughter is the evil mutant queen [[Rancor (comics)|Rancor]], who is obsessed with her ancestor.

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] line, Wolverine is combined with [[Batman]] to form the character [[Dark Claw]].

In an alternate reality, Genesis is successful in his attempt to re-implant Adamantium into Wolverine's skeleton, and Wolverine becomes Apocalypse's Horseman of Death. He kills Apocalypse and every single supervillain. War is hunted by superheroes when he begins to kill common criminals. When Wolverine disappears, a superhuman police force called the War Watch forms to protect the public from ''The Enemy'', as Wolverine is now dubbed, while the Wolf Pack, a gang of criminals, becomes a cult of sorts, inspired by Wolverine's violent tendencies. Secretly, Wolverine seeks redemption and calls himself Brother Xavier.(What If? #111).

==Appearances in other media== 	
Wolverine is the only character to be included in every non-comics media adaptation of the ''X-Men'' franchise, including [[film]], [[television]], [[computer and video games]], and is the only X-Man to have starred in his own video games. 

===Films=== 
[[Image:Wolverine X-Men.jpg|[[Hugh Jackman]] as Wolverine in ''[[X2 (film)|''X2]]''|thumb]]	 
*[[Hugh Jackman]] plays Wolverine in the ''X-Men'' films [[X-Men (film)|''X-Men'']], [[X2 (film)|''X2'']], and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. When it was first announced, it was considered a highly controversial move, as Hugh Jackman was not only known solely for his performance career, but the fact that he was simply too tall for the role (Jackman being 6'3", the comic-book version of Wolverine being approximately 5'3"). Despite these divergences though, Jackman's actual performance was well received.<ref> {{cite web| title = Daily Poll: Superhero casting| publisher = IMDb| url = http://www.imdb.com/poll/results/2006-07-12| accessdate = 2006-10-21}}</ref>

===Action Figures===
Wolverine has often been rendered in plastic, either independently, or in conjuntion with other media. [[Mattel]] was the first, with the 1984 [[Secret Wars]] line. Supported by five points of articulation, incuding; the neck, shoulders and hips. Among other notable figures, started a controversial trend in toys...the  variant.  His claws came in two different color options, one set silver, the other set black. When collectors began trying to complete their sets for Secret Wars, the silver set being readily available, while the black set was found to be rare.

While Wolverine was the first to be rendered in plastic, The other X-Men would go several years with no interest, until 1992 when, [[Night of the Sentinels]] was shown in animated form. With a toy line in stores retailing at roughly five inches, they had a modest roster of seven figures. The sculpts were a cross between DC's Superpowers line and GI Joe. The points of articulation included on these figures were relatively standard, but many of the figures also include action features as well.

Out of the twenty-eight waves of the X-Men line produced by [[Toybiz]], starting with 1991s series 1, only two series of the line did not feature a Wolverine (Counting Albert, because his package clearly states; "[[Robot Wolverine]]"...) Twenty-six (26) figures were eventually produced, but with; repaints, two-ups (10" figures) or reissues, the total count is uncertain.

In 1998, Marvel had begun producing [[X-Men: Evolution]] in 99', and that Line of toys yielded a net of six (6!) Wolverine action figures. But at the same time of the movies release, Wolverine gave us another nine (9!) figures. X-Men: Evolution's. The toy line performed well, as Toybiz began producing figures in 6" to support the character's animated exploits. In 2003, they featured a figures with twenty-six POA. X-men:Classics were 6" and they added three (3) Wolverines...

[[Marvel Legends]] started in 2002, releasing two solid waves with no Wolverine. Toybiz boasted 26+ POA (points of articulation), extreme detail, and excellent paint applications. It seemed that Marvel wanted to create iconic versions of all their characters with the collector in mind. Gone were the days of colorful, childlike toy packages. They were replaced with; impenetrable clamshells that flattered the characters in general. In the first ten series of ML, there were only five wolverines produced. X-Men's adjectiveless Toy Line was started with another three (3) figures. Diamond Select began a [[Marvel Select]]  collectors line-up. They promised even more detail than the X-Men and Marvel Legends lines. Although they weren't in scale with the other figures, offered more Wolverines, three(3) to date. Marvel Legends has provided thirteen (13) different figures, including variants, including deluxe scale figures and [[Icons]]. Hasbro, who took over the Marvel liscense from Toybiz, will be releasing Ultimate Wolverine in their second series, scheduled for May-June 2007.

There are always new collectors, as well as children, who want to purchase their first Wolverine. With over Ninety-Nine (99) versions to choose from, collectors have seemingly endless options.
