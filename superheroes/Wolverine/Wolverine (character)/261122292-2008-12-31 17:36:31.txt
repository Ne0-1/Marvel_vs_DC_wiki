'''Wolverine''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #180 ([[1974#October|October 1974]]) and was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita Sr.]], who designed the character, and was first drawn for publication by [[Herb Trimpe]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Chamber/8346/trimpe.interview.2.html Green Skin's Grab-Bag: "An Interview with Herb Trimpe", p. 2]: "That was John Romita's design. I drew him first in ''Hulk'' #181 [sic]. But it was Romita's vision based on Len's idea".</ref>  Wolverine later joined the X-Men's "All New, All Different" roster in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1975#May|May 1975]]). In May 2008, Wolverine was ranked # 1 out of "[[Wizard Magazine]]'s Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time"<ref>http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05230810thgreatestcharacters3.html</ref> and was ranked #4 of "The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters" by [[Empire Magazine]] in July 2008.<ref name="E #50">[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=4 ''Empire Top 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters'', July 2008]</ref>  ''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] played a significant role in the character's subsequent development as well as artist/writer [[John Byrne]], who insisted on making the character older than the other X-Men. Artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] collaborated with Claremont and helped to revise the character with a four part eponymous limited series from September to December 1982 in which Wolverine's catch phrase, "I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do isn't very nice".

Born '''James Howlett''' and commonly known as '''Logan''', Wolverine is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, retracting bone claws, and a [[healing factor]] that allows him to quickly recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin, enabling him to live beyond a normal human lifespan. This healing ability enabled the [[supersoldier]] program [[Weapon X]] to bond the near indestructible metal [[alloy]] [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] to his [[human skeleton|skeleton]] and claws. Wolverine was typical of the many tough anti-authority [[anti-hero]]es that emerged in American popular culture after the [[Vietnam War]];<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Johns Hopkins, 2001. Pg. 265</ref> his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for [[comic book]] anti-heroes by the end of the 1980s.<ref>Wright, pg. 277</ref> As a result, the character became the clear favorite for fans of the increasingly popular X-Men franchise.<ref>Wright, pg 263, 265</ref> Wolverine has been featured in his own solo comic since 1988 and has been a central character in every X-Men adaptation, including [[List of animated television series|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and the [[live-action]] [[20th Century Fox]] [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], in which he is played by [[Hugh Jackman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/ |title=X-Men IMDb|accessdate=2007-05-03 }}</ref>

==Publication history==
[[Image:inchulk181.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Wolverine made his debut in a battle against the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. ''The Incredible Hulk'' #181 (Nov 1974). Art by [[Herb Trimpe]].]]
Wolverine first appeared in the final "teaser" panel of ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #180 ([[cover date]] October 1974) written by Len Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications in early July (cover date November) before making his first major appearance in ''Hulk'' #181 (cover date November 1974) again by Wein and Trimpe. John Romita, Sr. designed Wolverine's yellow-and-blue costume. The character's introduction was ambiguous, revealing little beyond his being a [[superhuman]] agent of the [[Canada|Canadian]] government. In these appearances, he does not retract his claws, although Len Wein stated they had always been envisioned as retractable.<ref name="retractable">{{cite news |url=http://woodwardiocom.livejournal.com/326299.html#LenWein |publisher=Jonathan Woodward |title=CONvergence I, Len Wein |date=July 8, 2005}}</ref> He appears briefly in the finale to this story in ''Hulk'' #182.

Wolverine's next appearance was in 1975's ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, written by Wein and penciled by [[Dave Cockrum]], in which Wolverine is recruited for a new squad. [[Gil Kane]], who drew the cover of the comic, accidentally drew Wolverine's mask wrong, with larger headpieces. Dave Cockrum liked Kane's alteration (believing it to be similar to [[Batman]]'s mask) and decided to incorporate it into his own artwork for the actual story.<ref>Brian Cunningham, "Dressed to Kill", ''Wizard Tribute to Wolverine'', 1996.</ref> Cockrum was also the first artist to draw Wolverine without his mask, and the distinctive hairstyle became a trademark of the character.

A revival of ''X-Men'' followed, beginning with ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #94 (August 1975), drawn by Cockrum and written by Chris Claremont. In ''Uncanny X-Men'', Wolverine is initially overshadowed by the other characters, although he does create tension in the team as he has a crush on [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops']] girlfriend, [[Jean Grey]]. As the series progressed, Claremont and Cockrum (who preferred [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]<ref name="X-Men Companion">''X-Men Companion''</ref>) considered dropping Wolverine from the series;<ref name="X-Men Companion"/> Cockrum's successor, artist [[John Byrne]], championed the character, later explaining, as a Canadian himself, he did not want to see a Canadian character dropped.<ref>DeFalco, Tom. ''Comic Creators on X-Men''. Titan, 2006. Pg. 110</ref> Byrne created [[Alpha Flight]], a group of Canadian superheroes who try to recapture Wolverine due to the expense their government incurred training him. Later stories gradually establish Wolverine's murky past and unstable nature, which he battles to keep in check. Byrne also designed a new brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine, but retained the distinctive Cockrum cowl.

Following Byrne's departure, Wolverine remained in ''X-Men''. The character's growing popularity led to a solo, four-issue [[limited series]], ''Wolverine'' (Sept.-December 1982), by Claremont and Frank Miller, followed by the six-issue ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' by Claremont and [[Al Milgrom]] (November 1984 - April 1985). Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by [[John Buscema]] in November 1988. It ran for 189 issues. [[Larry Hama]] later took over the series and had an extensive run. Other writers who wrote for the two ''Wolverine'' ongoing series include [[Peter David]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Erik Larsen]], [[Frank Tieri (writer)|Frank Tieri]], [[Greg Rucka]], and [[Mark Millar]]. Many popular artists have also worked on the series, including John Byrne, [[Marc Silvestri]], [[Mark Texeira]], [[Adam Kubert]], [[Leinil Francis Yu]], [[Rob Liefeld]], [[Sean Chen]], [[Darick Robertson]], [[John Romita, Jr.]], and [[Humberto Ramos]]. During the 1990s, the character was revealed to have bone claws, after his adamantium is ripped out by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #25, which was inspired by a passing joke of Peter David's.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brian Cronin|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #96|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=[[2007-03-29]]| url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-96/| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

In addition to the ''Wolverine'' series and appearances in the various ''X-Men'' series, two other storylines expand upon the character's past: "Weapon X", by writer-artist [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], serialized in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #72-84 (1991); and ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'', a six-issue limited series by co-writers [[Joe Quesada]], [[Paul Jenkins]], and [[Bill Jemas]] and artist [[Andy Kubert]] (November 2001 -  July 2002). A second solo series, ''Wolverine: Origins'', written by [[Daniel Way]] with art by [[Steve Dillon]], [[spin-off|spun out of]] and runs concurrently with the second ''Wolverine'' solo series.

====Wolverine's first intended origin==== 	 
Co-creator Len Wein originally intended for Logan to be a mutated wolverine cub, evolved to humanoid form by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/10/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-21/|title=CBR.cc: Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #21|accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref> In ''X-Men'' #98, a biological analysis of Wolverine suggests that he was in some way different from the other X-Men, and in ''X-Men'' #103, Wolverine says he doesn't believe in [[leprechaun]]s, to which the leprechaun replies, "Maybe leprechauns don't believe in ''talkin' wolverines'', either."<ref>''X-Men'' #103, p.14, panel 3</ref>
In a reprint of Hulk #180-181, titled Incredible Hulk and Wolverine, an interview with Cockrum supports the claim that Wolverine was intended to be a mutated wolverine. Cockrum said he considered having the High Evolutionary play a vital role in making Wolverine a human. He wanted Wolverine to be the age of a young adult, with superhuman strength and agility similar to Spider-Man. This changed when Cockrum saw John Romita Sr. draw a mask-less Wolverine as a hairy 40-year-old. Creator Len Wein originally intended the claws to be retractable and part of Wolverine's gloves, and both gloves and claws would be made of adamantium. This idea was later nixed by Claremont because he believed anyone could then become Wolverine by wearing the gloves. The claws are first revealed to be part of Wolverine's anatomy in ''X-Men'' #98.

====Wolverine's second intended origin====
Byrne said (as stated in interviews and on his website) that he drew a possible face for Wolverine - but then learned that John Romita Sr. had already drawn one for him (Wolverine's face, drawn by Cockrum, can be seen in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #98, long before Byrne started). Later, Byrne used the drawing for [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth's]] face (an enemy of [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], who Claremont was also currently writing). Byrne then came up with the idea of Sabretooth being Wolverine's father (they both had similar healing abilities and raging tempers). Together, Byrne and Claremont came up with Wolverine being around 60 and having served in World War II after escaping from Sabretooth (who was around 120 years old and had been abusing him for decades - explaining his rages). The plan had been for Wolverine to have been almost crushed in an accident; at which point he would discover (when attempting to stand for the first time after recovering) that his healing factor does not work on bones - his legs immediately break. He then spends over a decade in a hospital bed, almost going mad (another reason for his berserker rages) when the Canadian Government approaches him with the idea of replacing his skeleton one bone at a time with solid adamantium - the claws being an extra surprise. This origin too was never used.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Wolverine-first-claws.jpg|thumb|right|200px|James Howlett in ''Origin #2.'']]
{{main|Fictional history of Wolverine}}
Born in 19th century [[Canada]] to rich plantation owners, James Howlett grows into manhood on a mining colony in [[Northern Alberta]], adopting the name "Logan", which is the last name of the plantation groundskeeper, [[Thomas Logan]] and his son [[Dog Logan|Dog]]. <ref>Origin #1</ref>  Logan leaves the colony and lives for a time in the wilderness among wolves, until returning to civilization, residing with the [[Blackfoot Indians]].  Following the death of his Blackfoot paramour, [[Silver Fox]], he is ushered into a Canadian military unit. Logan then spends some time in [[Madripoor]], developing his "Patch" persona; before settling in Japan, where he marries and has a [[Daken|son]].

During [[World War II]], Logan teams with [[Captain America]] versus [[HYDRA]], and continues a career as a soldier-of-fortune/adventurer.  Logan works for the First Canadian Parachute Battalion<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Marvel Comics|title=''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #34}}</ref>  and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] before being recruited for Team X.

As a member of Team X, Logan is given false memory implants.  He continues on the team, until he is able to break free of the mental control and joins the Canadian Defense Ministry. Logan is subsequently kidnapped by [[Weapon X]], where he remains captive and experimented on, until his rescue by the [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]], after which he returns to the Canadian wilderness.  It is during his imprisonment by [[Weapon X]] that he has unbreakable adamantium forcibly fused into his bones.

Logan is eventually discovered by [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James]] and [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]], who help him recover his humanity.  Following his recovery, Logan, this time under the supervision of [[Department H]], once again works for Canadian Intelligence.  Logan becomes Wolverine, one of Canada's first superheroes. In his first mission, he is dispatched to stop the destruction caused by a brawl between the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]].

[[Professor X]] recruits Wolverine to a new team of X-Men.<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1</ref> Disillusioned with his Canadian intelligence work and intrigued by Xavier's offer, Logan resigns from Department H. However, this only happened as recently discovered (2008) in the "Sins Of The Father" story arc after Professor X actually wipes Logan's memories and forces him to join the X-Men after Wolverine was sent on a assassination attempt to kill Xavier. This is a major story edit that changes the history of the character in a huge way because it opens up his past. After all one of the long standing character traits of Wolverine has always been his inability to remember his past and how his memory loss came to be. If his memory wipe and mental blocks were created by Professor X as a manipulation shortly before becoming an X-Man it would open his pre-X-Man past for major re-evaluation. Luckily for Logan and his fans his memories have all been recovered to him and his story lines over the coming years will delve more and more in to his past as he continues to adventure as a superhero.<ref> House of M #1</ref>

In ''X-Men'' #25 (1993), at the culmination of the "[[Fatal Attractions]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]], the [[supervillain]] [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] forcibly removes the adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton.  This massive trauma causes his healing factor to burn out and also leads to the discovery that his claws are actually bone. Wolverine leaves the X-Men for a time, embarking on a series of adventures during which his healing factor returns, greatly increased in speed and efficiency. After his return to the X-Men, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s son [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] kidnaps Wolverine and attempts to re-bond adamantium to his skeleton.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #99-100</ref>  This is unsuccessful and causes Wolverine's mutation to accelerate out of control. He is temporarily changed into a semi-sentient beast-like form in which he gains greater physical power than ever before, at the price of part of his humanity; he kills Genesis shortly after this occurs.  Finally, the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] captures Wolverine, brainwashes him, and has the adamantium re-bonded to his skeleton successfully. Wolverine overcomes Apocalypse's programming and returns to the X-Men.

==Powers and abilities==
Wolverine is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology. His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant [[healing factor]], that regenerates damaged or destroyed areas of his body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human.  This power facilitated the artificial improvements he was subjected to under the [[Weapon X]] program, in which his skeleton was reinforced with the nearly-indestructible material called [[adamantium]].

Wolverine's "healing factor" renders him virtually immune to nearly all physical harm, including toxins and diseases. However, he still suffers the immediate effects of such substances; he has been shown to become intoxicated after significant dosages of alcoholic beverages,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.1 #3 (Nov. 1982)</ref> and has been incapacitated on several occasions with drugs and poisons.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents vol.1 #87 (1991)</ref> Although his body heals, the healing factor doesn't suppress the pain he endures while injured.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #65 (Oct. 2007)</ref>

Depictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol.1 #107 (Oct. 1977)</ref> but writers have steadily increased this ability over the years. After several years, Wolverine's healing factor was depicted as healing severe wounds within a matter of days or hours.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.1 #2 (Oct. 1982)</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents vol.1 #86-90 (1991)</ref> Other writers went on to increase Wolverine's healing factor the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #92 (Aug. 1995)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #115 (Aug. 1997)</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol.2 #150 (Feb. 2004)</ref> One of the more extreme examples of Wolverine's healing factor shows the total regeneration of his soft body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #43 (Aug. 2006)</ref> Wolverine survives the explosion due to the protection his adamantium-laced skull provides to his brain.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #48</ref> It has been stated in the [[Xavier Protocols]], a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to "incredible levels" and that the only way to stop him is to [[decapitate]] him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol.1 #100</ref> It was also noted that the only thing that was able to slow his healing ability was carbonadium.<ref>"Wolverine: Origins" vol.1#7</ref> His healing factor also dramatically slows his aging process; despite being born in the late 1800s,<ref>''Origin'' mini-series</ref> he has the appearance and vitality of a man in his physical prime. Though he now has all of his memories, his healing abilities can provide increased recovery from psychological trauma by suppressing memories in which he experiences profound duress.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #175</ref>  

Wolverine's mutation also consists of animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.1 #2</ref> the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #75</ref> The claws are not made of [[keratin]], as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone, and can cut substances as durable as most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #91 and #101</ref> Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 # 77</ref> 

Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, is molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and [[Captain America's shield]], which is composed of the only substance in the [[Marvel Universe]] known to be even more durable than adamantium. Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. The adamantium also weights his blows, dramatically increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities.

Wolverine's healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.2 #5</ref> Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #5, ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004''</ref> Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury.<ref name="Wolverine vol.2 #1">''Wolverine'' vol.2 #1</ref> This, coupled by the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #57</ref> grants him some degree of superhuman strength. Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton.<ref>''Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004'' vol.1 #1</ref> He has been depicted breaking steel chains,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol.1 #111</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #51</ref> lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall<ref name="Wolverine vol.2 #1"/> and lifting [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] over his head before tossing him across a room.<ref>''Wolverine: First Class'' #8 (Dec. 2008)</ref>

Wolverine's senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute.  He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to both hear sounds ordinary humans can't and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify [[List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Shapeshifting|shapeshifting]] mutants despite other forms they may take.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 # 51</ref>

Due to high level [[psionic]] shields implanted by [[Professor Charles Xavier]], Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault and probing.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #46 (Nov. 2006)</ref> Wolverine's mind also possesses what he refers to as "psychic scar tissue" created by so many traumatic events over the course of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a telepath as powerful as [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''X-Men: Original Sin #1 (Dec. 2008)</ref> 

===Skills and personality=== 	 
During his time in Japan and other countries, Wolverine becomes an expert of virtually all forms of [[martial arts]] and is familiar with and experienced in virtually every fighting style on Earth. He is proficient with most weaponry, including firearms, though he is partial to bladed weapons. He has demonstrated sufficient skills to defeat the likes of [[Shang-Chi]]<ref>''X-Men'' Vol.2 #62</ref> and [[Captain America]]<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #4-5</ref> in single combat. He also has a wide knowledge of the body and [[pressure point]]s.<ref>''X-Men'' vol.2 #108/''Wolverine'' vol.3 #20</ref> He is also an accomplished [[aviator|pilot]] and highly skilled in the field of [[espionage]] and covert operations.

Wolverine will sometimes lapse into a "berserker rage" while in close combat. In this state he lashes out with the intensity and aggression of an enraged animal and is even more resistant to psionic attack.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #168</ref> Though he loathes it, he acknowledges that it has saved his life many times.  Despite his apparent ease at taking lives, he does not enjoy killing or giving into his berserker rages. Logan adheres to a firm [[Bushido|code]] of personal [[honor]] and [[morality]].<ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 2, #1. "I'm an X-Man. [...] With them, killing is a last resort.  With me, it's second nature.  I take the world as it is, and give better than I get.  Come at me with a sword.  I'll meet you with a sword.  You want mercy.  Show a little first.  [...] Some of those folks died fighting...some praying...some accepted their fate...some cursed it...some begged for their lives...most were terrified.  Details don't matter.  What's important is that they '''died'''.  And those scales have to be balanced.  In kind."</ref>

In contrast to his brutish nature, Wolverine is actually extremely intelligent. Due to his increased lifespan, he has traveled the world and amassed extensive knowledge of foreign languages and cultures.  He can speak [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Arab language|Arabic]], and [[Lakota language|Lakota]]; he also has some knowledge of [[French language|French]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Wolverine
|publisher=Marvel Comics|title=List of languages present on Marvel.com (excluding German, mentioned in ''Wolverine'' vol.2  #37, and Portuguese, mentioned in "Wolverine: Saudade" - Cedex: Panini, 2006.)}}</ref> 
When [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] monitors Wolverine's vitals during a Danger Room training session, he calls Logan's physical and mental state "equivalent of an Olympic-level gymnast performing a gold medal routine while simultaneously beating four chess computers in his head."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Marvel Comics|title=''Wolverine'' vol. 1 #51}}</ref>

Wolverine is frequently depicted as a gruff [[loner]], often taking leave from the X-Men to deal with personal issues or problems. He is often irreverent and rebellious towards authority figures, though he is a reliable ally and capable leader. He has been a mentor and father figure to several younger women, especially [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and [[Kitty Pryde]], and has had romantic relationships with numerous women (most notably [[Mariko Yashida]]<ref>''Wolverine'', vol. 1, #1-4</ref>), as well as a mutual but unrequited attraction to [[Jean Grey]], leading to jealous run-ins with her boyfriend (later husband), [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]].

Though he is a skilled combatant, Wolverine is frequently depicted entering combat situations in which he willingly allows himself to sustain injuries that would permanently cripple or kill those without sufficiently enhanced healing capabilities. In such situations, he relies on his healing factor and adamantium skeleton to handle the damage.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #65 (Jan. 1993)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #47 (Dec. 2006)</ref> He is also depicted on occasion deliberately injuring himself or allowing himself to be injured for varying reasons including freeing himself from capture,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #98 (Feb. 1996)</ref> intimidation,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #184 (Feb. 2003)</ref> strategy,<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #63 (May. 2008)</ref> or simply indulging his feral nature.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #90 (Feb. 1995)</ref><ref>''Wolverine Annual'' '95 (June. 1995)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #186 (Apr. 2003)</ref> Despite having an almost superhuman pain tolerance, he does not enjoy being hurt and sometimes has to work himself up for situations where extreme pain is certain.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #105 (Sept. 1996)</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #64 (Jun. 2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
{{main|Alternate versions of Wolverine}}
As one of Marvel's flagship characters, Wolverine has seen many adaptations and re-imaginings. For example, an issue of ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' featured a planet of Wolverines. In the ''[[Marvel Mangaverse]]'', Wolverine is even the founder of the X-Men. In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Wolverine appears zombified alongside Marvel's other major players. The [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics sought to ingrain Wolverine into its ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' title from the onset. The latest alternate version is seen in the [[Old Man Logan]] storyline set in an alternate timeline 50 years into the future where the world's superhuman heroes are dead. In this timeline, Wolverine has aged considerably and has become a [[pacifist]]. The story is currently ongoing.

==In other media==
{{main|Wolverine in other media}}
