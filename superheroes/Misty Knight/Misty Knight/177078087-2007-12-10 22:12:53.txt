'''Misty Knight''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe]].  She first appeared (by name) in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975). She normally appears with [[Colleen Wing]].

==Publication history==
Misty Knight first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and was created by writer [[Tony Isabella]].  A later [[retcon]] in {{issue}} by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]] would reveal she had previously appeared as an unnamed character in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (1st series) #1 (March 1972), written by [[Roy Thomas]] and penciled by [[Ross Andru]]. Notable comics in which Knight and [[Colleen Wing]] have starred include a storyline first printed in ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #32-33 (January &ndash; February 1977) and ''Bizarre Adventures'' #25 (March 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and penciller [[Marshall Rogers]]. The original depictions of Knight, a bionically enhanced [[African American|black]] female [[detective]] with [[martial arts]] skills,  were strongly influenced by the [[blaxploitation]] and [[Kung Fu]] [[craze]]s of the 1970s.

She was a longtime supporting character in comic books such as ''[[X-Men]]'' and ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]''; she also had a major role in the [[Deathlok]] story arc 'Souls of Cyber-Folk' that ran from issue 2-5 of the 1991 Deathlok series (Vol. 2). The character, alongside her partner [[Colleen Wing]], starred in ''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'', a 2005 six issue [[limited series]] by writers [[Justin Gray]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and penciller [[Khari Evans]]. 

Misty is one of the stars of the 2006 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series.

==Fictional character biography==
Misty was seriously injured preventing a bomb attack back when she was a member of NYPD. Her right arm was amputated and rather than take a desk job, she resigned from the police force. [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] provided her a [[bionic]] arm which endowed her superhuman strength. She then set up a [[private investigator|private detective]] agency with her friend Colleen Wing entitled "Nightwing Restorations Ltd." 

Misty roomed with [[X-Men]] member [[Jean Grey]] until Jean returned to her life as an X-Man.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Misty has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who will be a part of the ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. </ref><ref>http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map</ref>

===Relationships with Iron Fist and Power Man===
Soon after she first met [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], the two characters fell in love. Her "Knightwing Restorations Ltd" detective agency would go on to help [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and Iron Fist's [[Heroes for Hire]] agency on numerous cases. Later, when Iron Fist broke up with her, Misty began a short romance with Power Man. This episode was a source of tension between Power Man and Iron Fist in their shared title for a brief period.

When Iron Fist was presumed dead for an extended period, Misty assisted [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] in finding and saving the hero. She and Danny Rand renewed their relationship.

==Powers and abilities==
Misty Knight is highly skilled in [[martial arts]] and is a proficient hand-to-hand fighter. She also has near-perfect aim with firearms. Her bionic arm is superhumanly strong, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. However, since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.

Her new arm was built by [[Stark Industries]] and is an alloy of [[vibranium|Antarctic vibranium]] and [[diamond]]; at close range it can liquify all known metals including [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]]. It is also now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to [[Iron Man's armor]] <ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #6</ref>.  It can also apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold also seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen. <ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7 (2007)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Misty Knight===
The [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] version of Misty Knight has appeared in the 2006 limited series ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]'' which was written by [[Warren Ellis]] and drawn by [[Brandon Peterson]]. She appears to have the same origin story as before, with an artificial arm created by Tony Stark. While investigating a "Paul Maitreya", a cult leader who resembles the [[Silver Surfer]], she encounters a bald-headed woman who shoots Paul and his cult before escaping Misty. This woman appears to be one of an army of genetic clones of Heather Douglas a.k.a. [[Moondragon]].

===House Of M===
She is part of [[Luke Cage| Luke Cage's ]] resistance, and is killed when a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks their base and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] fails to teleport her out. It was retconned ([[retroactive continuity]]) in 'House Of M Avengers #2' that Misty was originally placed in Luke Cage's Avengers as a NYPD spy operating under [[John Proudstar]].

===MC2===
In the alternate future of the [[MC2]] universe, Misty eventually settled down and married Iron Fist. Unfortunately, at some point in the past, she died of cancer. Because of this Iron Fist gave up crime-fighting, and began to live as a simple martial arts trainer.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Misty was one of many 'flatscans'- non-mutants- forced underground by Apocalypse. When her friends were attacked by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], that had come to Earth, Misty escaped with the aid of [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott]] and [[Havok (X-Men)|Alex Summers]], only to subsequently die fighting the reanimated corpses of her former friends.
