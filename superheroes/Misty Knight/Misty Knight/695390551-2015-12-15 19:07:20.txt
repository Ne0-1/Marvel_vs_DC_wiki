'''Misty Knight''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].  She was first mentioned (by name) in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and appeared in the next issue. She appears frequently with [[Colleen Wing]].

==Publication history==
Misty Knight was first mentioned in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and was created by writer [[Tony Isabella]] with artist [[Arvell Jones]].  A later [[retcon]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (1st series)  #64 by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] would reveal she had previously appeared as an unnamed character in ''Marvel Team-Up'' (1st series) #1 (March 1972), written by [[Roy Thomas]] and penciled by [[Ross Andru]]. Comics in which Knight and [[Colleen Wing]] have starred include a storyline first printed in ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #32-33 (January â€” February 1977) and ''Bizarre Adventures'' #25 (March 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and penciller [[Marshall Rogers]]. The original depictions of Knight, a bionically enhanced [[African American|black]] female [[detective]] with [[martial arts]] skills,  were strongly influenced by the [[blaxploitation]] and [[Kung Fu]] [[fad|craze]]s of the 1970s{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

She was a longtime supporting character in comic books such as ''[[X-Men]]'' and ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]''; she also had a major role in the ''[[Deathlok]]'' story arc 'Souls of Cyber-Folk' that ran from issue 2-5 of the 1991 ''Deathlok'' series (Vol. 2). The character, alongside her partner [[Colleen Wing]], starred in ''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'', a 2005 six issue [[limited series]] by writers [[Justin Gray]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and penciller [[Khari Evans]].

Misty is one of the stars of the 2006 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series as well as a supporting character in the ongoing series ''The Immortal Iron Fist''.

In 2010, Misty appears in the crossover event [[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]], and is the central character in the spin-off title ''Shadowland: Blood on the Street''. She then goes on to star in the new version of ''Heroes for Hire''.

Misty Knight appears in the 2013 series ''[[Fearless Defenders]]'' by [[Cullen Bunn]] and [[Will Sliney]].<ref name="Fearless">{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/fearless-defenders-marvel-now-cullen-bunn.html |title=Marvel NOW!

==Powers and abilities==
Misty Knight is highly skilled in [[martial arts]] and is a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, with police combat training. She also has near-perfect aim with firearms, and possesses superb detective skills. Her bionic arm is superhumanly strong, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. However, since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.

Her original bionic right arm was constructed from steel, and designed by Stark International. Her new arm was built by [[Stark Industries]] and is an alloy of [[vibranium|Antarctic vibranium]] and [[diamond]]; at close range it can liquefy all known metals including [[adamantium]]. It is also now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to [[Iron Man's armor]].<ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #6</ref>  It can also apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold also seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7 (2007)</ref> Iron Man also revealed the arm also displays [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Technopathy|technopathic]] capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots.<ref name="World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1"/> Following her "pregnancy", Danny Rand spent money on additional features to the arm, including magnetism and a concussive blast.<ref>''Shadowland: Blood on the Street'' #1-3</ref>

===MC2===
In the alternate future of the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Misty eventually settled down and married Iron Fist. Unfortunately, at some point in the past, she died of cancer.

While investigating a "Paul Maitreya", a cult leader who resembles the [[Silver Surfer]], she encounters a bald-headed woman who shoots Paul and his cult before escaping Misty. This woman appears to be one of an army of genetic clones of Heather Douglas a.k.a. [[Moondragon]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}
