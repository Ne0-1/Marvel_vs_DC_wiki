'''Misty Knight''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe]].  She first appeared (by name) in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975). She normally appears with [[Colleen Wing]].

==Publication history==
Misty Knight first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and was created by writer [[Tony Isabella]].  A later [[retcon]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (1st series)  #64 by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]] would reveal she had previously appeared as an unnamed character in ''Marvel Team-Up'' (1st series) #1 (March 1972), written by [[Roy Thomas]] and penciled by [[Ross Andru]]. Notable comics in which Knight and [[Colleen Wing]] have starred include a storyline first printed in ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #32-33 (January â€” February 1977) and ''Bizarre Adventures'' #25 (March 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and penciller [[Marshall Rogers]]. The original depictions of Knight, a bionically enhanced [[African American|black]] female [[detective]] with [[martial arts]] skills,  were strongly influenced by the [[blaxploitation]] and [[Kung Fu]] [[craze]]s of the 1970s.

She was a longtime supporting character in comic books such as ''[[X-Men]]'' and ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]''; she also had a major role in the [[Deathlok]] story arc 'Souls of Cyber-Folk' that ran from issue 2-5 of the 1991 Deathlok series (Vol. 2). The character, alongside her partner [[Colleen Wing]], starred in ''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'', a 2005 six issue [[limited series]] by writers [[Justin Gray]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and penciller [[Khari Evans]]. 

Misty is one of the stars of the 2006 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series as well as a supporting character in the ongoing series ''The Immortal Iron Fist''.

Misty was seriously injured preventing a bomb attack back when she was a police officer with the NYPD. Her right arm was amputated and rather than take a desk job, she resigned from the police force.

==Powers and abilities==
Misty Knight is highly skilled in [[martial arts]] and is a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, with police combat training. She also has near-perfect aim with firearms, and possesses superb detective skills. Her bionic arm is superhumanly strong, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. However, since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.

Her original bionic right arm was constructed from steel, and designed by Stark International. Her new arm was built by [[Stark Industries]] and is an alloy of [[vibranium|Antarctic vibranium]] and [[diamond]]; at close range it can liquefy all known metals including [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]]. It is also now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to [[Iron Man's armor]] <ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #6</ref>.  It can also apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold also seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7 (2007)</ref> Iron Man also revealed the arm also displays technopathic capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots.<ref name="World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1"/>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Misty Knight===
The [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] version of Misty Knight has appeared in the 2006 limited series ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]'' which was written by [[Warren Ellis]] and drawn by [[Brandon Peterson]]. She appears to have the same origin story as before, with an artificial arm created by Tony Stark. While investigating a "Paul Maitreya", a cult leader who resembles the [[Silver Surfer]], she encounters a bald-headed woman who shoots Paul and his cult before escaping Misty. This woman appears to be one of an army of genetic clones of Heather Douglas a.k.a. [[Moondragon]].

===House Of M===
She is part of [[Luke Cage]]'s resistance, and is killed when a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks their base and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] fails to teleport her out. It was revealed within the past that Misty was originally placed in Luke Cage's Avengers as an NYPD spy operating under [[John Proudstar]], but defected to the Avengers after refusing Proudstar's order to kill Cage <ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2-#3</ref>. Misty eventually became Luke's lover, after some time has passed since the [[Taskmaster]]'s murder of Tigra. It was Misty who realized that Luke's Avengers were inspiring non-mutants to fight for their rights as "Sapien" and tried to convince Cage to think beyond protecting Sapien Town<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #4 & #5</ref>.

===MC2===
In the alternate future of the [[MC2]] universe, Misty eventually settled down and married Iron Fist. Unfortunately, at some point in the past, she died of cancer. Because of this Iron Fist gave up crime-fighting, and began to live as a simple martial arts trainer.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Misty was one of many 'flatscans'- non-mutants- forced underground by Apocalypse. When her friends were attacked by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], that had come to Earth, Misty escaped with the aid of [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott]] and [[Havok (X-Men)|Alex Summers]], only to subsequently die fighting the reanimated corpses of her former friends.
