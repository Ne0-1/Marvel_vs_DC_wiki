[[nl:Electro]]

'''Electro''' (occasionally referred to as ''electro funk'') is an electronic style of [[hip hop]] especially influenced by [[Kraftwerk]] and [[funk]] records (unlike earlier [[rap]] records that were closer to [[disco]], musically speaking). [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s Planet Rock ([[1982]]) is generally considered the first electro record, it mixed Kraftwerk and [[Captain Sky]], or was at least influenced by the latter. Electro also flourished on the west coast, where [[Egyptian Lover]] and [[Arabian Prince]] gave birth to [[Bass music]] (also known as [[Miami bass]]) as well as influencing [[House music]], [[Techno music| Techno]], [[Ghettotech]] and other electronic styles of [[dance music]].

'''Electro''' is the name of a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Spider-Man]] [[comic book]].
He is extremely powerful, but like the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], is usually outwitted by the wall-crawler, so despite his great power, Electro is not the most threatening villain.
