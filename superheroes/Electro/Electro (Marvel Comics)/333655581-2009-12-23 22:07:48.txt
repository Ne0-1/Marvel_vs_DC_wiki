Maxwell Dillon was born to Jonathan and Anita Dillon in [[Endicott, New York]]. Jonathan was an [[accountant]], though he had trouble keeping a job. Because of this, Max and his family moved frequently when Max was young and he found it difficult to make friends. His hot-headed father abandoned his family when Max was eight years old. Anita subsequently became overprotective of Max, leading to his single greatest flaw as a supervillain: his [[inferiority complex]]. Years later, Max told his mother he wished to become an electrical [[engineer]]. Anita, not wanting him to be angry if he failed, convinced him he was not intelligent enough, and Max reluctantly took a job as a lineman for an [[electric company]]. 

While he was repairing a power line, a freak [[lightning]] accident resulted in a mutagenic change in his nervous system, transforming Dillon into a living electrical [[capacitor]]. His powers were initially weak, so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from Stark Industries to charge himself.  During this time, he was approached by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who considered him a potential recruit for his [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], claiming that Dillon's power rivaled his own, but Dillon refused. The following day, Dillon was confronted by a small-time thug who he'd been borrowing money from to pay for the machinery he'd needed. When the thug drew a gun on him because he hadn't payed back the money yet, he responded by shooting a blast of lightning through the thug's chest- the first time Dillon ever killed anybody.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' Volume 2 #2</ref> Soon taking the name Electro, he turned to a life of a professional criminal, his first victim being [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Electro broke into the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' Building and stole Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During his confrontation with Electro, Spider-Man was nearly killed when he touched the electrically charged supervillain. Spider-Man eventually used a [[fire hose]] to short-circuit Electro.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #9 (Feb. 1964)</ref>

Electro next confronted [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] for the first time.<ref>''Daredevil'' #2</ref> Electro later joined the original [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> Electro attacked the [[Fantastic Four]] at the wedding of [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], under the control of [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> He later recruited the second [[Emissaries of Evil]] in a plot of revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. This group consisted of [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], [[Stilt-Man]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], and the [[Matador (Marvel Comics)|Matador]].<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1</ref>

Electro was later hired by J. Jonah Jameson to defeat Spider-Man on national television.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #82</ref> He encountered Daredevil again in San Francisco, at which time he temporarily donned a modified costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' #87</ref> He then took control of a Protarian android seeking the destruction of [[Omega the Unknown|Omega]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #3</ref> Electro then teamed with [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]] against Spider-Man and Daredevil.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #56</ref> Electro then attempted to aid a band of criminals escaping the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #63</ref>

Electro later joined the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #39</ref> As part of the Frightful Four, he used Spider-Man as bait to trap the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #218</ref> Electro later learned that he can electro-statically disrupt Spider-Man's wall-crawling ability.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #134</ref> The [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] then sent the [[Shocker (comics)#Shocker I|Shocker]] to try to recruit Electro into their organization.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #157</ref> Instead, he later accepted [[Doctor Octopus]]' invitation to rejoin the Sinister Six, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #334-339</ref>

Electro has fought Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also fought such other heroes as Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and the [[The New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]]. Despite his immense power, he has almost always been defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged. 

As a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tried to take over [[New York City]]'s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarted this plan, however, and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career. When the insane Spider-Man clone [[Kaine]] started killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined [[Mysterio]]'s Sinister Seven, which had been formed to combat Kaine. This group was quickly disbanded, and following Kaine's subsequent disappearance, Electro returned to retirement.

This changed when [[Richard Fisk|The Rose]] agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electro's abilities, in exchange for Electro's services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life, Electro underwent the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of '''The True Believers''' (an offshoot of the famous ninja sect The [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]), a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Rose's operations, Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City's power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stopped him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, threw himself into the [[Hudson River]] while his body was highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.

Somehow surviving, Electro resurfaced later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six, formed to kill [[Senator Ward|Senator Stewart Ward]] and Doctor Octopus (whom the other members of the Six now hated due to his arrogance). His powers had seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wore a new blue-and-white costume. When [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacked Electro and left him for dead. Once again, Electro survived, and when he next appeared had returned to his yellow-and green-costume.

In the mid-2000s, Electro was working with the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] <ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2</ref> when they were attacked by Spider-Man, who thought they had kidnapped his [[Aunt May]]. Electro managed to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly, and shortly afterwards joined the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], assembled by the [[Green Goblin]], though he and the rest of the team was defeated thanks to the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]].

[[Image:Electro Scars.jpg|145px|Electro's new look ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Art by Paul Azaceta.|right|thumb]]
Later, separately, he was hired by the [[Skrull]] [[Skrull#Known Skrulls|Pagon]] (who was posing as [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]) to free [[Sauron (comics)|Karl Lykos]] (also known as Sauron) from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], a maximum-security [[prison]] for supervillains. After causing a riot, Electro tried to run away with his waitress girlfriend, but was captured by the [[The New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]], subsequently fainting when faced with the prospect of being beaten up by [[Luke Cage]], using Spider-Man's webbing to protect himself from Electro.<ref>''New Avengers'' #4</ref>

Later, Electro joined the Chameleon's "Exterminators[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/exterminatorschamln.htm]", seeking to take advantage of Peter Parker and his loved ones.

During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] storyline, Electro was among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s unnamed villain army when [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] raided the hideout.<ref>Civil War: War Crimes #1 (February 2007)</ref>

In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Electro appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force. After the Skrull posing as [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]] kidnaps the baby of Luke Cage and [[Jessica Jones]], the Avengers and the Fantastic Four begin going after everyone who is associated with the Skrulls. Because of this, Electro is confronted by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in an alley where, after a battle, he leaves Dillon beaten and unconscious.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48</ref>

Electro returns in ''[[Spider-Man: The Gauntlet]]''. His appearance is changed with many scars due to his age affecting his body and powers. According to ''Gauntlet'' writer [[Mark Waid]], artist Paul Azaceta "tweaked the design a bit, adding some burn scars to reflect Electro's current situation. As Electro gets older, as his body chemistry starts to shift into middle age, his powers are becoming more erratic and less easy for him to control. So he turns to a surprise Marvel villain - someone rarely, if ever, seen in the pages of ''Amazing'' - to level up."<ref>http://comics.ign.com/articles/102/1026877p3.html</ref>

In ''Spider-Man: The Gauntlet'' storyline, his life ruined, Electro runs a public movement called "Power to the People" against [[Dexter Bennett]] and the New York Stock Exchange. Spider-Man gets caught in the middle of this as he tries to stop Electro, but he is criticized by the people for attacking their "hero".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #612</ref> Electro makes a deal with Dexter Bennett into paying for an operation that can cure his powers if he accepts to call off the campaign. The [[Mad Thinker]] tries to cure him by increasing his electrical abilities, but Spider-Man interferes with the process, turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt. Electro double-crosses Bennett and tells New York to turn on all electric appliances (thus giving him more power) to permanently end ''[[Daily Bugle|The DB]]''.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #613</ref> Electro traps all DB employees including Bennett inside the DB with the entire NYPD and Mayor Jameson outside. With their help, including Jameson, Spider-Man manages to weaken Electro enough to beat him down and web him up. Sadly, Dexter Bennett is crushed by falling to debris and has permanent damage to the legs, and the DB is also permanently destroyed during the fight. In the epilogue Electro runs into Sasha Kravinoff and Chameleon in his new jail cell.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #614</ref> In the following issue involving Sandman it is revealed that Electro has escaped.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #615</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
An unusually configured magnetic field was created when struck by lightning while Dillon was holding live, high-tension wires and a wound reel of one-inch cable, granting superhuman powers to him. Electro can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], theoretically up to approximately one million [[volt]]s. He can employ this electrostatic energy as lightning arcs from his fingertips, and his maximum charge is more than enough to kill a normal human.

When his body is charged to high levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and he has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts. During a stint in prison, [[Doctor Octopus]] gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tank of a vehicle as a way to generate explosions.  He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful. He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further.

In ''New Avengers'', he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ryker's Island|Rykers]] (although, due to the city-wide blackout preceding the event, he probably absorbed a great deal of energy beforehand).

An experimental procedure heightened his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him. He made Spider-Man beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain, and was able to defeat [[Nate Grey]] by manipulating said currents in Nate's brain to turn his own psionic powers against him.

Electro can override any electrically-powered device and manipulate it according to his mental commands.

By using an external electrical power source to recharge his body's energy reserves, Electro could expend electricity indefinitely without diminishing his personal reserves. When he is fully charged, Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may "short circuit" him, such as water.

Electro propels himself along magnetic lines of force in objects that have great electrical potential, such as high-tension electrical lines. He can also create electrostatic bridges to traverse upon, at the cost of a great expenditure of energy.

==Reception==
In 2009, Electro was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 87th Greatest Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/87.html Electro is number 87] [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.</ref>
==In other media==
===Television===
====The Marvel Superheroes Show====
Electro made a cameo appearance on ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' episode "Dr. Doom's Day" (which was a [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] segment).

====Spider-Man (1967)====
Electro made three appearances in the [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|1960s ''Spider-Man'' animated series]].

====''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''====
Electro was the main villain in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episode ''Videoman'' voiced by [[Allan Melvin]]. He later made a cameo appearance in ''Attack of the Arachnoid''.

====''Spider-Man: The Animated Series''====
Originally, Electro was not to appear in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', because the series did not want to interfere with the continuity of James Cameron's proposed Spider-Man movie (see below), in which the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and Electro were supposed to be the villains.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Although Sandman remained unseen in the series when Cameron's film fell through, Electro was belately introduced in the series' fifth season. Electro appears in the ["[Six Forgotten Warriors]]" storyline of season 5 voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]. Here he is '''Rheinholt Schmidt''', instead of Max Dillon. Schmidt spent much of his life searching for his father, the [[Red Skull]]. After becoming the chief of police in his city under the alias Kragov, he impersonated his father in an attempt to gain control of the doomsday weapon, an unknown aid which his father believed would help the Nazis win World War II. A run in with the Kingpin left him without the box containing the secret information on the project as Kingpin stated that the ''real'' Red Skull would've broken free from his grasp. After the Chameleon (Kragov’s stepbrother) turned traitor on Kingpin at a nearby run-down building, he had the box and all the keys to use the Doomsday weapon. When his father is freed, he left with Chameleon to prepare the Doomsday weapon which turned out to be turning Rheinholt into Electro. Electro proved to be too much for the Red Skull to control as Electro left to attack the United Nations. After defeating some S.H.I.E.L.D. forces, Electro returned to the building where the Doomsday weapon was with Spider-Man on his trail. Electro was defeated when Spider-Man tricked him into absorbing the energy of the vortex that Red Skull and Captain America fell into, which was originally intended to be used on Electro if Red Skull could not control him.

====''Spider-Man Unlimited''====
In ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', the [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of Electro (voiced by [[Dale Wilson]]) appears in the episode "Ill-Met By Moonlight" as a [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bestial]] [[electric eel]] possessing electrokinetic powers. In the episode, Electro is a guard in the [[High Evolutionary|High Evolutionary's]] main base, Wundagore Castle, and appears to attack to Spider-Man and his Human Revolutionary allies when they invade the castle, looking for a cure for [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson's]] uncontrollable transformations into the Man-Wolf. Electro apparently dies in an explosion during the climax of this fight, after being brutally attacked by the Man-Wolf. Throughout his fight with the Counter-Earth Electro, Spider-Man also references the Earth Electro.<ref> {{cite episode| title = Ill-Met By Moonlight | series = Spider-Man Unlimited | credits = Larry Brody and Robert Gregory-Browne (writers) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | airdate = 2001-02-17 | season = 1|number = 8}}</ref>

====Spider-Man: The New Animated Series====
[[Image:Smtv11.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Electro in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]''.]]

In MTV's ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' in 2003, '''Max Dylan''' (not Dillon), voiced by [[Ethan Embry]], was a nerdy college friend of Peter Parker. Bullied by members of a fraternity he was pledging, he is invited to a party and is bullied so badly that he flees out into the rain and is involved in an accident. He is transformed into an electrical creature after being covered in an unknown substance and then struck by lightning. He becomes Electro and plans revenge on the primary bully, Doug Reisman. 

He returns several episodes later, attempting to make Sally, a girl with whom he became infatuated at the party, go through a similar transformation. Spider-Man traps Electro in an electric generator box provided by [[Harry Osborn]]'s OsCorp and tosses it into the river, effectively destroying Electro.

====The Spectacular Spider-Man====
[[Image:spectacularelectro.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Electro as he appears in [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]].]]
Electro, voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]], appears in the second episode of ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'',<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0708/10/index.htm Comics Continuum (Aug. 10, 2007): "The Spectacular Spider-Man's Electro", by Rob Allstetter]</ref> entitled "Interactions".<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0708/31/index.htm Comics Continuum (Aug. 31, 2007)]</ref> 

Originally an electrician and friend of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], Max Dillon is electrocuted in a freak accident when his power drill falls on a faulty wire, throwing him back against an experimental tank of electric eels and being exposed to the liquid inside. Though Max survived, his body became an unstable living electrical capacitor. Soon after, Dr. Bromwell has Max wear a jumpsuit to contain the electricity to protect himself and others, with his body, especially his face, turned into an electric field. Maddened by his physical isolation, combined with Spider-Man harassing him, Max takes on the name of "Electro"--after Spider-Man jokingly called him that during their first fight—and lashes out for a cure by taking Dr. Connors hostage until he is defeated by Spider-Man knocking him into a pool, rendering Electro unconscious. Electro is one of the only villains (besides Lizard and Molten Man) who didn't want to become a villain, and is also loyal to [[Doctor Octopus]].

Electro reappears in Episode 11 "Group Therapy", in which Electro has been undergoing therapy at [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ravencroft|Ravencroft]], and under the instruction of [[Doctor Octopus]], who offered a cure in return for his cooperation, pretended to respond well to it. Upon his release, Electro freed Doc Ock, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Fancy Dan]], and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] from prison to form the Sinister Six, where his loyalty to Doc Ock keeps the team together and has better control of his powers. Despite this, he is defeated by Spider-Man (possessed by the [[Symbiote (comics)|black suit]]), when he drops Rhino on top of him, causing him to pass out from his weight and loses control over his powers.

Electro next appears in the season two episode "Reinforcement", where his mentality has degraded to the point where he refused to be called "Max", claiming that a normal name was only for a normal person. He is broken out of Ravencroft by the Master Planner (aka Doctor Octopus) and made a member of a new Sinister Six. Most of the new Six is defeated by Spider-Man, but Electro manages to get away. He appears in the following episode, "Shear Strength", assisting in the Master Planner's plan to control the world's technology. Spider-Man battles him in Master Planner's underwater base, and makes him lose his temper by repeatingly calling him "Max", causing him to lose focus and be defeated. Electro is later pulled out of the base by Spider-Man before it self-destructs.

In "Growing Pains", Electro is held at Ravencroft once more, becoming maniacal (he does not desire being normal anymore). [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Prof. Miles Warren]] says, "Another one of yours?". Dr. Connors simply nods.

The show's version of Electro gives him an army private green color scheme with wires and tubes connecting his body to his gloves and a mask that opens up to reveals his face, making his costume a mixture of the mainstream version and the Ultimate version. When unmasked, his face takes the shape of the mainstream's mask.

====Film====
====''Spider-Man 4''====
[[Sam Raimi]] has hinted towards the possibility of having Electro appear in the upcoming [[Spider-Man (film series)#Future|''Spider-Man 4'']]. He originally expressed interest in setting up the [[Sinister Six]], but the film has been limited to two villains.<ref>{{cite news | author = Borys Kit | title = Col hands Vanderbilt pen for 'Spidey 4' | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = [007-10-31 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ic868cb7073298c931e9d39a02384565e | accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Larry Carroll | title = Sam Raimi May Not Helm 'Spider-Man 4'; Wants Electro, Vulture As Villains If He Does | work = [[MTV]] | date = 2007-06-26 | url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1563359/20070625/story.jhtml | accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

* Electro appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'' voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]]. He causes mass destruction when looking for the S.H.I.E.L.D. Quarantine Zone that his sister is in. After a fight with Spider-Man, Electro's sister runs to his side after Black Widow shoots him. The symbiote on her infects Electro and turns him into a symbiote version of himself. Soon, Electro-type Symbiotes called Electrolings appear and Spider-Man engages Symbiote-Electro in battle when they start showing up. During the battle, Symbiote-Electro will create more Symbiote Pods to power him up. If the player takes the Red Suit path, Spider-Man helps Electro overcome his symbiote and he remembers what happened before he was infected and then collapses. If the player takes the Black Suit path, Spider-Man badly beats up Electro enough for the symbiote to come off and Electro fries the symbiote in revenge for infecting his sister.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
