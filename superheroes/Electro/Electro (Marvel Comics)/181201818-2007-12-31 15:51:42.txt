===Electro (Timely Comics)===
The first comics character of this name was the robot hero Electro, a backup-feature star in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'', flagship title of Marvel's [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] predecessor, [[Timely Comics]]. Created by writer-artist [[Steve Dahlman]], Electro appeared in ''Marvel Mystery'' #4&ndash;19 (Feb. 1940 &ndash; May 1941). His origin story described his invention by Professor Philo Zog, one of a group of twelve known as the Secret Operatives. <ref>[http://www.geocities.com/jjnevins/electro.html Guide To Marvel's Golden Age Characters profile for the Timely Comics character], [[Jess Nevins]]</ref><ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/e/electroga.htm International Catalogue of Superheroes profile for the Timely Comics character]</ref>

Marvel Comics announced that Electro, renamed Elektro, would appear in the cast of the comic ''[[The Twelve (comic)|The Twelve]]'' by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Chris Weston]], scheduled for publication in 2008.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11312 Mystery Men's Dozen: Brevoort Talks "The Twelve"], July 26, 2007, [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref> <ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124457 12 Days of the Twelve: Elektro], August 8, 2007, [[Newsarama]]</ref>

===Electro (Atlas Comics)===
Marvel's next Electro was a [[Communist]] supervillain created during the unsuccessful attempt by Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], to revive [[superhero]]es in that decade. This Electro, a Soviet citizen named Ivan Kronov, appeared on the cover and in the six-page story "His Touch is Death" in ''[[Captain America]]'' #78 (Sept. 1954), penciled and inked by [[John Romita Sr.]] and almost certainly if unconfirmably written by the more famous Electro's co-creator, [[Stan Lee]]. Many years later, this Electro reappeared in ''What If?'' vol. 1, #9 (June 1978), "What If the Avengers had been Formed During the 1950s?"; and, in flashback, in ''Captain America Annual'' #13 (1994).

'''Maxwell Dillon''' was born to Jonathan and Anita Dillon in [[Endicott, New York]]. Jonathan was an [[accountant]], though he had trouble keeping a job. Because of this, Max and his family moved frequently when Max was young and he found it difficult to make friends. His hot-headed father abandoned his family when Max was eight years old. Anita subsequently became overprotective of Max, leading to his single greatest flaw as a super-villain: his [[inferiority complex]]. Years later, Max told his mother he wished to become an electrical [[engineer]]. Anita, not wanting him to be angry if he failed, convinced him he was not intelligent enough, and Max reluctantly took a job as a lineman for an [[electric company]]. 

While he was repairing a power line, a freak [[lightning]] accident resulted in a mutagenic change in his nervous system, transforming Dillon into a living electrical [[capacitor]]. Taking the name Electro, he turned to a life of [[crime]], his first victim being [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Electro broke into the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' Building and stole Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During his confrontation with Electro, Spider-Man was nearly killed when he touched the electrically charged supervillain. Spider-Man eventually used a [[fire hose]] to short-circuit Electro.

Electro has fought Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also fought such other heroes as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]]. Despite his immense power, he has almost always been defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged. 

As a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tried to take over [[New York City]]'s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarted this plan, however, and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career. When the insane Spider-Man clone [[Kaine]] started killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined [[Mysterio]]'s Sinister Seven, which had been formed to combat Kaine. This group was quickly disbanded, and following Kaine's subsequent disappearance, Electro returned to retirement.

This changed when [[The Rose (comics)|The Rose]] agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electro's abilities, in exchange for Electro's services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life, Electro underwent the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of [[The True Believers]] (an offshoot of the famous ninja sect [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]]), a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Rose's operations, Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City's power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stopped him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, threw himself into the [[Hudson River]] while his body was highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.

Somehow surviving, Electro resurfaced later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six, formed to kill Senator [[Stewart Ward]] and [[Doctor Octopus]] (Whom the other members of the Six now hated due to his arrogance). His powers had seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wore a new blue-and-white costume. When [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacked Electro and left him for dead. Once again, Electro survived, and when he next appeared had returned to his yellow-and green-costume.

In the mid-2000s, Electro was working with the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] (as well as questioning his own sexuality)<ref>[http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=209 Gay League: Characters]</ref><ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2</ref> when they were attacked by Spider-Man, who thought they had kidnapped his Aunt May. Electro managed to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly, and shortly afterwards joined the [[Sinister Twelve]], assembled by the [[Green Goblin]], though he and the rest of the team was defeated thanks to the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]]. Finally, he found out he is [[bisexual]].

Later, separately, he was hired by unknown fighre to free [[Sauron (comics)|Karl Lykos]] (also known as Sauron) from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], a maximum-security [[prison]] for supervillains. After causing a riot, Electro tried to run away with his waitress girlfriend, but was captured by the [[New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]], subsequently fainting when faced with the prospect of being beaten up by [[Luke Cage]], using Spider-Man's webbing to protect himself from Electro. <ref>''New Avengers'' #4</ref>.
<!--You can't say "recently", per [[WP:DATED]]. Please rephrase to say: In ''Title'' #No. (month year), Electro joined the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s "Exterminators", ...
He has recently been revealed to be in league with the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s "Exterminators", seeking to take advantage of Spider-Man having revealed his identity to the public.

==Powers and abilities==
Electro can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], theoretically up to approximately one million [[volts]]. When his body is charged to such levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts. During a stint in prison, [[Doctor Octopus]] gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tank of a vehicle as a way to generate explosions.  He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful. He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further.


He is extremely powerful but not particularly intelligent, and like the similarly strong but not smart [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], is usually outwitted by his foes.  In ''New Avengers'', he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at Rikers (although, due to the city-wide blackout preceding the event, he probably absorbed a great deal of energy beforehand).

An experimental procedure heightened his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him. He made Spider-Man beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain, and was able to defeat [[Nate Grey]] by manipulating said currents in Nate's brain to turn his own psionic powers against him.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] alternate future, Electro has a daughter, Allison Dillon, who is emotionally troubled over never having had a stable father-figure in her life and becomes the supervillainess '''[[Aftershock (comics)|Aftershock]]'''.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #51 (Nov. 2002)</ref> She had inherited her father's powers, but because Dillon and Allison's electrical auras are different, the slightest touch causes them intense pain. When Dillon discovers his daughter is following in his footsteps, he asks Spider-Man for help. Spider-Man, [[Spider-Girl]] and the [[A-Next|Avengers]] help subdue Aftershock, and when Dillon shows up, father and daughter vow to overcome their pain, and Max promises to be a better father.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #81 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

===Ultimate Electro===
[[Image:Ultimateelectro.jpg|left|thumb|Ultimate Electro]]In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Electro has been [[Reboot (continuity)|reimagined]] with powers as a product of [[bioengineering]]. Instead of his mainstream appearance, he is bald, wears a black leather outfit, and has some grotesque burn scars.

As a result of experimentation by [[Justin Hammer]], Max Dillon is given the power to control and create electricity. He is sold by Hammer to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] in exchange for a [[Real estate|real-estate]] development contract.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #17 (March 2002)</ref> [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] defeats him. Electro later escapes from federal custody, murdering several people in the process.

The five supervillains escape and briefly force Spider-Man to join their criminal team, the ''[[Ultimate Six]]''.<ref>[[Miniseries]] [[Ultimate Six]] #1-7 (Nov. 2003 - June 2004)</ref> In a battle with the Ultimates on the [[White House]] lawn, [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] defeats Electro. 

Electro eventually escapes and is hired by Bolivar Trask to gauge Venom's power. Electro leads Venom on a chase throughout Manhattan when Spider-Man appears. Electro knocks Spider-Man out and tries to kill him, but Venom attacks Electro, trying to take Electro's opportunity to kill the fallen hero. Venom defeats Electro by desroying the neon signs that Electro is feeding off of. When S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives Venom flees, and Electro is once again brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. 

The Green Goblin later breaks Electro out of the supervillain prison within the Ultimates' headquarters, the [[Triskelion#In popular culture|Triskelion]], in exchange for Electro's alliance when needed.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112 (Oct. 2007)</ref>

Electro goes to Norman Osborn's penthouse to wait for instructions where he is disturbed by Spider-Man. He attempts to flee and gets involved in a fight both with Spider-Man and Shield agents. He is eventually brought down and is assumed to be back in custody.

===Television===

==== Spider-Man (1967) ====

Electro made three appearances in the [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|1960s ''Spider-Man'' animated series]]. 

==== Spider-Man: The Animated Series ====

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Electrosmanimated.png|thumb|left|Electro in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']] -->

In the 1990s [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|''Spider-Man Animated Series'']], Electro (voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]). made an appearance in season five. Here he was Rheinholt Kragov, instead of Max Dillon. During the course of [[Six Forgotten Warriors|the episode arc]] in which he appears, it is shown that this version of Electro is the [[Red Skull]]'s son created as a Doomsday weapon to destroy the Six American Warriors. In this portrayal, Electro is much more powerful than his comic book counterpart (or at least capable of using his powers more intelligently), as he is seen taking over the circuitry of vast machines and essentially brings all of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to its knees. He is only defeated when Spider-Man tricks him into connecting himself to a machine made to generate a void in the [[space-time continuum]], which traps him inside a time loop. Electro appeared in most of the episode arc in the episodes, ''Unclaimed Legacy'' and ''The Secrets of the Six'' before he became the villain and as the villain, he only appeared in ''The Price of Heroism.''

==== Spider-Man Unlimited ====

An [[Electric eel]] who is [[Counter-Earth]]'s version of Electro appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series. He appeared in the eighth episode of the series titled "Ill Met by Moonlight" where he resided in a [[power plant]].

==== Spider-Man: The New Animated Series ====

[[Image:Smtv11.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Max Dillon/Electro in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]''.]]

In MTV's ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' in 2003, Max Dillon, voiced by [[Ethan Embry]], was a nerdy college friend of Peter Parker. Bullied by members of a fraternity he was pledging, Dillon, after being humiliated at their party, goes out into the rain and is struck by lightning. He becomes Electro and plans revenge on the primary bully, Doug Reisman. He kills Doug by electrocuting him and is later defeated by Spider-Man in battle when the hero used grounded power cables, sucking him into the city's electrical system. At this point, Max Dillon was presumed dead. 

However, he returns several episodes later, attempting to make Sally, a girl with whom he became infatuated at the party, go through a similar transformation. Spider-Man defeats him again, this time by trapping Electro in an electric generator box provided by Harry Osborn's OsCorp and tossing it into the river, effectively destroying Electro.

==== The Spectacular Spider-Man ====

The [[website]] Comics Continuum reported in August 2007 that at an unspecified panel at the 2007 [[Comic-Con International]], an unnamed panelist said Electro would appear in the [[Kids WB]] [[animated television series]] [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''The Spectacular Spider-Man'']], voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]], and would not wear his original costume from the comics.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0708/10/index.htm Comics Continuum (Aug. 10, 2007): "The Spectacular Spider-Man's Electro", by Rob Allstetter]</ref> He will appear in the second episode of the series entitled "Interacting Systems."<ref>http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0708/31/index.htm Comics Continuum (Aug. 31, 2007)</ref>
