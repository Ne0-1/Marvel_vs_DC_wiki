'''Electro''' (Maxwell Dillon) is [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #9 ([[1964]]).

Max Dillon was a humble technician working for an electrical company when a freak [[lightning]] accident at an electrical facility resulted in a mutagenic change in his nervous system. This change transformed him into a living, electrical [[capacitor]]. He can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], and when his body is charged with immense levels of electricity he becomes superhumanly strong as well. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts.

He is extremely powerful, but like the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], is usually outwitted by the wall-crawler, so despite his great power, Electro is not the most threatening villain. Electro was even involved with a plot to kidnap Peter Parker's Aunt May.
