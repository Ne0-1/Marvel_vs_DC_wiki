'''Electro''' is the name of several [[fictional characters|fictional]] [[comic book]] characters in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], including [[Electro (comics)#Timely.2FAtlas Comics.27 Electro|two from Marvel's predecessors]], [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].

The most prominent Electro is '''Maxwell Dillon''',  a [[supervillain]] and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. (Electro should not be confused with Marvel's similarly named, unrelated character, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]). He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #9 (Feb. [[1964]]).

==Character history==
'''Maxwell Dillon''' was born to Jonathan and Anita Dillon in [[Endicott, New York]]. Jonathan was an [[accountant]], though he had trouble keeping a job. Because of this, Max and his family moved frequently when Max was young and he found it difficult to make friends. His hot-headed father abandoned his family when Max was eight years old. Anita subsequently became overprotective of Max, leading to his single greatest flaw as a super-villain: his [[inferiority complex]]. Years later, Max told his mother he wished to become an electrical [[engineer]]. Anita, not wanting him to be angry if he failed, convinced him he was not intelligent enough, and Max reluctantly took a job as a lineman for an [[electric company]].

While he was repairing a power line, a freak [[lightning]] accident resulted in a mutagenic change in his nervous system, transforming Dillion into a living electrical [[capacitor]]. Taking the name Electro, he turned to a life of [[crime]], his first victim being [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Electro broke into the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' Building and stole from Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During his confrontation with Electro, Spider-Man was nearly killed when he touched the electrically charged supervillain. Spider-Man eventually used a [[fire hose]] to short-circuit Electro.

Electro has fought Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also fought such other heroes as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. Despite his immense power, he has almost always been defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged. 

As a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tried to take over [[New York City]]'s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarted this plan, however, and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career. When the insane Spider-Man clone [[Kaine]] started killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined [[Mysterio]]'s Sinister Seven, which had been formed to combat Kaine. This group was quickly disbanded, and following Kaine's subsequent disappearance, Electro returned to retirement.

This changed when [[The Rose (comics)|The Rose]] agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electro's abilities, in exchange for Electro's services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life, Electro underwent the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of [[The True Believers]] (an offshoot of the famous ninja sect [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]]), a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Rose's operations, Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City's power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stopped him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, Electro threw himself into the [[Hudson River]] while his body was highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.

Somehow surviving, Electro resurfaced later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six. His powers had seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wore a new blue-and-white costume. When Venom betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacked Electro and left him for dead. Once again, Electro survived, and when he next appeared had returned to his yellow-and green-costume.

In the mid-2000s, Electro was working with the Vulture (as well as questioning his own sexuality [http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=209] ) when they were attacked by Spider-Man, who thought they had kidnapped his Aunt May. Electro managed to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly, and shortly afterwards joined the [[Sinister Twelve]], assembled by the [[Green Goblin]], though he was defeated. Later, separately, he was hired by Brainchild to free [[Sauron (comics)|Karl Lykos]] (also known as Sauron) from The Raft, a maximum-security [[prison]] for supervillains. After causing a riot, Electro tried to run away with his waitress girlfriend, but was captured by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

<!--You can't say "recently", per [[WP:DATED]]. Please rephrase to say: In ''Title'' #No. (month year), Electro joined the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s "Exterminators", ...

He has recently been revealed to be in league with the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s "Exterminators", seeking to take advantage of Spider-Man having revealed his identity to the public.

===Powers and abilities===
Electro can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], theoretically up to approximately ten million [[volts]]. When his body is charged to such levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts. During a stint in prison, [[Doctor Octopus]] gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tank of a vehicle as a way to generate explosions.

He is extremely powerful but not particularly intelligent, and like the similarly strong but not smart [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] is usually outwitted by his foes.  In New Avengers, he was shown to fly, and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at Rikers. 

An experimental procedure heightened his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him. He was able to defeat [[Nate Grey]] by manipulating the bioelectric currents in the human brain to turn Nate's own psionic powers against him.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Electro===
[[Image:Ultimateelectro.jpg|thumb|left|Ultimate Electro.]]In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Electro has been [[Reboot (continuity)|reimagined]] with powers as a product of [[bioengineering]]. Instead of his mainstream appearance, he is bald, wears a black leather outfit, and has some grotesque burn scars.

As a result of experimentation by [[Justin Hammer]], Max Dillon is given the power to control and create electricity. He is sold by Hammer to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] in exchange for some contracts for a building that Hammer wanted to create.{{issue}}

Spider-Man fights both Electro and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] when raiding the Kingpin's building for evidence to put the Kingpin away. Electro nearly kills Spider-Man, but Spider-Man manages to burst open a water pipe, shocking the villain and putting him into a coma.  When Electro awakes, he tries to escape federal custody and is apprehended by the Ultimates, who place him in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody along with [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Doctor Octopus]] and the [[Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]].  In the limited series ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' these five villains manage to escape and form the titular team, kidnapping Spider-Man and forcing him to join them.  After a lengthy battle with the [[Ultimates]] on the [[White House]] lawn, Electro is defeated by [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]].

In the [[video game]] ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', Electro, armed and earless, is hired by [[Bolivar Trask]] to gauge [[Ultimate Venom|Venom's]] power. Electro leads Venom on a chase throughout Manhattan when Spider-Man appears. Electro knocks Spider-Man out and tries to kill him, but Venom attacks Electro, trying to take Electro's opportunity to kill the fallen hero.  Venom defeats Electro, but S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives. Venom flees, and Electro is once again brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] alternate future, Electro has a daughter, Allison Dillon who is emotionally delicate because she never had her father in her life and becomes the supervillainess '''[[Aftershock (comics)|Aftershock]]'''. She inherited her father's powers, but because Electro and Allison's electrical auras were slightly different, the slightest touch would cause them intense pain. When Max Dillon found out that his daughter was following in his footsteps, he asked Spider-Man for help. Spider-Man, [[Spider-Girl]] and the [[A-Next|Avengers]] helped subdue Aftershock and Max shows up. The two overcome their pain and Max promises to be a better father. [http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/mc2/aftershock.html 5], [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Aftershock_(MC2) 6]

===Hyper-Electro===
Hyper-Electro is the combination of Electro with the [[Bio-Nexus Device]] (BND) resulting in a being of pure energy, called Hyper-Electro. Capable of lauching electrical bolts and even calling down lightning strikes, Hyper-Electro was only defeated when Spider-Man tricked him into burning out the BND. After Spider-Man defeated him, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] was given credit for his defeat, even though he probably didn't know what happened.  Since these events only took place in the [[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]] [[Computer and video games|video game]], they are not necessarily canon.

==Timely/Atlas Comics' Electro==
[[Image:CaptainAmerica(Atlas)78.jpg|thumb|195px|The first supervillain Electro, in ''Captain America'' #78 (Sept. 1954), cover art by [[John Romita Sr.]]<!--Confirmed: He both penciled & inked-->]]
The first comics character of this name was the robot hero Electro, a backup-feature star in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'', flagship title of Marvel's [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] predecessor, [[Timely Comics]]. Created by writer-artist [[Steve Dahlman]], he appeared in ''Marvel Mystery'' #4&ndash;19 (Feb. 1940 &ndash; May 1941). The character's origin story described his invention by Professor Philo Zog, one of a group of twelve known as the Secret Operatives.

Marvel's next Electro was a [[Communist]] supervillain created during the unsuccessful attempt by Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], to revive [[superhero|superheroes]] in that decade. This Electro, a Soviet citizen named Ivan Kronov, appeared on the cover and in the six-page story "His Touch is Death" in ''[[Captain America]]'' #78 (Sept. 1954), penciled and inked by [[John Romita Sr.]] and almost certainly if unconfirmably written by the more famous Electro's co-creator, [[Stan Lee]]. Many years later, this Electro reappeared in ''What If?'' Vol. 1, #9 (June 1978), "What If the Avengers had been Formed During the 1950s?"; and, in flashback, in ''Captain America Annual'' #13 (1994).

* In the 1990s [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]], Electro made an appearance in season five. Here he was Rheinholt Kragov, instead of Max Dillon.  During the course of [[Six Forgotten Warriors|the episode arc]] in which he appears, it is revealed that this version of Electro is the [[Red Skull]]'s son. In this portrayal, Electro is much more powerful than his comic book counterpart (or at least capable of using his powers more intelligently), as he is seen taking over the circuitry of vast machines and essentially brings all of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to its knees. He is only defeated when Spider-Man tricks him into connecting himself to a machine made to generate a void in the [[space-time continuum]], which traps him inside a time loop. He was played by [[Philip Proctor]].

* An eel who is [[Counter-Earth]]'s version of Electro appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series. He appeared in the eighth episode of the series titled "Ill Met by Moonlight".

Bullied by members of a fraternity he was pledging, Dillon, after being humiliated at their party, goes out into the rain and is struck by lightning. He becomes Electro and plans revenge on the primary bully, Doug Reisman. He kills Doug by electrocuting him and is later defeated by Spider-Man in battle when the hero used grounded power cables, sucking him into the city's electrical system. At this point, Max Dillon was presumed dead. However, he returns several episodes later, attempting to make Sally, a girl with whom he became infatuated at the party, go through a similar transformation. Spider-Man defeats him again, this time by trapping Electro in an electric generator box provided by Harry Osborn's OsCorp and tossing it into the river, effectively destroying Electro permanently.

===Video games===
