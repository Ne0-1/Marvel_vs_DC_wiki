While Maxwell Dillon, an electrical engineer and lineman, was repairing a power line, a freak [[lightning]] accident caused a mutagenic change that transformed him into a living electrical [[capacitor]]. His powers were initially weak, so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from Stark Industries to charge himself. During this time, he was approached by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who considered him a potential recruit for his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], claiming that Dillon's power rivaled his own, but Dillon refused. The following day, Dillon was confronted by a small-time thug from whom he had been borrowing money from to pay for the machinery he had needed. When the thug drew a gun on him because he had not paid back the money yet, he responded by shooting a blast of lightning through the thug's chest- the first time Dillon ever killed anybody.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #2</ref> Soon taking the name Electro, he turned to a life of a professional criminal, his first victim being [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Electro broke into the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' Building and stole from Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During his confrontation with Electro, Spider-Man was nearly killed when he touched the electrically charged supervillain, but was only knocked out. Spider-Man eventually used a [[fire hose]] to short-circuit Electro while wearing rubber gloves to protect himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #9 (Feb. 1964)</ref>

Electro next confronted [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] for the first time when trying to break into the [[Baxter Building]]. He was again defeated.<ref>''Daredevil'' #2</ref> Electro later joined the original [[Sinister Six]], and was the first member of the group to fight Spider-Man, battling him at a Stark plant, when Spider-Man dodged a bolt of electricity he realized his powers had returned. Electro lost his power when the power was cut off by Spider-Man. Spider-Man got a card from him that led him to fight [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> Electro attacked the [[Fantastic Four]] at the wedding of [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], under the control of [[Doctor Doom]]'s mind-control machine, but due to Mister Fantastic he, like the other villains, has no memory of the incident.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> He later recruited the second [[Emissaries of Evil]] in a plot of revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. This group consisted of [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], [[Stilt-Man]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], and the [[Matador (Marvel Comics)|Matador]].<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1</ref>

Electro was later hired by J. Jonah Jameson to defeat Spider-Man on national television.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #82</ref> He encountered Daredevil again in San Francisco, at which time he temporarily donned a modified costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' #87</ref> He then took control of a Protarian android seeking the destruction of [[Omega the Unknown|Omega]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #3</ref> Electro then teamed with [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]] against Spider-Man and Daredevil.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #56</ref> Electro then attempted to aid a band of criminals escaping the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #63</ref>

Electro later joined the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #39</ref> As part of the Frightful Four, he used Spider-Man as bait to trap the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #218</ref> Subsequently, he battled the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] but was defeated, partly because he did not consider the Falcon to be a serious threat.<ref>''Falcon'' #3-4</ref> Electro later learned that he can electro-statically disrupt Spider-Man's wall-crawling ability.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #134</ref> The [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] then sent the [[Shocker (comics)#Shocker I|Shocker]] to try to recruit Electro into their organization.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #157</ref> Instead, he later accepted [[Doctor Octopus]]' invitation to rejoin the Sinister Six, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #334-339</ref>

Electro has fought Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also fought such other heroes as Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. Despite his immense power, he has almost always been defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged.

As a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tried to take over [[New York City]]'s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarted this plan, however, and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career. When the insane Spider-Man clone [[Kaine]] started killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined [[Mysterio]]'s Sinister Seven, which had been formed to combat Kaine. This group was quickly disbanded, and following Kaine's subsequent disappearance, Electro returned to retirement.

This changed when [[Richard Fisk|The Rose]] agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electro's abilities, in exchange for Electro's services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life, Electro underwent the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of The True Believers (an offshoot of the famous ninja sect The [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]), a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Rose's operations, Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City's power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stopped him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, threw himself into the [[Hudson River]] while his body was highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.

Somehow surviving, Electro resurfaced later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six, formed to kill [[Senator Ward|Senator Stewart Ward]] and Doctor Octopus (whom the other members of the Six now hated due to his arrogance). His powers had seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wore a new blue-and-white costume. When [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacked Electro and left him for dead. Once again, Electro survived, and when he next appeared had returned to his yellow-and green-costume.

In the mid-2000s, Electro was working with the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2</ref> when they were attacked by Spider-Man, who thought they had kidnapped his [[Aunt May]]. Electro managed to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly, and shortly afterwards joined the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], assembled by the [[Green Goblin]], though he and the rest of the team was defeated thanks to the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

Later, separately, he was hired by the [[Skrull]] [[Skrull#Known Skrulls|Pagon]] (who was posing as [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]) to free [[Sauron (comics)|Karl Lykos]] (also known as Sauron) from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], a maximum-security [[prison]] for supervillains.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #1</ref> After causing a riot, Electro tried to run away with his waitress girlfriend, but was captured by the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], subsequently fainting when faced with the prospect of being beaten up by [[Luke Cage]], using Spider-Man's webbing to protect himself from Electro.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. #4</ref>

Later, Electro joined the Chameleon's "Exterminators",<ref name="marvunapp1"/> seeking to take advantage of Peter Parker and his loved ones.

During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] storyline, Electro was among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s unnamed villain army when [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] raided the hideout.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' (February 2007)</ref>

In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Electro appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force. After the Skrull posing as [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]] kidnaps the baby of Luke Cage and [[Jessica Jones]], the Avengers and the Fantastic Four begin going after everyone who is associated with the Skrulls. Because of this, Electro is confronted by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in an alley where, after a battle, he leaves Dillon beaten and unconscious.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48</ref>

Electro returns in ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'', with a new look as his face is now scarred with lightning bolts. The revamp was explained by writer Mark Waid, stating that artist Paul Azaceta "tweaked the design a bit, adding some burn scars to reflect Electro's current situation. As Electro gets older, as his body chemistry starts to shift into middle age, his powers are becoming more erratic and less easy for him to control. So he turns to a surprise Marvel villain - someone rarely, if ever, seen in the pages of ''Amazing'' - to level up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/102/1026877p3.html|title=IGN.com "Spider-Man: Enter the Gauntlet"}}</ref> During his appearance in "The Guantlet", it is revealed that Electro has lost control over his powers: besides the physical disfigurment, his touch is now 100% lethal. Depressed and angry at the world because of this, Electro begins gathering other outcasts and misfits into a group known as "Power To The People", which targets right-wing newspaper baron [[Dexter Bennett]] and the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis. Electro's group manages to gain positive coverage in the medial, hampering Spider-Man's ability to convince Electro's followers of his true evil nature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #612</ref> Electro's duplicitous nature causes him to betray his followers in order to align with the amoral Bennett in exchange for help finding a way to restore his powers to a controllable level. The Mad Thinker is able to come up with a process to cure Electro, but Spider-Man interferes with the process, turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt. Furious, Electro double-crosses Bennett and ultimately uses his new powers to destroy [[Daily Bugle|The DB]] building, crippling Bennett in the process. Spider-Man ultimately defeats Electro, who uses up all of his new found power destroying the building, that Spider-Man is able to neutralize him with his webbing.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #613-614</ref> In the epilogue, Electro runs into Sasha Kravinoff and Chameleon in his new jail cell.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614</ref> In the following issue involving Sandman, it is revealed that Electro has escaped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #615</ref> Under the orders of the Kravinoffs, he breaks the [[Vulture (comics)#Jimmy Natale|Vulture (Jimmy Natale)]] out of prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #623</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, it is suspected by the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] that Electro had a discarded and disavowed daughter named [[Aftershock (comics)|Aftershock]] (similar to the MC2 Universe version) who is a member of the [[Bastards of Evil]].<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2 #1</ref> When Young Allies members [[Firestar]] and [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] fight Electro, he defeats them. He let them live so that they can spread the message that he doesn't endorse Aftershock and the Bastards of Evil's terrorism. He also says they can look up how and when he got his powers on the internet and there no way a girl of Aftershock's age could have been conceived after he got his powers: It's impossible for him to be Aftershock's father.<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

Electro is later present at the scene where [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] is sacrificed by Sasha Kravinoff as part of a ritual that resurrects [[Grim Hunter|Vladimir Kravinoff]] as a large humanoid lion creature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #634</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, Electro is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where they are promised that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Electro goes after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. Anticipating Spider-Man's plan to deliver the infant to a hospital, Electro waits at the nearest hospital in Spider-Man's area until Spider-Man shows up. The two begin to battle until Sandman interferes and Spider-Man tricks Electro into electrocuting Sandman, turning him into glass. Flying shards of glass hit Electro, temporarily stunning him and allowing Spider-Man to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643</ref> Spider-Man goes on a rampage against the villains after the infant is stolen from him by the Chameleon. Spider-Man defeats Electro.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref>

In the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline, Electro becomes a member of Doctor Octopus's new Sinister Six and helps Chameleon break into an air force base in New Jersey.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref>

Electro was with the Sinister Six when it came to fighting [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]]. During a conflict between the Intelligencia and the Sinister Six, [[Mad Thinker]] was able to briefly deactivate Electro's powers, but was caught off-guard when Electro physically attacked him instead, the surprise of the attack allowing Electro to defeat Mad Thinker.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #676</ref>

Despite the Sinister Six being prepared for a fight with the Avengers, Electro was the first of the team to be defeated, being hurled into the upper atmosphere by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] while distracted by his inability to attack Spider-Man's new hi-tech armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
An unusually configured magnetic field was created when Dillon was struck by lightning while holding live, high-tension wires and a wound reel of one-inch cable, granting him superhuman powers. Electro can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], theoretically up to approximately one million [[volt]]s. He can employ this electrostatic energy as lightning arcs from his fingertips, and his maximum charge is more than enough to kill a normal human.

When his body is charged to high levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and he has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts. During a stint in prison, [[Doctor Octopus]] gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tank of a vehicle as a way to generate explosions. He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful. He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further.

In ''New Avengers'', he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ryker's Island|Rykers]] (although, due to the city-wide blackout preceding the event, he probably absorbed a great deal of energy beforehand).

An experimental procedure heightened his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him. He made Spider-Man beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain, and was able to defeat [[Nate Grey]] by manipulating said currents in Nate's brain to turn his own psionic powers against him.

Electro can override any electrically powered device and manipulate it according to his mental commands.

By using an external electrical power source to recharge his body's energy reserves, Electro could expend electricity indefinitely without diminishing his personal reserves. When he is fully charged, Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may "short circuit" him, such as water.

Electro propels himself along magnetic lines of force in objects that have great electrical potential, such as high-tension electrical lines. He can also create electrostatic bridges to traverse upon, at the cost of a great expenditure of energy.

During the events of the storyline "The Gauntlet", Electro became a living artificial thunderbolt, allowing him to travel through electrical appliances such as going through a light bulb and exiting through any other electronic device connected to the power source.{{Issue|date=November 2010}} He was also able to transmit himself over Spider-Man's web.{{Issue|date=November 2010}}

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Electro is one of Rhino's friends (along with [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]]) who helped him attack and detain the Green Goblin for ruining the best chance at a good life Rhino ever had.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #3</ref>

===Marvel Zombies Return===
Another Electro appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] that battles the reality-jumping zombie [[Spider-Man]]. When the zombified Spider Man is behind him, he was bitten on the hand. Then Electro is decapitated and infected, later helping his fellow members in devouring Peter Parker's friends. Angered and devastated, the zombie [[Spider-Man]] then obliterates his body for what he and the team has done.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #2 (October 2009)</ref>

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] alternate future, Electro has a daughter, Allison Dillon, who is emotionally troubled over never having had a stable father-figure in her life and becomes the supervillain [[Aftershock (comics)|Aftershock]].<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #51 (Nov. 2002)</ref> She had inherited her father's powers, but because Dillon and Allison's electrical auras are different, the slightest touch causes them intense pain. When Dillon discovers his daughter is following in his footsteps, he asks Spider-Man for help. Spider-Man, [[Spider-Girl]], and the [[A-Next|Avengers]] help subdue Aftershock. When Dillon shows up, father and daughter vow to overcome their pain, and Max promises to be a better father.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #81 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

===Spider-Man: Reign===
In the ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' reality, Electro is one of the villains released by [[Venom (comics)|Edward]] to destroy Spider-Man; he is killed by Spider-Man after being knocked into [[Hydro-Man]] (who also dies) causing him to short circuit.<ref>''Spider-Man: Reign'' #1-4 (December 2006 - March 2007)</ref>

===Ultimate Electro===
[[File:Ultimateelectro.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Ultimate Electro]]

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Electro has been [[Reboot (fiction)|reimagined]] with powers as a product of [[bioengineering]]. Unlike his mainstream counterpart, Ultimate Electro is bald, wears a black leather outfit, and has some grotesque burn scars. As a result of experimentation by [[Justin Hammer]], Max Dillon is given the power to control and create electricity. He is sold by Hammer to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] in exchange for a [[real estate]] development contract.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #17 (March 2002)</ref> When Spider-Man breaks into the Kingpin's office, Electro electrocutes him, and he, the Enforcers, and Fisk unmask him, revealing him to be a teenager. They decide to throw him out a window. [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]  returns and defeats him.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #12 (October 2001)</ref> His defeat changes Electro's powers, making him reach a more powerful blue form, during which he can fly and perform greater feats. Electro later escapes from federal custody, murdering several people in the process. The superhero team the [[Ultimates]] re-apprehend him and place him in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody along with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Doctor Octopus]], and the [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]]. The five supervillains escape and become the [[Ultimate Six]].<ref>[[Miniseries]] ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' #1-7 (Nov. 2003 - June 2004)</ref> They attack S.H.I.E.L.D. They manage to capture an unmasked Spider-Man. They tie him to a chair, torture and humiliate him, and force him to join them. In a battle with the Ultimates on the [[White House]] lawn, [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] defeats Electro. He eventually escapes and is hired by [[Bolivar Trask]] to gauge Venom's power. Electro leads Venom on a chase throughout Manhattan when Spider-Man appears. Electro knocks Spider-Man out and tries to kill him, but Venom attacks Electro, trying to take Electro's opportunity to kill the fallen hero. Venom defeats Electro by destroying the neon signs that Electro is feeding on. When S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives Venom flees, and Electro is once again brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. The Green Goblin later breaks Electro out of the supervillain prison within the Ultimates' headquarters, the [[Triskelion#Popular culture|Triskelion]], in exchange for Electro's alliance when needed.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113 (November 2007)</ref> Electro goes to Norman Osborn's penthouse to wait for instructions where he is disturbed by Spider-Man. He attempts to flee and gets involved in a fight both with Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. He is eventually brought down and is assumed to be back in custody.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #114 (December 2007)</ref>

Alongside the rest of the Ultimate Six, Electro plays a role in the "Death of Spider-Man" storyline. Norman Osborn breaks him and the rest out of the Triskelion, and after their escape, informs them that God wishes for them to kill Peter Parker.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #156 (May 2011)</ref> Then, after Osborn kills Dr. Octopus after he tries to leave the group, the remaining five (Electro, The Green Goblin, Sandman, Kraven, and Vulture) go to Parker's home in Queens.  There a fight ensues between the Five and both Johnny Storm and Bobby Drake, who were living there at the time. The two heroes are defeated, with Electro himself defeating Iceman by sending a jolt of electricity through his ice, but not before Johnny manages to knock Osborn out. Peter then arrives, wearing his Spider-Man costume but no mask, and proceeds to fight the four remaining members of the Six. After a pitched battle, Electro is about to deliver the killing shot on a beaten and exhausted Spider-Man, but before he can strike he is shot three times from behind by Aunt May. He 'short circuits' in a massive electrical surge, taking out Kraven, Sandman, and Vulture.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #157-159 (June-July 2011)</ref>

Later, Dillon is shown to have survived the shooting, and is being held in SHIELD custody when [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], the new Spider-Man, is brought in for questioning. Electro is able to power up and attempt an escape after being improperly sedated by a S.H.I.E.L.D. nurse. After taking down [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], Electro fights Miles, in his store-bought Spider-Man costume, and Fury, thinking Miles is the original Spider-Man and angry that he's still alive. Miles stuns Electro by hitting him with a hurled crate, and Fury shoots him to end the threat.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #5 (December 2011)</ref>

Although Max survived, his body became an unstable living electrical capacitate. Max is then forced to wear an insulated body suit to contain the bio-elctricity being procduced in order to protect others around him, especially his face which had transformed into an electrical field. After an encounter with Spider-Man (who Spider-Man thought was a thug), Max goes berserk, takes up the name "Electro" after Spider-Man called him that on their first encounter and rushes out to Dr. Connors' lab, demanding that Connors cure him. He is interrupted by Spider-Man again and the two battle; Spider-Man defeats Electro by tossing him into a swimming pool which short-circuits him, knocking him unconscious.

==Reception==
During an interview with ''[[Newsarama]]'' about ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt]]'', [[Mark Waid]] claimed that the character of Electro is "one of the smart criminals who was saving what he's been stealing from banks and savings and loans". He also described Electro as the "anti-bailout guy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090620-heroes-spidey-gauntlet-spotlight.html|title=Heroes Con '09: Waid & Guggenheim Run 'The Gauntlet'|author=Vaneta Rogers|date=19 June 2009|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>

A ''[[Comics Bulletin]]'' review published by Ray Tate of ''Young Allies #2'' described Electro’s appearance in that issue as "a punk with a gimmick". He also claimed that the character "never harbored a pathological hatred of Spider-Man", and that he instead "developed a healthy loathing for Spidey because the Wall Crawler frequently interfered with his sole goal of larceny". Ray believes that Electro "isn’t a wanton psychopath", but a "bank robber with electrical powers", and that he is "not nuts" but "a felon". These remarks show that Electro’s character is received not as being mentally ill, but simply a thieving villain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/127870605522500.htm|title=Young Allies #2 Review|author=Ray Tate|date=9 July 2010|publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]|accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>
