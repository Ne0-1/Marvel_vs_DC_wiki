==Fictional character biography==
Peter van Zante enlists in the U.S. military, and after being wounded in action he is treated with an experimental radiation device. A lightning strike during a freak storm destroys the device but rejuvenated van Zante. While convalescing, van Zante discovers he could manipulate water and create semi-solid three-dimensional shapes. Turning to crime, van Zante dons a costume and adopts the alias of Water Wizard. He is then employed by the criminal the [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]] and battles [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], but is defeated. <ref>''Ghost Rider'' #23 - 24 (Apr. - Jun. (bi-monthly) 1977)</ref> Although Water Wizard is later employed by criminal mastermind [[Justin Hammer]] to battle [[Iron Man]] with several other villains, he panics and flees the fight. <ref>''Iron Man'' #126-127 (Sep - Oct. 1979)</ref> The magician [[Moondark]] also recruits Water Wizard to battle Ghost Rider, but both are defeated. <ref>''Ghost Rider'' #59 (Aug. 1981)</ref> Ghost Rider then breaks van Zante out of prison shortly afterwards to assist a drought-stricken town. <ref>''Ghost Rider'' #61 (Oct. 1981)</ref> At this time van Zante discovers he can also affect oil, and after a brief criminal venture is returned to prison by Ghost Rider. <ref>''Ghost Rider'' #62 (Nov. 1981)</ref> 

Water Wizard is targeted by the assassin the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], and due to a flat tire was not present at the bar where many minor supervillains are killed. Water Wizard turns himself in to [[Captain America]], who later captures the assassin. <ref>''Captain America'' #320 (Aug. 1986)</ref> Several years later during [[Acts of Vengeance]], Water Wizard and many other villains are freed from prison by [[Doctor Doom]] to battle the [[Fantastic Four]], but van Zante ends up arguing with and fighting against fellow villain [[Hydro-Man]]. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #336 (Jan. 1990)</ref> Failure follows failure as van Zante is sidelined by construction workers during a futile attack on the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] <ref>''Avengers Annual'' #19 (1990)</ref> and is later defeated by Captain America in seconds. <ref>''Captain America'' #414 (Apr. 1993)</ref>

Water Wizard eventually reappears with a new costume and alias - Aqueduct. He joins with three other super villains with elemental abilities to form the team [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]]. The group battles the superhero team the [[New Warriors]] on two occasions, but are defeated each time. <ref>''New Warriors'' #8-9 (Feb. - Mar. 1990) and ''New Warriors'' #29 - 30 (Nov. - Dec. 1993)</ref> Aqueduct then joins the fifth generation of the [[Masters of Evil]] and battles the superhero team the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-25 (Mar. - Apr. 1997)</ref>
