'''Mordred the Evil''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is based loosely on the [[Mordred]] of [[Arthurian]] legend.

Mordred is the traitorous, illegitimate son of King Arthur Pendragon of Camelot and his sister Morgause.  [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]] warned Arthur that Mordred would be responsible for the end of Camelot, but before Arthur could put the baby to death, he was rescued and raised in anonymity.  Mordred's many conspiracies against his father were foiled by his constant foe Sir Percy of Scandia (the original [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]]) and others until finally Mordred's forces defeated Arthur's on Salisbury Plain.  Arthur and Mordred fatally wounded each other, and before dying, Mordred mortally wounded the Black Knight as well.

In modern times, Mordred's spirit has been allowed by the evil Celtic gods he serves to become active on Earth.  His first opponent was fittingly the new [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], Dane Whitman.

Mordred became [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]]'s lover, and used the [[Fomor (comics)|Fomor]] as allies.  He assisted Morgan in a scheme involving the Twilight Sword, which reunited the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].
