'''Black Lightning''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Tony Isabella]] and artist [[Trevor Von Eeden]], first appearing in ''Black Lightning'' #1 (April 1977) during the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]]. He is a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]] known as [[Metahuman|metahumans]] in the [[DC Universe]]. Born '''Jefferson Pierce''', he grew up in the disreputable Southside section of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] known as [[Suicide Slum]]. Returning to his hometown after an extended leave due to tragedy, Pierce becomes the principal at Garfield High School. Having supressed his abilities since adolescence, he adopts his new alias and persona to combat the criminals and corrupt leadership in the area while protecting his loved ones from harm. He is capable of electrical manipulation and generation. Black Lightning is DC Comics' first African American superheroes and the first to star in their own series for the DC imprint.

Tony Isabella, an experienced writer having done work for the [[Luke Cage]] character at [[Marvel Comics]], was signed on to develop DC's first starring black character. He pitched the idea for Black Lightning and it was developed though only 11 issues were published in the first series due to the infamous 'DC Implosion' of 1978. However, the character continued to make appearances in other titles over the years, including a [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] storyline in which Pierce is offered but turns down a position with the group. He does later become one of the founding members of the [[Batman]]-helmed [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] superhero team.

Pierce has two daughters with his former wife who are also metahumans. His eldest daughter Anissa, known as [[Thunder (comics)|Thunder]], can increase the denseness of her physique rendering her almost indestructable and create shockwaves when stomping the ground. Pierce's younger child Jennifer, also a superhero known as [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Lightning]], has powers almost identical to her father though she is still inexperienced and not in full control of them. A common misconception is that Pierce is the father of fellow superhero [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], who debuted much later and possesses similar abilities. Pierce addresses this coincidence in a Justice League narrative.

Along with his presence in comics, Black Lightning has made various appearances in DC-related animated television series, video games and comic strips. The character will be portrayed in live action for the first time by [[Cress Williams]] for the self-titled upcoming 2018 television series ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'', a production of [[The CW]] network. In 2011, he was ranked 85th overall on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes" list.

==Publication history==
[[Image:Black lightning JLA.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Black Lightning, cover detail, ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #12. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]
The original candidate for DC Comics' first headlining black superhero was a character called the Black Bomber, a white racist who would turn into a black superhero under stress,<ref>[http://www.proudrobot.com/hembeck/blacklightning.html The Hembeck Files]</ref> but would later be described by comics historian [[Don Markstein]] as "an insult to practically everybody with any point of view at all."<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/b_lightn.htm Black Lightning] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]</ref> When the editor who had approved the Black Bomber left the company before the character had seen print, [[Tony Isabella]] (whose previous writing experience included [[Luke Cage]], a black [[Marvel Comics]] superhero with his own title) was asked to salvage the character.  Isabella managed to convince editors to instead use his Black Lightning character which he had been working on for some time, mentioning that his characters along the way were merely stepping stones.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Isabella| first=Tony|date=30 August 2007|

What was he intended to be? Describe the character as you created him.''That's a long story, which has been told many times. The short version is that I'd been working toward creating a new black super-hero who would be an iconic role model. The other characters I'd written along the way were stepping stones to Black Lightning. I created Jefferson Pierce to be a reluctant warrior, a man of many extraordinary talents who would hear the call of his community and respond to it, even at great cost to his personal happiness. When DC Comics planned to publish a black hero who was actually a white racist, I talked them into dumping that character and going with my creation instead.}}</ref>

Tony Isabella wrote the first 10 issues of ''Black Lightning'', before handing it over to [[Dennis O'Neil]]. Only one O'Neil-scripted issue came out before the series was canceled in 1978 as part of a general large-scale pruning of the company's superhero titles known as the [[DC Implosion]]. Issue #12 was published in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #260.

Black Lightning made a number of guest appearances in various titles over the next few years, including a string of issues of ''World's Finest Comics'' written by O'Neil, then shifting to ''[[Detective Comics]]'' and a two-part story in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' in which the League invited him to join, but he turned them down. In 1983, with his powers restored, he regularly appeared again as a member of the [[Batman]]-led superhero team [[Outsiders (comics)|the Outsiders]]. When ''The Outsiders'' ended, he returned to making occasional guest appearances.

In 1995, a new ''Black Lightning'' series began, with the art by Eddy Newell, and once again being written by Tony Isabella,<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Dolan, p. 269: "Writer Tony Isabella returned to his prized character, Black Lightning, in an ongoing series with artist Eddy Newell."</ref> who was fired after the eighth issue with the series then being written by Australian writer [[David de Vries|Dave de Vries]]. After Isabella left, the series was canceled five issues later, the decision being made before these issues had seen print.  Isabella has stated that he believes the editor fired him because of a wish to bring in a new writer to "create his own power base at DC Comics".<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=2640064&postcount=150 Tony Isabella's post] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325120009/http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=2640064&postcount=150 |date=March 25, 2007 }} at [[Newsarama]]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Year One===
A [[gold medal]]-winning [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[decathlon|decathlete]], Jefferson Pierce, returned to his old neighborhood in the Southside ([[Suicide Slum]]) section of the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], with his wife Lynn Stewart and his daughter [[Thunder (comics)|Anissa]] to become the [[Head teacher|principal]] of Garfield [[high school|High School]]. Southside, as it was once known, was where his father - renowned [[journalist]] Alvin Pierce - had been murdered. Guilt over this event was a factor in his decision to leave the city of Metropolis. Suicide Slum was being torn apart by a local [[organized crime|organized criminal gang]] called [[100 (DC Comics)|the 100]], shady corporations, and crooked local politicians like [[Tobias Whale]]. A family friend and tailor, Peter Gambi, had taught a much younger Jefferson how to suppress his inborn [[metahuman]] abilities so that he would not accidentally hurt any of the people he cared about.<ref>''Black Lightning: Year One'' #1 (March 2009)</ref> Upon his return, Gambi suggested to Jefferson that he should use his powers to help the neighborhood, and refers him to a plaque with the paraphrased [[Milo Sweetman]] quote ''"Justice, like lightning, should ever appear to some men hope, to other men fear."'' (the original text of which was ''"Justice, like lightning, ever should appear to few men's ruin, but to all men's fear. Of mortal justice if thou scorn the rod, believe and tremble, thou art judged of God."'') Appalled by the public murder of Earl Clifford, one of his more promising students, Pierce tried to intervene on behalf of the schoolchildren, but quickly learned that the 100 objected violently to any interference.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book  | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Black Lightning | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 51  | publisher = [[Tate McRae ]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>As seen in ''Black Lightning: Year One'' #1 (March 2009)</ref> Pierce adopts the costumed identity "Black Lightning". Years later, he would tell fellow African American superhero [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] that he chose the name ''Black'' Lightning because he "was the only one of us around" at the time, and he "wanted to make sure everyone knew who they were dealing with."<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (May 2006)</ref>

===Outsiders===
{{main|Outsiders (comics)}}
After his own series was canceled, Black Lightning lost his electrical powers, but continued fighting without them. The loss eventually turned out to be [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]], a symptom of a crisis of confidence resulting from the accidental death of a female bystander named Trina Shelton during an altercation between Black Lightning and some gun-wielding thugs. Batman, wanting to recruit him to rescue [[Lucius Fox]] in Markovia, helped him regain his powers; this eventually led him to join the Batman's Outsiders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  During his time with the Outsiders, a group of villains called the [[Masters of Disaster (comics)|Masters of Disaster]] captured Black Lightning at the behest of the parents of Trina Shelton to avenge the death of their daughter;<ref>''Adventures of the Outsiders #34'' June 1986</ref> however, upon learning that he still regretted what happened and was willing to be executed by them, they sacrificed their lives to save him. During the [[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]] crossover, the Dominators detonated a Gene-Bomb that wreaked havoc with anyone possessing the [[metahuman#The Metagene|metagene]] by making them lose control of their powers.<ref>''Invasion!'' #1 (January 1989)</ref> After the breakup of the Outsiders, Black Lightning moved to Brick City to continue his solo career in 1995's ''Black Lightning'' #1.<ref>''Black Lightning'' #1 (February 1995)</ref>

===Secretary of Education===
[[File:Blpierce.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Cover to ''Black Lightning'' v2, #1, Eddy Newell]]
When [[Lex Luthor]] was elected [[President of the United States]] in 2000, he appoints Jefferson Pierce as [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]], Pierce accepting as he concludes that he can do more good working within the system than outside it.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  He resigned amidst controversy over his "worst-kept secret in Washington" identity as Black Lightning, and his alleged inadvertent killing of a criminally-minded corporate [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], for which President [[Pete Ross]] (who had since succeeded Luthor) then pardoned him.

Making frequent [[guest appearance]]s in several DC series, Pierce has appeared in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' (who had a one-night stand with his niece, a successful attorney named Joanna Pierce). Pierce helped [[Green Arrow]] track down [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] in the ''Green Arrow'' "Heading into the Light" story arc. He also appeared in the new ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'', of which his daughter, Anissa (using the alias [[Thunder (comics)#Anissa Pierce|Thunder]]), is a member. He came to fight the new [[Sabbac]] and help his daughter alongside [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] and the Outsiders. He had on an outfit that mixed his second outfit with the colors of the first. After teaming up with the Outsiders, incoming President [[Pete Ross]] asked him to resign as Secretary of Education and he did.

At some point prior to his resignation, Pierce used his pull in Washington to deny the powerful metahuman gangster known as [[Holocaust (DC Comics)|Holocaust]] a permit to build a Casino on Paris Island in Dakota. This would come back to haunt Pierce sometime later when the enraged Holocaust attacked him while he was giving the graduation speech at [[Ernest Hemingway]] High School.<ref>''Brave and the Bold'' (vol. 3) #24</ref>

===Infinite Crisis===
{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}
In issue #5 of the ''Infinite Crisis'' storyline, it was shown that Black Lightning was one of the eight people [[Batman]] had considered to aid him in destroying the [[OMAC (comics)|Brother Eye]] satellite, which controlled the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]].  [[Booster Gold]], who was not on the list of eight, but knew about the candidates from his knowledge of the future, contacted Lightning before Batman did, as historical data from the future had shown who had aided Batman. Lightning accepted, arriving at the Bat cave to await orders. He then forged an uneasy yet effective alliance with [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]], combining their powers of electrical manipulation and invisibility technology to strike the villainous AI from the inside.

After the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|third Society of Super Villains]] was formed, Black Lightning (as a member of [[Brad Meltzer]]'s new [[Justice League]]) began using his status as [[Lex Luthor]]'s former Secretary of Education to gain information from super villains.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol 2 #2 (November 2006)</ref>

===Outsiders redux===
In ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #45, it was revealed that three years have passed since Jefferson's niece Joanna Pierce was murdered, and that upon initially learning of her death, Jefferson went after the corrupt businessman Martin Somers, the man who was responsible. He had intended to wound Somers with his lightning shot, but apparently ended up killing him. Jefferson turned himself in to the authorities. However, it is revealed that [[Deathstroke]] was responsible for Somers' death by firing a dart of toxin to Somers moments before Jefferson shot his lightning. Hence, he was dead before he hit the ground. [[Jason Todd]] discovered the truth while eavesdropping on the assassin's conversation with [[Lex Luthor]] (who was really [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] in disguise) and contacted [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] with this information. When Nightwing and Anissa told Jefferson of this in prison, he disbelieved it and intended to pay for Somers' death. Anissa herself intended to break her father out of [[Iron Heights]] Prison. Upon learning from Todd that other inmates were about to carry out a contract hit on Pierce (whose identity as an inmate had leaked to unknown parties), the Outsiders resolved to assist her. They freed him from jail and, with the audio recording of Deathstroke's conversation, cleared his name.

===Justice League of America===
Years ago, [[Green Arrow]] brought Black Lightning to the attention of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], who extended an offer of membership to the protector of Suicide Slum.  He turned down the offer, preferring to work as a loner and focus on street-level crime, though he did offer to become a reservist.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #173-174 (December 1979 – January 1980)</ref> Years later, when all of the JLA reservists were called in to fight a newly revived Amazo, Black Lighting was one of the heroes called, confirming that the League had accepted his offer. Most recently, however, Black Lightning has joined the JLA, once again appearing with a modified costume.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He appears to be primarily based in [[Washington, D.C.]] again. Black Lightning assists the JLA with intelligence gathered from the criminal community. Many super villains still believe he is 'in' with Lex Luthor and are willing to cooperate. Jefferson also helps the team in a battle against [[Amazo]]. He was the first member of the League to respond to the recent attacks made by the Amazons of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], and he also saved the President of the United States in this event.

Black Lightning was the focus of the one-shot ''[[Final Crisis]]: Submit'', in which he helped the new [[Tattooed Man#Mark Richards|Tattooed Man]] and his family escape at the cost of his own freedom. He is subsequently shown in issue 4 of ''Final Crisis'' under Darkseid's thrall.

===Outsiders===
Recently, Black Lightning was recruited by [[Alfred Pennyworth]] to join a new version of the Outsiders following an attack by [[Doctor Hurt]] which left Thunder comatose. Unlike previous iterations of the team, these Outsiders must live "off the grid" and stay out of contact with friends and family for months at a time. It is confirmed that, due to this new commitment, Black Lightning has left the Justice League.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #31</ref>

===The New 52===
In DC's 2011 reboot of its continuity, ''[[The New 52]]'', Black Lightning comes into conflict with [[Blue Devil]], over their confrontation of [[Tobias Whale]]'s crime wave.<ref>''DC Universe Presents'' #13. DC Comics.</ref> He later made an appearance as a possible recruit for the Justice League.<ref>''Justice League'' #17. DC Comics.</ref>

==='''Black Lightning: Cold Dead Hands'''===
Tony Isabella, the creator of Black Lightning, rebooted the character in a new six part series that began in November, 2017. The series, which takes place in Cleveland, "forgets" much of the previous history of the character. Tony Isabella says that this will not be an "origin" story, but one may follow.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Powers and abilities==
{{Cleanup|reason=Lots of mischief and flippant phrasing in here.|date=June 2017}}
Originally,<ref>Black Lightning #1 (April 1977)</ref> he was described as having no innate powers, using a belt that allowed him to generate a force field and project electrical bolts. This power was later revealed to exist as a result of the [[Metagene]], according to ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]'' #3.<ref>''Invasion!'' #3 (March 1989)</ref>

Black Lightning is able to shoot extremely powerful lightning bolts, strong enough to kill a man if he wanted to, but he usually uses the lightning to scare his enemies. When he does fire his lightning at people, he tries to stun if he can. In a pinch, he can also ionize the atmosphere, creating localized lightning storms with strikes hundreds of times per minute. He can also create quick charges of electricity in his fists to give his punches more of a shock.

Besides being able to control electricity, Black Lightning can turn into electricity himself. In his electrical form, Black Lightning is almost invulnerable. He can’t be hit with physical objects, can’t be poisoned or infected with any diseases, and he doesn’t need air, food or water to survive. He can go through conditions that would normally kill him, and even into space, as electricity, and survive. He can shoot himself across vast distances in electrical form, but also travel the same way regular electricity can; by jumping into electrical cables or wires, Black Lightning can move through the power system as fast as a spark can. In this form. Black Lightning can pass through walls or solid objects, and can move extremely fast.  With his power over electricity, he can also make magnetic fields, allowing him to move and control objects.

Black Lightning also has a mystical ability to throw a different type of lightning that is literally colored black; it is fueled by his rage, and he grows stronger as he gets angrier.

With his electrical power, he can create huge walls or bubbles of energy, which can take punishment in his place. These force fields can be used to block incoming fists, bullets, and other physical attacks, including cars that try to run him over. The fields block energy blasts from weapons or other metahumans, and they can even block explosions, keeping him from being hit by grenades or bombs.  He also has the ability to sense electrical fields around him, and can tell where electricity is coming from and how strong it is.

His powers allow him to absorb energy in order to make himself stronger. Black Lightning can then make himself stronger, faster, heal quicker and produce more lightning. Any source of electricity will do, but he has a fondness for absorbing lightning from thunderstorms. He can even drain power plants, which give him a huge boost, even if it does shut down power for the rest of the city sometimes. He can also use this power in an offensive way by draining energy from machines that might be attacking him.

==Black Lightning's daughters==
Jefferson has had two daughters by his ex-wife Lynn Stewart, both of whom have followed in his footsteps and become superheroes.
His oldest daughter, [[Thunder (comics)|Anissa Pierce]], has taken on the name "Thunder" and served on an incarnation of his team the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>As seen in ''Outsiders'' vol. 3 #1 (August 2003)</ref> His sixteen-year-old, younger daughter, [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Jennifer Pierce]], was recently recruited by the [[Justice Society of America]] under the code name "Lightning".<ref>As seen in Justice Society of America #12 (March 2008)</ref>  A version of Lightning first appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' a 1996 miniseries published by DC Comics.

In ''Justice League of America'' vol. 2 #27, Pierce claims that people frequently ask him if he is the father of [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], much to his chagrin. It is later revealed that Static is in fact a fan of Black Lightning, and has a poster of the hero in his room in [[Titans Tower]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol 3) #83</ref>
