Jefferson Pierce, aka '''Black Lightning''', was [[DC Comics]]'  first [[African American]] [[superhero]] to have his own title. He was created by [[Tony Isabella]] and first appeared in ''Black Lightning'' #1 ([[1977]]).

A frequent [[Guest star|guest starring]] character in several DC series, Pierce has had recent appearances in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' (in which the protagonist was dating his niece), and the new ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (in which one member is his daughter Anissa, aka [[Thunder (comics)#Thunder II|Thunder]]).

==Origin==
{{spoiler}}
A gold medal-winning [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] decathlete, Jefferson Pierce returned to his old neighborhood (the notorious [[Suicide Slum]] in the proud city of [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]]) to become a high school teacher. Appalled by the violence he saw, Pierce tried to intervene on behalf of his students, but quickly learned that The 100, the local [[organised crime|criminal organization]], objected violently to interference. Peter Gambi, a family friend and tailor, designed the costume and electronic power belt of Black Lightning.  Pierce donned a mask, an Afro wig, a hip way of talking, and Gambi's outfit that gave him electrical powers to become Black Lightning, defender of the poor and underprivileged. (Later, when Black Lightning was captured by his enemies and the belt that gave him his powers destroyed, it was discovered that he had somehow internalised the power and no longer needed the belt.)

==Character History==
The original candidate for DC Comics' first headlining black superhero was a character called the Black Bomber, later described by cartoon and comics historian [[Don Markstein]] as "an insult to practically everybody with any point of view at all." When the editor who had approved the Black Bomber left the company before the character had seen print, [[Tony Isabella]] (whose previous writing experience included [[Luke Cage]], [[Marvel Comics]]' first black superhero with his own title) was asked to salvage the character; even with the first-issue deadline looming, Isabella was convinced that the only way forward was to scrap the Black Bomber and start again from scratch, and so Black Lightning came into being.

Isabella wrote the first ten issues of ''Black Lightning'', before handing over to [[Dennis O'Neil]]. Only one O'Neil-scripted issue came out before the series was cancelled in 1978 as part of a general large-scale pruning of the company's superhero titles (which also cancelled the debut of ''Vixen'', which would have been DC's first title starring a ''female'' black superhero).  Issue #12 was published only in ''[[Cancelled Comics Cavalcade]]''.

Black Lightning made a number of guest appearances in various titles over the next few years, including a string of issues of ''[[World's Finest]]'' written by O'Neil, and, notably, a two-part story in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' in which the League invited him to join, but he turned them down.

During this period, Black Lightning lost his electrical powers, but continued fighting without them. The loss eventually turned out to be [[psychosomatic]], a symptom of a crisis of confidence resulting from the accidental death of a bystander during an altercation between Black Lightning and some gun-wielding thugs.

In [[1983]], powers restored, he became a regularly-appearing character again as a member of the [[Batman]]-led superhero team [[Outsiders (comics)|the Outsiders]].  When ''The Outsiders'' ended, he returned to doing the occasional guest appearance.  One such appearance, in [[1988]], resulted in increased powers.

In [[1995]], a new series of ''Black Lightning'' began, again written by Tony Isabella. Editorial disagreements about the direction of the series resulted in Isabella leaving after eight issues; the series limped along for another five issues before being cancelled, and Black Lightning returned once again to guest-star limbo.

When [[Lex Luthor]] was elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000]], he appointed Jefferson Pierce as [[Secretary of Education]].  He resigned among controversy over his "worst-kept secret in Washington" identity as Black Lightning, and his inadvertent killing of a criminally-minded corporate [[CEO]], for which President [[Pete Ross]] (who had since succeeded Luthor) then pardoned him.

==Black Lightning in other media==

Black Lightning has never appeared in any of the many television series based on DC Comics superheroes. This is in itself not unusual for a character of Black Lightning's relative obscurity, but is notable because at least three such series have contained specially-created black superheroes with electrical powers who ''weren't'' Black Lightning - series regular [[Black Vulcan]] in ''[[Super Friends]]'' and guest stars Soul Power in ''[[Static Shock]]'' (not to mention Static himself) and [[Juice (JLUTV)|Juice]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' - leading fans to speculate that for some reason DC is making a point of not including Black Lightning. It is possible that DC is not using the character because his use comes with having to pay his creator royalties.

[[Sinbad (actor)|Sinbad]] once appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' dressed as Black Lightning, crashing Superman's funeral. The other dignitaries and superheroes didn't recognize him. He walked around asking incredulously if anyone remembered Black Lightning and zapping people to prove his powers. Black Lightning creator, [[Tony Isabella]], told ''[[Fanzing]]'' regarding this appearance, "If I ever see that guy, I'm going to give him a big wet one. I never laughed so hard in my life. I was on the floor rolling around."

==Awards==
The second series was nominated for the [[Squiddy Award]] for Favorite Continuing Series in 1994.
