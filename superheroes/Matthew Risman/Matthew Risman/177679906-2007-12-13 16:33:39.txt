'''Matthew Risman''' is a [[fictional character]], in the [[Marvel Universe]] and a deadly enemy of mutants including the [[X-Men]].

==History==
A trained sniper, Matthew Risman was in the middle of a hit when he suddenly received a call telling him to return to his home. Leaving his target, Risman rushed home, dragging his wife and daughter from their home seconds before a mountainside collapsed on it, completely obliterating it. As the trio looked at their damaged home, the man who had informed Risman of the coming disaster, [[William Stryker]], appeared. Convincing Risman that he had access to future events, Stryker recruited Risman into the [[Purifiers]], a group who believed it was their holy mission to eradicate the few mutants who remained following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

Following events that Stryker foresaw while tapping into a damaged Nimrod's memory of the future, Stryker and the Purifiers began slaughtering mutants and ex-mutants, attempting to alter the future seen by [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] to one where the Purifiers triumphed during their assault on the Xavier Institute. Due to a switch between [[X-23]] and Dust, the Purifiers believed they'd eliminated the correct mutants, allowing them to triumph. Surprised by the switch, the Purifiers were defeated, Stryker was killed, and Risman was left horribly scarred by an angry Dust.

Calling Stryker a martyr, Risman has taken up leadership of the Purifiers and is ready to continue his war on mutant-kind.

===Messiah Complex===
The Purifiers are one of the three factions, alongside the X-Men and [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], searching for the first mutant baby born since M-Day.

All three groups were alerted to the baby's birth more or less simultaneously, and headed for the remote [[Alaskan]] village where the birth took place.  The Purifier task force beat both the X-Men and the Marauders to the scene, and proceeded to cull every child in the city, in order to make sure the mutant baby did not survive.  They were then attacked by the Marauders, who killed several Purifiers.  By the time the X-Men arrived on the scene, both villain teams had departed, with the whereabouts of the baby unknown.

When the [[New X-Men]] discovered the Purifiers' role in this, [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] led a squad to attack the Purifiers at their base, forcing X-Man mole [[Rictor]] to blow his cover. [[Hellion (comics)|Hellion]] recognised and attacked Risman, but was stabbed through the chest by [[Lady Deathstrike]], who Risman had hired, along with her [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], to help him kill the mutant child and the X-Men.

==Powers and abilities==
Being baseline humans, neither Risman nor the Purifiers possess superhuman abilities to speak of, relying on superior technology in their genocidial campaign against mutants. The Purifiers possess a variety of deadly armaments and munitions, some more conventional weapons like assault rifles and anti-tank rockets, as well as more advanced and expensive equipment like Vibranium-based weaponry. The group also used the knowledge contained within Nimrod's memory banks to great effect, although that advantage was lost when the Sentinel reactivated and destroyed its keepers, before being defeated by the New X-Men. 

Risman is a trained hitman, so he is highly-trained, like all the others Purifiers, who and have been shown to be capable of holding their own against both O.N.E. troopers and the X-Men. Their belief in the righteousness of their actions and their belief that they are fulfilling God's work by killing mutants is a source of great strength for the group, enabling them to commit acts that would make more moral, reasoned individuals cringe, and enabling them to hold their ground in the face of great odds or past defeats. Combined with their secret nature and fanatical determination, the Purifiers are undoubtedly a deadly foe and a cause of great concern for the remaining mutants.
