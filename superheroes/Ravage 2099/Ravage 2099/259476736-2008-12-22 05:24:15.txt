'''Ravage 2099''' ('''Paul Phillip Ravage''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a [[fictional character]] created by [[Stan Lee]] in [[1992 in comics|1992]] for Marvel's [[Marvel 2099]] [[imprint]]. Ravage's first full appearance was in ''Ravage 2099'' # 1, which appeared along with the Marvel 2099 universe releases of [[Spider-Man 2099]], [[Doom 2099 (comics)|Doom 2099]], and [[The Punisher 2099|Punisher 2099]], distinct among the other titles as Ravage was an original character, not [[Re-imagining#Reimagining|re-imagined]]. The series ran for 33 issues.

==Character history==
Paul-Phillip Ravage was the CEO of a subsidiary of '''Alchemax''' that worked to combat polluters.  Ravage's life changed when he was framed for murder in response to questioning the secrets of the company and the violent, often fatal, methods it used. A fugitive armed with a blaster, a [[gear|cog]] used as a [[shuriken]], and a [[kevlar]] vest, Ravage was the target of both the police and Alchemax. On the lam, Ravage's companions were an orphaned boy named Dack, son of a man his company killed, and an Asian-American woman named Tiana who was originally his secretary. As a fugitive, Ravage would find himself traveling from civilization to Hellrock, home of [[radiation poisoning|irradiated]] and mutated outcasts, to become the mutated hero of the [[Barrio]]â€”an impoverished community of superhero worshipers located on the outskirts of the city. The despotic ruler of Hellrock, Dethstryk, who planned to invade the rest of the world and destroy all humans, would eventually become Ravage's arch-nemesis.

After prolonged exposure to the radiation of Hellrock, Ravage soon develops a new superpower: his hands become radioactive and constantly generate lethal energy. This new power gives Ravage extreme destructive power, but it doesn't last for very long; eventually the radiation devolves his body to a primal beast form, making Ravage far more attuned to the animal world, and gives him fangs, claws, horns, enhanced senses, strength and speed and the ability to regenerate from almost anything. Ravage can also transform back to a human form when necessary. 

Tiana would later become a version of the Norse entity [[Hel]], given powers by Alchemax as part of a scheme to control or kill vigilante superheros, such as Ravage himself. The two would confront each other but Tiana recognized her friend and kept herself from killing him.

Later they both gained new jobs. Ravage a new business style-job, and Tiana destroying old satellites to follow a 'one up, one down' law. The two would temporarily split when Ravage's animal nature caused him to blurt out his opinion of her new powers, specifically that she is wasting them. 

Ravage attempts to control his animal side, but it comes out in various ways. In one instance he almost transforms in the presence of a business rival. While visiting a zoo full of cloned animals, he roars back at the lions, realizing he is communicating with them about their wild instincts hating their confinement. He comes to accept his animal side better after dealing with an insane hunter and his abused cat-man.

Ravage teams up with a sentient bat-woman, named Ferra, to search out a legendary valley of animal-people. They team up to destroy a reality-manipulating alien but do not actually find the valley at the time, just a close, other-dimensional copy.

Ravage eventually returned to Hellrock, along with Ferra and Tiana/Hela. There, with the help of Dethstryk's own confidant, the Seeress, Ravage killed Dethstryk and took over Hellrock. Ravage (presumably) died after being immersed in liquid [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] by [[Doom 2099 (comics)|Doom]] and sent into space.

==Powers and abilities==
Ravage would gain powers being mutated by the radiation of Hellrock, where he battled Deathstryk to free Tiana. Initially, the powers consisted of the ability to project bio-energy beams that were physically taxing on Ravage; however, these powers mutated and Ravage soon became a man-beast. In his new form, Ravage had enhanced strength, speed, senses, durability, and agility; in addition to growing horns, fangs, and claws on his hands and feet. Ravage also possessed a [[healing factor]].
