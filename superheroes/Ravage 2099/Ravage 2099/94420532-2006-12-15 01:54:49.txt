'''Ravage 2099''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a [[fictional character]] created by [[Stan Lee]] in 1992.

==Publication history==
Ravage's first full appearance was in ''Ravage 2099'' # 1, which appeared along with the [[Marvel 2099]] universe releases of [[Spider-Man 2099]], [[Doom 2099 (comics)|Doom 2099]], and [[The Punisher 2099|Punisher 2099]], distinct among the other titles as Ravage was an original character, not re-imagined. The series ran for 33 issues.

==Fictional character biography==
Paul-Phillip Ravage was the CEO of a subsidiary of '''Alchemax'''.  Ravage's life changed when he was framed for murder.  A fugitive armed with a blaster, a [[cog]] used as a [[shuriken]] and a [[kevlar]]-vest, Ravage was the target of both the police and Alchemax.  On the lam, Ravage's companions were an orphaned boy named Dack, and a woman named Tiana.  As a fugitive, Ravage would find himself traveling from civilization to Hellrock, home of [[radiation poisoning|irradiated]] and mutated outcasts, to become the mutated hero of the [[Barrio]]â€”an impoverished community of superhero worshippers located on the outskirts of the city.

==Powers and abilities==
Ravage would gain powers after being mutated by the radiation of Hellrock, where he battled Deathstryk to free Tiana.  Initially, the powers consisted of the ability to project bio-energy beams that were physically taxing on Ravage.  However, these powers mutated and Ravage soon became a man-beast, similar to [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] or [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] of the [[Earth-616|main Marvel universe]].  In his new form, Ravage had enhanced strength, speed, senses, durabilty, and agility; in addition to growing horns, fangs, and claws on his hands and feet.  Ravage also possessed a [[healing factor]].

==Demise of Ravage==
Ravage presumably died after being immersed in liquid [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] by [[Doom 2099 (comics)|Doom]] and sent into space.
