Ravage 2099 is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a [[fictional character]] created by [[Stan Lee]] in 1992.

Ravage's first full appearance was in ''Ravage 2099'' # 1, which appeared along with the [[Marvel 2099]] universe releases of [[Spiderman 2099]], [[Doom 2099]], and [[Punisher 2099]], distinct among the other titles as Ravage was an original character, not re-imagined. The series ran for 33 issues.

==Character History==

Paul-Phillip Ravage was the CEO of a subsidary of Alchemax.  Ravages life changed when he was framed for murder.  A fugitive armed with a blaster, cog used as a shuriken and kevlar-vest, Ravage was the target of both the police and Alchemax.  On the lamb, Ravage's companions were an orphaned boy named Dack, and a woman Tiana.  As a fugitive, Ravage would find himself traveling from civilization to Hellrock, home of irradiated and mutated outcast, to becoming the mutated hero of the Barrio, an empoverished community of superhero worshippers located on the outskirts of the city.

Ravage presumably died after being immersed in liquid adamantium by Doom and sent into space.
==Powers and abilities==

Ravage would gain powers after being mutated by the radiation of Hellrock, after battling Deathstryk to free her.  Initially, the powers consisted of the ability to project bio-energy beams, that were physically taxing on Ravage.  However, these powers mutated and Ravage soon became a man-beast, similar to [[Beast]] or [[Sabertooth]].  In his new form, Ravage had enhanced strenth, speed, senses, durabilty, and agility; in addtion to growing horns, fangs, and claws on his hands and feet.  Ravage also possessed a [[healing factor]].

====Demise of Ravage====
Ravage met his demise by being encased by Herod in a fast-solifying liquid adamantium block.
