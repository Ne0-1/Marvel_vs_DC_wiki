The '''Protector''' is a character who replaces [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] temporarily in the [[1983]] ''[[Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'' Drug issues written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and penciled by [[George PÃ©rez]].  The book was sponsored by [[Keebler]], and Robin was at the time licensed by [[Nabisco]] so the Protector was used as a substitute. Coinciding with the issue was an anti-drug cartoon tv advert that may have been a test for a Titans tv show.  As Robin was already member of the popular [[Super Friends]] he would not have been available. <ref>http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/nttanimated.html</ref>
