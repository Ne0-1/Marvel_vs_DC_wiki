The '''Protector''' is a character who replaces [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] temporary in the [[1983]] [[Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]] Drug issues written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and penciled by [[George PÃ©rez]].  The idea was to convince kids into not doing [[drug]]s so they needed a more patriotic superhero version of Robin to take his place.
