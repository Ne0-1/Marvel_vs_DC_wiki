{{For|the Marvel Comics character|Protector (Marvel Comics)}}

The '''Protector''' ('''Jason Hart''') is a character who replaces [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] temporarily in the [[1983]] ''[[Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'' drug issues written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and penciled by [[George PÃ©rez]].  

The book was sponsored by [[Keebler]], and Robin was at the time licensed by [[Nabisco]] so the Protector was used as a substitute. Coinciding with the issue was an anti-drug cartoon television advertisement that may have been a test for a Titans television show.  As Robin was already a member of the popular [[Super Friends]] he would not have been available. <ref>http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/nttanimated.html</ref>
Despite the fact that he hardly appeared outisde of the Drug Issue comics he is regarded as a member of the team as confirmed in the "[[Who's Who in the DC Universe#Who.27s Who Update .2787|DC Who's Who Update 1987]]" comic.
