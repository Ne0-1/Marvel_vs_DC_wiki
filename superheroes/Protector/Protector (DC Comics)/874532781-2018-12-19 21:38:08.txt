{{For|the Marvel Comics character|Protector (Marvel Comics)}}

The '''Protector''' ('''Jason Hart''') is a superhero that occasionally teams up with the [[Teen Titans]]. He somewhat replaces [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] temporarily in the 1983 ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' drug issues written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and penciled by [[George Pérez]].  

==Publication history==
The book was sponsored by [[Keebler]], and Robin was at the time licensed by [[Nabisco]] so the Protector was used as a substitute. Coinciding with the issue was an anti-drug cartoon television advertisement that may have been a test for a Titans television show.  As Robin was already a member of the popular [[Super Friends]] he would not have been available.<ref>[http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/nttanimated.html Titans Tower Theater: New Teen Titans<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016051509/http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/nttanimated.html |date=October 16, 2006 }}</ref>
Despite the fact that he hardly appeared outside of the Drug Issue comics he is regarded as a member of the team as confirmed in the ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe#Who.27s Who Update .2787|DC Who's Who Update '87]]'' comic.

Jason finally made another appearance in ''Titans Secret Files'' #2 (October 2000), attending a superhero party held by [[Beast Boy]]. Later, he also appeared in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' hardcover collected edition in an added two-page spread.

Protector has recently appeared in the mini-series "Heroes in Crisis". He is one of the many heroes who was being treated at Sanctuary. It is unknown, but highly possible that he is among the casualties of the recent massacre that occurred there.

==Other versions==
The Protector appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go]]'' #52 as an alternate alias of [[Dial H For Hero|Robby Reed]].  Unknown to both Robby and the Titans, his Hero Dial borrows power from any hero who's in close proximity to him, and thus becomes The Protector when Robin is close by. <ref>''Teen Titans Go'' #52</ref>

The Protector appears again in ''[[Teen Titans Go]]'' #55, although if it's still Robby Reed is doubtful. <ref>''Teen Titans Go'' #55</ref>

A version of the Protector shows up in ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' issues #16 and 46. <ref>''Tiny Titans'' #16</ref> <ref>''Tiny Titans'' #46</ref>
