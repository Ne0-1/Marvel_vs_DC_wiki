{{For|the Marvel Comics character|Protector (Marvel Comics)}}

The '''Protector''' ('''Jason Hart''') is a character who replaces [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] temporarily in the 1983 ''[[Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'' drug issues written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and penciled by [[George PÃ©rez]].  

==Fictional character biography==
The book was sponsored by [[Keebler]], and Robin was at the time licensed by [[Nabisco]] so the Protector was used as a substitute. Coinciding with the issue was an anti-drug cartoon television advertisement that may have been a test for a Titans television show.  As Robin was already a member of the popular [[Super Friends]] he would not have been available. <ref>[http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/nttanimated.html Titans Tower Theater: New Teen Titans<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Despite the fact that he hardly appeared outside of the Drug Issue comics he is regarded as a member of the team as confirmed in the ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe#Who.27s Who Update .2787|DC Who's Who Update 1987]]'' comic.

Jason finally made another appearance in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' hardcover collected edition in an added two-page spread.

==Other Version==
The Protector appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go]]'' #52 as an alternate alias of [[Dial H For Hero|Robby Reed]].  Unknown to both Robby and the Titans, his Hero Dial borrows power from any hero who's in close proximity to him, and thus becomes The Protector when Robin is close by.

The Protector appears again in ''[[Teen Titans Go]]'' #55, though if it's still Robby Reed is doubtful.
