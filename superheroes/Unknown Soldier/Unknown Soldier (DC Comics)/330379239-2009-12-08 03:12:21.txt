The '''Unknown Soldier''' is [[fictional character|fictional]] [[war comics]] character in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. The character was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Joe Kubert]], first appearing in ''Our Army At War'' #168 (June [[1966 in comics|1966]]). 

==Publication history==
The Unknown Soldier's first appearance in ''Our Army At War'' #168 was in a [[Sgt. Rock]] story, "I Knew The Unknown Soldier!", written by Kanigher and drawn by Kubert. Kubert, who also edited the DC Comics line of war comics at the time, decided that the character was interesting enough to be featured in his own series, which began some years later in ''Star Spangled War Stories'', running from #151 (June-July 1970) to #204 (February 1977).<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/unknown.htm The Unknown Soldier - Don Markstein's Toonopedia]</ref> Eventually, ''Star Spangled War Comics'' began featuring the Soldier exclusively. With #205 (May 1977), the book changed its title to ''The Unknown Soldier'', continuing the numbering and running for another 64 issues, ending with #268 (October 1982).

The series originally takes place during [[World War II]], and focuses on the missions of an [[United States]] [[intelligence agent]] code-named "The Unknown Soldier," whose head and face are so severely disfigured that he typically has it completely wrapped in heavy bandages. Despite this, he is a master of [[disguise]] who can assume the identity of almost any man using latex masks and make-up. However, his disguises occasionally itch where they meet the [[scar]] tissue of his face, forcing him to be conscious not to give himself away by scratching. He is also prone to loss of temper at enemy atrocities and has been seen to blow his cover in this manner.

The character is named after [[Tomb of the Unknowns|The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], [[Virginia]] (which occasionally makes appearances in the series). The character of the Unknown Soldier is symbolic of the nameless soldiers that have fought throughout America's wars; as stated in his first featured story "They Came From Shangri-La!" (''Star Spangled War Stories'' #151, June-July 1970), he is the "man who no one knows — but — is known by everyone!" Another nickname for the character used in the series is "The Immortal [[GI (term)|G.I.]]"

Other writers contributing stories to the original run included [[Bob Haney]], [[Frank Robbins]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[David Michelinie]]. Artists also included [[Dick Ayers]], [[Doug Wildey]], [[Dan Spiegle]], [[Jack Sparling]] and Gerry Talaoc. Backup features included "[[Enemy Ace]]" by Robert Kanigher and [[John Severin]], and "[[Captain Fear]]" by David Michelinie and [[Walt Simonson]]. 

The second series, also titled ''The Unknown Soldier'', was a twelve-issue [[limited series]] published in [[1988 in comics|1988]] and [[1989 in comics|1989]], written by [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Jim Owsley]] and drawn by [[Phil Gascoine]]. It was a top vote getter for the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' Fan Award for Favorite Limited Series for 1988. However, its depiction of the Soldier is radically different from the original comics, with the Soldier being literally [[Immortality|immortal]] and more cynical about the United States than the patriotic character of the original series. As a result its place in "official" continuity is unclear.

In [[1997 in comics|1997]] [[Garth Ennis]] wrote ''Unknown Soldier'', a four-issue mini-series under the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, featuring art by Kilian Plunkett. A much darker portrayal of the Soldier, the story is about a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent tracing the post-war activities of the Soldier and the Soldier searching for a replacement for himself. This story appeared to ignore the 1988–89 mini-series, and was collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] in 1998.

A "DC Showcase" black and white trade paperback collection, ''The Unknown Soldier Volume One'', reprinting stories between 1970 and 1975, was published in [[2006 in comics|2006]].

A new Unknown Soldier series from Vertigo, set in [[Uganda]], is currently written by [[Joshua Dysart]], with art by Alberto Ponticelli. It began publication in October 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/php/multimedia/album.php?aid=19701 Exclusive Preview: Vertigo's ''Unknown Soldier'' #1], [[Newsarama]], July 17, 2008</ref><ref>McLean, Matthew.

A figure, similar in appearance to the original Unknown Soldier, appears to exit The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in [[Blackest Night]] issue #3 and is seen again in issue #4 battling [[Wonder Woman]].

===Fictional character biography===
The origin story in ''Star Spangled War Stories'' #154 (December–January 1970–1971) reveals that the Unknown Soldier is an unnamed young man who joins the [[United States Army]] together with his brother Harry less than two months before the [[Japan]]ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Assigned to the [[Philippines]] when the [[Pacific War]] breaks out, he and Harry are present when the Japanese sweep across the islands. In their [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]], Harry tells his brother not to lose hope even though they are outnumbered, because "one guy can affect the outcome of a whole war! One guy in the right place... at the right time..."

The two are fighting off wave after wave of invading Japanese soldiers when a [[hand grenade]] lands near their foxhole. Harry throws himself on the grenade and is killed instantly, but the explosion also injures the unnamed soldier's face. In a rage, the soldier defeats the remaining Japanese single-handedly, but his face has been obliterated by the grenade and doctors are unable to restore it. Turning down a [[Congressional Medal of Honor]] for his actions, the soldier instead volunteers to be that "one man in the right place" that Harry spoke of. His previous identity is erased and he undergoes intensive training to become an intelligence operative code-named "The Unknown Soldier".

The series does not take place linearly, but has individual stories scattered throughout all the years of the war and in various [[Theater (warfare)|theaters]]. Over the course of the series, the Unknown Soldier also builds up a supporting cast, including Sergeant Chat Noir, an [[African American]] soldier and former [[French Resistance]] leader whom the Soldier first encounters a few days prior to [[D-Day]]. The Soldier also occasionally uses the services of an informant known only as Sparrow, who works behind enemy lines. 

===Final issue===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Unknownsoldierlastcover.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''The Unknown Soldier'' #268 (October 1982), the final issue of the original series.]] -->
The last issue of the first series, ''The Unknown Soldier'' #268, "A Farewell to War" relates how during the [[Battle of Berlin]], the Unknown Soldier is sent on a mission to stop a Nazi super-weapon, [[vampire|vampiric]] [[octopi]] called "[[Nosferatu (word)|Nosferatu]]". During the course of the story both Sparrow and Chat Noir are killed. On April 29, 1945, the Soldier infiltrates [[Adolf Hitler]]'s bunker, killing him and assuming the dictator's identity to call off the weapon's deployment. He then makes Hitler's death look like a suicide so people will assume Hitler took the coward's way out. As the Soldier makes his way to the Allied lines, he saves the life of a civilian girl from a bomb blast, apparently being killed himself. However, the last panel, taking place on May 7, 1945 after the city's surrender, shows an American [[staff sergeant]] scratching his face in the Soldier's distinctive manner, suggesting that he survived. 

In ''DC Comics Presents'' #42 (February 1982), "The Specter of War!", [[Superman]]'s alter-ego [[Clark Kent]] receives a mysterious note from an unidentified soldier that leads him to uncover a plan by a renegade Army officer to cause a nuclear holocaust. Throughout, Superman is assisted at key moments by the mysterious soldier, whom he later believes could be the legendary immortal G.I. However, it is left ambiguous if the Unknown Soldier is still alive or a ghost. At the end of the story, Kent visits the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, while a gardener in the background is seen scratching his face as the Soldier used to do. 

In ''Swamp Thing'' #82 (January 1989), "Brothers In Arms Part Two", it is revealed that the Soldier did survive World War II, but his continued existence is kept top secret, having been officially declared dead by his superiors.

During the [[Blackest Night]] event, the Soldier is depicted as one of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]], attacking his tomb in Washington and saying "I have a name.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3</ref>

===Fictional character biography===
In 2002, Dr. Moses "Patrick" Lwanga is a born [[pacifist]], trained doctor and a [[philanthropist]], he lived with his [[African]]-born [[Catholic]] wife and had no children. When he travels back to Africa after a philanthropy summit to stop fighting in [[Uganda]], he goes to help a refugee camp with medical aid in the war zone area. He is, however, always haunted in his dreams with visions of himself randomly, and easily, killing people around him. Constantly disturbed by these nightmares, the inherent violence surrounding the field hospital and his treatment of various injuries caused by the fighting exacerbate his already deteriorating moral compass. After seeing the horrors of children and adults with missing limbs from the fighting and hears stories of children who watched their family slain, Moses ventures out into the bush just to be ambushed by two [[child soldiers]] of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]]. The two child soldiers had already assaulted a young boy, [[War Rape|raped]] his sister, and shot a soldier assisting Moses before making him drop to his knees for an execution. It seems like the children are ready to kill him, when a voice that sounds like him tells him how to take the [[AK-47]] a child had and shoot the boy. Moses does so and briefly enters a [[fugue]] where he loses his grip on reality, at first believing himself to be somewhere else, only to then get snapped to reality and watch himself take action as if he were outside himself. After seeing the child soldier dead at his feet, he aims the weapon at the other, and tells him to take the girl to the IDP camp hospital, which the desperate soldier does. Moses, disgusted with himself and wants the voice out of his head, grabs a rock and bashes his face to shreds passing out once he was satisfied. 

An unknown amount of time later a group of  [[orphan]]s of war come across his body believing him to be dead and [[loot]] him for his weapons, his wallet taking out any ID that it was his believing it was his father, even his clothes. Another amount of time later as flies gather an [[ox]] picks him up onto its back, it is not known the journey the ox took but its herdsman found Moses.

Moses wakes up partially [[color blind]] from what the [[Nun]], who found him, says it's from deep infections to the face. The Nun, Sister Sharon, gives him shelter and food at an all girls school in the middle of the bush that was an [[IDP]] camp. He stays and listens to Sharon's stories about her rape and deals with the rebels that weren't part of the LRA or [[UPDF]]. He also finds a friend, in one of the girl orphans, Anyayo or "Anna" who he lies too and says his name is "Patrick". He is mistaken for a [[NGO]] operative by Sharon and Anna believes him to be a soldier. Anna warns him that the rebels probably will break their deal, not to bother the camp, and to be prepared. That night Moses has a vision being visited by the spirit of the boy he killed, then goes to pray when [[Jesus Christ]] steps down from his cross and comforts him and ask him to remember. This brings another vision out showing him strapped to a table and a fetus, but this is cut short by gun fire. He runs out to find the rebels killing a woman, but the spirit of his former self gives him instructions to avoid the same faith, which he argues against killing the rebels who are barely teens. 

He sneaks up on a rebel and secures the boy's rifle and uses the boy as a shield as he moves through the compound. He comes across a room where the boys are spliting the girls up, he tries to take control of the situation but fails and is captured and led back to their camp. He finds out that the unit is a part of the LRA and he again is mistaken for a priest, and is shown around the camp by a grown man who is acting as the commander. He learns that the LRA twist the view of Christianity to fit their need,after he confronts a boy who killed a woman on the mission and watches as his fellow soldiers beat him for his [[sin]]. A while later, The nun, Sharon, arrives at the camp and after a talk with the leader is allowed to take ten of the thirty girls back to the school, while the other 20 would become wives and [[sex slaves]] for the soldiers. As she is about to leave she unties Patrick secretly, which leads him to tap into his [[sixth sense]] as he stages a break out with all the girls who haven't been [[indoctrinated]] into the LRA. The escape goes well at first, as he kills a few soldiers by hand and sets a few mines as traps. However, during the escape a girl is badly wounded by gun fire and he picks her up as she dies after he kills the shooter. During this time he is thinking of all the lives he is ending and the time he first came back to Uganda as an adult as he does a row of mines blows up behind him.
