'''Cobalt Man''' ('''Ralph Roberts''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller  [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #31 (April, 1967), where he was a member of [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead's]] [[Emissaries of Evil]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ralph Roberts was an inventor who had been studying the effects of nuclear radiation involving cobalt. He sought to use this as a weapon and built a cobalt suit of armor in imitation of [[Iron Man]]'s, and called himself the '''Cobalt Man'''.  He later achieved superhuman size and power due to radiation.  While on a mission with [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]]'s [[Emissaries of Evil]], he appeared to have been killed in a nuclear explosion <ref>Defenders #43</ref>, but he was later revealed to have survived.

===Iron Man imposter===
During the 2004 ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]/[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' six issue mini-series Tony Stark, (aka [[Iron Man]]), infiltrated the Thunderbolts as "Cobalt Man" to learn their intentions and agenda. Eventually, Stark revealed his true identity and tossed the Cobalt Man armor away.

===The Stamford Disaster===
Apparently, the original Cobalt Man was one of the many villains that escaped from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] prison during ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #1-3 (January - March 2005). In an appearance which was widely previewed (first in ''New Avengers: [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]'' #1; May 2006) but which was originally produced as part of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1 (July, 2006), the [[New Warriors]] located Cobalt Man hiding in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] with other escaped convicts. The New Warriors were part of a reality show and decided to take down the villains. During the ensuing conflict, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] used his powers to demolish the entire neighborhood, causing the death of hundreds of men, women and children, most of the New Warriors, and apparently Cobalt Man as well.

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Roberts wore the Cobalt Man armor to gain Iron Man-like abilities, including flight, superhuman strength (Class10--it multiplied his strength 100x) and durability, flight, recoil beams, etc. The armor (at least the second version) also had oxygen tanks and could protect its wearer from the vacuum of space.
