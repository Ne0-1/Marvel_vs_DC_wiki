==Fictional character biography==
Ralph Roberts was an inventor who had been studying the effects of [[nuclear radiation]] involving [[cobalt]]. He sought to use this as a weapon and built a cobalt suit of armor in imitation of [[Iron Man]]'s, and called himself the '''Cobalt Man'''. At the time, Ralph's younger brother Ted Roberts was dating [[Jean Grey]]. Ralph Roberts took Ted, Jean, and [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] on a tour of his lab, and when he showed Ted his armor he became destructive, and when Scott and Jean fought the Cobalt Man he buried them under rubble. As he was becoming more unstable, the [[X-Men]] fought and defeated him, and he realized that the armor was too dangerous to use.<ref>''The X-Men'' #31</ref> However, [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]] soon kidnapped him to force him to build a giant super-cobalt robot. The X-Men fought Tyrannus and rescued Roberts and returned him to the surface world.<ref>''The X-Men'' #34</ref>

He later achieved superhuman size and power due to radiation. This ends up slowly killing him; addled, he decides to show the world the dangers of nuclear power by destroying himself and the city of [[Sydney, Australia]]. In a confrontation with the Hulk, he seemingly dies, safely away from the Earth.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #174-175 (May–April 1974)</ref> While on a mission with [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]]'s [[Emissaries of Evil]], he appeared to have been killed in a [[nuclear explosion]].<ref>''Defenders'' #42-43</ref>

Some time later he was later revealed to have survived the explosion.<ref>''Hulk: Nightmerica'' #1</ref>

Apparently, the original Cobalt Man was one of the many villains that escaped from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] prison during ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1-3 (January - March 2005). In an appearance which was widely previewed (first in ''New Avengers: [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]'' #1; May 2006) but which was originally produced as part of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1 (July, 2006), the [[New Warriors]] located Cobalt Man hiding in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] with other escaped convicts. The New Warriors were part of a reality show and decided to take down the villains. During the ensuing conflict, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] used his powers to demolish the entire neighborhood, causing the death of hundreds of men, women and children, most of the New Warriors, and apparently Cobalt Man as well beginning the events of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline.<ref>''Civil War'' #1</ref>

Ralph Roberts seemingly returned from the dead in the 2007-08 ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'' mini-series, but it is revealed that this is really a [[Skrull]] impostor. When interrogated by Captain Marvel on the Skrull's [[Secret Invasion]] plans, the Cobalt Man Skrull tells Captain Marvel that he is not the real Captain Marvel.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 7) #1</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] travels to the Underworld and Cobalt Man is among the dead characters in [[Erebus]]. Due to outside forces, this section of the afterlife was chaotic and breaking down. It is clarified that Cobalt Man and the other dead had a chance of returning to life by winning at gambling games.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129 (2009)</ref>

===Iron Man impostor===
During the 2004 ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]/[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' six issue mini-series, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] infiltrated the Thunderbolts as Cobalt Man to learn their intentions and agenda. Eventually, Stark revealed his true identity and tossed the Cobalt Man armor away.<ref>''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' #1-6</ref>

===Cobalt Men===
A group of men in Cobalt Man armor attacked [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] and a group of trainee Avengers when they visited Stamford. They were all defeated by Speedball who unleashed a powerful energy blast that disabled their armor. A local police officer revealed that the group were some pro-[[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] fanatics who had fabricated copies of the Cobalt Man armor with plans to make the heroes look bad in public.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #10 (March 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Roberts wore the Cobalt Man armor to gain Iron Man-like abilities, including flight, superhuman strength (it multiplied his strength 100x) and durability, recoil beams, etc. The armor (at least the second version) also had oxygen tanks and could protect its wearer from the vacuum of space.
