'''Cobalt Man''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller  [[Werner Roth (comics)| Werner Roth]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #31 (April, 1967)
==Iron Man imposter==
During the 2004 ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]/[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' six issue mini-series Tony Stark, (aka [[Iron Man]]), infiltrated the Thunderbolts as "Cobalt Man" to find out what they were all about. Eventually, Stark revealed his true identity and tossed the Cobalt Man armor away.

==The Stamford Disaster==
Apparently, the original Cobalt Man was one of the many villains that escaped from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] prison during ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #1-3 (January - March 2005). In an appearance which was widely previewed (first in ''New Avengers: [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]'' #1; May 2006) but which was originally produced as part of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1 (July, 2006), the [[New Warriors]] located Cobalt Man hiding in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] with some other escaped convicts. During the ensuing conflict, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] used his powers to explode the entire neighborhood, causing the death of hundreds of schoolchildren, most of the New Warriors, and apparently Cobalt Man as well.
