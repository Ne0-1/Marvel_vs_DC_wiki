==Fictional character biography==
Ralph Roberts was an inventor who had been studying the effects of nuclear radiation involving cobalt. He sought to use this as a weapon and built a cobalt suit of armor in imitation of [[Iron Man]]'s, and called himself the '''Cobalt Man'''.  He later achieved superhuman size and power due to radiation.  While on a mission with [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]]'s [[Emissaries of Evil]], he appeared to have been killed in a nuclear explosion <ref>Defenders #43</ref>, but he was later revealed to have survived.

Ralph had a younger brother named Ted Roberts who used to date [[Jean Grey]]. 

===Iron Man imposter===
During the 2004 ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]/[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' six issue mini-series, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] infiltrated the Thunderbolts as Cobalt Man to learn their intentions and agenda. Eventually, Stark revealed his true identity and tossed the Cobalt Man armor away.

===The Stamford Disaster===
[[image:Cobalt_Man.jpg|thumb|left]]
Apparently, the original Cobalt Man was one of the many villains that escaped from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] prison during ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #1-3 (January - March 2005). In an appearance which was widely previewed (first in ''New Avengers: [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]'' #1; May 2006) but which was originally produced as part of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1 (July, 2006), the [[New Warriors]] located Cobalt Man hiding in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] with other escaped convicts. The New Warriors were part of a reality show and decided to take down the villains. During the ensuing conflict, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] used his powers to demolish the entire neighborhood, causing the death of hundreds of men, women and children, most of the New Warriors, and apparently Cobalt Man as well.

===Secret Invasion===
In ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2007-2008), the Cobalt Man unexpectedly returned, and fought against the apparently resurrected Captain [[Mar-vell]], but mentioned that he "seemed different". After having certain recent events, including other villains seemingly being resurrected, and having learned of the [[Secret Invasion]], Captain Marvel decides to interrogate Cobalt Man, who reveals himself to in fact be a [[Skrull]] impostor, and then accuses Mar-Vell of not being the real Captain Marvel. When it turns out that Captain Marvel was actually a Skrull named [[Captain Marvel (Khn'nr)|Khn'nr]], he turns against the Skrulls by killing the Cobalt Man Skrull.

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Roberts wore the Cobalt Man armor to gain Iron Man-like abilities, including flight, superhuman strength (Class10--it multiplied his strength 100x) and durability, recoil beams, etc. The armor (at least the second version) also had oxygen tanks and could protect its wearer from the vacuum of space.
