==Fictional character biography==
Ralph Roberts was an inventor who had been studying the effects of nuclear radiation involving cobalt. He sought to use this as a weapon and built a cobalt suit of armor in imitation of [[Iron Man]]'s, and called himself the '''Cobalt Man'''.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} He later achieved superhuman size and power due to radiation.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} While on a mission with [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]]'s [[Emissaries of Evil]], he appeared to have been killed in a nuclear explosion <ref>Defenders #43</ref>, but he was later revealed to have survived.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

Ralph had a younger brother named Ted Roberts who used to date [[Jean Grey]]. 

===Iron Man imposter===
During the 2004 ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]/[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' six issue mini-series, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] infiltrated the Thunderbolts as Cobalt Man to learn their intentions and agenda.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Eventually, Stark revealed his true identity and tossed the Cobalt Man armor away.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===The Stamford Disaster===
[[image:Cobalt Man.jpg|thumb|left]]
Apparently, the original Cobalt Man was one of the many villains that escaped from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] prison during ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #1-3 (January - March 2005). In an appearance which was widely previewed (first in ''New Avengers: [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]'' #1; May 2006) but which was originally produced as part of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1 (July, 2006), the [[New Warriors]] located Cobalt Man hiding in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] with other escaped convicts. The New Warriors were part of a reality show and decided to take down the villains. During the ensuing conflict, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] used his powers to demolish the entire neighborhood, causing the death of hundreds of men, women and children, most of the New Warriors, and apparently Cobalt Man as well.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===Dark Reign===
When [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] travels to the Underworld, Cobalt Man is among the dead characters in Erebus.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Roberts wore the Cobalt Man armor to gain Iron Man-like abilities, including flight, superhuman strength (Class10—it multiplied his strength 100x) and durability, recoil beams, etc. The armor (at least the second version) also had oxygen tanks and could protect its wearer from the vacuum of space.
