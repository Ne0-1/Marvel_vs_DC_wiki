In the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] of the [[1940s]], [[Will Eisner]] created a [[superhero]] version of [[Uncle Sam]] for [[Quality Comics]].

In that version, '''Uncle Sam''' was a mystical being who was the spirit of a slain patriotic soldier of the [[American Revolutionary War]], but now appeared in the world whenever his country needed him. The character was used for a few years from [[1940]] to [[1943]] when it was discontinued. 

[[DC Comics]] acquired the character as part of its acquisition of the Quality characters and he occasionally appeared as a supporting character, leader of the '''[[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]'''. 

His origin was [[retcon|rewritten]] somewhat in ''[[The Spectre]]'', where he was the third Uncle Sam, the first having been created in 1870, when the Spirit of America resurrected a political cartoonist who had been killed by [[Boss Tweed]], and the second having fought in [[World War I]]. The new origin also states that, before this the Spirit of America had taken human form as the [[Minutemen|Minuteman]], Brother Jonathan and, during the [[American Civil War]], had been split in two as [[Johnny Reb]] and [[Billy Yank]]. It was also stated he had disappeared at the end of [[World War II]], invalidating any previous appearances since then (although most of them had already been invalidated by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]).

In ''The Spectre'' the Spirit was resurrected in a new form, called the '''Patriot''', but has since reverted to Uncle Sam.

In an alternate DC universe appearing in ''Superman/Batman'', Uncle Sam becomes [[Green Lantern]] when [[Wonder Woman]] gives him [[Abin Sur]]'s ring, as [[Hal Jordan]] was dead in this reality and wasn't able to take the power ring. 

{{Spoiler}}

Uncle Sam was apparently killed by [[Sinestro]] in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' # 1, after the Freedom Fighters were sent to investigate a warehouse where the [[Secret Society of Supervillains|Society]] had been spotted. However, in #2 it was revealed that whilst the bodies of several Freedom Fighters had been strung up on the [[Washington Monument]], Uncle Sam's was missing.

==Vertigo==

In 1998, DC Comics published a two issue prestige format comicbook called ''Uncle Sam'', which has since been collected into a [[trade paperback]]. This is not set in the [[DC Universe]], however, and features a very different version of the character. This Uncle Sam is a ragged old man who is tormented by visions of historical episodes and modern aspects of the United States at its worst. The bloody crushing of [[Shays' Rebellion]] is considered a particularly disillusioning moment for the character which suggested for him that the USA's professed ideals have never been seriously respected since the nation's beginning. It was published under DC's line of Adult comics called [[Vertigo]], and was written by [[Steve Darnell]] with painted artwork by [[Alex Ross]].
