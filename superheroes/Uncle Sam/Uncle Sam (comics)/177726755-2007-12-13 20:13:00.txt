==Uncle Sam in Quality Comics==

Uncle Sam first appeared in ''[[National Comics (series)|National Comics]]'' #1 ([[July]], [[1940]]), which was published by [[Quality Comics]] during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].  He was depicted as a mystical being who was originally the spirit of a slain patriotic soldier from the [[American Revolutionary War]], and who now appears in the world whenever his country needs him. The character was used for a few years from 1940 to [[1944]], briefly receiving its own series, ''Uncle Sam Quarterly''.
==Uncle Sam in DC Comics==
[[DC Comics]] acquired the character as part of its acquisition of the Quality characters in the 1950s, and he was used as a supporting character in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' in the 1970s. This established Uncle Sam as the leader of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], a team of former Quality characters that briefly received its own title. This team was initially based on a parallel world called Earth-X, where [[World War II]] had lasted into the 70s.

Uncle Sam's origin was [[retcon|rewritten]] somewhat in ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'', where Uncle Sam is described as a spiritual entity created through an occult ritual by the [[Founding Fathers]]. This "Spirit of America" was initially bound to a powerful talisman and would take physical form by merging with a dying patriot. The new origin states that the Spirit of America had taken human form as the [[Minute-Man]] during the Revolutionary War, [[Brother Jonathan]] in later conflicts and, during the [[American Civil War]], had been split in two as [[Johnny Reb]] and [[Billy Yank]]. 

The Spirit first assumed its now familiar Uncle Sam incarnation in [[1870]], when it resurrected a political [[cartoonist]] who had been killed by [[Boss Tweed]]. The second host of Uncle Sam fought in [[World War I]]. A third (the character's Golden Age incarnation) was a superhero during World War II but vanished at the end of the war, erasing any subsequent appearances from the fictional history of the [[DC Universe]] (although most of them had already been erased by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]).  In ''The Spectre'' the Spirit is resurrected in a new costumed form called the '''Patriot''', but later reverts to Uncle Sam in a ''[[Superman]]'' issue.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1, the Freedom Fighters are attacked by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Uncle Sam is shown easily standing up to [[Black Adam]], even knocking him away with one punch. Three of the Freedom Fighters, [[Human Bomb]], [[Phantom Lady]] and [[Black Condor]] are killed in the battle. Uncle Sam himself seemingly dies at the hands of [[Sinestro]]. The other team members are brutally injured but survive. Uncle Sam is seen face down in rainwater.

However, when the dead heroes are found strung up on the [[Washington Monument]] in ''Infinite Crisis'' #2, Uncle Sam is missing.

The character's latest incarnation appeared in the first issue of ''[[Freedom Fighters (comics)#Current team|Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters]]'', and spends the first few issues of this new series attempting to form a new version of the Freedom Fighters. This new Uncle Sam emerges from the [[Mississippi River]] at the same time as [[Father Time (DC Comics)|Father Time]] is elsewhere planning the future of [[List of government agencies in comics#S.H.A.D.E.|S.H.A.D.E.]] with new incarnations of the Freedom Fighters members. Uncle Sam, disturbed by the deadly force used by the new versions of [[Phantom Lady]], [[The Human Bomb]], [[Doll Man#Lester Colt|Doll Man]] and others, successfully recruits these [[metahumans]] into his new Freedom Fighters team, which results in Father Time ordering his remaining S.H.A.D.E. personnel to pursue and kill Uncle Sam and his team. Although Uncle Sam is shown to be against killing, particularly rebuking Doll Man for murdering a crime lord in front of the man's young grandson (in issue #1), Uncle Sam is not against using using deadly force when necessary.

==Powers and abilities==
Uncle Sam has demonstrated various powers, including super strength, invulnerability, the ability to alter his size, enhanced speed, and some degree of omniscience.  He is also shown to be able to transport himself and others to a pocket of an alternate dimension called The Heartland; he does this to Doll Man in issue #2 of Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters.  His power is said to be in direct proportion of the belief people have in the idea of America, therefore his powers are presumably malleable to some degree.  In Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters, Father Time states that tests indicate Sam is not a human, meta-, or magical being, and the results on what he is are inconclusive.  In issue #3 of Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters, he states that he does not have the ability to fly.

== Alternate versions ==
=== Vertigo Comics ===
In [[1998]], DC published under its adult [[imprint]] [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] a two-issue prestige format comic simply titled ''Uncle Sam'', which was written by [[Steve Darnall]] with painted artwork by [[Alex Ross]].  The book is not set in the standard [[DC Universe]]{{Fact|date=August 2007}}, and depicts Uncle Sam as a ragged old man who is tormented by visions of historical episodes and modern aspects of the United States at its worst.  The bloody crushing of [[Shays' Rebellion]] is considered a particularly disillusioning moment for the character, which suggested for him that the professed ideals of the United States have never been seriously respected.  Uncle Sam is forced to battle a dark doppelganger of himself based on corruption, deceit and oppression, with the identity of the United States at stake.  

''Uncle Sam'' was a top vote-getter for the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' Fan Awards for Favorite Limited Series, Favorite Original Graphic Novel, and Favorite Story for 1998, and the collected edition was a top vote-getter for their Favorite Reprint Graphic Album Award for [[1999]].

=== ''Superman/Batman'' ===
In an alternate DC timeline appearing in ''Superman/Batman'', where Superman and Batman have been raised by [[Cosmic King]], [[Lightning Lord]] and [[Saturn Queen]], the three original members of the [[Legion of Super-Villains]], and have turned the Earth into a totalitarian state, Uncle Sam becomes [[Green Lantern]] when [[Wonder Woman]] gives him [[Abin Sur]]'s ring, as [[Hal Jordan]] is dead in this reality and so isn't able to take the power ring.

=== ''52'' ===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-10". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-X, including the Quality characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but a character visually similar to Uncle Sam appears.<ref>

Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]] and the fact that a [[Nazi]] version of [[Superman]] is depicted in the scene, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-X.<ref>{{cite web
