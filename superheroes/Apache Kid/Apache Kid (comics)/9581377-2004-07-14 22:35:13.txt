'''Apache Kid''' was the name of a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] and [[gunslinger]] in the [[Old West]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The Apache Kid was a [[Caucasian]] named Alan Krandal who was raised by the [[Apache]]s after being [[orphan]]ed.  He fought against outlaws, both white and [[Native American]], and generally protected the peoples of both groups.  Unlike many other Western comics of the [[1950s]], ''Apache Kid'' generally presented the indigenous Americans in the same light as the whites, and made a distinction between the various tribes.  The Apache Kid first appeared in ''Two-Gun Western'' volume 1 #5 ([[1950]]), and received his own series shortly thereafter.  ''Apache Kid'' was retitled to ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' as of #20.
