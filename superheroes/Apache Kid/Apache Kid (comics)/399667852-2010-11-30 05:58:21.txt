'''The Apache Kid''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Old West]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], mostly seen in stories from Marvel's 1950s precursor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].  This character was named after, but is totally unrelated to, the real-life [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] man known as [[The Apache Kid (Haskay-bay-nay-natyl)]].

==Publication history==
The Apache Kid debuted as the cover feature, drawn by a young [[John Buscema]], of ''Two-Gun Western'' #5 (Nov. 1950). He received his own title the following month, premiering as ''The Apache Kid''&nbsp; #53 (picking up the numbering from ''Reno Browne, Hollywood's Greatest Cowgirl'') and then running as ''Apache Kid''&nbsp; #2-19. Stories also ran in the omnibus titles ''Two-Gun Western''&nbsp; #5-9 and ''Wild Western''&nbsp; #15-22. After that initial Buscema story and at least two by [[Joe Maneely]] (who would also do many of the later covers), the bulk of the book's run would be [[penciler|penciled]] and [[inker|inked]] by future [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] ''[[X-Men]]'' artist [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]].

After ''The Apache Kid'' ended with #19 (April 1956), its numbering continued as the [[anthology]] series ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'', where the character did not appear. 

Apache Kid reprints, however, did appear in Marvel's 1970s omnibus series also titled ''[[Western Gunfighters]]''. The Kid shared its pages with new [[Phantom Rider|Ghost Rider]] (also known as [[Phantom Rider]]) stories, as well as anthological and Western-hero reprints of a changing lineup that included Atlas' [[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]] (here renamed '''Black Mask'''), the [[Western Kid]], [[Wyatt Earp (Marvel Comics)|Wyatt Earp]], and later [[Kid Colt]]. Apache Kid reprints ran from&nbsp; #2-33, the final issue (Oct. 1970 - Nov. 1975).

The character returned in ''[[Apache Skies]]'' (2002), a four-issue [[miniseries]] starring the [[Rawhide Kid]] and two persons called the Apache Kid: Dazii Aloysius Kare, and his wife, Rosa. This  was a sequel to the miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' (2000), which specifically [[retconned]] that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely [[dime novel]] fictions of the characters' actual lives.

Unrelated characters called the Apache Kid appeared in [[Fox Comics]]' ''Western Outlaws''&nbsp; #21 (May 1949), and Youthful Comics' ''Indian Fighter''&nbsp; #5 (Jan. 1952).

==Fictional character biography==
[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] child Alan Krandal was raised by [[Apache]] chief Red Hawk and his wife after being [[orphan]]ed. When grown, he took on a "civilian" identity as cowboy Aloysius Kare, changing to his warpaint outfit to fight outlaws both white and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and generally  protect both groups of people. Captain Bill Gregory of the nearby fort was his "white brother" who also respected the elder Red Hawk's counsel. Unlike many other [[Western (genre)|Western]] comics of the 1950s, ''Apache Kid'' generally presented the indigenous Americans in the same light as Caucasians, and made distinctions among the various tribes.
