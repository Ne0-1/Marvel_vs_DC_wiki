'''Zarrko, the Tomorrow Man''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], most commonly associated with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #86 (November, [[1962]]). Zarrko is an evil scientist from the future, who built a [[Time travel|time machine]] to escape from his peaceful 23rd century and visit more primitive periods, like USA in the [[1960s]], where nuclear weapons could be stolen easily.

{{spoiler}}
In one of the last story arcs of Thor v2 Zarrko's plot was revealed as a plan to save humanity. In his future, in fact, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], separated from his human self, Jake Olson, had lost his ability to understand humanity, becoming more and more oppressive and imposing his reign as the only just thing to do. In the future, knew Zarrko, Thor was going to be a tyrant, so he had to travel into time and stop him before the Odin Force made him invicibile and near-omnipotent.
When the Governments of Earth launched a massive assault on Asgard, Zarrko was seen trying to escape with his [[Time travel|time machine]], only to be stopped by Thialfi.
His attempted [[time travel]] was instrumental for Thor to create for him a new future in which he would never be the tyrant he was supposed to be without his human self.
