'''Jor-El''' is a [[fictional character]] that appeared in the [[Superman]] comics published by [[DC Comics]]. He is the biological father of Superman, and the husband of [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara]] ([[nee]] [[Lara Lor-Van]]).

Jor-El was a highly respected scientist on the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction...a fate which he foresaw, but was unable to convince his colleagues of in time to save their race. Jor-El was, however, able to save his infant son [[Kal-El]], sending him in a homemade rocket ship to the planet [[Earth]] just moments before Krypton's destruction.

After constructing his [[Fortress of Solitude]], Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a [[globe]] of Krypton.

==History==
Jor-El was first referred to in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 in 1938, but made his first full-fledged appearance in the Superman [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] in 1939, where his name was spelled as "Jor-L"; his name first appeared as being spelled "Jor-El" in a 1942 Superman novel.

A 1948 retelling of Superman's origin story first delved into detail about Jor-El, though his formal and more familiar [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades, with a definitive summarization in the 1979 miniseries ''The World of Krypton'' (not to be confused with the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late 1980s comic special of the same name).

As it was summarized in this miniseries (and in various other Silver Age stories), Jor-El was Krypton's leading scientific genius, having been the inventor of, among things, the "Jor-El" (a [[hovercar]]) and the discoverer of the [[Phantom Zone]] (and the inventor of the Phantom Zone projector). He lived in Krypton's major city of [[Kryptonopolis]].

Jor-El had a brother that lived in [[Argo City]] named Zor-El, who eventually became the father of Kara Zor-El, alias [[Supergirl]].

Jor-El eventually met and married Lara Lor-Van, an [[astronaut]] in Krypton's fledgling space program (which was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons), and the two soon had an infant son, Kal-El.

When Krypton began experiencing a series of [[earthquakes]], Jor-El investigated, and soon discovered that Krypton's core was greatly unstable, and would eventually explode, taking the entire planet and its populace with it. Jor-El tried to convince the members of Krypton's ruling body, the Science Council, of this impending disaster, and urged re-establishing Krypton's space program so giant spacecrafts could be built to carry the populace to another habitable world. However, the Council was dismissive of Jor-El's findings, and refused to comply with his plan. 

Frustrated, Jor-El continued his work on space travel on his own, hoping to build a spacecraft to save his own family; this included launching several smaller test rockets (one of which included the El family [[dog]], [[Krypto]]). However, as time ran short, Jor-El soon found that he would only have enough time to build a spacecraft to save his son Kal-El. Jor-El decided to aim for sending Kal to Earth, realizing he would gain superpowers under Earth's yellow [[sun]] and lower [[gravity]]. As Krypton finally went through its final destructive stages, Jor-El and Lara placed their son in a rocket, and launched him toward Earth, before perishing along with nearly the rest of the planet's population.

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''The Man of Steel'' rewrote Superman's origins, details about Jor-El's background and character were changed. Under Byrne's version, Jor-El inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Jor-El was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing emotions toward his wife Lara, and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. Another change in this version was Jor-El genetically altering his son's [[fetus]] (gestating in a "birthing matrix") to allow him to leave Krypton (in this version of the mythos, Kryptonians were genetically "bonded" to the planet itself, not allowing them to leave), and merely attaching a warp engine to the matrix instead of constructing a ship wholesale.

In the 2004 Superman miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Jor-El, along with Krypton and Lara, was more-or-less reverted back to his Silver Age versions, though with updated touches (such as Lara contributing equally to the effort of sending Kal-El to Earth).

In his youth, Jor-El met with Jack Knight and Mikaal Tomas, two of the [[Starman]] incarnations, who were accidentally sent 70 years back from his present time. It was in this way Jor-El learned of Earth's existence. Jor-El helped Jack and Mikaal escape from his overbearing father.

Jor-El has appeared (usually briefly) in various screen adaptations of the Superman story. 
* Jor-El was portrayed by [[Nelson Leigh]] in the 1948 ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' movie serial.
* Jor-El was portrayed (uncredited on-screen) by [[Robert Rockwell]] in the first episode of the 1952 ''[[The Adventures of Superman]]'' television series.
* [[Marlon Brando]] played Jor-El in the 1978 [[Superman: The Movie|''Superman'' movie]] and the late actor will reprise this role in  2006's ''[[Superman Returns]]'', through the harvesting of archived video footage and sound clips.
* Jor-El was played by [[George Lazenby]] in the late 1980s ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' television series.
* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] played Jor-El in ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.
* [[Christopher McDonald]] played Jor-El in the 1990s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''
* [[Terence Stamp]] (who played the evil [[General Zod]] in [[Christopher Reeve]]'s first two Superman movies) provides the voice of Jor-El in the 2000s television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.

Media portrayals of Jor-El tend to vary greatly in how he's presented, often diverging from the original source material.

For example, in the 1978 ''[[Superman: The Movie|Superman]]'' movie, Jor-El is shown as wearing the Superman "S"-shield symbol as the family crest of the House of El, while in the traditional comics, it was a creation of [[Martha Kent|Ma]] and [[Jonathan Kent|Pa Kent]] for Superman's costume. In 2004's ''Superman: Birthright'', it was established that the "S"-shield symbol is Kryptonian in origin, and was a symbol of hope to Kryptonians. 

As another example, in the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' [[television]] series, [[Superman|Clark Kent]] speculates that he was sent to [[Earth]] by Jor-El not to be saved from the destruction of Krypton, but instead to conquer Earth; a great divergence from any other version of Jor-El, who is usually shown as having benevolent reasons for sending Kal-El to Earth. This was proven wrong at the end of the fourth season, continuing into the fifth, when Jor-El's words are revealed to actually mean that he wanted to prepare Clark for the coming meteor shower and the arrival of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], which is what Jor-El meant by "your destiny."

In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] text novel ''Superman: Last Son of Krypton'', Jor-El is shown as having contacted a scientist on Earth ([[Albert Einstein]], in this story) to arrange for him to find a suitable Earth family to find Kal-El's rocket and adopt him.
