'''Jor-El''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]]  in the {{DC Universe}}. Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], he first appeared in ''Action Comics'' #1 as [[Superman]]'s biological father.

Jor-El is a [[Kryptonian]], and the husband of [[Lara (comics)|Lara]]. He was a [[scientist]] on the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] before its destruction. Jor-El foresaw the planet's fate, but was unable to convince his colleagues in time to save their race after his appeals. He was able to save his infant son, Kal-El (Superman), sending him in a homemade rocket ship to Earth just moments before Krypton's demise. After constructing his [[Fortress of Solitude]], Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a [[globe]] of Krypton.

Jor-El is usually portrayed as closely resembling the later appearance of Kal-El as the adult Superman. In the 2006 [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|Richard Donner cut of ''Superman II'']] (actor [[Marlon Brando]] did not appear in the original [[1980 in film|1980]] release of the [[Superman II|film]]), [[Lex Luthor]] notes a resemblance between Jor-El and Superman.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden and Silver Age versions===
Jor-El was first referred to indirectly in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 in 1938, which only mentioned a scientist who sends his son to Earth. He made his first full-fledged appearance in the ''Superman'' [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] in 1939, where his name was spelled as "'''Jor-L'''." His name first appeared as being spelled "Jor-el" in the 1942 ''Superman'' novel ''The Adventures of Superman'' written by [[George Lowther (writer)|George Lowther]]; later comics would capitalize the 'E' in 'El.' After the introduction of [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the 1960s, it was established that the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] version of [[Superman]]'s father was named "Jor-L" and lived on the Krypton of the [[Earth-Two]] universe, while "Jor-El" was the father of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] version of Superman and lived on the Krypton of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]] [[fictional universe|universe]].

A 1948 retelling of Superman's [[origin story]] first delved into detail about Jor-El, though his formal and more familiar Silver Age aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades, with a definitive summarization in the [[1979 in comics|1979]] miniseries ''The World of Krypton'' (not to be confused with the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late-[[1980s in comics|1980s]] comic miniseries of the same name).

====His accomplishments====
As it was summarized in this miniseries (and in various other [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] stories), Jor-El was Krypton's leading scientific genius, having invented, among other devices, the "Jor-El," a [[hovercar]], and having discovered a parallel plane of existence which he called the [[Phantom Zone]] and invented a device by which it could be entered, which he called the Phantom Zone Projector. He lived in Krypton's major city of [[Kryptonopolis]].

Even before Jor-El's birth, the El family was renowned across Krypton for its various contributions to Kryptonian society. Ancestors of Jor-El included: Val-El, a famous [[exploration|explorer]]; Sul-El, the inventor of Krypton's first [[telescope]]; Tala-El, the author of Krypton's first planetary [[constitution]]; Hatu-El, the inventor of Krypton's first [[electromagnet]] and electric motor; and Gam-El, the father of modern Kryptonian [[architecture]].

====Family life====
Jor-El had two brothers: [[Zor-El]], who lived in [[Argo City]] and eventually became the father of Kara Zor-El, alias [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and an identical [[twin]] brother named [[Nim-El]], who lived in [[Kandor]]. In several stories, Jor-El's father was established as Jor-El I, and his mother as Nimda ([[Née|nee]] An-Dor). Jor-El eventually met and married [[Lara (comics)|Lara, daughter of Lor-Van]], a young [[astronaut]] in Krypton's fledgling space program (which was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons), and the two had an infant son, [[Kal-El]]. In [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s novel ''The Last Days Of Krypton'', Jor-El has only one brother, Zor-El, who is two years his junior, and their parents are Yar-El (a revolutionary scientist slowly dying of what is known as the Forgetting Disease) and Charys (a renowned psychologist who continues to study and attempt to reach her beloved husband). His wife Lara Lor-Van is a historian and, like her parents Ora and Lor-Van, an accomplished artist.

====Jor-El as a male Cassandra====
When [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] began experiencing a series of [[earthquake]]s, Jor-El investigated. He soon discovered, to his horror, that Krypton's core was extremely unstable and indeed radioactive, and worse, that it would eventually reach [[critical mass]] and explode, taking the entire planet and its populace with it. Jor-El tried to convince the members of Krypton's ruling body, the Science Council, of this impending disaster, and urged reestablishing Krypton's space program so giant spacecrafts could be built to carry the populace to another habitable world. However, the Council was dismissive of Jor-El's findings and refused to comply with his plan.

Frustrated, Jor-El continued his work on space travel on his own, hoping to build a spacecraft to save his own family. This work included launching several smaller test rockets; one of these rockets included the family [[dog]], who responded to the name of [[Krypto (comics)|Krypto]]. However, as time ran short, Jor-El soon found that he would only have enough time to build a spacecraft to save his son [[Superman|Kal-El]]. He decided to send Kal-El to Earth, realizing he would gain superhuman powers under Earth's more intense yellow [[sun]] and lower [[gravitation|gravity]]. As Krypton finally went through its final destructive stages, Jor-El and Lara placed their son in the rocket and launched him toward Earth, before they themselves were killed along with almost all the rest of the planet's population.

===Modern versions===
After the [[1980s in comics#1985|1985]]-[[1980s in comics#1986|1986]] [[limited series|miniseries]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' rewrote [[Superman]]'s origins, details about Jor-El's background and character were changed. In Byrne's version, Jor-El inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Indeed, Jor-El himself was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing [[emotion]]s toward his mate [[Lara (comics)|Lara]], and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. Another change in this version was Jor-El genetically altering his son's [[fetus]] (gestating in a "birthing matrix") to allow him to leave Krypton (in this version of the mythos, Kryptonians were genetically "bonded" to the planet itself, not allowing them to leave), and merely attaching a warp engine to the matrix instead of constructing a ship wholesale. The result was that when the birthing matrix opened on Earth, [[Superman|Kal-El]] was "born" on that planet.

In the [[1990s in comics|1990s]] series ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'', it was revealed that, in his youth, Jor-El met a time-traveling Jack Knight and Mikaal Tomas, two individuals who both bore at various points the "Starman" mantle. Knight and Tomas had been accidentally sent 70 years back in time and hurled across space. It was in this way that Jor-El first learned of Earth's existence; in return, Jor-El helped Knight and Tomas escape from his overbearing father, Seyg-El.

In the [[2004 in comics|2004]] miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Jor-El, along with Krypton and Lara, was, more or less, reinstated to his [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] versions, though with such updated touches as Lara contributing equally to the effort of sending Kal-El, once again an infant while on Krypton, to Earth. In this version, Jor-El discovers Earth moments before launching his son's spacecraft. Also, the conclusion of the miniseries has the adult Superman, on Earth, seeing his parents through [[Lex Luthor]]'s time-space communicator, and on Krypton, seconds before its destruction, Jor-El and Lara see their son alive and well on Earth and know that their efforts were successful. As with Byrne's conflicting view of Krypton, the ''Birthright'' origins of Jor-El, Krypton, and Lex Luthor have recently been [[retroactive continuity|retconned]], and, following ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', they are no longer valid in comics [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

However, a more recent storyline co-written by [[Geoff Johns]] and ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' director [[Richard Donner]] presented yet another version of Jor-El and Krypton which reintroduced [[General Zod]] and the [[Phantom Zone]] criminals into mainstream continuity. With art by [[Adam Kubert]], Jor-El is depicted for the first time with a [[beard]] and the design of Kryptonian society is distinct yet again from ''Birthright'' and ''Man of Steel'', incorporating elements of Donner's work on the first two [[Christopher Reeve]] films, in particular the notion of Krypton's Council threatening Jor-El with harsh penalty of exile to the very Phantom Zone he himself had discovered if he were to make public his predictions of their planet's imminent doom or otherwise attempt to "create a climate of panic."

Jor-El is shown here to have been mentored by friend and noted scientist [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], who corroborated Jor-El's findings regarding Krypton's impending destruction, when the two were arrested and brought to trial before the Council by Zod and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]. When Non defies the Council's dire prohibitions and elects to spread the word of the coming apocalypse, he is abducted by Council agents and apparently [[lobotomy|lobotomized]], thus explaining the character's mute simple-mindedness, brutality, and destructiveness in line with [[Jack O'Halloran]]'s performance as Non in the first two films. Appalled, Zod and Ursa propose to Jor-El that they band together and overthrow the Council, but Jor-El will have none of it. When their murderous insurrection fails, the Council forces Jor-El to exile them to the Phantom Zone and never speak of his findings again, lest he face the same fate. For this perceived betrayal, Zod declares that he will escape and conquer Krypton (confident that Jor-El will actually discover some way to save the planet) and force the scientist and his son to kneel before him one day (this echoes the statement [[Terence Stamp]] made in both ''Superman'' movies Donner directed: "You will bow down before me, Jor-El! I swear it! No matter that it takes an eternity, ''you WILL bow down before me! Both you, and then one day, '''YOUR HEIRS!!!"''''')

Having been rebuilt via a Kryptonian crystal during the ''[[One Year Later]]'' story arc, the current version of the [[Fortress of Solitude]], which was also designed to essentially be visually identical to the Donner and [[Bryan Singer]] films, now contains an advanced interactive "recording" of Jor-El which, although visually dissimilar to [[Marlon Brando]], is otherwise identical in function to that featured in ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #50, it is revealed that, years ago, Jor-El sent a probe to Earth that made contact with [[Thomas Wayne]] while he was on a drive with a pregnant [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], the probe [[holography|holographically]] transmitting Thomas' consciousness to Krypton so that Jor-El could better learn what kind of world Earth was to help him decide which of many possible candidates he should send his son to. Thomas tells Jor-El that the people of Earth aren't perfect, but are essentially a good and kind race, who would raise the child right, convincing Jor-El to send Kal-El there.  Thomas recorded his encounter in a diary, which was discovered by Bruce in the present day.

==In other media==
Jor-El has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the [[Superman]] story. Media portrayals of Jor-El tend to vary greatly in how he's presented, often diverging from the original source material.

===Film===
====Superman serial====
Jor-El was portrayed by [[Nelson Leigh]] in the 1948 ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' movie serial.

====Superman film series====
=====''Superman''=====
[[Image:Jorel yahoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marlon Brando as Jor-El, with Kal-El played by Lee Quigley.<ref>Superman: The Movie Magazine</ref>]]
[[Marlon Brando]] played Jor-El in the 1978 [[Superman (film)|''Superman'' film]], which [[Alexander Salkind]], his son [[Ilya Salkind]], and their business partner [[Pierre Spengler]] produced and which [[Richard Donner]] directed. In the movie, Jor-El is shown wearing the [[Superman]] "S"-shield symbol as the family crest of the House of El, resembling an Earth "S" by coincidence. The name "Superman" is later coined by [[Lois Lane]] due to the resemblance. In tandem, other Kryptonians are seen wearing their own individualized family crests. Originally thought up by Brando himself and suggested on-set, this origin of the famous Superman symbol has been used in many stories since. In the current comics, however, the shield is the Kryptonian symbol for "hope," and not only is it worn by Jor-El in a similar manner to Brando of the first feature film, but it adorns all manner of Kryptonian flags, clothing, spaceships, and equipment.

When the teenage [[Clark Kent]] finds the green crystal his birth father placed in his ship, it leads him to the [[North Pole]], where the green crystal creates the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and brings Clark into contact with an interactive hologram of Jor-El, who instructs his son on how to use his powers and informs him that the people of Earth "can be a great people, Kal-El, if they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all...their capacity for good...I have sent them you, my only son." Later, Jor-El is shown advising Superman on why he must maintain his secret identity to protect himself and his loved ones.

=====''Superman II''=====
[[Marlon Brando]] filmed additional footage for the sequel, ''[[Superman II]],'' before differences behind the scenes caused his footage to end up on the cutting room floor. It has been restored for the 2006 revised version, ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]''. In the ''Richard Donner Cut'', Jor-El appears again as in the first as a person to guide and inform [[Superman|Kal-El]]. Jor-El's historical crystals reveal to [[Lex Luthor]] the existence of the three [[Phantom Zone]] criminals [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], which makes Luthor realize just who and what they are (and that it was Superman who caused their release).

Jor-El is asked by  Clark if he can live a life as a human with [[Lois Lane]]. Jor-El tries to persuade Clark not to wish so, but Clark is firm with his will. Jor-El then reveals the crystal chamber with the rays of Krypton's red sun which will make Clark human forever. Later, Clark returns to find all the crystals and information regarding Krypton destroyed, but finds the original crystal and is able to bring back Jor-El. Jor-El sacrifices his remaining life-force to restore his son's powers so that Superman can save Earth from Zod. Superman later destroys the Fortress after it has been breached by Luthor and the Phantom Zone criminals, but then goes back in time, where it remains normal.

=====''Superman Returns''=====
In [[2006]], two years after Brando died, he "reprised" the role of Jor-El in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' through the harvesting of archived video footage and sound clip outtakes. In the film, [[Lex Luthor]], having retained vague memories of the place, returns to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] during [[Superman]]'s absence to learn the power of the crystals. After stealing them, he uses one in a [[kryptonite]] tube, to create a new continent that threatens to destroy [[North America]]. Superman manages to throw the "New Krypton" island out of the atmosphere and into space.

===Live-action television===
====''Adventures of Superman''====
Jor-El was played by [[Robert Rockwell]], who went uncredited on-screen, in "Superman On Earth," the first episode of the 1952 [[television program|television series]] ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''.

====''Superboy''====
Jor-El was "played" by [[George Lazenby]], who was actually playing the role of an alien disguised as Jor-El, in the late 1980s [[television program|television series]] ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]],'' which [[Alexander Salkind]] and his son [[Ilya Salkind]] produced for first-run syndication.

====''Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman''====
[[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] played Jor-El in the episode "[[List of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman episodes#Foundling|Foundling]]." From a small Kryptonian globe in the spacecraft that carried him to Earth, [[Clark Kent]] begins to see holographic messages from his biological father. Jor-El details [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]'s destruction and how he saved his son by sending him to Earth in a small experimental spaceship. Jor-El says that there is an old Kryptonian saying: "On a long road, take small steps."

François Giroday played Jor-El in the episode "[[List of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman episodes#Big Girls Don't Fly|Big Girls Don't Fly]]," where Clark learns that he was married, at birth, to Zara, which was apparently a common ritual on Krypton prior to its destruction.

====''Smallville''====

[[Image:JulianSandsJorEL.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Julian Sands as Jor-El, on episode "Kandor."]]
[[Terrence Stamp]] has voiced the disembodied spirit of Jor-El, Clark’s biological father, in 16 episodes from season two to season seven. Jor-El first appears to Clark as a voice emanating from the spaceship that brought Clark to Earth, informing him that it is time to leave Smallville and fulfill his destiny – a destiny that Clark believes is to conquer the world. Clark does not want to leave Smallville, so he destroys his spaceship, but this triggers a shockwave that causes Martha Kent to suffer a miscarriage, prompting Clark to flee Smallville in shame.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Exodus|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & Greg Beeman (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2003-05-20|season=2|number=23}}</ref>  Three months after Clark fled Smallville, Jor-El and Jonathan make a deal.

With the three stones united, Clark uses them to form the Fortress of Solitude, where Jor-El informs him that he needs to begin his training in order to fulfill his destiny. That training is interrupted by two Kryptonian disciples of Zod—a criminal from Krypton, who is stuck in the Phantom Zone—who proceed to destroy Smallville looking for Clark. As a consequence when Clark does not return, Jor-El strips him of his powers.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Arrival|series=Smallville|credits=Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer (writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2005-09-29|season=5|number=1}}</ref> When Clark is killed in his mortal body, Jor-El resurrects Clark, with his powers, but informs his son that someone he loves will have to take his place in death;<ref name="Hidden ep">{{cite episode|title=Hidden|series=Smallville|credits=Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson (writers) & Whitney Ransick (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2005-10-13|season=5|number=3}}</ref> that person turns out to be Jonathan.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Reckoning|series=Smallville|credits=Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson (writers) & Greg Beeman (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2006-01-26|season=5|number=12}}</ref> In season seven, Jor-El warns Clark about the existence of his cousin Kara, the daughter of Jor-El’s brother Zor-El.

Jor-El helps Clark save Chloe from Brainiac and also warns Clark about [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], General Zod's son, and also says that he will help him fight the monster. Clark thanks Jor-El and leaves. Just as Clark leaves, Brainiac emerges from hiding and kills Jor-El and takes over the fortress and saying that Doomsday is coming. In Season 9, Episode "Savior", Clark managed to fix the connection with Jor-El and began his training. He trained for 3 weeks before whilst on duty in Metropolis he found Lois on a monorail train that he saved. When he returned to his training, Lois kept clouding his judgment and when Clark asked why he couldn't fly yet, Jor-El told him that something or somebody is holding him back and to fully embrace his Kryptonian side, he must leave his human life behind fully. In "Echo", Jor-El gives Clark temporary telepathy as part of his trials. In "Metallo", during an investigation of Kryptonian sightings on Earth following the defeat of [[Metallo]] at the hands of [[Superman]], Tess found Jor-El, in the epicenter of a burnt crest of the House of El. In "Roulette", Jor-El tells Clark about Alia's origins and informs him that more Kryptonians may have come to earth. 

Terence Stamp's name was deliberately kept out of the opening credits in order to keep the secret that he was voicing Jor-El. Stamp originally portrayed [[General Zod]] in the first two [[Superman (film series)|''Superman'' films]], starring Christopher Reeve.<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 2 Companion) pp. 98–101</ref> 

Apart from Welling's portrayal of the character, Jor-El himself is never actually seen on-screen, with the exception of a glimpse during a flashback scene in the episode "[[wikia:Smallville:Memoria|Memoria]].".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Memoria|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred
 Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & Miles Millar (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2004-04-28|season=3|number=19}}</ref> This was until season 9 episode 7 where Jor-El played by [[Julian Sands]] was discovered to be released from the same orb as the restored General Zod as a younger man. Twenty years ago, Jor-El and Zod were friends, and they convinced Krypton's council that if their planet would be any catastrophe as according to Rao's [[prophecy]], their race would live on as clones of themselves would survive on Earth, within the orb which has his, Zod, and Kandorians' DNA.  In this episode Jor-El, as a clone, started by visiting the Kent farm where he had been when he was younger, although having no memory of his son's existence as his DNA was extracted a few years before Kal-El was born. Here he talked to Chloe Sullivan about what he missed in the past on Krypton and its destruction, and learned of Kal-El's existences. Jor-El was then kidnapped by Tess who tried to hide him from Zod. This did not work and Zod captured Jor-El to find out why he had powers and the rest of the Kandorians did not. Jor-El was then killed by Zod and his men because he was not the one with the powers, it was his son Kal-El as Zod soon found out, as he follows the dying Jor-El returning to the Kent farm and dying in his son's arms, assuring him that he is proud of him and his last request being for Clark to save Zod. Sands will reprise the role in the tenth season

In the Season 9 finale called "Salvation", after Tess Mercer is defeated and killed by General Zod, the latter, in his fury towards Clark went on to destroy the console of crystals, by which Clark communicates with the essence of his biological father. Therefore, it is unknown whether or not Jor-El still resides within the Fortress, or if Zod has removed him permanently, thereby cutting off Clark's contact with Jor-El forever. This sequence occurs when Clark comes to the Fortress to explain to Jor-El what he feels he has to do to save the world from the Kandorians and that he knows what he must do to fulfill his destiny, but when he hears no reply, he looks and is horrified to find the crystal console shattered. This feeling turns to anger when Zod emerges and easily claims responsibility, telling Clark that he will never speak to his father again.  However, on the Season 10 premiere, "Lazarus," it is revealed that Jor-El's essence has survived and he warns his son about the coming of [[Darkseid]].

===Animation===
====Superman theatrical cartoons====
Jor-El is referenced in the first episode of the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman theatrical cartoons]] as one of Krypton's "leading scientists sensing the approach of doom." He then placed [[Superman|Kal-El]] into a rocket and blasted it off toward Earth just as Krypton exploded.

====''Super Friends''====
Jor-El is also seen in at least three episodes of the ''[[Super Friends]]''. He appears in the episode "The Planet Splitter," and in the ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' episode "Secret Origins of The Superfriends," as well as the short episode called "The Krypton Syndrome."

====''Superman'' (1988)====
In the 1988 animated series [[Superman (TV series)|''Superman'']], the Man of Steel mentions that his father Jor-El was the creator of the [[Phantom Zone]], which holds [[General Zod]] and his two [[Kryptonian]] companions. One of Zod's minions creates a pool of energy that allows them to create a monster called "The Hunter" (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) that leaves the Phantom Zone to kill Superman, then find the Phantom Zone Projector and free them. Jor-El is only mentioned, but he is not shown.

====DC Animated Universe====
=====''Superman: The Animated Series'' (1996)=====
In the 1990s-era ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Jor-El is featured as the hero of the series' first episode; he is voiced by [[Christopher McDonald]].
[[File:stas-jorel-lara.jpg|thumb|200px|Jor-El and his wife, Lara, in the first episode of Bruce Timm's [[Superman: The Animated Series]]]]
In the first part of the three-part opener, "[[wikia:DCanimated:The Last Son of Krypton|The Last Son of Krypton]]," Jor-El is a scientist examining the reasons for various [[earthquake]]s across the planet. His findings indicate Krypton's imminent destruction. Here, the animated Jor-El diverges from the comic version. While both versions feature the ruling council of Krypton dismissing Jor-El's findings, Jor-El is portrayed as a far less respected member of the scientific community, and the episode also gives a specific reason to the council's dismissal: [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], the operating system that runs the planet and chronicles its history and information.  Brainiac insists that Jor-El's calculations are incorrect, and the council members trust Brainiac much more than Jor-El (also, Jor-El's radical plan to put Krypton's entire population in the [[Phantom Zone]] while Krypton is destroyed for later transference to another planet is greeted by the council with nothing less than hatred). This is the same Brainiac who later becomes a nemesis of [[Superman]].

When Jor-El investigates the difference between Brainiac's findings and his own, he discovers that Brainiac has lied to the council to save himself. Brainiac counters by sending the authorities after him, leading to a protracted action sequence of Jor-El evading the police; this is one of several scenes which portray Jor-El as a skilled fighter and pilot, his primary vehicle resembling a flying [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]. With mere minutes before Krypton is to be destroyed, Jor-El loads Kal-El into the rocketship which had been intended for a single Kryptonian who would restore Krypton's population from the Phantom Zone, and dies with his wife [[Lara (comics)|Lara]] as the planet explodes. Jor-El's legacy on the show is carried on by the constant battles between Superman and Brainiac (he is as much Jor-El's enemy as he is Superman's) and the Phantom Zone criminals [[Jax-Ur]] and [[Mala (Kryptonian)|Mala]], who were foiled by Jor-El.

=====''Justice League''=====
In the two-part episode "[[wikia:DCanimated:Twilight|Twilight]]", Jor-El and [[Lara (comics)|Lara]] make a cameo in a picture shown to [[Superman]] by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] when he attempts to renew his offer of exploring the universe and collecting knowledge.

=====''Justice League Unlimited''=====
Jor-El also appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[wikia:dcanimated:For the Man Who Has Everything|For The Man Who Has Everything]]," an adaptation from [[For the Man Who Has Everything|the print story of the same name]] written by [[Alan Moore]], which originally appeared in 1985's ''Superman Annual''. In the story, [[Superman]] has an induced fantasy where he sees what his life would be like if Krypton had not exploded. Here, Jor-El is portrayed as an old man whose "sky-is-falling" theories disgraced him, but has done well enough for himself since then to have a sense of humor about it. As a bit of an [[in-joke]], his facial design matches Superman's from the first season of ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]],''. Jor-El's voice is again provided by [[Christopher McDonald]]. His last line of dialogue in the episode, however, is done by [[Mike Farrell]] (voice of [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan Kent]]) as a sign of Superman realizing the truth about the fantasy.

=====''Batman Beyond''=====
As a possible tie to the resemblance between father and son, [[Christopher McDonald]] also voices an older Superman in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' two-parter "[[wikia:DCanimated:The Call|The Call]]."

====''Pinky and the Brain'' (1997)====
The Silver Age versions of Jor-El and Lara appear in the episode "Two Mice and a Baby" as they place an infant Kal-El in his ship as Krypton crumbles. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} He is voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]].

====''Legion of Super Heroes''====
Jor-El also appears in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series. He appears in the episode called "Message in a Bottle." In that episode, he was shown in a flashback, which was a story told by [[Brainiac 5]], referring to the time when [[Brainiac (comics)|the original Brainiac (known as Brainiac 1.0 by the 31st century)]] shrank [[Kandor]] and destroyed the entire planet Krypton.

====''Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton''====
Jor-El is also featured in the animated web series ''Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton'', a spin-off of the television series ''[[Smallville]]''.

====''Dilbert''====
In the episode "The Delivery", Dilbert gives brith to a "half-alien, half-hill-billy, and half-robot" baby that Dogbert sends into outer space at the end of the climax. the baby's destination is revealed, to be Krypton, where a depressed Jor-El and Lara are embarrassed by their proven false claims of their planet's destruction and the loss of their son over a false alarm. However, they eventually get over it when Dilbert's baby arrives, as foretold to them by Dogbert.

==Novels==
===''Superman: Last Son of Krypton''===
In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] 1978 novel ''[[Superman: Last Son of Krypton]]'', Jor-El is shown as having sent a navigation probe ahead of [[Superman|Kal-El]]'s spaceship, in order to find a suitable foster parent on his new planet.

In [[Kryptonian]] society, scientific achievement was a preeminent virtue, so Jor-El's probe was programmed to seek out the leading scientific mind on Earth, presumably to adopt Kal-El. The probe landed (in the early 1950s, although the date is non-specific) in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where it soon appeared outside the window of [[Albert Einstein]] and communicated its mission to him through [[telepathy]], along with precise details of where Kal-El's rocket would land (near [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]]), several days later.

Through the probe, Einstein learned that, due to the yellow-sun environment and lower gravity, the child would acquire superhuman powers on Earth, but concluded that he himself was too old to raise a super-child and that he would probably not live to see him become an adult. He reasoned the child should have both a father and mother, and also that on Earth, the qualities of kindness and honesty would be more important than sheer scientific knowledge to instill into a super-powerful being. (The real-life fact that Einstein had fled from despotic [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s was noted as a possible factor in this decision.)

Einstein then traveled incognito to Smallville to seek out a suitable family; this required his sneaking away from fawning government handlers assigned to protect/baby-sit Einstein as a vital national resource. In the course of several days in Smallville, he encountered [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]], and decided that they would be ideal foster parents for the Kryptonian child, due to their honest and generous natures. Einstein arranged for the Kents to be in the immediate area when Kal-El's spaceship landed, thus ensuring he would be found and later adopted by them.

The last sequence shown in the novel has Kal-El, now grown up to become [[Clark Kent]]/Superman, reading a letter that Einstein had written to him, using the written Kryptonese language, in which he explains all this.

===''The Last Days of Krypton''===
In the [[2007]] novel ''The Last Days of Krypton'' by [[Kevin J. Anderson]], Jor-El is shown as a science hero who is respected and admired by all of the people of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] and has a standing offer of a place on the Council for many years. At the start of the novel, Jor-El's research discovers the [[Phantom Zone]] and met his future wife when he became trapped in it until she rescued him.
