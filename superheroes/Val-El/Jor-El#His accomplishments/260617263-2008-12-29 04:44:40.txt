'''Jor-El''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Superman]] [[comic books]], published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by [[United States of America|American]] writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Canada|Canadian]]-born artist [[Joe Shuster]], he first appeared in ''Action Comics'' #1 as Superman's biological father.

Jor-El is a [[Kryptonian]], and the husband of [[Lara Lor-Van]]. He is a [[scientist]] and leader on the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] before its destruction. Jor-El foresaw the planet's fate, but was unable to convince his colleagues in time to save their race after his appeals. He was able to save his infant son, Kal-El, sending him in a homemade rocketship to [[Earth]] just moments before Krypton's demise. After constructing his [[Fortress of Solitude]], Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a [[globe]] of Krypton.

Jor-El is usually portrayed as closely resembling the later appearance of Kal-El as the adult Superman. In the 2006 [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|Richard Donner cut of ''Superman II'']] (actor [[Marlon Brando]] did not appear in the original [[1980 in film|1980]] release of the [[Superman II|film]]), [[Lex Luthor]] notes a resemblance between Jor-El and Superman.

==History==
===Golden and Silver Age versions===
Jor-El was first referred to indirectly in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 in [[1938]], which only mentioned a scientist who sends his son to [[Earth]]. He made his first full-fledged appearance in the ''Superman'' [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] in [[1939]], where his name was spelled as "'''Jor-L'''." His name first appeared as being spelled "Jor-el" in the [[1942]] ''Superman'' novel ''The Adventures of Superman'' written by [[George Lowther]]; later comics would capitalize the 'E' in 'El.' After the introduction of [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the [[1960s]], it was established that the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] version of [[Superman]]'s father was named "Jor-L" and lived on the [[Krypton]] of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] universe, while "Jor-El" was the father of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] version of Superman and lived on the Krypton of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-One|Earth-One]] [[fictional universe|universe]].

A [[1948]] retelling of Superman's [[origin story]] first delved into detail about Jor-El, though his formal and more familiar Silver Age aspects were firmly established starting in the late [[1950s]] and over the course of the next several decades, with a definitive summarization in the [[1979]] miniseries ''The World of Krypton'' (not to be confused with the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late-[[1980s]] comic mini-series of the same name).

====His accomplishments====
As it was summarized in this miniseries (and in various other [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] stories), Jor-El was [[Krypton]]'s leading scientific genius, having invented, among other devices, the "Jor-El," a [[hovercar]], and having discovered a parallel plane of existence which he called the [[Phantom Zone]] and invented a device by which it could be entered, which he called the Phantom Zone Projector. He lived in Krypton's major city of [[Kryptonopolis]].

Even before Jor-El's birth, the El family was renowned across Krypton for its various contributions to Kryptonian society. Ancestors of Jor-El included: Val-El, a famous [[exploration|explorer]]; Sul-El, the inventor of Krypton's first [[telescope]]; Tala-El, the author of Krypton's first planetary [[constitution]]; Hatu-El, the inventor of Krypton's first [[electromagnet]] and electric motor; and Gam-El, the father of modern Kryptonian [[architecture]].

====Family life====
Jor-El had two brothers: [[Zor-El]], who lived in [[Argo City]] and eventually became the father of Kara Zor-El, alias [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and a fraternal [[twin]] brother named Nim-El, who lived in [[Kandor]]. In several stories, Jor-El's father was established as Jor-El I, and his mother as Nimda An-Dor. Jor-El eventually met and married [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara, daughter of Lor-Van]], a young [[astronaut]] in [[Krypton]]'s fledgling space program (which was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons), and the two had an infant son, [[Superman|Kal-El]].

====Jor-El as a male Cassandra====
When [[Krypton]] began experiencing a series of [[earthquake]]s, Jor-El investigated. He soon discovered, to his horror, that Krypton's core was extremely unstable and indeed radioactive, and worse, that it would eventually reach [[critical mass]] and explode, taking the entire planet and its populace with it. Jor-El tried to convince the members of Krypton's ruling body, the Science Council, of this impending disaster, and urged re-establishing Krypton's space program so giant spacecraft could be built to carry the populace to another habitable world. However, the Council was dismissive of Jor-El's findings and refused to comply with his plan.

Frustrated, Jor-El continued his work on space travel on his own, hoping to build a spacecraft to save his own family. This work included launching several smaller test rockets; one of these rockets included the family [[dog]], who responded to the name of [[Krypto]]. However, as time ran short, Jor-El soon found that he would only have enough time to build a spacecraft to save his son [[Superman|Kal-El]]. He decided to send Kal-El to [[Earth]], realizing he would gain superhuman powers under Earth's more intense yellow [[sun]] and lower [[gravity]]. As Krypton finally went through its final destructive stages, Jor-El and Lara placed their son in the rocket and launched him toward Earth, before they themselves were killed along with almost all the rest of the planet's population.

===Modern versions===
After the [[1985]]-[[1986]] [[limited series|mini-series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 mini-series ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' re-wrote [[Superman]]'s origins, details about Jor-El's background and character were changed. In Byrne's version, Jor-El inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile [[Krypton]] where even bodily contact was forbidden. Indeed, Jor-El himself was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing [[emotion]]s toward his mate [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara]], and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. Another change in this version was Jor-El genetically altering his son's [[fetus]] (gestating in a "birthing matrix") to allow him to leave Krypton (in this version of the mythos, Kryptonians were genetically "bonded" to the planet itself, not allowing them to leave), and merely attaching a [[warp drive|warp engine]] to the matrix instead of constructing a ship wholesale. The result was that when the birthing matrix opened on [[Earth]], [[Superman|Kal-El]] was "born" on that planet.

In the [[1990s]] series ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'', it was revealed that, in his youth, Jor-El met a time-traveling Jack Knight and Mikaal Tomas, two individuals who both bore at various points the "Starman" mantle. Knight and Tomas had been accidentally sent 70 years back in time and hurled across space. It was in this way that Jor-El first learned of Earth's existence; in return, Jor-El helped Knight and Tomas escape from his overbearing father, Seyg-El.

[[Image:Jor-El & Lara.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jor-El and Lara in ''Superman: Birthright''.]]
In the [[2004]] mini-series ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Jor-El, along with Krypton and Lara, was, more or less, reinstated to his [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] versions, though with such updated touches as Lara contributing equally to the effort of sending Kal-El, once again an infant while on Krypton, to Earth. In this version, Jor-El discovers Earth moments before launching his son's spacecraft. Also, the conclusion of the mini-series has the adult Superman, on Earth, seeing his parents through [[Lex Luthor]]'s time-space communicator, and on Krypton, seconds before its destruction, Jor-El and Lara see their son alive and well on Earth and know that their efforts were successful. As with Byrne's conflicting view of Krypton, the ''Birthright'' origins of Jor-El, Krypton, and Lex Luthor have recently been [[retcon]]ned, and, following ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', they are no longer valid in comics canon.

However, a more recent storyline co-written by [[Geoff Johns]] and ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' director [[Richard Donner]] presented yet another version of Jor-El and Krypton which reintroduced [[General Zod]] and the [[Phantom Zone]] criminals into mainstream continuity. With art by [[Adam Kubert]], Jor-El is depicted for the first time with a [[beard]] and the design of Kryptonian society is distinct yet again from ''Birthright'' and ''Man of Steel'', incorporating elements of Donner's work on the first two [[Christopher Reeve]] films, in particular the notion of Krypton's Council threatening Jor-El with harsh penalty of exile to the very Phantom Zone he himself had discovered if he were to make public his predictions of their planet's imminent doom or otherwise attempt to "create a climate of panic."

Jor-El is shown here to have been mentored by friend and noted scientist [[Non (DC comics)|Non]], who corroborated Jor-El's findings regarding Krypton's impending destruction, when the two were arrested and brought to trial before the Council by Zod and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]. When Non defies the Council's dire prohibitions and elects to spread the word of the coming apocalypse, he is abducted by Council agents and apparently [[lobotomy|lobotomized]], thus explaining the character's mute simple-mindedness, brutality, and destructiveness in line with [[Jack O'Halloran]]'s performance as Non in the first two films. Appalled, Zod and Ursa propose to Jor-El that they band together and overthrow the Council, but Jor-El will have none of it. When their murderous insurrection fails, the Council forces Jor-El to exile them to the Phantom Zone and never speak of his findings again, lest he face the same fate. For this perceived betrayal, Zod declares that he will escape and conquer Krypton (confident that Jor-El will actually discover some way to save the planet) and force the scientist and his son to kneel before him one day. (This echoes the statement [[Terence Stamp]] made in both ''Superman'' movies Donner directed: "No matter that it takes me an eternity, ''you WILL bow down before me, Jor-El; I swear it! First you, and then one day, Jor-El, '''YOUR HEIRS!!!"''''')

Having been rebuilt via a Kryptonian crystal during the ''[[One Year Later]]'' story arc, the current version of the [[Fortress of Solitude]], which was also designed to essentially be visually identical to the Donner and [[Bryan Singer]] films, now contains an advanced interactive "recording" of Jor-El which, although visually dissimilar to [[Marlon Brando]], is otherwise identical in function to that featured in ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #50, it is revealed that, years ago, Jor-El sent a probe to Earth that made contact with [[Thomas Wayne]] while he was on a drive with a pregnant [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], the probe [[holography|holographically]] transmitting Thomas' consciousness to Krypton so that Jor-El could better learn what kind of world Earth was to help him decide which of many possible candidates he should send his son to. Thomas tells Jor-El that the people of Earth aren't perfect, but are essentially a good and kind race, who would raise the child right, convincing Jor-El to send Kal-El there. Upon returning to his body, Thomas uses the technology in the Kryptonian probe to revitalize a failing [[Wayne Enterprises]]. Years later, the alien technology would be the basis of much of [[Batman]]'s technology. Thomas recorded his encounter in a diary, which was discovered by Bruce in the present day.

==''Smallville''==
{{Plot|date=June 2008}}
On the [[television program|television series]] ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', [[Terence Stamp]] provides the voice of Jor-El. (Stamp had previously played [[General Zod]] in ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]].'') [[Tom Welling]], who plays [[Clark Kent]] on the show, played a young Jor-El during flashbacks showing Jor-El visiting [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] in the early [[1960s]], in the episode "[[Smallville (Season 3)#Relic|Relic]]," which shows that, during his time on [[Earth]], Jor-El had an affair with [[Lana Lang]]'s great-aunt, only for her to be shot and killed by [[Lex Luthor]]'s grandfather. Apart from Welling's portrayal of the character, Jor-El himself is never actually seen on-screen, with the exception of a glimpse during a flashback scene in the episode "[[Smallville (Season 3)#Memoria|Memoria]]."

In the ''Smallville'' continuity, Jor-El's essence and will lives on within the Kawatche Caves of [[Smallville, Kansas]], and later the [[Fortress of Solitude]], from which he attempts to guide and influence the life of his son. Whether this "spirit" is supernatural in origin or some technological duplication of the long-dead Kryptonian scientist's memories, knowledge and personality as it is in the films is never made clear in the series. But in a great divergence from any other version of Jor-El, who is usually shown as having had benevolent reasons for sending his son to Earth, Clark finds a message from his biological father, in the spaceship that carried him to Earth, that seemingly instructs him to conquer the planet; this was proven to be incorrect by the end of the show's fourth season and continuing into Season 5, when the actual meanings of Jor-El's words are revealed to be that he wanted to prepare Clark for the impending meteor shower, the arrival of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] and, by the fifth season finale, the dreaded arrival of Zod.

Jor-El's relationship with Clark, posthumous though it is, can best be described, up until recently, as turbulent. Throughout the series, Clark defies Jor-El countless times and, each time, always has to deal with the repercussions. In the episode "[[Smallville (season 2)#Exodus|Exodus]]," Jor-El demands that Clark return himself to him so that he can begin his quest to rule Earth. Clark, fearing the path Jor-El has laid out for him, destroys his spaceship, which was a vessel for Jor-El's commands. As a result of the following explosion, [[wikia:Smallville:Martha Kent|Martha Kent]], Clark's human mother, is injured and loses her unborn child, resulting in [[wikia:Smallville:Jonathan Kent|Jonathan Kent]] blaming him for causing it. Overwrought with guilt, Clark puts on a [[Kryptonite in Smallville#Red Kryptonite|Red Kryptonite]] ring and runs away to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

Jonathan discovers the location of his son and seeks Jor-El's help in retrieving Clark. Jor-El makes an agreement with Jonathan, stipulating that he will help if Clark is eventually returned to him. Jonathan reluctantly agrees and is given temporary Kryptonian superpowers which he uses to bring Clark home but ignores his part of the bargain. Later, at the end of the episode "[[Smallville (season 3)#Hereafter|Hereafter]]", Jonathan suffers a near-fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and this plagues him from time to time, as a warning.

In the episode "[[Smallville (season 3)#Covenant|Covenant]]," Jor-El abducts a young girl and reprograms her into a superpowered girl named Kara. (In the comics, Kara is actually Clark's cousin and Jor-El's niece, and later takes on the title of [[Supergirl]]; this character appears later in the TV series.) Kara manipulates Clark into joining her by saying that Clark's family and friends will betray him. When Kara's predictions seemingly prove correct, Clark, having no one else to turn to, returns to Jor-El and is reprogrammed as "Kal-El of [[Krypton]]," a cold, single-minded being with no memory of Clark's life. Kal-El begins his mission of retrieving three Kryptonian stones scattered throughout the world. Martha disrupts Jor-El's plan by exposing Clark to [[Kryptonite in Smallville#Black Kryptonite|Black Kryptonite]], freeing the "Clark" persona and eliminating the colder Kryptonian side of Kal-El.

In the episode "[[Smallville (season 4)#Sacred|Sacred]]", Clark once again contacts Jor-El, who explains that Krypton's knowledge was encoded in the three stones, which were brought to Earth and hidden at far reaches of the world, and that his mission was to have Clark unite the stones and prevent Earth's destruction. In the season finale, "[[Smallville (season 4)#Commencement|Commencement]]" (and continuing into the fifth season premiere, "[[Smallville (season 5)#Arrival|Arrival]]"), Clark unites the stones, which meld into one crystal, and is transported to the [[North Pole]], where the Kryptonian crystal forms the Fortress of Solitude.

Clark enters the Fortress where the final phase in his journey is about to be completed. However, he interrupts his mission by aiding [[Chloe Sullivan]] who, having been accidentally transported along with Clark to the [[Arctic]], followed him into the Fortress and is freezing to death. Jor-El initially refuses to allow Clark to leave, but relents, stating that Clark must return to the Fortress before sunset. Clark fails to return and, as a result, is stripped of his powers. Although Clark is grateful to finally be able to live a "normal" life, it comes back to haunt him when he is fatally shot in the episode "[[Smallville (season 5)#Hidden|Hidden]]."

Jor-El inhabits [[Lionel Luthor]]'s body and brings Clark's corpse to the Fortress where Clark is resurrected with all his powers restored. After being revived, Clark is told by Jor-El that there will be a price to pay for this favor: the life of someone close to Clark must be taken in exchange for his being given back. In the episode "[[List of Smallville episodes|Reckoning]]," the series' 100th episode, when Lana is killed in a car accident and a grief-stricken Clark begs him for help, Jor-El gives Clark a crystal that will send him 24 hours into the past. Clark uses the crystal to go back in time and prevents the accident that took Lana's life, but unfortunately, this leads to a confrontation between Jonathan and Lionel. In the original timeline, Jonathan was on his way to meet with Lionel, but never met him as Lana was killed in an accident. When Clark went back to the past and saved her, Jonathan didn't have a reason to stop and met Lionel, but died shortly afterward from a heart attack.

In the fifth season finale "[[Smallville (season 5)#Vessel|Vessel]]," Jor-El warns Clark that Brainiac wants to unleash Zod from the [[Phantom Zone]] and if Zod inhabits a human host, he must kill the host to prevent destruction. When he confronts Lex (whom Brainiac chose to be Zod's host), Clark prepares to stab Lex but backs down at the last minute and stabs Brainiac instead; this results in Zod being freed and taking over Lex's body. Zod subsequently exiles Clark to the Phantom Zone. In the sixth season premiere "[[Smallville (season 6)#Zod|Zod]]," Clark is rescued by Jor-El's former research assistant and ally [[wikia:Smallville:Raya|Raya]], who provides him a key to escape the Phantom Zone. At the same time, Jor-El contacts Martha for the first time and commends her for having raised Clark, and he helps heal [[Lois Lane]], who had been injured in a plane crash caused by Brainiac. Following this, the Fortress shuts down temporarily, but Clark manages to restore it with a crystal bearing the House of El insignia in the episode "[[Smallville (season 6)#Fallout|Fallout]]."

In the show's seventh season, [[Kara Zor-El]], the daughter of Jor-El's younger brother [[Zor-El]], awakens from nearly twenty years in [[suspended animation]] with the goal to find and protect baby Kal-El, whom she does not realize has grown. When he finally learns that her father and his were at odds with each other, Clark seeks Jor-El out for answers about who this girl really is. Jor-El explains that Zor-El was evil, and Clark must start his training with Kara by finding out what her real motives are.

In a flashback scene in the episode "[[Smallville (season 7)#Lara|Lara]]," Clark's biological mother [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara]] mentions that Jor-El invented Brainiac to save Krypton from its war with Zod. At the end of the episode "[[Smallville (season 7)#Blue|Blue]]," Jor-El informs Clark that, because of his recurring disobedience and not learning from his mistakes, Clark will have to face a consequence: imprisonment at the Fortress. However, he learns that [[Bizarro]] has returned, Jor-El releases Clark so that he can stop him. Later, Jor-El "appears" in the episode "[[Smallville (season 7)#Traveler|Traveler]]," where he restores Kara's powers and memories. In the episode "[[Smallville (season 7)#Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]," Jor-El sends Clark to an [[alternate universe]] to show his son what life would be like if he had never made it to Earth and helps Clark [[time travel|travel back through time]] to stop Brainiac from killing his infant self on Krypton.

At the end of the seventh season finale "[[Smallville (season 7)#Arctic|Arctic]]," the Fortress is destroyed by Lex but restored by Clark in the eighth season episode "[[Smallville (season 8)#Abyss|Abyss]]," where he restores Chloe's memories and erases her memories of Clark's powers and Kryptonian heritage. At the end of the episode, Jor-El tells Clark that he will be there for him when he faces [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] and, for the first time, Clark addresses Jor-El as "Father." Shortly after Clark leaves, Brainiac takes over the Fortress; Jor-El's current status is unknown.

==Appearances in other media==
Jor-El has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the [[Superman]] story. Media portrayals of Jor-El tend to vary greatly in how he's presented, often diverging from the original source material.

===Film===
====Superman serial====
Jor-El was portrayed by [[Nelson Leigh]] in the [[1948]] ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' movie serial.

====Superman film series====
=====''Superman''=====
[[Image:Jorel yahoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marlon Brando as Jor-El, with Kal-El. The actual name of the child who appeared as Kal-El is unknown.]]
[[Marlon Brando]] played Jor-El in the [[1978]] [[Superman (film)|''Superman'' film]], which [[Alexander Salkind]], his son [[Ilya Salkind]], and their business partner [[Pierre Spengler]] produced and which [[Richard Donner]] directed. In the movie, Jor-El is shown wearing the [[Superman]] "S"-shield symbol as the family crest of the House of El; it was, in fact, Brando's idea to wear the symbol in this manner.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} In the current comics, the shield is the Kryptonian symbol for "hope," and not only is it worn by Jor-El in a similar manner to Brando of the first feature film, but it adorns all manner of Kryptonian flags, clothing, spaceships, and equipment. However, the film version is one in which the shield is unique to members of the House of El, with other Kryptonians wearing their own individualized family crests.

When the teenage [[Clark Kent]] finds the green crystal his birth father placed in his ship, it leads him to the [[North Pole]], where the green crystal creates the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and brings Clark into contact with an interactive hologram of Jor-El, who instructs his son on how to use his powers and informs him that the people of [[Earth]] "can be a great people, Kal-El, if they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all...their capacity for good...I have sent them you, my only son." Later, Jor-El is shown advising Superman on why he must maintain his secret identity to protect himself and his loved ones.

=====''Superman II''=====
[[Marlon Brando]] filmed additional footage for the sequel, ''[[Superman II]],'' before differences behind the scenes caused his footage to end up on the cutting room floor. It has been restored for the [[2006]] revised version, ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]''. In the ''Richard Donner Cut'', Jor-El appears again as in the first as a person to guide and inform [[Superman|Kal-El]]. Jor-El's historical crystals reveal to [[Lex Luthor]] the existence of the three [[Phantom Zone]] criminals [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], which makes Luthor realize just who and what they are (and that it was Superman who caused their release).

Jor-El is asked by  Clark if he can live a life as a human with [[Lois Lane]]. Jor-El tries to persuade Clark not to wish so, but Clark is firm with his will. Jor-El then reveals the crystal chamber with the rays of [[Krypton]]'s red sun which will make Clark human forever. Later, Clark returns to find all the crystals and information regarding Krypton destroyed, but finds the original crystal and is able to bring back Jor-El. Jor-El sacrifices his remaining life-force to restore his son's powers so that Superman can save Earth from Zod. Superman later destroys the Fortress after it has been breached by Luthor and the Phantom Zone criminals, but then goes back in time, where it remains normal.

=====''Superman Returns''=====
In [[2006]], two years after Brando died, he "reprised" the role of Jor-El in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' through the harvesting of archived video footage and sound clip outtakes. In the film, [[Lex Luthor]], having retained vague memories of the place, returns to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] during [[Superman]]'s absence to learn the power of the crystals. After stealing one, he uses it, with [[kryptonite]], to create a new continent that threatens to destroy [[North America]]. Superman manages to throw the "New Krypton" island out of the atmosphere and into space.

===Animation===
====Superman theatrical cartoons====
Jor-El is referenced in the first episode of the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman theatrical cartoons]] as one of [[Krypton]]'s "leading scientists sensing the approach of doom." So he placed [[Superman|Kal-El]] into a rocket and blasted it off toward [[Earth]] just as Krypton exploded.

====''Super Friends''====
Jor-El is also seen in at least three episodes of the ''[[Super Friends]]''. He appears in the episode "The Planet Splitter," and in the ''[[Challenge of the Superfriends]]'' episode "Secret Origins of The Superfriends," and he also appears in the short episode called "The Krypton Syndrome."

====''Superman: The Animated Series'' (1988)====
On the [[Superman (1988 TV series)|1988 Superman animated series]], Superman mentions that Jor-El was the creator of the [[Phantom Zone]], which holds [[General Zod]] and his two [[Kryptonian]] companions. One of Zod's minions creates a pool of energy that allows them to create a monster called "The Hunter" (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) that leaves the Phantom Zone to kill Superman, then find the Phantom Zone Projector and free them. Jor-El is only mentioned, but he is not shown.

====''Superman: The Animated Series'' (1996)====
In the [[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman animated series]] in the mid-[[1990s]], Jor-El is featured as the hero of the series' first episode; he is voiced by [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]].

In the first part of the three-part opener, "[[List of Superman: The Animated Series episodes|The Last Son of Krypton]]," Jor-El is a scientist examining the reasons for various [[earthquake]]s across the planet. His findings indicate [[Krypton]]'s imminent destruction. Here, the animated Jor-El diverges from the comic version. While both versions feature the ruling council of Krypton dismissing Jor-El's findings, Jor-El is portrayed as a far less respected member of the scientific community, and the episode also gives a specific reason to the council's dismissal: [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]. Brainiac, the operating system that runs the planet and chronicles its history and information, insists that Jor-El's calculations are incorrect, and the council members trust Brainiac much more than Jor-El. (Also, Jor-El's radical plan to put Krypton's entire population in the [[Phantom Zone]] while Krypton is destroyed for later transference to another planet is greeted by the council with nothing less than hatred.) This is the same Brainiac who later becomes [[Superman]]'s nemesis.

When Jor-El investigates the difference between Brainiac's findings and his own, he discovers that Brainiac has lied to the council to save himself. Brainiac counters by sending the authorities after him, leading to a protracted action sequence of Jor-El evading the police; this is one of several scenes which portray Jor-El as a skilled fighter and pilot, his primary vehicle resembling a flying [[scooter]]. With mere minutes before Krypton is to be destroyed, Jor-El loads Kal-El into the rocketship which had been intended for a single Kryptonian who would restore Krypton's population from the Phantom Zone, and dies with his wife [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara]] as the planet explodes. Jor-El's legacy on the show is carried on by the constant battles between Superman and Brainiac (he is as much Jor-El's enemy as he is Superman's) and the Phantom Zone criminals [[Jax-Ur]] and Mala, who were foiled by Jor-El.

====''Batman Beyond''====
As a possible tie to the resemblance between father and son, [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]] also voices an older Superman in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' two-parter "[[List of Batman Beyond episodes|The Call]]."

====''Justice League''====
In the two-part episode "[[List of Justice League episodes|Twilight]]", Jor-El and [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara]] make a cameo in a picture shown to [[Superman]] by [[Brainiac]] when he attempts to renew his offer of exploring the universe and collecting knowledge.

====''Justice League Unlimited''====
Jor-El also appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[For the Man Who Has Everything (Justice League Unlimited episode)|For The Man Who Has Everything]]," an adaptation from the print story of the same name written by [[Alan Moore]], which originally appeared in [[1985]]'s ''Superman Annual''. In the story, [[Superman]] has an induced fantasy where he sees what his life would be like if [[Krypton]] had not exploded. Here, Jor-El is portrayed as an old man whose "sky-is-falling" theories disgraced him, but has done well enough for himself since then to have a sense of humor about it. As a bit of an [[in-joke]], his facial design matches Superman's from the first season of ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]],'' plus he slightly resembles [[Marlon Brando]]{{Fact|date=February 2008}}. Jor-El's voice is again provided by [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]].

====''Legion of Super Heroes''====
Jor-El also appears in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series. He appears in the episode called "Message in a Bottle." In that episode, he was shown in a flashback, which was a story told by [[Brainiac 5]], referring to the time when [[Brainiac (comics)|the original Brainiac (known as Brainiac 1.0 by the 31st century)]] shrank [[Kandor]] and destroyed the entire planet [[Krypton]].

====''Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton''====
Jor-El is also featured in the animated web series ''Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton'', a spin-off of the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.

===Live-action television===
====''The Adventures of Superman''====
Jor-El was played by [[Robert Rockwell]], who went uncredited on-screen, in "Superman On Earth," the first episode of the [[1952]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The Adventures Of Superman]]''.

====''Superboy''====

===Novels===
====''Superman: Last Son of Krypton''====
In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] [[1978]] novel ''[[Last Son of Krypton|Superman: Last Son of Krypton]]'', Jor-El is shown as having sent a navigation probe ahead of [[Superman|Kal-El]]'s spaceship, in order to find a suitable foster parent on his new planet.

In [[Kryptonian]] society, scientific achievement was a preeminent virtue, so Jor-El's probe was programmed to seek out the leading scientific mind on [[Earth]], presumably to adopt Kal-El. The probe landed (in the early [[1950s]], although the date is non-specific) in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where it soon appeared outside the window of [[Albert Einstein]] and communicated its mission to him through [[telepathy]], along with precise details of where Kal-El's rocket would land (near [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]]), several days later.

Through the probe, Einstein learned that, due to the yellow-sun environment and lower gravity, the child would acquire superhuman powers on Earth, but concluded that he himself was too old to raise a super-child and that he would probably not live to see him become an adult. He reasoned the child should have both a father and mother, and also that on Earth, the qualities of kindness and honesty would be more important than sheer scientific knowledge to instill into a super-powerful being. (The real-life fact that Einstein had fled from despotic [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[1930s]] was noted as a possible factor in this decision.)

Einstein then traveled incognito to Smallville to seek out a suitable family; this required his sneaking away from fawning government handlers assigned to protect/baby-sit Einstein as a vital national resource. In the course of several days in Smallville, he encountered [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha Kent]], and decided that they would be ideal foster parents for the Kryptonian child, due to their honest and generous natures. Einstein arranged for the Kents to be in the immediate area when Kal-El's spaceship landed, thus ensuring he would be found and later adopted by them.

The last sequence shown in the novel has Kal-El, now grown up to become [[Clark Kent]]/Superman, reading a letter that Einstein had written to him, using the written Kryptonese language, in which he explains all this.

====''The Last Days of Krypton''====
In the [[2007]] novel ''The Last Days of Krypton'' by [[Kevin J. Anderson]], Jor-El is shown as a science hero who is respected and admired by all of the people of [[Krypton]] and has a standing offer of a place on the Council for many years. At the start of the novel, Jor-El's research discovers the [[Phantom Zone]].
