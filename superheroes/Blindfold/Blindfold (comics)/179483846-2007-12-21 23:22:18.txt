'''Blindfold''', real name '''Ruth Aldine''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]]. She first appeared in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #7 and was created by [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Blindfold is a student at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. She was first mentioned by [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]] and Wing before their confrontation with [[Ord]]. Hisako and [[Wing (Marvel Comics)|Wing]] both said she had a big mouth because she had read Wing's mind and informed Hisako of his dreams of one day becoming an [[X-Men|X-Man]]. Wing was upset, but Hisako told him not to worry, as she wanted to be an X-Man too, and that Blindfold was just lonely. In her first actual appearance, the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] led her to [[Emma Frost]] and the rest of the X-Men to warn them of the coming of the [[Danger Room]] entity. 

When [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] hit, she was [[New X-Men|one of 27 students]] to maintain her powers. She was excused along with [[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]], [[Ernst (comics)|Ernst]] and [[Gentle (comics)|Gentle]] from Emma Frost's Battle Royal which determined who will train to be an X-Man.

===Torn===

When Emma Frost was suffering from a bad case of [[survivor's guilt]], Blindfold was found by Hisako "crying" in a restroom. While trying to comfort Blindfold, Blindfold tries to convince Hisako that they are going "to lose another one." [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], believing he is a defenseless child due to the manipulations of [[Cassandra Nova]], barged into the restroom asking for help as a feral [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] followed him in. Hisako leaves Blindfold and hides with Wolverine, unfortunately Beast targets Blindfold and goes to attack her. Hisako powers up and scares the feral X-Man away but passes out from exhaustion. Blindfold then takes her to the infirmary because she believes someone was awake only to find the unconscious bodies of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. Eventually Shadowcat makes her way back to the Institute and asks the girls to tell her everything they know. When Kitty leaves to find out who exactly is attacking, Cyclops manages to contact Blindfold and instruct her to give Beast a special box containing a ball of string. He also asks her to keep his mind safe from any sort of psychic attacks as he helps Emma. During the middle of the battle, Ord and the Danger Room entity interrupt and a battle begins between the X-Men, Hisako, Ord and Danger. Suddenly [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] beamed the team, Danger, Ord, and Hisako into a spaceship headed for the Breakworld. Blindfold was last seen watching them along with a few other students and commented that not all of them will come back.

===Quest For Magik===

Blindfold, during an evening of storytelling, relayed the history of the deceased New Mutant [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] to her fellow classmates. Her story emotionally bothered some of them as Blindfold began including aspects that both recently happened and were about to happen. She explained that the demon lord [[Belasco]] reclaimed the realm of [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]] by defeating its previous mistress, [[Amanda Sefton]]. After stealing the [[Soulsword]] from her, Belasco cast her out of Limbo and began searching for a way to bring back Illyana Rasputin from the dead. After saying this Blindfold and the other students were themselves attacked by demons from Limbo sent by Belasco. She continued to assist the students with advice throughout their time in Limbo, telling certain students when and how to react to their situations, especially concerning Pixie, who she declared "must not fall". She survived the final battle and was returned to the mansion with the rest of the students.

===Blinded by the Light===
[[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] is given knowledge of the plans of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and implies that Blindfold is second on a list targets for elimination by them and the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], orchestrated by [[Mr. Sinister]]. Blindfold speaks to the [[New X-Men]] saying that whatever is supposed to happen to her can be prevented by [[Josh_Foley|Elixir]]. She grabs his hands, touching the black part of his skin that represents death and the gold part that represents life at the same time.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #201</ref> A large energy transfer of black and gold follows, and she is incapacitated, though the New X-Men are both confused as to what she meant and unsure of whether she is dead or merely unconscious.  Right as Pixie goes to get help from [[Shadowcat]], the Institute is attacked by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and his Acolytes. After examining her, Exodus states that Blindfold is dead and she is no longer a priority to them and they continue on to look for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s Diaries in the mansion, but in spite of this she does not 'smell dead' to [[X-23]], and [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]] theorizes that Blindfold's precognitive abilities forewarned her of Exodus' coming and so she used Elixir's powers to put herself in a death-like sleep. Shadowcat subsequently operates on Blindfold, who finally awakens to speak further cryptic predictions about the X-Men's handicapped situation, saying that soon Hellion, Pixie, and Nightcrawler will be hurt.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #203</ref>. 

===Messiah Complex===
As of now, her prediction about Hellion and Nightcrawler was proven correct when [[Lady Deathstrike]] mortally wounds Hellion and Scalphunter seriously injured Nightcrawler.

The story is ongoing...

==Mannerisms==

Blindfold has a unique speech pattern. It includes the odd insertion into her sentences of words of politeness including "please" and "pardon" and "thank you." 

Given that she is both a telepath and a precognitive, she often answers questions before they are asked and responds to comments before they are spoken aloud. As a result, she tends to turn what would ordinarily be a two-way conversation into a monologue. While she does not always do this, it may be assumed that she is allowing the other person or persons to say what she already knows they will say out of politeness' sake.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Blindfoldastxmen0072.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Art by John Cassaday]]
Blindfold is a [[psionic]], but the full extent of her abilities is unknown.  She has been shown in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' using telepathy and ''[[New X-Men]]'' to sometimes psychically sense events when other telepaths apparently did not such as Belasco pulling everyone inside the mansion into Limbo. Her appearances in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' she used [[telepathy]], and in her most recent appearance in ''[[New X-Men]]'' 'The Quest for Magic' she has demonstrated and said to be; a [[clairvoyant]], [[retrocognition]] or [[precognition|precognitive]], and able to see past, present or future places or events. Her [[blindness]] is part of her mutation in the sense that she has no eyes, but rather has skin where eyes would normally be. Because of this she cannot cry.
