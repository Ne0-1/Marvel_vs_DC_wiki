'''Blindfold''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]].  She first appeared in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' (third series) #7 and was created by [[Joss Whedon]].  She is [[New X-Men|one of 27 students]] to maintain her powers post-[[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers==
Blindfold is a [[Telepath]], but the full extent of her abilities is unknown.  She has been shown in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' to both lack control and also to sometimes sense events when other telepaths apparently did not.  Therefore, besides [[Telepathy]], she may also be a [[clairvoyant]] or [[precognition|precognitive]], and able to see nearby present or future events. Her [[blindness]] is part of her mutation in the sense that she has no eyes, but rather has skin where eyes would normally be.

Her powers and situation as a blind person who is able to "see" thanks to her powers mirrors the situation of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]], the [[deceased]] [[lover]] of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].

==Facts==

*She always wears a blindfold around her eyes, and when it was removed, it was shown that Blindfold had no eyes at all, not even open eye sockets. There was just skin where a person's eyes are supposed to be.
