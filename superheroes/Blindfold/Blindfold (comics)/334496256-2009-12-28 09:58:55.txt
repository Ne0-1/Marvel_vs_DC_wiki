'''Blindfold''' ('''Ruth Aldine''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]]. She first appeared in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #7 and was created by [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Blindfold is a student at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. She was first mentioned by [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]] and Wing before their confrontation with [[Ord (comics)|Ord]]. Hisako and [[Wing (Marvel Comics)|Wing]] both said she had a big mouth because she had read Wing's mind and informed Hisako of his dreams of one day becoming an [[X-Men|X-Man]]. Wing was upset, but Hisako told him not to worry, as she wanted to be an X-Man too, and that Blindfold was just lonely. In her first actual appearance, the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] led her to [[Emma Frost]] and the rest of the X-Men to warn them of the coming of the [[Danger Room]] entity. 

When [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] hit, she was [[New X-Men|one of 27 students]] to maintain her powers. She was excused along with [[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]], [[Ernst (comics)|Ernst]] and [[Gentle (comics)|Gentle]] from Emma Frost's Battle Royale which determined who will train to be an X-Man.

===Torn===

When Emma Frost was suffering from a bad case of [[survivor's guilt]], Blindfold was found by Hisako "crying" in a restroom. While trying to comfort Blindfold, Blindfold tries to convince Hisako that they are going "to lose another one." [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], believing he is a defenseless child due to the manipulations of [[Cassandra Nova]], barged into the restroom asking for help as a feral [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] followed him in. Hisako leaves Blindfold and hides with Wolverine, unfortunately Beast targets Blindfold and goes to attack her. Hisako powers up and scares the feral X-Man away but passes out from exhaustion. Blindfold then takes her to the infirmary because she believes someone was awake only to find the unconscious bodies of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. Eventually Shadowcat makes her way back to the Institute and asks the girls to tell her everything they know. When Kitty leaves to find out who exactly is attacking, Cyclops manages to contact Blindfold and instruct her to give Beast a special box containing a ball of string. He also asks her to keep his mind safe from any sort of psychic attacks as he helps Emma. During the middle of the battle, Ord and the Danger Room entity interrupt and a battle begins between the X-Men, Hisako, Ord and Danger. Suddenly [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] beamed the team, Danger, Ord, and Hisako into a spaceship headed for the Breakworld. Blindfold was last seen watching them along with a few other students and commented that not all of them will come back.

===Quest For Magik===
Blindfold, during an evening of storytelling, relayed the history of the deceased New Mutant [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] to her fellow classmates. Her story emotionally bothered some of them as Blindfold began including aspects that both recently happened and were about to happen. She explained that the demon lord [[Belasco]] reclaimed the realm of [[Otherplace|Limbo]] by defeating its previous mistress, [[Amanda Sefton]]. Belasco cast her out of Limbo and began searching for a way to bring back Illyana Rasputin from the dead. After saying this Blindfold and the other students were themselves attacked by demons from Limbo sent by Belasco. She continued to assist the students with advice throughout their time in Limbo, telling certain students when and how to react to their situations, especially concerning Pixie, who she declared "must not fall". She survived the final battle and was returned to the mansion with the rest of the students.

===Blinded by the Light===
[[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] is given knowledge of the plans of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and implies that Blindfold is second on a list targets for elimination by them and the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], orchestrated by [[Mr. Sinister]]. Blindfold speaks to the [[New X-Men]] saying that whatever is supposed to happen to her can be prevented by [[Josh Foley|Elixir]]. She grabs his hands, touching the black part of his skin that represents death and the gold part that represents life at the same time.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #201</ref> A large energy transfer of black and gold follows, and she is incapacitated, though the New X-Men are both confused as to what she meant and unsure of whether she is dead or merely unconscious.  Right as Pixie goes to get help from [[Shadowcat]], the Institute is attacked by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and his Acolytes. After examining her, Exodus states that Blindfold is dead and she is no longer a priority to them and they continue on to look for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s Diaries in the mansion, but in spite of this she does not 'smell dead' to [[X-23]], and [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]] theorizes that Blindfold's precognitive abilities forewarned her of Exodus' coming and so she used Elixir's powers to put herself in a death-like sleep. Shadowcat subsequently operates on Blindfold, who finally awakens to speak further cryptic predictions about the X-Men's handicapped situation, saying that soon Hellion, Pixie, Nightcrawler and someone else she can't recall will be hurt.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #203</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
Her predictions were soon proven correct when [[Lady Deathstrike]] mortally wounds Hellion, [[Scalphunter (comics)|Scalphunter]] seriously injures Nightcrawler and Pixie injures herself by blindly teleporting the team from the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. The other person Blindfold mentions but does not recall is [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], who was injured by Bishop; or perhaps [[Professor Xavier|Professor X]].

===Young X-Men===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:YNGXM001 CVR.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blindfold and her teammates on the cover of [[Young X-Men]], art by [[Terry Dodson]]]] -->
Blindfold has a nightmare in which one of her future teammates, the Young X-Men, is killed by [[Donald Pierce]]. She meets up with [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] and tells him of her premonition of the soon-to-be-formed team and mentions the death of one of their future teammates, though Santo appears to take little heed of it, being more interested in the team uniforms she saw.  As predicted, Cyclops arrives at the cafe and offers Santo a place on the team, but also revealing that he did not wish to recruit Ruth. However, Santo refuses to join the team unless she is allowed to as well, noting that Ruth's vision included her on the squad as well. Cyclops concedes, and Ruth takes her place on the squad.<ref>''Young X-Men #1''</ref>

Cyclops orders Ruth and Ink to bring in Dani Moonstar, who is apparently a member of a new Brotherhood of Mutants. However Ink betrays Ruth and delivers both girls to Donald Pierce, who is revealed to be impersonating Cyclops. Eventually they are freed and Ruths prediction comes to pass and Wolf Cub is killed. She then relocates to San Francisco with the rest of the Young X-Men, but leaves the team.  Cyclops states that Ruth will only be called in as needed.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #6''</ref>

When [[Cipher (marvel)|Cipher]] reveals her presence to the Young X-Men, Cyclops explains that she had been there in secret under his orders helping the Young X-Men and much earlier, including during Beast's attack on Blindfold during Astonishing X-Men.  Blindfold's seemingly one-sided conversation during that time (and others) is revealed to have actually been a conversation between herself and Cipher, who was able to mask her part of the conversation using her stealth powers.  Blindfold is the only other besides [[Jean Grey]], Cyclops, and Graymalkin who were aware of Cipher's existence prior to the events of ''Young X-Men''.  The two developed a friendship during this time.

===Necrosha===
Blindfold is contacted by the newly resurrected [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] by accident when she was trying to reach her foster daughter [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Destiny saves her life from being crushed by falling rubble and gives her some information to help combat Selene's forces. After Destiny breaks contact with her, she believes she made a grave mistake.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1</ref>
Blindfold is revealed to be possessed by Proteus.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #231</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blindfold is [[psionic]], but the full extent of her abilities is unknown.  She has been shown in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' using telepathy and ''[[New X-Men]]'' to sometimes psychically sense events when other telepaths apparently did not, such as Belasco pulling everyone inside the mansion into Limbo. During her appearances in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' she used [[telepathy]], and in her most recent appearances in ''[[New X-Men]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]'',  she has been said to be  a [[clairvoyant]], [[retrocognition|retrocognitive]] and [[precognition|precognitive]] mutant, meaning that she is able to see past, present or future places or events. Her [[blindness]] is part of her mutation in the sense that she has no eyes, but rather has skin where eyes would normally be.

===Mannerisms===
Blindfold has a unique speech pattern. It includes the odd insertion into her sentences of words of politeness, including "''please''", "''thank you''", "''you're welcome''", and "''pardon''". She's also been known to oddly insert the words "''yes''" and "''no''" into her sentences.

Given that she is both a telepath and a precognitive, she often answers questions before they are asked and responds to comments before they are spoken aloud. As a result, she tends to turn what would ordinarily be a two-way conversation into a monologue. While she does not always do this, it may be assumed that she is allowing the other person or persons to say what she already knows they will say out of politeness' sake.

Some of her "''one-sided''" conversations in ''Astonishing X-Men'' and ''Young X-Men'' were explained as having been with her friend, [[Cipher (comics)|Cipher]], who remained concealed from all others around them by using her complete stealth mutant powers.
