The '''Rocket Racer''' ('''Robert Farrell''') is an [[African-American]] [[super-hero]] (reformed [[super-villain]]) in [[Marvel comics]].

==Publication history==
Rocket Racer first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #172 as a super-villain. He returned in issues #182 and #183 in a battle against the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]]. His origin was finally revealed in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #104.<ref>http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/apps/rocket_racer.html</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Robert Farrell, born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], was the eldest of seven children. He became responsible for his younger siblings when his mother, Emma Johnson Farrell died. Robert was a scientific prodigy, and when he realized he couldn't earn enough to support his family, he turned to a life of crime as the '''Rocket Racer'''. He developed a super-powered skateboard which is propelled at great speed by small rockets and cybernetically controlled by a crude walkman-like device. He wore a weapon-equipped costume, including rocket-powered gloves which give him the ability to hit an opponent with a "rocket-powered-punch."

Early in his career as a burglar, Rocket Racer encounters [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #172</ref> Rocket Racer hires the villain the [[Tinkerer]] to redesign his skateboard. At one point he is hired by Jackson Weele to steal evidence that might incriminate him. Robert uses the evidence to blackmail Jackson. Weele wishes to commit suicide but Robert stops him. Even then, though, he mocks Weele, calling him ''Big Weele''. This is enough for Jackson to hire the villain the Tinkerer to create a literal '[[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]]', to chase Robert around town with. Spider-Man assists and Jackson seemingly falls to his death in the Hudson River.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #182-183</ref> Later, Rocket Racer was saved by Spider-Man from the Bounty Hunter.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #104</ref>

Repeated defeats at the hands of [[Spider-Man]] and several brushes with the law, including a short jail sentence, convince Robert to reform.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He goes through a high school equivalency course and his extremely high marks gain him a scholarship to [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30â€“33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref> This doesn't go well as his first few days are full with combating the efforts of a hate-group on campus.

He ''appeared'' to have been tempted back into crime, and reduced to a state of stuttering nervousness by the situation.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up/MODOK's 11'' #1 (September 2007)</ref> He turned out to have been working for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] all along, with a deal that they will give him the money he needs in return for the Hypernova<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up/MODOK's 11'' #4 (December 2007)</ref> - he failed in this and it's unknown yet what's happened with his mother.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up/MODOK's 11'' #5 (January 2008)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Spidermanep32.jpg|thumb|right|Animated Rocket Racer on 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']]
* Rocket Racer appeared in [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Billy Atmore]]. This version is depicted as a teenager in a crime-ridden neighborhood who ends up helping Spider-Man. He only appears in the episode ''Rocket Racer''. Robert had great skill in gyro mechanisms due to working at the Science center taught by Peter Parker. He stole parts of his technology from the criminal mastermind behind the Big Wheel and used them to create a cybernetically controlled, rocket-powered magnetic skateboard which he travels with and can attain speeds of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h}}. He can also scale walls. After Robert was thought to have stolen some jewels, he was chased by [[Spider-Man]]. Rocket Racer escaped but Spider-Man planted a tracer on him and found out his identity. A criminal leader, whose machines were stolen, created the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]], a giant wheel with lasers, missiles, and spikes that was able to roll onto buildings and higher grounds. Spider-Man and Rocket Racer were able to stop the Big Wheel when Rocket Racer had Spider-Man electrocute the Big Wheel with two electric wires. The criminal was arrested. This taught Robert that education, not crime, would help him in the world to overcome his problems. Later in the night, when the criminals demanding protection money came, Spider-Man and Robert took care of them. In the same episode, Robert supposedly gave up the Rocket Racer suit, but when he kicked his board onto one of the criminals, he was wearing the suit, even though a few seconds later, he wasn't.

* The ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' episode "Heroes and Villains" features '''Turbo Jet''' (voiced by [[Harold Perrineau]]), a high tech janitor turned thief named Lewis Wyler who is based on Rocket Racer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}<!--source for who he is based on?-->
