The '''Rocket Racer''' is a low-level super-hero in [[Marvel comics]]

After his Mother, Emma Farrell, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized, Robert Farrell turned to crime to pay for the store bills -- especially with criminals demanding money for protection. He stole a few machines from the same criminals whose leader was an expert in engineering and believed in time and precision. 

Robert had great intelligence in gyro mechanicisms due to working at the Science center taught by Peter Parker. He created the cybernetically controlled, rocket-powered magnetic skateboard which he travels with and can attain speeds of 60 miles per hour. He can also scale walls. After stealing some jewels, [[Spider-Man]] chased him. Rocket Racer escaped but Spider-Man planted a tracer on him and found out his identity.

The criminal leader, whose machines were stolen, created the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]], a giant wheel with lasers, missiles, spiky wheels and able to roll onto buildings and higher grounds. Spider-Man and Rocket Racer were able to stop the Big Wheel when Rocket Racer had Spider-Man electricute the Big Wheel with two electric wires. The criminal was arrested. This taught Robert that education, not crime, would help him in the world to overcome his problems. 

Later in the night, when the criminals demanding protection came, Spider-Man and Robert took care of them.

Robert Farrell has no superpowers but he has great intelligence, street-fighting experience and is a great skateboarder.
