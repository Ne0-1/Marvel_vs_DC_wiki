*Rocket Racer appeared in [[FOX]]'s ''[[Spider-Man:The Animated Series]]'' as a teenager in a crime-ridden neighborhood who ends up helping Spider-Man. 
{{spoiler}}
Robert had great skill in gyro mechanicisms due to working at the Science center taught by Peter Parker. He created a cybernetically controlled, rocket-powered magnetic skateboard which he travels with and can attain speeds of 60 miles per hour. He can also scale walls. After Robert stole some jewels, he was chased by [[Spider-Man]]. Rocket Racer escaped but Spider-Man planted a tracer on him and found out his identity.

A criminal leader, whose machines were stolen, created the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]], a giant wheel with lasers, missiles, and spikes that was able to roll onto buildings and higher grounds. Spider-Man and Rocket Racer were able to stop the Big Wheel when Rocket Racer had Spider-Man electrocute the Big Wheel with two electric wires. The criminal was arrested. This taught Robert that education, not crime, would help him in the world to overcome his problems. 

Later in the night, when the criminals demanding protection came, Spider-Man and Robert took care of them.
