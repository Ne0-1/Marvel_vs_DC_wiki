==Fictional character biography==
Athena is the daughter of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] and [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], having emerged fully formed from her father's brow after Zeus consumed Metis in hopes of avoiding a male child who would succeed him, as he had his father.  She took the place of the goddess of wisdom, war, and heroic endeavor in the [[Olympians (comics)|Olympian pantheon]]. Her grey owl companion is named Pallas, a reference to her own name.

In her first appearance, Athena stood alongside Zeus when he forbade Pluto from interferng on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #164</ref> She then observed Pluto's later conflict with Zeus.<ref>''Champions'' #2</ref> Athena later accompanied Zeus to a meeting with Odin, who had requested Olympian aid in opposing the Eternals.<ref>''Thor'' #289</ref> As a result, she participated in the assault on the Eternal home city of Olympia, and fought her counterpart among the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]], [[Thena]], for whom she evinces tremendous dislike.<ref>''Thor'' #291-292</ref>

Athena later battled Thor when Zeus had convinced her that the Avengers were enemies of Olympus. The battle ended when Thor saved her from a pool of molten metal in Hephaestus' workshop, and she realized that Thor was not her enemy. Athena, Hephaestus, and Venus went with the Avengers to heal the wounded Hercules, but Zeus was at his bedside and blasted them all with lightning.<ref>''Avengers'' #283-284</ref> Zeus then forbade Athena and all Olympians from interfering with the Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #285</ref>

In modern times, Athena is responsible for [[Aegis (comics)|Aegis]] gaining his superhuman powers from her gift of her aegis breastplate.<ref>''New Warriors'' (v.2) #10</ref>

Athena later battled Pluto, and then met with the other Olympian gods to discuss their distaste at Ares' brutality.<ref>''Ares'' #1</ref> When Olympus was then invaded by Mikaboshi's demons, Athena fought for Olympus and looked to Ares for battlefield strategy.<ref>''Ares'' #3</ref> Athena joined the Olympians in battle against Mikaboshi's forces, and prevailed with the aid of the benevolent gods of the east.<ref>''Ares'' #5</ref>

She has appeared in ''The Incredible Hercules'', offering shelter to [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Amadeus Cho]] at her estate in Vermont, and warning Hercules both about Ares, and Amadeus' potential for becoming good or evil.  After Hercules and Amadeus ultimately make it to her estate, she warns them of the threat of the [[Secret Invasion]], and takes them to [[San Francisco]], to convene a meeting of Earth's various pantheons, in the shadow of the [[Dreaming Celestial]] to discuss the threat.  Following the "[[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]]"'s victory, and [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Mikaboshi]]'s takeover of the [[Skrull]] slave deities, Athena is shown watching from her scrying pool, and she says that this is an even better result than she had planned for, curiously expressing no alarm or shock when Mikaboshi vows to get revenge on the Olympians. Athena is thus confirmed not to be a Skrull.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #120 (August 2008)</ref>

In the past, she was shown using her foresight to predict the birth of [[Amadeus Cho]] and the events of the [[World War Hulk]], predicting that while the still young Hercules would grow to be a force for good, Amadeus would always be her champion, foretelling the modern times and his final choosing in becoming a force for good himself, and her and Hercules helper <ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #126</ref> Thus she accepted him as her helper.

Meanwhile, [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]] and [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] have taken over the Olympus Group, the modern day seat of power for the Olympians, via the inherited shares of Zeus' and by buying out Poseidon, and have decided the company has a new major goal:  the deaths of Athena and Hercules.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #121-123''</ref> As a part of her master plan, Hera has Aegis killed, and using his body as a bait, lures Athena, Amadeus and Hercules into a trap.  Among Hera's retinue is [[Delphyne Gorgon]], who wishes to kill Athena in revenge for her cursing the original Gorgons.  Athena formulates a new plan to counter Hera, and the heroes escape in the midst of a battle between Hera's forces and the [[Dark Avengers]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #127-128</ref>

When they arrive in Atlantic City, Athena revealed that she's sending them to Hades to retrieve Zeus. However, when they arrive back, Zeus is reborn as a young boy. As Amadeus leaves them to find his sister, Athena and Hercules race to hide Zeus with the [[Mighty Avengers]].  Cho, meanwhile, departs to uncover the truth behind his parents' death and his sister's disappearance, uncertain whether to trust her any longer.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129-132</ref>  Subsequently, he learns that in fact Athena has been posing as an ally of his, former FBI Agent Sexton, to aid him on his adventure, and that she intervened even earlier to save his life from the murder attempt that killed his family.  It is revealed that Pythagoras Dupree was Athena's original choice to be her champion, but he refused the position, and, retreating inside an elaborate web of realities, began killing anyone who could possibly lead Athena to him.  Cho, after confronting Dupree, rejoins Athena, and shares with her information about Hera's superweapon, Continuum.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #135, 137</ref>  

Athena reveals to Cho that he is her choice to be the next Prince of Power, as the 'hero of the mind', as opposed to the hero of strength that Hercules represented.  Further, as there cannot be more than one Prince of Power at any one time, this means that Hercules will soon meet his death.  Cho vows to prevent this, even as they gather forces to mount an assault on New Olympus.  Athena provides [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Aphrodite]] with information on her enemies, the [[Agents of Atlas]], in exchange for her distracting Ares from joining the battle.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #138</ref>  Using the aegis breastplate taken from Aegis, [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]] forged a helmet channeling the power of the Medusa head, which Delphyne used to turn Athena to stone.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #139</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Athena is the mistress of many forms of knowledge.  She is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, swordswoman, and combat strategist, superior even to [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]. As the goddess of wisdom, Athena has devoted a great deal of time throughout the centuries to studying and mastering many areas of knowledge including all fields of non-technical science. Also, as the goddess of battle Athena is quite adept at combat both armed and unarmed and is a highly competent military strategist even superior to her half-brother Ares, the god of war. She is a master of the weapons used at the time of ancient Greece and Rome including the sword, spear, and shield.

Athena possesses the conventional powers of the Olympian gods including superhuman strength, the inability to age upon reaching adulthood as a sign of true immortality, immunity to terrestrial diseases and harm from conventional means and a regenerative ability that heals wounds rapidly should she indeed be injured. Athena is stronger than the average Olympian goddess (Class 25) and can lift about 35 tons optimally. 

Athena possesses considerable magical abilities as an Olympian goddess, at least on a scale to that of Ares. She can fly at great speed, change her size or form to appear as another person, animal or object, render herself and other beings invisible from mortal eyesight (for example when she was a secret participant in the Trojan War), create illusory images, animate inanimate objects, and control the shape and form of objects or people (notably she changed the physical appearance of Trey Rollins, the New Warrior youth aka Aegis). She also bears the gift of foresight used to predict the birth of [[Amadeus Cho]]. Athena can also project mystical energy bolts, cross the distance between dimensions and materialize objects. While she joined with Hercules and Amadeus Cho, she has yet to demonstrate such wide use of her godly abilities, though she has most commonly used it to change from her regular mortal garb into full battle armor as well as summon her mace and shield.

Athena possesses a scrying pool enabling her to see into other dimensions, even into the dimensions of alien Skrull deities virtually unreachable, without detection.
