==Fictional character biography==
Athena is the daughter of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] and [[Metis]], having emerged fully formed from her father's brow after Zeus consumed Metis in hopes of avoiding a male child who would succeed him, as he had his father.  She took the place of the goddess of wisdom, war, and heroic endeavor in the [[Olympians (comics)|Olympian pantheon]]. Her grey owl companion is named Pallas, a reference to her own name.

Her counterpart among the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]] is [[Thena]], for whom she evinces tremendous dislike.

In modern times, Athena is responsible for [[Aegis (comics)|Aegis]] gaining his superhuman powers from her gift of her aegis breastplate.<ref>revealed in ''New Warriors'' vol. 2, #10</ref>

She has appeared in ''The Incredible Hercules'', offering shelter to [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Amadeus Cho]] at her estate in Vermont, and warning Hercules both about Ares, and Amadeus' potential for becoming good or evil.  After Hercules and Amadeus ultimately make it to her estate, she warns them of the threat of the [[Secret Invasion]], and takes them to [[San Francisco]], to convene a meeting of Earth's various pantheons, in the shadow of the [[Dreaming Celestial]] to discuss the threat.  Following the "[[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]]"'s victory, and [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Mikaboshi]]'s takeover of the [[Skrull]] slave deities, Athena is shown watching from her scrying pool, and she says that this is an even better result than she had planned for.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #120 (August 2008)</ref>

Meanwhile, Hera and Pluto have taken over the Olympus Group, the modern day seat of power for the Olympians, via the inherited shares of Zeus' and by buying out Poseidon, and have decided the company has a new major goal:  the deaths of Athena and Hercules.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #121-123''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Athena is the mistress of many forms of knowledge.  She is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, swordswoman, and combat strategist, superior even to [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].
