'''Neon the Unknown''' is a fictional superhero from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] who, like [[the Red Bee]], first appeared in ''Hit Comics'' #1, owned by [[Quality Comics]]. He was featured in issues 1-17. Like many characters owned by that company, he was later bought by [[DC Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Tom Corbet was a member of the Foreign Legion. While pursuing an enemy across the desert, his entire unit died of dehydration. Surely he would have suffered the same fate, if he hadn't found a magical oasis at the very last second. Corbet drank the glowing water and was transformed into Neon the Unknown, with the ability to fly and shoot energy from his hands. 

On December 7, 1941, Neon was recruited by [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] to be a member of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], along with several other Quality Comics heroes, and defend [[Pearl Harbor]] from the Japanese attack. [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]], [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]], [[Hourman]], [[Invisible Hood]], [[Magno (Golden Age)|Magno]], [[Red Torpedo]], and Neon the Unknown fought valiantly, but all but Uncle Sam died. Since then, all of the heroes who "died" in the attack have been revealed as alive, except for Magno and Neon.
