'''Neon the Unknown''' is a fictional superhero from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] created by [[Jerry Iger]] for [[Quality Comics]]. Neon first appeared in a story penciled and inked by [[Lou Fine]] in ''Hit Comics'' #1 and was featured on the cover of that same issue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=The Illustrated History of Superhero Comics of the Golden Age|url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Taylor Publishing]]|location=Dallas, Texas|year=1992|isbn=978-0878338085|page=[https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/ '''??''']}}</ref> His stories ran in issues 1–17. 

Like many characters owned by that company, he was later bought by [[DC Comics]] after Quality ceased operations.

==Fictional character biography==
Tom Corbet was a member of the Foreign Legion. While pursuing an enemy across the desert, his entire unit died of dehydration. Surely he would have suffered the same fate if he hadn't found a magical oasis at the very last second. Corbet drank the glowing water and was transformed into Neon the Unknown, with the ability to fly and shoot energy from his hands. 

On December 7, 1941, Neon was recruited by [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] to be a member of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], along with several other Quality Comics heroes, and defend [[Pearl Harbor]] from the Japanese attack. He, [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]], [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]], [[Hourman]], [[Invisible Hood]], [[Magno (Quality Comics)|Magno]], and [[Red Torpedo (Jim Lockhart)|Red Torpedo]] fought valiantly. However, all but Uncle Sam were seemingly killed.<ref name="dc-free">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Freedom Fighters | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 131 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

As of the 2008 ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' mini-series, Neon is revealed to be alive and has been living at his magical oasis (Magno is the only superhero who appears to have actually died in the defense of Pearl Harbor).

=== The new Neon ===
Called upon during a major crisis hitting the reformed Freedom Fighters, Tom Corbet is confronted by [[Ray (comics)|Langford Terrill]], the former Ray.<ref>http://goldenageheroes.blogspot.com/2008/08/secret-origin-of-neon-unknown.html</ref> Now warped into a more powerful glowing form but more detached from humanity, Corbet refuses his help but lets Terrill drink from his magical oasis. Adding his light-based powers to Neon's energies, Langford Terrill is now empowered as the new Neon the Unknown.

===DC Rebirth===
In [[DC Rebirth]]'s ''[[The Unexpected (2018 comic book)|The Unexpected]]'', Neon the Unknown (real name Colin Nomi) is now a famous artistic painter and a bisexual man, appearing first in ''Supergirl'' #20 (2018). Desiring more inspiration for his work, Colin performed a ritual to evoke the Fires of Creation, which resulted in him acquiring great powers to create or manipulate matter but in exchange for his vision and the lives of his friends. Colin set out on a journey of redemption as Neon the Unknown, and eventually he met up with two others on paths of redemption calling themselves Viking Judge and the Ascendant. The three of them formed The Unexpected, defenders of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]].<ref>''The Unexpected'' #2 (2018)</ref>
