'''King Chimera''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]], a member of the [[superhero]] team the [[Justice Society of America]]. King Chimera first appeared in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 3) #29 (September 2009), and was created by [[Bill Willingham]], [[Matthew Sturges]] and Allen Passalaqua. 

==Publication history==
[[Newsarama]] held an interview with Matthew Sturges, the co-writer of ''[[JSA All-Stars]]'' in [[San Diego]] to discuss the series. Sturges briefly talked about King Chimera and how he wanted to re-invent the character off of [[King Standish|"King" Standish]]. He also mentioned that King Chimera was meant to specifically be with the All-Stars, although he did not reveal why.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090728-jsa-all-stars.html</ref> In a later interview, Sturges said that King wants to be "the most effective hero he can be and will do anything to achieve that goal." Sturges also said how King doesn't care what people think of him and he is not with the team to make friends and wants "to be trained as well as possible, and to take that training and use if effectively against the bad guys." <ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091112-sturges-all-star-jsa.html</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
King Chimera first appeared as [[All-American Kid|Billy Armstrong]]'s new roommate when they joined the JSA. As Billy was somewhat optimistic about the idea, King wasn't. King demonstrated his power of casting illusions to Billy and [[Mister America (DC Comics)|Mr. America]] explaining that his father, "King" Standish (the 1940s crimefighter known as The King) was a master of disguise. Wanting to perfect the art of illusion, he met with a member of a secret order on a distant island. The adepts of the order possessed the power to bend light and sound in order to cast illusions. King mentions that his mother was able to have this power as well.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #29 (July 2009)</ref>

An emergency alarm went off and the JSA went into battle, excluding King and Billy. [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] stayed behind, telling the JSA he'd watch the two, however he sends them off to their room so he could work on a problem the JSA had. During this, Billy is put under mind control by an unknown source, forcing him to stab Mr. Terrific. When the JSA comes back and finds Terrific dead, they watch the tape that was recording the room where he was murdered and see Billy stab him. As they interrogate Billy, he swears he never left the room but King had previously told them otherwise.

Later, [[Jay Garrick|Flash]] takes King to his office where they discuss King's attitude and why King is with the JSA. King explains that he's with the JSA to have an observation of the older members of the team, wanting to learn from them. Flash states he and the others are flattered but think it would be easier for him if he tried to be cooperative with everybody. King disagrees with his reasoning.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #30 (August 2009)</ref><ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #31 (September 2009)</ref>

As Billy was being interrogated by the JSA, they see on a video tape that after the murder Billy went to King's locker and took an energy dampener out of his bag, which had jammed Mr. Terrific's T-Spheres and had allowed Billy to sneak up on him. Billy suggests that the person on the tape was one of King's duplicates. Flash then receives audio in the tape, revealing that Billy was resisting. They conclude that Billy was put under mind control by King and was forced to kill Mr. Terrific.

[[Power Girl]] and [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]] then start to interrogate King. He arrogantly explains he doesn't have mind control powers.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #32 (October 2009)</ref> He manages to escape the two. When they catch him, the Brownstone is immediately put under attack by villains the JSA previously fought. Despite his interrogation, King fights alongside the team, notably helping [[Magog (comics)|Magog]] out. Soon after, he sees Billy knock out [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], realizing he was the traitor all along. King tries to stop him by holding him at gunpoint, but King's gun turns out to be an illusion. Billy sees this and escapes King.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #33 (November 2009)</ref>

===Justice Society of America 80-Page Giant===
In the story arc called "Heart of Steel", King has a very brief appearance. When [[Commander Steel#Nathan Heywood|Citizen Steel]] says that he hears his mother's voice, King thinks that he will be blamed for him hearing things.<ref>''Justice Society of America 80-Page Giant'' (November 2009)</ref>

===JSA All-Stars===
{{main|JSA All-Stars}}
King Chimera ended up with the new "JSA All-Stars" team when the Justice Society decided to split up. While Magog puts the team under training, King and [[Damage (comics)|Damage]] break into an argument, resulting in Damage punching him. When King leaves to cool off with some water, [[Cyclone (DC Comics)|Cyclone]] offers him a towel; as he accepts it, they both show an attraction to each other.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #1 (December 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
King Chimera presumably inherited his powers from his mother and/or father. He has the power to cast illusions as well as flight. King mentions he is [[eidetic]]. King is known for his ego and boasting about his genius intellect.
