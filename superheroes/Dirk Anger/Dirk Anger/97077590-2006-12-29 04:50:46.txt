[[General]] '''Dirk Anger''' is a satiric Marvel Comics character appearing in the book ''[[Nextwave]]''. He was created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]].

Anger is a thinly veiled, over-the-top parody of [[Nick Fury]]. Ellis originally intended to use Fury[http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/36/t/004065.html], but when that character was unavailable, he created Dirk Anger.

==Fictional character biography==
Dirk Anger is the Director of the Highest Anti Terrorist Effort ([[H.A.T.E.]]), and apparently oversees all operations aboard the Aeromarine (a reference to the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] - but while the Helicarrier is essentially a flying [[aircraft carrier]], the Aeromarine appears to consist of several [[submarines]], bolted together, with rocket engines).  Anger is fully aware that The [[Beyond Corporation©]], which funds H.A.T.E., is the newest version of [[terrorist cell]] S.I.L.E.N.T. However, he simply doesn't care.

Anger is over ninety years old, but has, through chemical means ("H.A.T.E. has the best drugs"), an extended lifespan.  It has been hinted that Anger has been married at least once, and that he has met [[Winston Churchill]] (and bested him in a [[hula hoop]] contest).

Anger has a multitude of psychological issues, including [[misogyny]], [[bulimia]], [[alcoholism]], [[nicotine addiction]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[sadism]] and a fixation on a flowery house dress that may have belonged to his mother (In a scene reminiscent of [[Norman Bates]]). At one point he was fed chopped-up baby [[chick]]s through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous tube]]; it is unknown whether this is a regular treatment. He has also mentioned that his wife, upon turning forty, refused to give in to a fetish of his involving a chicken and a bathful of acid.

Dirk Anger accidentally (and finally) committed suicide during his pursuit of the Nextwave squad. However, the Beyond Corporation© had installed a "Zombie Chip" in his brain, preventing him from dying, yet leaving him craving human brains.
