'''Revanche''' (Real Name: '''Kwannon''') was originally an assassin for the Japanese crime syndicate, The Hand, and the lover of crime boss, [[Matsu'o Tsurabaya]], who was transformed into a telepathic mutant. She first appeared in ''X-Men # 19'' and died in ''X-Men # 31''

==History==
While on a mission for the Hand, Kwannon suffered a serious injury that left her brain-dead, with no hope for recovery, until hand operatives found Betsy Braddock (aka [[Psylocke]]), who had been transported to Japan by the Seige Perilous. Matsu'o was told by [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] (a servant of [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]) that it would be possible to use Psylocke's telepathy to restore Kwannon's mind. Matsu'o agreed, not knowing that Spiral had a penchant for trickery. Spiral used her reality-warping powers to actually transfer Psylocke's mind, soul, and even a small portion of her mutant DNA into Kwannon's body, while placing Kwannon's mind in Psylocke's [[Caucasian]] form. The result was that Psylocke was now trapped in the body of a Japanese ninja (who was now a telepathic mutant as well, thanks to the DNA transfer) and Kwannon now inahbited the body of a British telepath. Matsu'o tried to brainwash Psylocke (who he thought was his lover Kwannon) into becoming a criminal, but she eventually broke free of his control and fled back to America, where she rejoined the X-Men. 

Kwannon still remained in Japan with the Hand, who realized that the women's minds were swapped. They helped her train her new body in the use of martial arts, and she went to the US to confront Psylocke. Becuase of the fact that Kwannon and Betsy shared the same telepathic powers, they had a subliminal psychic link that let them share memories, so Kwannon believed that she was the true Betsy Braddock. She infiltrated the X-Mansion, and fought Psylocke, by manifesting a psychic [[katana]] that functioned much like Psylocke's psychic knife. When the X-Men arrived to save Psylocke,  Kwannon (who assumed the codename "Revanche", which is [[French]] for "Revenge") claimed that Psylocke was an imposter. Unable to determine who was the real Betsy Braddock (since the psychic bond Revanche shared with Psylocke made the women's minds an amalgam of each others thoughts and memories), the X-Men went to Japan to uncover the truth. Revanche surprised fellow X-Men [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] when she was able to read and speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] perfectly (a talent that the real Betsy Braddock never had), and translated a diary that said that Psylocke had fused her mind with Revanche by accident. They found and confronted Matsu'o, but he would reveal nothing about what had truly transpired.

Revanche returned to the USA as a member of the X-men, and found a [[leper]] colony for mutants with the lethal legacy virus, where it was revealed that Revanche herself had the deadly disease. Revanche returned to Japan and confronted Matsu'o, using her telepathy to force the answers out of him, that she was Kwannon in Betsy Braddock's original body. As a way to atone for his mistakes, Kwannon asked Matsu'o to kill her, so she would die by her own choosing, and not as a victim of a disease. Matsu'o stabbed Revanche with a ceromonial dagger used for [[sepuku]] (honorable suicide), and with her death, the psychic link she had with Psylocke was dissolved, and Psylocke's mind was once agian the mind of Betsy Braddock.

==Powers==
Revanche had the power of [[telepathy]], which enabled her to read minds, communicate with others by broadcasting her thoughts, control minds, and create realistic illusions by altering people's perceptions. She could physically manifest her telepathic powers as a blade (like Psylocke's psychic knife), but instead of a small energy dagger, she created an ornate psionic [[katana]] sword. Anyone "sliced" by her sword would be knocked out, as the blade would disrupt their central nevous system. Revanche could also use her psychic katana to force her way into an opponent's mind, and reveal any thoughts that were originally shielded from her telepathic powers.
