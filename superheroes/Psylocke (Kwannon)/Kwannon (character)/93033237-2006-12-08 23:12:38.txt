'''Revanche''' ('''Kwannon''') was a short-lived [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. She was created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and first appeared in ''[[X-Men, vol. 2|X-Men]]'' ([[1993#February|February 1993]])

Kwannon was an [[assassin]] for the [[Japan]]ese crime syndicate [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]] and lover of crime boss [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]]. After she was mortally injured, The Hand captured the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[superhero]] [[Psylocke]] and permanently switched the minds of the two, creating innumerable problems for both.

==Character history==
While on a mission against the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], Kwannon suffered a serious injury that left her brain-dead with no hope for recovery until Hand operatives found Betsy Braddock (aka [[Psylocke]]), who had been transported to Japan by the Siege Perilous. Matsu'o was told by [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] (a servant of [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]) that it would be possible to use Psylocke's telepathy to restore Kwannon's mind. Matsu'o agreed, not knowing that Spiral had a penchant for trickery. Spiral used her reality-warping powers to actually transfer Psylocke's mind, soul and even a small portion of her mutant DNA into Kwannon's body while placing Kwannon's mind in Psylocke's [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] form. The result was that Psylocke was now trapped in the body of a Japanese ninja who was now a telepathic mutant as well and Kwannon now inhabited the body of a British telepath. Matsu'o tried to brainwash Psylocke, who he thought was his lover Kwannon, into becoming a criminal but she eventually broke free of his control and fled back to America, where she rejoined the X-Men.

Kwannon still remained in Japan with the Hand, who realized that the women's minds were swapped. They helped her train her new body in the use of martial arts and she went to the US to confront Psylocke. Because Kwannon and Betsy shared the same telepathic powers, they had a subliminal psychic link that let them share memories, so Kwannon believed that she was the true Betsy Braddock. She infiltrated the X-Mansion and fought Psylocke by manifesting a psychic [[katana]] that functioned much like Psylocke's psychic knife. When the X-Men arrived to save Psylocke,  Kwannon (who assumed the codename "Revanche", which is [[French language|French]] for "Revenge") claimed that Psylocke was an impostor. Unable to determine who was the real Betsy Braddock (since the psychic bond Revanche shared with Psylocke made the women's minds an amalgam of each others thoughts and memories), the X-Men went to Japan to uncover the truth. Revanche surprised fellow X-Men [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Beast and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] when she was able to read and speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] perfectly (a talent that the real Betsy Braddock never had), and translated a diary that said that Psylocke had fused her mind with Revanche by accident. They found and confronted Matsu'o, but he would reveal nothing about what had truly transpired.

Revanche returned to the USA as a member of the X-men and found a [[leper]] colony for mutants with the lethal [[Legacy_virus|Legacy Virus]] where it was revealed that Revanche herself had the deadly disease. Revanche returned to Japan and confronted Matsu'o, using her telepathy to force the answers out of him, that she was Kwannon in Betsy Braddock's original body. As a way to atone for his mistakes, Kwannon asked Matsu'o to kill her, so she would die by her own choosing and not as a victim of a disease. Matsu'o stabbed Revanche with a ceremonial dagger used for [[seppuku]] (honorable suicide) and with her death, the psychic link she had with Psylocke was dissolved and Psylocke's mind was once again the mind of Betsy Braddock.  Kwannon's epitaph, left by Elisabeth and Matsu'o on her grave in Japan, read "Kwannon, love that transcended body and soul".

She was later seen in the [[House of M]] altered reality as a member of [[Magneto]]'s elite guards, as depicted in ''House of M''#7.  It is unknown whether or not she continued to live after the House of M reality was undone.

==Powers and abilities==
Revanche had the power of [[telepathy]], which enabled her to read minds, communicate with others by broadcasting her thoughts, control minds and create realistic illusions by altering people's perceptions. She could physically manifest her telepathic powers as a blade (like Psylocke's psychic knife), but instead of a small energy dagger, she created an ornate psionic [[katana]] sword. Anyone "sliced" by her sword would be knocked out, as the blade would disrupt their central nevous system. Revanche could also use her psychic katana to force her way into an opponent's mind and reveal any thoughts that were originally shielded from her telepathic powers.

Originally, Kwannon possessed low-level empathic psi-talents which allowed her to sense the emotional state of others.  This ability was what allowed Kwannon's mind to survive a body transfer with a telepath like Psylocke.

==Alternate Versions==

===[[Age of Apocalypse]]===
In the 6-part 2005 limited series, ''[[X-Men: Age of Apocalypse]]'' written by Akira Yoshida and drawn by Chris Bachalo, which was part of Marvel's celebration of the 10th anniversary of the original AOA, a counterpart of Psylocke was introduced, who was most likely also the AOA version of Kwannon. This Psylocke is a ninja who looks and acts almost exactly like the original pre-transormation version of Kwannon in 616, except with black instead of purple hair, and with the ability to generate psychic blades (an ability manifested by 616 Betsy Braddock only after she body-switched with 616 Kwannon, who was herself a low-level mutant psychic), which she used to make the AOA's version of [[X-23]], Wolverine's daughter Kirika by [[Mariko Yashida]], regain her suppressed memory. After helping the X-Men in battling the Guthrie siblings and thwarting the machinations of Mister Sinister, she then joined the other Japanese members of the X-Men ([[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], Kirika, and [[Silver Samurai]]) in migrating to the Clan Yashida's refugee colony of New Japan.

===[[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe===

In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' # 18, S.T.R.I.K.E Psi-Division agent Elisabeth Braddock is killed by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] in order to destroy [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]], who has taken her as his host. In #25, she later appears at the gala celebration held at the [[X-Mansion]] in the last issue of [[Mark Millar]]'s run on the title, this time in the body of a Japanese teenager. She explains that after she died, her consciousness migrated to the body of a comatose Japanese girl named Kwannon, who was "happy to go the light", and that despite the shocked reactions of her listeners - "Isn't that obscene?" - she herself is okay with it as she's "never felt perkier".

==Appearances in other media==
[[Image:Revanche_vs_Psylocke.jpg|thumb|170px|Revanche fights Psylocke in ''X-Men Next Dimension''.]]

Revanche has a cameo in the X-Men based [[fighting game]] [[X-Men: Next Dimension]].  In the game, there are actually two separate Psylocke characters, one appearing as the telepathic Psylocke (called "Betsy" in the game), and a second, appearing as the telekinetic version of Psylocke (sporting her trademark psionic katana).  Though neither character is technically Kwannon, one of the telekinetic Psylocke's costumes is the Revanche costume. The Revanche costume also alters the look of the psi-katana, making it white with a pale pink aura (while TK Psylocke, shown next to Revanche in the screenshot, has a rose colored energy blade)

In the third installment of the X-Men film franchise, Psylocke appears in an asian body, which many fans presumed, was Revanche's, as even writer Zack Penn has admitted that he has no idea how Psylocke made it into the final film, since he had no such intentions in his script.

==Trivia==
The name "Revanche" is not simply an alternate derivative of the word "revenge", but rather means a "policy designed to recover lost territory or status".
