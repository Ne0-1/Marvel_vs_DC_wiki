'''Red Star''' (a.k.a. '''Leonid Konstantinovitch Kovar''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Russia]]n [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC universe]]. A former member of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], he first appeared under the name '''Starfire''' in ''Teen Titans'' , #18 (Dec. 1968). He is not to be confused with the female DC character [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]].

==Fictional character biography==
Leonid's father, Konstantin, was an archaeologist, and when the two investigated a spaceship that had crashed into the Yenesi River, the ship exploded. It imbued Leonid with energy, and gave him powers of super-strength, speed, and [[pyrokinesis]]. Being a Russian patriot who believed in [[socialism]], he offered his services to his country and became the first official Russian superhero in the DC universe, taking the name '''Starfire'''. He would not reappear until ''New Teen Titans'' #18 in 1982. A new character named [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] was on the team at this point, and so Leonid changed his codename to Red Star.

In ''New Titans'' #76 ([[1991]]), Red Star joined the Teen Titans. After two years, Red Star left the Titans with [[Pantha]] and [[Wildebeest (comics)|Baby Wildebeest]], forming a unique and somewhat dysfunctional family unit (''New Titans'' #114, 1994).  He was not seen again until the ''[[Justice League|JLA]]/Titans'' miniseries in [[1999]].  He made a few minor appearances over the next few years and was most recently seen in  ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #4, in which he was frozen solid by [[Superboy-Prime]] after witnessing the brutal murder of Pantha and Baby Wildebeest.

He had, apparently, joined the Titans during the one year jump, but left the team for unknown reasons.  He recently helped them in their search for [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. Since his last appearance he had stopped an invasion of Russia by the aliens from his origin, and been appointed State Protector. He is now based in a ship similar to the one that exploded, hovering over Moscow.

==Known Powers==
Red Star was empowered by unknown alien energies that have caused chain reactions within his molecular structure, altering his physical abilities and reflexes. Over time, these abilities have changed and he has gone from being an incredibly fast and strong being into one with an array of powers.

Red Star's abilities include superhuman strength, speed and endurance. Red Star can also morph into a form that is composed of fire-like energy, in which he can form and redirect energy. It seems his powers have the same effect on Kryptonians as his namesake, as he used them against [[Superboy-Prime]] during the [[Sinestro Corps War]].

Red Star appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series episode ''Snowblind.'' He assisted Starfire during a mission in Russia and quickly became a friend and ally to her and the Titans. His powers are similar to Starfire's, since he has super strength, speed, stamina and can fire red energy beams; however, he can only do this while in his red mutant form. However, his powers - unlike hers - are fueled by intense and dangerous radiation.

In the cartoon show, Red Star's powers were the results of scientific experiments performed by the Soviet government and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Professor Chang|Professor Chang]], in the hopes of producing a new [[supersoldier]]. Unfortunately, Red Star lost control of his powers, and the energy within him burst out and exploded, causing mass destruction for which he was blamed. Fearing that he could lose control of his powers again, Red Star locked himself away in an abandoned nuclear power plant, releasing his excess energy into canisters to regulate his powers.

However, when bacteria mutated from a nuclear radiation leak began to attack the Titans and a nearby town, Red Star courageously defeats the monster. At that point, he begins to lose control of his powers again and told Starfire to take him far away. She took him to the void of space where he disappeared in a massive explosion. 

He made a surprise reappearance in "Titans Together", and participated in the battle against the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. He helps by stopping [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Steamroller|Steamroller]] from tackling [[Beast Boy]], and also by tackling Mammoth earlier than that (having been given the opportunity to do so under the smoke cover provided from Malchior's fire breath bouncing off Raven's shield). This origin of Red Star was made up by Story Editor/Writer [[Rob Hoegee]].

Red Star was voiced by [[Jason Marsden]].
