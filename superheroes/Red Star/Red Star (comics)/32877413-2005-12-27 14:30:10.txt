'''Red Star''' (a.k.a. Leonid Kovar) is a [[fictional]] [[Russian]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC universe]]. He has been most notably an associate and one time member of the [[Teen Titans]]. He first appeared in ''Teen Titans'' vol 1 #18 ([[1968]]). Leonid's father, Konstantin, was an archealogist, and when the two investigated a spaceship that had crashed into the Yenesi River, the ship exploded. It imbued Leonid with energy, and gave him powers of superstrength, speed, flight, and [[pyrokinesis]]. Being a Russian patriot who believed in [[socialism]], he offered his services to his country and became the first official Russian superhero in the DC universe, taking the name Starfire. He would not reappear until ''New Teen Titans'' #18 in 1982. A new character named [[Starfire]] was on the team at this point, and so Leonid changed his codename to Red Star.

In ''New Titans'' #76 ([[1991]]), Red Star joined the Teen Titans until he left after two years. He was not seen again until the ''[[JLA]]/Titans'' miniseries in [[1999]], and has not been seen since. He currently resides in Science City.

Although some writers such as [[Marv Wolfman]] had plans for him, he never reached the spotlight, and fell back to become a rarely-used reserve member of the Titans.

==Appearences in Other Media==
Red Star appeared in the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans animated series]] episode entitled ''Snowblind''. He assisted Starfire during a mission in Russia and quickly became an ally to her and the Titans. His powers are similar to Starfire's, since he has super strength, and can fire red energy beams. In the cartoon show, Red Star's powers were the results of scientific experiments performed by the Russian government and [[Professor Chang]], in the hopes of producing a new super-soldier. Unfortunately, Red Star lost control of his powers and the energy within him burst out and exploded, causing mass destruction. Because of the scale of the blast, it is possible that he is responsible for the infamous [[Tunguska]] incident. Fearing that he could lose control of his powers again, Red Star locked himself away in a nuclear power plant, releasing his excess energy into canisters to regulate his powers. But when bacteria mutated by nuclear radiation began to attack the Titans and a nearby town, Red Star courageously defeats the monster. At that point, he began to lose control of his powers again and told Starfire to take him far away. She took him to the void of space where
he dissappeared in a massive explosion. It is unknown at this point whether he will make a reappearance.

Red Star was voiced by [[Jason Marsden]].
