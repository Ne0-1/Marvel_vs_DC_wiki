'''Martha Connors''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a supporting character of [[Spider-Man]]. She is the wife of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], also known as the Lizard, and much of her character's story revolves around her constant suffering, yet perseverance through her husband's constant transformations.

==Fictional character biography==
Sometime before her first appearance, Martha met and married surgeon and biologist [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]. Together they had a son named [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy]] and their life seemed perfect. However, Curt, an amputee, was looking for a way to regrow lost limbs. Despite Martha's worrying for her husband's safety, Curt had transformed into a terrible lizard monster. Martha managed to meet up with [[Spider-Man]] who had encountered the Lizard already and she told her story to the wall-crawler prompting him to successfully cure Curt, albeit temporarily.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #6</ref>

During a major story arc, Martha and Billy were kidnapped by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] branch led by [[Silvermane]] who wanted Curt to decipher an ancient tablet. Once again, Curt transformed into the Lizard and it took the combined effort Spider-Man and [[Human Torch]] save Martha and Billy who were happily reunited with a cured Curt. Curt would continue to transform into the Lizard, but each time Martha would stick by her husband.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #74-77</ref>
