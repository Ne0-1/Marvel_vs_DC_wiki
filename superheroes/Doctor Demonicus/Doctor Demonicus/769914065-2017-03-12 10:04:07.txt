==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=June 2014}}
Doctor Demonicus first appeared in ''Godzilla'' #4 (Nov 1977), and was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Tom Sutton]].

==Fictional character biography==
Douglas Birely was born in [[Culver City, California]]. As a scientist, he was studying the correlation between radioactivity and mutation when he is contaminated by a radioactive spill. As Doctor Demonicus, he is a criminal [[geneticist]] and subversive. His discovery of the Lifestone allows him to create immense monsters mutated from animals. These include Batragon, Ghilaron, Lepirax and Centipoor. Using his monsters and his troops he raids oil tankers from his secret laboratory on one of the Aleutian Islands. The monsters are defeated by [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]] and Demonicus is defeated by [[Gabe Jones]] and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. When Jones confronts Demonicus during this story, Demonicus is altogether willing to tell him his background, and when referencing his monsters' creations he says "Knowing of his nuclear radiation mutation, I took my cues from Godzilla himself." When Godzilla begins slaying the creatures he has made, Demonicus becomes unstable, even claiming he would battle Godzilla directly in order to save the last of the creatures.<ref>''Godzilla'' #4-5</ref>

Demonicus becomes an ally of the alien [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#M|Myndai]], [[Maur-Konn]], who gives Demonicus his gigantic space satellite base orbiting the moon. Demonicus later uses his genetic and robot monsters the [[Starchild (Marvel Comics)|Starchild]], [[Cerberus (robot)|Cerberus]] and the [[Hand of Five]] against the [[Shogun Warriors (comics)|Shogun Warriors]] Raydeen, Combatra and Dangard Ace. Demonicus launches a meteor strike against Earth from his space station base. He is foiled by the Shogun Warriors and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. again.<ref>''Shogun Warriors'' #8-14</ref>

He eventually captures, enslaves, and further mutates Godzilla (however, the creature is deliberately not named as such because Marvel's license to use the monster had by that point expired. To give readers a clue as to who the creature was, Demonicus refers to the creature as being "my once-greatest enemy", referring to Godzilla's defeat of his original creations. This version of Godzilla, according to ''G-Fan'' magazine, still makes occasional appearances in the Marvel universe).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The creature also, for reasons unknown, shrunk once Demonicus had captured and enslaved him. He sets Godzilla against the [[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]]. Demonicus also salvages [[Iron Man]]'s original [[Iron Man's armor|armor]] and uses it to attack the Avengers West Coast personally. He is defeated by Tony Stark.<ref>''Iron Man'' #193, 196</ref> He is later mutated by the Lifestone and the demon [[Raksasa (comics)|Raksasa]]. His alter ego, Douglas Birely, develops [[skin cancer]] which is kept under control by devices in his costume.  

Demonicus is the founder, creator and leader of the [[Pacific Overlords]], and with them battles [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and the Avengers West Coast. He raises a land mass from the Pacific Ocean floor just north of Hawaii, and on it founds the new nation of Demonica with himself as ruler.  He attempts, unsuccessfully, to get the [[United Nations]] to recognize Demonica as a sovereign nation.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49â€“51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>  However he is seemingly killed when Demonica sinks back into the Pacific.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #70-74</ref>

Doctor Demonicus is eventually arrested, convicted and incarcerated for his crimes. He was sentenced to "[[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]]", a supervillain prison facility. He was among of the 43 villains who escape during the breakout engineered by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #2</ref>

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] hires him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helps them fight the New Avengers but is taken down by Doctor Strange.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2</ref> Demonicus participates in the Hood's temporary alliance with superheroes in order to battle an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' 1-6</ref> As seen in flashbacks, the Hood had used his powers to help Demonicus and the others escape jail. During a secretive gathering, Demonicus and the others learn of the Skrulls' attempt to infiltrate and control their organization.<ref>''New Avengers'' #46</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>
