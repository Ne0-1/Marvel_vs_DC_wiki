'''Doctor Demonicus''' ('''Douglas Birely''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He possess advanced knowledge of [[genetic engineering]], though is not as versatile as [[Arnim Zola]] or the [[High Evolutionary]].  He has clashed with [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] and [[Shogun Warriors]], in addition to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

==Fictional character biography==
Douglas Birely was born in [[Culver City, California]]. As a scientist, he was studying the correlation between radioactivity and mutation when he is contaminated by a radioactive spill. As '''Dr. Demonicus''', he is a criminal [[geneticist]] and criminal subversive who creates monsters and discovers the [[Lifestone (comics)|Lifestone]].  He creates numerous immense monsters mutated from animals. These include [[Batragon]], [[Ghilaron]], [[Lepirax]] and [[Centipoor]]. Using his monsters and his troops he raids oil tankers from his secret laboratory on the Aleutian Islands.  The monsters were defeated by [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]], and Demonicus was defeated by [[Gabe Jones]] and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. When Jones confronts Demonicus during this story, Demonicus is altogether willing to tell him his background, and when referencing his monsters' creations he says "''Knowing of his nuclear radiation mutation, I took my cues from '''Godzilla himself'''''",  and when Godzilla begins slaying the creatures he's made, Demonicus begins to become unstable, even claiming he would battle Godzilla directly in order to save the last of the creatures left alive at the time.<ref>''Godzilla'' #4-5</ref>

Demonics becomes an ally of the alien [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#M|Myndai]], [[Maur-Konn]], who gives Demonicus his gigantic space satellite base orbiting the moon. Demonicus later uses his genetic and robot monsters [[Starchild (Marvel Comics)|Starchild]], [[Cerberus (robot)|Cerberus]] and the [[Hand of Five]] against the [[Shogun Warriors]] Raydeen, Combatra, and Dangard Ace. Demonicus launches a meteor strike against Earth from his space station base. He is foiled by the Shogun Warriors and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. again.<ref>''Shogun Warriors'' #8-14</ref>

He eventually captures, enslaves, and further mutates Godzilla. (However, the creature is not deliberately named as such because Marvel's license to use the monster had by that point expired. To give readers a clue as to who the creature was, Demonicus refers to the creature as being "Once my greatest enemy", referring to Godzilla's defeat of his original creations. This version of Godzilla, according to ''G-Fan'' magazine, still makes occasional appearances in the Marvel universe every so often.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}) The creature also, for reasons unknown, shrunk once Demonicus had captured and enslaved him. He sets Godzilla against the [[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]]. Demonicus also salvages [[Iron Man]]'s original [[Iron Man's armor|armor]] and uses it to attack the Avengers West Coast personally. He is defeated by Tony Stark.<ref>''Iron Man'' #193, 196</ref> He is later mutated by the Lifestone and the demon [[Raksasa (comics)|Raksasa]].  It is revealed his alter ego, Douglas Birely has [[skin cancer]] which is kept under control by devices in his costume.  

Demonicus is also the founder of the [[Pacific Overlords]], and with them battles [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and the Avengers West Coast. He raises a land mass from the Pacific Ocean floor just north of Hawaii, and on it founds the new nation of Demonica with himself as ruler.  He attempts, unsuccessfully, to get the [[United Nations]] to recognize Demonica as a sovereign nation.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>  However he is seemingly killed when Demonica sunk back into the Pacific.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #70-74</ref>
