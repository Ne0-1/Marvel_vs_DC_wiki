'''Doctor Demonicus''' ('''Douglas Birely''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He possess advanced knowledge of [[genetic engineering]], though is not as versatile as [[Arnim Zola]] or the [[High Evolutionary]].  He has clashed with [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] and [[Shogun Warriors]].

==Fictional character biography==
Douglas Birely was born in [[Culver City, California]]. As a scientist, he was studying the correlation between radioactivity and mutation when he was contaminated by a radioactive spill. As '''Dr. Demonicus''', he is a criminal [[geneticist]] who creates monsters and discovered the [[Lifestone (comics)|Lifestone]].  He was also a founding member of the [[Pacific Overlords]].  As a former ally of [[Maur-Konn]], who of which gave Demonicus his satellite headquarters, he created numerous immense monsters including [[Batragon]], [[Ghilaron]], [[Lepirax]] and [[Centipoor]].
He later used [[Starchild (Marvel Comics)|Starchild]], [[Cerberus (robot)|Cerberus]] and the [[Hand of Five]] and founded the nation of Demonica.  He eventually enslaves [[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]] but was mutated by the Lifestone and the demon [[Raksasa (comics)|Raksasa]].  His alter ego, Douglas Birely has [[skin cancer]] which is kept under control by devices in his costume.  However he was seemingly killed when Demonica sunk into the Pacific.

He apparently finances his criminal efforts and schemes by producing boybands for the music industry, and as a skilled (and amoral) geneticist, when he says "producing", he means it quite literally.

Doctor Demonicus was eventually arrested, convicted  and incarcerated for his crimes. He was 
sentenced to "[[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]]", a supervillain prison facility. He was among of the 43 villains that escaped during the breakout engineered by [[Electro (comics)#Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].  

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Demonicus wears a life-support suit that keeps his skin cancer in remission.
