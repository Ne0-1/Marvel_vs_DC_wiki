'''Doctor Mid-Nite''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by writer [[Charles Reizenstein]] and artist [[Stanley Josephs Aschmeir]], the original Doctor Mid-Nite first appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #25 ([[1941#April|April 1941]]).

In the history of the [[DC Universe]], three different [[fictional character|characters]] have assumed the role of Doctor Mid-Nite. All of them have been all but [[blindness|blind]] in daylight but are able to see clearly in darkness, and have utilized special visors and smoky “black out” bombs to give them the upper hand against enemies. All three have also been actual medical doctors. Two have also had [[sidekick]] [[owl]]s.

Like many [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] heroes, Doctor Mid-Nite was a core member of the [[Justice Society of America]]. His two successors were also members of the group or an offshoot.

==Character history==
===Charles McNider===
The first Doctor, [[surgeon]], '''Charles McNider''', was the earliest [[Blindness|blind]] superhero, predating [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] by more than two decades.  One night, he was called to remove a [[bullet]] from a witness who was to testify against the [[mafia|mob]].  However, a mobster threw a [[grenade]] into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider.  McNider thought his days as a surgeon were over until one day, as he was recovering, an [[owl]] crashed through his window (reminiscent of the incident that inspired [[Batman]] to dress as a [[bat]]).  Taking off the [[bandage]]s that were covering his [[eye]]s, he found that he could see, but only in perfect [[darkness]]. Using his newfound ability, he developed a special [[visor]] that let him see in light and "blackout bombs" that block out all light, and used these to fight crime. He adopted the owl, Hooty, and appointed him as his sidekick. He later joined the [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[All-Star Squadron]]. In 1951, McNider briefly took over the role of [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] after the JSA had disbanded and Ted Knight, the original Starman, had suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of his participation in the development of the atomic bomb. McNider was one of the casualties of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], dying alongside the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] and [[Hourman]] at the hands of Extant.

===Beth Chapel===
'''Doctor Midnight''' (note the different spelling) was '''Beth Chapel''', an [[African-American]] woman who was McNider's student.  While working at a hospital, she was blinded by an oxygen explosion during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and discovered she now had the same night-vision as her predecessor. Alongside [[Rick Tyler]], the second [[Hourman]], she eventually joined the superhero team [[Infinity, Inc.]] after being initially rejected. She was later killed alongside a cadre of other heroes in the [[Shadow Fighters (comics)|Shadow Fighters]], including fellow Inifinitor [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] II, by the [[supervillain]] [[Eclipso]] in issue 13 of the Eclipso series.

===Pieter Cross===
The second Doctor Mid-Nite is '''Pieter Cross'''.  He was a Norwegian-born doctor who ran a free clinic in [[Portsmouth City (comics)|Portsmouth City]], [[Oregon]], which led him to investigate a new street [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] called A39, an accidental derivative of the steroid-like Venom, produced by an evil [[corporation]] called Praeda Industries, run by former [[Batman]] villains [[Terrible Trio]]. In retaliation, the corporation drugged him and he was involved in a car accident which took the life of a young woman.  Like the previous bearers of the name, he found that he could only see in pitch darkness.  He, too, donned a costume to fight crime.  

The new Dr. Mid-Nite carries high-tech medical equipiment in addition to his crimefighting apparatus (which includes blackout bombs). Various people he has helped aid him in his work as a crime-fighter and community surgeon, including a number of street kids. He later joined an incarnation of the [[Justice Society of America]], where he had a brief romance with his teammate, [[Black Canary]]. 

Dr. Mid-Nite is one of the most prominent physicians in the DCU, along with his JSA teammate and colleague [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]. They are often called upon when an autopsy is needed, or when a hero needs major surgery. Among the notable achievements of Cross as a physician include determining [[Alan Scott]] was composed of the green flame of the Starheart, giving [[Power Girl]] her annual checkups as well as testing her powers, emergency surgery on [[Rick Tyler|Hourman]], removal of the [[Brainiac]] virus from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], the autopsy of [[Sue Dibny]] during the [[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]] storyline, and removing the sniper bullet that wounded [[Lois Lane]] in [[Umec]] during the ''Battery'' story arc in [[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]].

Cross is usually portrayed as being a physician first and a superhero second. In his miniseries, the scanners in his cowl-lenses identified health risks as well as threats. According to JSA, Cross is a vegetarian.

===Owls===
Both Dr. McNider and Dr. Cross had trained owls as [[sidekick]]s. McNider trained the same owl which crashed through his window and led to the discovery of his powers; named "Hooty," he and McNider shared many adventures during the Golden Age. Hooty even took some [[Miraclo]] in one adventure, leading to him gaining super-strength and super-speed, albeit temporarily. Cross employs an owl named "Charlie," named after the original Mid-Nite. Charlie has a mini-camera around his neck which can feed directly to a display in Dr Mid-Nite's goggles.

==Other versions==
In [[Kingdom Come]], [[Alex Ross]] portrayed Doctor Mid-Nite (known here as '''Midnight''') as a disembodied cowl and the thick black smoke reminiscent of his "blackout bombs". He was said to be the spirit of Dr. Charles McNider.

Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris' [[JSA: The Liberty File]]  as a [[World War II]] United States intelligence agent code-named '''the Owl'''. He was primarily unchanged, but shown to be a good-natured womanizer.

==Powers and abilities==
McNider possessed the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special [[infrared]] lenses, McNider could see in light; later in his life, his lenses became more ineffective as his eyesight continued to deteriorate even further, inhibiting his daylight vision. McNider also employed "blackout bombs," which released pitch-black gas that blinded villains and allowed McNider to see. For a time he used a weapon called a "cryotuber" which could either control the nervous system of an opponent, or fire bursts of heat or cold. As Starman II, McNider used various star-themed gadgets, including an airship designed by the [[Red Torpedo]]. McNider was also a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a gifted physician and author. 

Chapel possessed the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special infrared lenses, Chapel could also see in light. Chapel also employed "blackout bombs," which released pitch-black gas that blinded villains and allowed Chapel to see. Chapel was also a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a physician.

Cross's eyes were altered by a chemical injection, allowing him to see the ultra-violet and infrared spectrums, but blinding him to visible light.  Cross can also equip special ultrasonic lenses, as well as receive images from a camera strapped to his owl, Charlie. Cross also employs "blackout bombs," which release pitch-black gas that blinds villains; these "blackout bombs" are improvements over those used by his predecessors. Cross's gauntlets carry a wide variety of chemicals, medicines, and small-scale surgical and tactical equipment. Cross is a superb athlete and martial artist, as well as a top physician.
