'''Doctor Mid-Nite''' or '''Doctor Midnight''' is the moniker of three [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  The first originates in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]; the others are modern creations based upon the original.

The first Doctor was Charles McNider, a [[surgeon]].  He was the earliest [[Blindness|blind]] superhero, predating [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]].  One night he was called to remove a [[bullet]] from a witness who was to testify against the mob.  However, a mobster threw a [[grenade]] into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider.  McNider thought his days as a surgeon were over until one day, while he was recovering, an [[owl]] crashed through his window (remenescent of the incident that inspired [[Batman]] to dress as a [[bat]]).  Taking off the [[bandage]]s that were covering his [[eye]]s, he found that he could only see in perfect [[darkness]]. Using his newfound ability, he developed a special [[visor]] that let him see in light and "blackout bombs" that block out all light, and used these to fight crime.  He later joined the [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[All-Star Squadron]].

The second Doctor Midnight (note the different spelling) was Beth Chapel, an [[African-American]] woman who was McNider's student.  She was blinded in an accident and discovered she now had the same night-vison as her predecessor.  She joined the superhero team [[Infinity, Inc.]]  She was later killed by the [[supervillain]] [[Eclipso]].

The third Doctor Mid-Nite is Pieter Cross.  He ran a free clinic in Portsmouth City, which led him to investigate a new street [[drug]] produced by an evil [[corporation]].  In retaliation, the corporation drugged him, and he got into a car accident.  Like the previous Doctors, he found that he could only see in pitch dark.  He too donned a costume to fight crime.  The new Dr Mid-Nite carries high-tech medical equipiment in addition to his crimefighting aparatus (which includes blackout bombs). Various people he has helped aid him in his work, both as a crime-fighter and as a community surgeon, including a number of street kids. He later joined the newest incarnation of the Justice Society.  He had a brief romance with his teammate, [[Black Canary]]. 

Both Dr McNider and Dr Cross had trained owls named "Hooty" as "sidekicks" (Dr McNider's was the same owl who crashed through his window). The second Hooty has a mini-camera around his neck, which can feed directly to a display in Dr Mid-Nite's goggles. The goggles also enable him to see in daylight.
