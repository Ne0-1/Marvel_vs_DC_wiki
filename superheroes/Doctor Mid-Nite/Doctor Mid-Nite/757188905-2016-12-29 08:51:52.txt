'''Doctor Mid-Nite''' (also '''Doctor Midnight''') is a fictional [[superhero]] physician in [[DC Comics]]. The figure has been represented in the comics by three different individuals, '''Charles McNider''', '''Beth Chapel''', and '''Pieter Anton Cross'''. Dr. Mid-Nite was originally created by writer [[Charles Reizenstein]] and artist [[Stanley Josephs Aschmeier]] in 1941. The hero, represented first by Charles McNider, appeared for the first time in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #25 (April 1941).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Doctor Mid-Nite I & II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 104  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Like many [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] heroic characters, the original Doctor Mid-Nite appeared as a member of DC's [[Justice Society of America]]. His two successors were also represented as members of the group or an offshoot. Doctor Mid-Nite has never appeared as the solo [[protagonist]] of a regular title magazine, but the figure has been the subject of an [[anthology]] and a mini-series.

All three versions of Doctor Mid-Nite have exhibited the same basic features: a cowled costume featuring a crescent moon symbol, keen ability to see in the darkness at the cost of near or total blindness in sunlight, the use of special visors and “blackout” smoke bombs to gain tactical advantage in combat, a high degree of skill in martial arts, and jobs as physicians serving both normal human beings and "[[metahuman]]" superheroes. Additionally, two of the doctors have been accompanied by sidekick owls.

As a blind character, Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in comics to exhibit a physical impairment, pre-dating the creation of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] by more than twenty years.

==Fictional character biographies==
The following biographies are presented "in universe."

===Charles McNider===
'''Charles McNider''', a surgeon, was called one night to remove a bullet from a witness set to testify against [[mafia|mobsters]]. A mobster threw a grenade into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider, with the injury causing him to believe his career as a surgeon was over.<ref name="dc-ency"/> One evening, as he was recovering, an owl crashed through his window. Removing the bandages covering his eyes, McNider discovered that he could still see, but only in perfect darkness. McNider developed a special visor allowing him to see in the light and "blackout bombs" capable of blocking out all light, becoming a costumed crime fighter. Adopting the owl that flew through his window and naming it 'Hooty', the bird became his "sidekick."<ref name="dc-ency"/> He later joined the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA) and the [[All-Star Squadron]]. In 1942, McNider enlisted in the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Medical Corps]] as a physician during [[World War II]],<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #11 (June–July 2012)</ref> rising to the rank of Captain.{{Issue|date=July 2012}} Ten years after his debut, McNider briefly assumed the role of [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] after the JSA disbanded when Ted Knight, the original Starman, suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of his participation in the development of the atomic bomb.<ref>''Starman'' (vol. 2) #77</ref>

McNider suffered a devastating event in 1953, when the girl he loved, Myra Mason, was murdered by the Shadower, a foe who has learned Doctor Mid-Nite's secret identity.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  McNider's later romantic history is unrevealed, but another "old friend" of McNider, Miss Alice King, made an appearance in ''All-American Comics'' #90 (October 1947). McNider apparently had no children, but at one point McNider rescued a pregnant woman from attack in [[Sogndal]], [[Norway]] and delivered her baby, Pieter Cross, who later became the third Doctor Mid-Nite. McNider was also one of the JSA members captured and placed in [[suspended animation]] by the Immortal villain [[Vandal Savage]], before being freed by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] Flash.

Charles McNider eventually met his end as one of the casualties of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], when he and fellow JSA member [[Hourman]] were aged to death by [[Hank Hall|Extant]].<ref name="dc-exta">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = | contribution = Extant | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 117  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> He was briefly reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event,<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4</ref> only to be destroyed by [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]].<ref>Blackest Night: JSA #1–3 (February–April 2010)</ref>

===Beth Chapel===
[[File:Doctormidnight.png|150px|left|Beth Chapel as Doctor Midnight. Art by Todd MacFarlane.]]

As the aging McNider spent less time in action, '''Beth Chapel''', a medical doctor, stepped into the role of '''Doctor Midnight'''. Beth Chapel was a native of Orangeburg, [[South Carolina]], with a [[pastor]] father, a mother who sang in the church choir, and four brothers.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #21</ref> Chapel first appeared when [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] of [[Infinity, Inc.]] was rushed to her hospital for treatment after encountering [[Mister Bones]]' cyanide touch. During the onset of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Beth was blinded by an oxygen explosion, only to be rescued by [[Hourman]]'s son Rick Tyler, who has taken McNiter's drug that enhances ability to see in the dark. Beth used the formula to similarly treat her blindness, and she and Rick assume the mantles of their predecessors as Doctor Midnight and Hourman, with her mother crafting a super hero costume from a choir robe. Along with a new [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Wildcat]], Chapel and Tyler applied for membership in Infinity, Inc, eventually gaining admission; however, the association was short-lived, as Infinity, Inc. disbanded shortly thereafter, though Chapel and Tyler began a romantic relationship during their tenure.

Doctor Midnight and Wildcat were subsequently recruited by the U.S. government for a mission to defeat the [[supervillain]] [[Eclipso]], only for Chapel to die on the mission along with Wildcat, the [[The Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], [[Commander Steel]], [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]], and [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]].<ref>''Eclipso'' #13</ref>

===Pieter Cross===<!-- This section is linked from [[Justice Society of America]] -->
The third Doctor Mid-Nite (and the second to use the original spelling) is '''Pieter Anton Cross'''. Cross makes his first appearance in the 3-issue [[prestige format]] [[limited series]] ''Doctor Mid-Nite'' (1999).

Cross is the [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born son of a noted scientist, the late Theodoric Cross.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Pieter was delivered as a baby by the original Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider, who had just rescued his mother from vagrants. As an adult Pieter is later unable to save his mother from [[Chagas disease]], which she catches in Brazil while visiting him. Cross otherwise has no known relatives.

Cross's crime-fighting career begins as he runs a free clinic in [[Portsmouth(comics)|Portsmouth]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. His work leads him to investigate a new street [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] called A39, an accidental derivative of the steroid-like Venom. The drug, he soon learns, is produced by an evil corporation named Praeda Industries, run by the [[Terrible Trio]] (former foes of the [[Batman]]). Cross is drugged by company enforcers and soon involved in a car accident. The accident takes the life of a young woman named Katherine Blythe. After the accident, he finds that he can only see in pitch darkness via infrared vision (he can also employ ultrasonic vision). He takes the name Doctor Mid-Nite and resolves to fight crime.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Cross joins the newest incarnation of the [[Justice Society of America]],<ref>''JSA'' #11</ref> and enjoys a brief romance with teammate [[Black Canary]].

Cross is usually portrayed as being a physician first and vigilante second. Scanners in his cowl-lenses identify health risks as well as threats. He is a vegetarian and practices yoga (''JSA''). Cross carries high-tech medical equipment in addition to weapons (including blackout bombs). Some individuals whom Cross assists eventually come to aid him in his work as both crime fighter and community surgeon. Allies gained in this way include reformed street kids "Nite Lite" and "Ice Sickle" and writer Camilla Marlowe. (Ice Sickle is later killed by the vengeful [[Spirit King]]<ref>''JSA'' #60</ref>) Dr. Mid-Nite also serves as a wise and kind mentor to young Jaime Reyes, the latest [[Blue Beetle]].<ref>''Blue Beetle - Boundaries (2009) - ISBN 978-1-4012-2162-1</ref>

Cross's Doctor Mid-Nite is one of the most prominent physicians in the DCU. He and his JSA colleague Mr. Terrific function as "go-to" scientists for the superhero set. Among Cross' notable achievements: the discovery that [[Alan Scott]] is composed of the green flame of the Starheart; conducting tests and annual checkups for [[Power Girl]]; emergency surgery on [[Rick Tyler|Hourman]]; removal of the [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] virus from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]];<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #85</ref> the autopsy of [[Sue Dibny]] (''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''); removing the sniper bullet that wounds [[Lois Lane]] in [[Umec]] (''Battery'' story arc in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]''); conducting DNA tests on [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] (''Terra'' #3, 2009).

Cross is also called upon by medical agencies such as [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] during unusual cases. At one point he is called by S.T.A.R. to investigate the reappearance of Delores Winters, the first host for the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. Winters now steals the body parts of metahumans and calls herself Endless Winter. Doctor Mid-Nite puts an end to the thievery and helps restore the health of her victims. (''JSA: Classified'' #19-20, 2007)

The [[Batman]] conducts covert research on Cross's abilities and concludes that the full extent of his enhanced vision has not yet been reached (''JSA'' 31). The Batman has apparently not revealed this information to Cross.

When the Justice Society encounter [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]], last survivor of the Third World, the benevolent being restores Pieter's vision.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #17</ref> Although initially a blessing, this later works to Pieter's disadvantage in the field, as he is no longer able to see through his own dark bombs, and the loss of his infrared vision prevents him from saving a mortally-wounded [[Lance (DC Comics)|Lance]]<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18</ref> as well as leaving him feeling challenged when trying to perform even normal operations. Eventually, the full JSA mount an all-out assault on Gog, having learned from [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will die if he ever leaves, leaving them with the one option of killing Gog and separating his head from the Earth, which is the only way to save the planet. The other society members following Gog attempt to protect him, until they see him attempt to attack a society member. All of the followers take up the fight, and Gog punishes them all by taking away his blessings, including Dr. Mid-Nite's sights.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21</ref>

After being contacted by current [[Teen Titan]] leader [[Beast Boy]], Dr. Mid-Nite is called in to help [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] when she is attacked and possessed by an unknown demonic entity. Appearing in [[Titans Tower]] via hologram technology, Dr. Mid-Nite and [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] are successfully able to drive the demon from Raven's body.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #75</ref>

Dr. Mid-Nite has been a mentor to the young superhero [[Blue Beetle]].

==Owls of Doctor Mid-Nite==
Both Charles McNider and Pieter Anton Cross train owls as [[sidekick]]s.

McNider trains the same owl which crashes through his window, an event that leads to the discovery of his powers. This owl, named "Hooty" (sometimes "Hootie"), shares many adventures during the Golden Age.

Cross keeps company with an owl named "Charlie". The bird is named after the original Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider. Charlie keeps a mini-camera around his neck that can feed video directly to a display in Cross's goggles.

==Powers, equipment, and abilities==
McNider possesses the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special [[infrared]] lenses, McNider can see in light; later in his life, his lenses become more ineffective as his eyesight continues to deteriorate even further, inhibiting his daylight vision. McNider also employs "blackout bombs" which release pitch-black gas that blind villains even as they allow McNider to see. For a time he used a weapon called a "cryotuber" which can either control the nervous system of an opponent or fire bursts of heat or cold. He is also a brilliant doctor, and a mathematician. In All-Star Comics #13 he is able to communicate with a Neptunian using mathematical equations. As Starman, McNider uses various star-themed gadgets, including an [[airship]] designed by the [[Red Torpedo (Jim Lockhart)|Red Torpedo]]. McNider is also a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a gifted physician and author.

==Other versions==
In 1965, DC Comics had no plans to revive Doctor Mid-Nite. DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] gave [[M.I.T.]] student and comic book [[letterhack]] [[Rick Norwood]] permission to publish a Dr. Midnight story in his fanzine, ''Five''.  The story written by Norwood and illustrated by [[Steve Sabo (comics)|Steve Sabo]] features a doctor named Tom Benson who is blinded in battle. He discovers that his other senses are super-sensitive and dons the Doctor Midnight costume to fight crime.
 
In ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', [[Alex Ross]] portrays Doctor Mid-Nite (known here simply as '''Midnight''') as a disembodied cowl amid thick black smoke reminiscent of his "blackout bombs". The [[Wraith (entity)|wraith]] is said to be the spirit of Dr. Charles McNider.

Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris' ''[[JSA: The Liberty File]]'' as a World War II United States intelligence agent code-named '''the Owl'''. This character, though a playboy, resembles other Doctor Mid-Nite representations. Though derided for his dalliances with the ladies, McNider was trusted as a valued field operative.

In the [[Elseworlds]] novel ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]''- set in a world where [[Oliver Cromwell]] lived longer and America is run by a corrupt theocracy- Doctor Charles McNider was a friend of [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] before their deaths, losing his eyes and his wife for his defiance of the state. When Bruce comes to visit him, he warns Bruce against fighting the system, but also confirms that the Waynes were killed by the privy council for providing medical services to those the council has deemed undesirable, such as Jews or homosexuals.

In the ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent]]: Superman's Reign'' series, a version of Doctor Mid-Nite his body completely covered by a black cloak is briefly seen.

In the new [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] created in the wake of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and [[52 (comics)|52]], a version of Beth Chapel is shown to be a member of the [[Justice Society|Justice Society Infinity]].<ref>''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1</ref>
