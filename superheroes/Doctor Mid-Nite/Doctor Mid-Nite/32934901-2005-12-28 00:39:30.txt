'''Doctor Mid-Nite''' or '''Doctor Midnight''' is the moniker of three fictional [[super-hero|superheroes]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  The first originated in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]; the others are modern creations based upon the original.

===Doctor Mid-Nite (Charles McNider)===
The first Doctor was Charles McNider, a [[surgery|surgeon]].  He was the earliest [[Blindness|blind]] superhero, predating [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] by over two decades.  One night, he was called to remove a [[bullet]] from a witness who was to testify against the [[mafia|mob]].  However, a mobster threw a [[grenade]] into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider.  McNider thought his days as a surgeon were over until one day, as he was recovering, an [[owl]] crashed through his window (remeniscent of the incident that inspired [[Batman]] to dress as a [[bat]]).  Taking off the [[bandage|bandages]] that were covering his [[eye|eyes]], he found that he could only see in perfect [[darkness]]. Using his newfound ability, he developed a special [[visor]] that let him see in light and "blackout bombs" that block out all light, and used these to fight crime.  He later joined the [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[All-Star Squadron]]. In 1951, McNider briefly took over the role of [[Starman (comics)|Starman II]] after the JSA had disbanded and Ted Knight, the original Starman, had suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of his participation in the development of the atomic bomb. McNider was one of the casualties of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], dying alongside [[The Atom]] I and a time-tossed [[Hourman]] III at the hands of Extant.

===Doctor Midnight (Beth Chapel)===
The second Doctor Midnight (note the different spelling) was Beth Chapel, an [[African-American]] woman who was McNider's student.  While working at a hospital, she was blinded by an oxygen explosion during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] and discovered she now had the same night-vision as her predecessor. Alongside Rick Tyler, the second [[Hourman]], she eventually joined the superhero team [[Infinity, Inc.]] after being initially rejected. She was later killed alongside a cadre of other heroes, including fellow Inifinitor [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] II, by the [[supervillain]] [[Eclipso]] .

===Doctor Mid-Nite (Pieter Cross)===
The third Doctor Mid-Nite is Pieter Cross.  He was a doctor who ran a free clinic in Portsmouth City, which led him to investigate a new street [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] produced by an evil [[corporation]].  In retaliation, the corporation drugged him, and he was involved in a car accident which took the life of a young woman.  Like the previous bearers of the name, he found that he could only see in pitch darkness.  He, too, donned a costume to fight crime.  The new Dr. Mid-Nite carries high-tech medical equipiment in addition to his crimefighting apparatus (which includes blackout bombs). Various people he has helped aid him in his work as a crime-fighter and community surgeon, including a number of street kids. He later joined the newest incarnation of the [[Justice Society of America]]. He had a brief romance with his teammate, [[Black Canary]]. Dr. Mid-Nite is one of the most prominent physicians in the DCU, along with his JSA teammate and colleague [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]. They are often called upon when an autopsy is needed, or when a hero needs major surgery. Among the notable achievements of Cross as a physician include determining [[Green Lantern|Alan Scott]] was composed of the green flame of the Starheart, giving [[Power Girl]] her annual checkups as well as testing her powers, emergency surgery on [[Hourman]] II, and the autopsy of [[Sue Dibny]] during the [[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]] storyline.

===Hooty===
Both Dr. McNider and Dr. Cross had trained owls as [[sidekick|sidekicks]]. McNider trained the same owl which crashed through his window and led to the discovery of his powers; named "Hooty," he and McNider shared many adventures during the Golden Age. Hooty even took some [[Miraclo]] in one adventure, leading to him gaining super-strength and super-speed, albeit temporaily. Cross employs an owl named "Charlie". Charlie has a mini-camera around his neck which can feed directly to a display in Dr Mid-Nite's goggles.

===Powers===
'''Charles McNider''' - McNider possessed the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special [[infrared]] lenses, McNider could see in light; later in his life, his eyesight began to fail, resulting in the infrared lenses become ineffective for seeing in light. McNider also employed "blackout bombs," which released pitch-black gas that blinded villains and allowed McNider to see. For a time he used a weapon called a "cryotuber" which could either control the nervous system of an opponent, or fire bursts of heat or cold. As Starman II, McNider used various star-themed gadgets, including an airship designed by the [[Red Torpedo]]. McNider was also a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a gifted physician and author. 

'''Beth Chapel''' - Chapel possessed the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special infrared lenses, Chapel could also see in light. Chapel also employed "blackout bombs," which released pitch-black gas that blinded villains and allowed Chapel to see. Chapel was also a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a physician.

'''Pieter Cross''' - Cross possesses the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special infrared lenses, Cross can see in light; Cross can also equip special ultrasonic lenses, as well as receive images from a camera strapped to his owl, Charlie. Cross also employs "blackout bombs," which release pitch-black gas that blinds villains and allows Chapel to see; these "blackout bombs" are improvements over those used by his predecessors. Cross's gauntlets carry a wide variety of chemicals, medicines, and small-scale equipment. Cross is a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a top physician.
