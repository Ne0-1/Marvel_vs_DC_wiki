'''Doctor Mid-Nite''' (also '''Doctor Midnight''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] [[physician]] in [[DC Comics]]. The figure has been represented in the comics by three different [[fictional character|individuals]], '''Charles McNider''', '''Beth Chapel''' and '''Pieter Anton Cross'''. Dr. Mid-Nite was originally created by writer [[Charles Reizenstein]] and artist [[Stanley Josephs Aschmeier]] in 1941. The hero, represented first by Charles McNider, appeared for the first time in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #25 ([[1941#April|April 1941]]).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Doctor Mid-Nite I & II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 104  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

The character typically appears in stories of teamwork. Like many [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] heroic characters, the original Doctor Mid-Nite appeared as a member of DC's [[Justice Society of America]]. His two successors were also represented as members of the group or an offshoot. Doctor Mid-Nite has never appeared the solo [[protagonist]] of a regular title magazine, but the figure has been the subject of an [[anthology]] and a mini-series (see below).

All three [[fictional character|characters]] who have represented the heroic Doctor in the [[DC Universe]] have exhibited the same basic features: a cowled costume featuring a [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] symbol, keen ability to see in the darkness at the cost of near or total blindness in sunlight, and the use of special visors and “blackout” smoke bombs to gain tactical advantage in combat. All three have been physicians who see not only to the needs of normal human beings but also to the needs of DC's "[[metahumans]]" (superheroes). All are skilled in [[martial arts]]. Two of the doctors have been accompanied by [[sidekick]] [[owl]]s.

Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in [[comic books|comics]] to exhibit a physical impairment (blindness). (The figure pre-dates by over twenty years the arrival of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], also a blind character, in [[Marvel Comics]].)

==Fictional character biographies==
The following biographies are presented "in universe."

===Charles McNider===
'''Charles McNider''', a [[surgeon]], is called one night to remove a [[bullet]] from a witness who is soon to testify against [[mafia|mobsters]]. A mobster throws a [[grenade]] into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider.<ref name="dc-ency"/> McNider believes his days as a surgeon are over. One evening, as he is recovering, an [[owl]] crashes through his window (reminiscent of the [[bat]] that crashes through [[Bruce Wayne]]'s window to inspire his identity as the [[Batman]]). McNider removes the [[bandage]]s covering his eyes to find that he can see, but only in perfect [[darkness]]. His vision is now 'inverted': he can see in the dark the way most people can see in light, and vice-versa. He develops a special [[visor]] that allows him to see in light and "blackout bombs" that block out all light. These become useful in his effort to fight crime. The owl becomes his [[totem animal|totem]]. He adopts the bird that flew through his window, naming it 'Hooty' and calling it his "sidekick."<ref name="dc-ency"/> He later joins the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA) and the [[All-Star Squadron]].

Ten years after his debut, McNider briefly assumes the role of [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] after the JSA disbands. Ted Knight, the original Starman, suffers a nervous breakdown as a result of his participation in the development of the atomic bomb.<ref>''Starman'' (vol. 2) #77</ref> 

McNider suffers a devastating event in 1953, when the girl he loves, Myra Mason, is murdered by the Shadower, a foe who has learned Doctor Mid-Nite's secret identity.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  McNider apparently never reveals his identity to Myra, presumably - and ironically - to keep her "safe". McNider's later romantic history is unknown, but another "old friend" of McNider, Miss Alice King, makes an appearance in ''All-American Comics'' #90 (October 1947)

McNider apparently has no children, but at one point McNider rescues a pregnant woman from attack in [[Sogndal]], [[Norway]]. He delivers her baby. The child, Pieter Cross, is destined to become the third Doctor Mid-Nite. Pre-Crisis he was one of the JSA members captured and placed in [[suspended animation]] by the Immortal villain [[Vandal Savage]], before being freed by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] Flash.

Charles McNider eventually meets his own end as one of the casualties of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], dying alongside the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] at the hands of [[Hank Hall|Extant]] when he is aged to death.<ref name="dc-exta">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = | contribution = Extant | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 117  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

McNider is briefly reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #4</ref> He is destroyed by the current Mr. Terrific. <ref>Blackest Night: JSA #1–3 (February–April 2010)</ref>

===Beth Chapel===
[[File:Doctormidnight.png|150px|left|Beth Chapel as Doctor Midnight. Art by Todd MacFarlane.]]

Upon McNider's death his student and protégé, '''Beth Chapel''', an [[African-American]] medical doctor, steps into the role of '''Doctor Midnight''' (note different spelling). Beth Chapel is a native of Orangeburg, [[South Carolina]]. Her father is a [[pastor]]. Her mother sings in the [[local church|church]] [[choir]] and crafts her daughter's hero costume from a choir robe. Chapel has four brothers: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #21</ref>

Chapel first appears when [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] of [[Infinity, Inc.]] is rushed to the hospital for treatment after [[Mister Bones]]' cyanide touch. Her superhero career soon kicks into fast and full gear. During the onset of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Beth is blinded by an oxygen explosion. She is rescued by [[Hourman]]'s son Rick Tyler, who has taken his father's drug that enhances ability to see in the dark. Like McNider, Beth discovers that she can do the same. She and Rick assume the mantles of their predecessors as Doctor Midnight and Hourman. 

Along with a new [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Wildcat]], Chapel and Tyler apply for membership in Infinity, Inc. They are not immediately accepted but eventually both gain admission. The association is short-lived, though, as Infinity soon disbands. Doctor Midnight and Wildcat are recruited by the U.S. government for a mission to defeat the [[supervillain]] [[Eclipso]]. By now Chapel has begun a romantic relationship with Rick Tyler. 

Beth Chapel dies on the mission, though, along with Wildcat, the [[The Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], [[Commander Steel]], [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] and [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]].<ref>''Eclipso'' #13</ref> She is survived by her family.

===Pieter Cross===<!-- This section is linked from [[Justice Society of America]] -->
The third Doctor Mid-Nite (and the second to use the original spelling) is '''Pieter Anton Cross'''. Cross makes his first appearance in the 3-issue [[prestige format]] [[limited series]] ''Doctor Mid-Nite'' (1999). 

Cross is the [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born son of a noted scientist, the late Theodoric Cross.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Pieter was delivered as a baby by the original Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider, who had just rescued his mother from vagrants. As an adult Pieter is later unable to save his mother from [[Chagas disease]], which she catches in Brazil while visiting him. Cross otherwise has no known relatives.

Cross's crime-fighting career begins as he runs a free clinic in [[Portsmouth(comics)|Portsmouth]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. His work leads him to investigate a new street [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] called A39, an accidental derivative of the steroid-like Venom. The drug, he soon learns, is produced by an [[evil corporation]] named Praeda Industries, run by the [[Terrible Trio]] (former foes of the [[Batman]]). Cross is drugged by company enforcers and soon involved in a car accident. The accident takes the life of a young woman named Katherine Blythe. After the accident he finds that he can only see in pitch darkness via infrared vision (he can also employ ultrasonic vision). He takes the name Doctor Mid-Nite and resolves to fight crime.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Cross joins the newest incarnation of the [[Justice Society of America]],<ref>''JSA'' #11</ref> and enjoys a brief romance with teammate [[Black Canary]].

Cross is usually portrayed as being a physician first and vigilante second. Scanners in his cowl-lenses identify health risks as well as threats. He is a vegetarian and practices yoga (''JSA''). Cross carries high-tech medical equipment in addition to weapons (including blackout bombs). Some individuals whom Cross assists eventually come to aid him in his work as both crime fighter and community surgeon. Allies gained in this way include reformed street kids "Nite Lite" and "Ice Sickle" and writer Camilla Marlowe. (Ice Sickle is later killed by the vengeful Spirit King [''JSA'' #60]) Dr. Mid-Nite also serves as a wise and kind mentor to young Jaime Reyes, the latest [[Blue Beetle]]. <ref> ''Blue Beetle - Boundaries (2009) - ISBN 9781401221621 </ref>

Cross's Doctor Mid-Nite is one of the most prominent physicians in the DCU. He and his JSA colleague [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]] function as "go-to" scientists for the superhero set. Among Cross' notable achievements: the discovery that [[Alan Scott]] is composed of the green flame of the Starheart; conducting tests and annual checkups for [[Power Girl]]; emergency surgery on [[Rick Tyler|Hourman]]; removal of the [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] virus from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]];<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #85</ref> the autopsy of [[Sue Dibny]] (''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''); removing the sniper bullet that wounds [[Lois Lane]] in [[Umec]] (''Battery'' story arc in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]''); conducting DNA tests on [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] (''Terra'' #3, 2009).  

Cross is also called upon by medical agencies such as [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] during unusual cases. At one point he is called by S.T.A.R. to investigate the reappearance of Delores Winters, the first host for the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. Winters now steals the body parts of metahumans and calls herself Endless Winter. Doctor Mid-Nite puts an end to the thievery and helps restore the health of her victims. (''JSA: Classified'' #19-20, 2007)

The [[Batman]] conducts covert research on Cross's abilities and concludes that the full extent of his enhanced vision has not yet been reached (''JSA'' 31). The Batman has apparently not revealed this information to Cross.

When the Justice Society encounter [[Gog (comics)|Gog]], last survivor of the Third World, the benevolent being restores Pieter's vision. <ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #17</ref> Although initially a blessing, this later works to Pieter's disadvantage in the field, as he is no longer able to see through his own dark bombs, and the loss of his infrared vision prevents him from saving a mortally-wounded [[Lance (DC Comics)|Lance]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18</ref> The rest of the JSA arrive, having learned from [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will die if he ever leaves, leaving them with the one option of killing Gog and separating his head from the Earth, which is the only way to save the planet. The other society members following Gog attempt to protect him, until they see him attempt to attack a society member. All of the followers take up the fight, and Gog punishes them all by taking away his blessings, including Dr. Mid-Nite's sights.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21</ref>

After being contacted by  current [[Teen Titan]] leader [[Beast Boy]], Dr. Mid-Nite is called in to help [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] when she is attacked and possessed by an unknown demonic entity. Appearing in [[Titans Tower]] via hologram technology, Dr. Mid-Nite and [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] are successfully able to drive the demon from Raven's body.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #75</ref>

Dr. Mid-Nite has been a mentor to the young superhero [[Blue Beetle]].

==Owls==
Both Charles McNider and Pieter Anton Cross train owls as [[sidekick]]s.

McNider trains the same owl which crashes through his window, an event that leads to the discovery of his powers. This owl, named "Hooty" (sometimes "Hootie"), shares many adventures during the Golden Age.

Cross keeps company with an owl named "Charlie". The bird is named after the original Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider. Charlie keeps a mini-camera around his neck that can feed video directly to a display in Cross's goggles.

==Powers, equipment, and abilities==
McNider possesses the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special [[infrared]] lenses, McNider can see in light; later in his life, his lenses become more ineffective as his eyesight continues to deteriorate even further, inhibiting his daylight vision. McNider also employs "blackout bombs" which release pitch-black gas that blind villains even as they allow McNider to see. For a time he uses a weapon called a "cryotuber" which can either control the nervous system of an opponent or fire bursts of heat or cold. He is also a brilliant Doctor, and a [[mathematician]], in All-Star comics #13 he is able to communicate with a Neptunian using mathematical equations. As Starman, McNider uses various star-themed gadgets, including an [[airship]] designed by the [[Red Torpedo (Jim Lockhart)|Red Torpedo]]. McNider is also a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a gifted physician and author.

==Other versions==
In 1965, [[DC Comics]] had no plans to revive Doctor Mid-Nite. DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] gave [[M.I.T.]] student and comic book [[letterhack]] [[Rick Norwood]] permission to publish a Dr. Midnight story in his fanzine, ''Five''.  The story, written by Norwood and illustrated by [[Steve Sabo (comics)|Steve Sabo]], features a doctor named Tom Benson who is blinded in battle. He discovers that his other senses are super-sensitive and dons the Doctor Midnight costume to fight crime.
 
In ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', [[Alex Ross]] portrays Doctor Mid-Nite (known here simply as '''Midnight''') as a disembodied cowl amid thick black smoke reminiscent of his "blackout bombs". The [[Wraith (entity)|wraith]] is said to be the spirit of Dr. Charles McNider.

Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris' ''[[JSA: The Liberty File]]'' as a [[World War II]] United States intelligence agent code-named '''the Owl'''. This character, though a playboy, resembles other Doctor Mid-Nite representations.

In the ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent]]: Superman's Reign'' series, a version of Doctor Mid-Nite, his body completely covered by a black cloak, is briefly seen.

In the new [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] created in the wake of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and [[52 (comic book)|52]], a version of Beth Chapel is shown to be a member of the [[Justice Society|Justice Society Infinity]]. <ref>''Justice Society of America Annual'' #1</ref>
