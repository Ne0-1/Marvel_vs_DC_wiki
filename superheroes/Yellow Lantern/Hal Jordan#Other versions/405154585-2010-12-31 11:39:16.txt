'''Harold "Hal" Jordan''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] known as [[Green Lantern]] and a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. Jordan is the second DC Comics character to adopt the Green Lantern moniker and arguably the most popular one. Jordan was created in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]], and made his first appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #22 (October 1959) to replace the original Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book| last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Green Lantern | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 144–147 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

In 1994, the story "[[Emerald Twilight]]" saw Hal Jordan turn into the [[supervillain]] '''[[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'''. Later, in the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries, he attempts cosmic genocide. He was replaced by [[Kyle Rayner]] as the new Green Lantern for the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]]. In 1996's crossover story "[[The Final Night]]", he attempted to return to his heroic roots by dying to save the Earth, and later returned as a spirit of redemption in the persona of the '''[[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]'''. Hal Jordan was resurrected and exonerated of his past crimes in the 2004 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'', which revealed that Parallax was actually an alien parasitic entity that caused his prior villainy. He subsequently returned to the Green Lantern Corps, and is the protagonist of the current volume of ''Green Lantern''.

==Publication history==
===Recreated for the Silver Age===
After achieving great success in 1956 in reviving the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] character ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'', DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] looked toward recreating the Green Lantern from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Like The Flash, Schwartz wanted this new character to have a different secret identity, origin, and personality than his 1940s counterpart. A long time [[science-fiction]] fan and [[literary agent]], Schwartz wanted a more sci-fi based Green Lantern, as opposed to the mystical powers of [[Alan Scott]], the forties Green Lantern. He enlisted writer [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and artist [[Gil Kane]], who in 1959 would reintroduce Green Lantern to the world in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]] #22'' (September–October 1959).

Like [[E.E. Doc Smith]]'s [[Lensman|Lensmen]], the new Green Lantern was a member of an intergalactic constabulary made up of many different alien species who were given a device that provided them with great mental and physical abilities; however, both Broome and Schwartz have denied a connection between those stories from science fiction pulps and the Green Lantern comic book stories.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Gil Kane drew from actor [[Paul Newman]] in creating Hal Jordan's likeness,<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 2) #3 (November–December 1960)</ref> contrary to the myth that he was based on Errol Flynn, and redesigned the Green Lantern uniform into a sleek form-fitting green, black, and white outfit, a distinct departure from Alan Scott's red, yellow, green, purple, and black costume with a puffy shirt and cape.

The character was a success, and it was quickly decided to follow-up his three issue run on ''Showcase'' with a self-titled series. ''Green Lantern #1'' began in July–August 1960 and would continue until #84 in April–May 1972.

This creative team was responsible for introducing many of the major characters in Hal Jordan's life. First and foremost was [[Carol Ferris]], Jordan's love interest. She was in charge of Ferris Aircraft, and as such, Hal's boss. While she preferred Green Lantern to Hal Jordan, she took an active role in trying to win him over, even going so far as to propose to him in the old [[Leap year|Leap Year]] tradition. Although she gave Jordan some attention, her job and company always came first. Ferris was a strong-willed woman of authority at a time when this was rare, especially in comic books.

Another unique addition to Green Lantern's supporting cast was his best friend, [[Thomas Kalmaku|Tom Kalmaku]], who was both Hal's mechanic and the chronicler of his super-hero adventures. An [[Inuit]] (Eskimo) from Alaska, Tom's nickname was "Pie" or "Pieface", in reference to Eskimo Pie ice cream sandwiches. Like "Chop Chop" from the [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk]] comics, this nickname is today understandably viewed as racist and has been downplayed by most modern writers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} However, unlike "Chop Chop", Tom was actually a competent and intelligent character with a well-rounded personality, not a stereotypical buffoon. Despite the unfortunate nickname, Tom Kalmaku was among the first minority characters to be portrayed in this manner and broke new ground for mainstream comic books. Tom would later be followed by another trail-blazing minority character, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], the first African-American super-hero of the DC Universe.

Jordan's masters, the mysterious [[Guardians of the Universe]], were physically based on [[David Ben-Gurion]], the first [[Prime Minister of Israel]], and were developed from an idea Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring [[Captain Comet]] in ''[[Strange Adventures]] #22'' (July, 1952) entitled "Guardians of the Clockwork Universe".<ref>[http://povonline.com/cols/COL234.html] {{Dead link|date=May 2008}}</ref>

Schwartz and company also allowed Jordan to have a family, which was another rare thing at this time in superhero comics. While he didn't have a wife or children of his own, he had many interactions with his two brothers, Jack and Jim. The Brothers Jordan were primarily inspired by the Kennedy brothers, who rose to prominence during the sixties.

When compared to comics of the thirties, forties, and early fifties, Green Lantern broke new storytelling ground and can be seen as a precursor to the "[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Revolution" that would take place several years later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Whereas older comics treated each issue as a stand-alone with no real sense of temporal direction between issues, ''Green Lantern's'' issues followed the order of publication, with references within the stories to previous stories and adventures. Not only were references made, but subplots (such as Hal and Carol's romance, the marriage of Tom Kalmaku, etc.) were advanced showing actual growth in the character's lives. While these subplots rarely were given much notice in comparison to Marvel's storylines in the sixties and especially to today's modern stories, they were the first step toward this sort of serial storytelling instead of the episodic nature of older comics.{{Or|date=March 2009}}

Likewise, Green Lantern was one of the first comics to be a part of a "shared universe". [[Justice League|The Justice League of America]] united several superheroes that DC owned, just as [[Justice Society|the Justice Society of America]] had in the Golden Age. The crucial difference was that events occurring in the ''Justice League'' title were reflected and referenced in individual superheroes' titles (such as Green Lantern).

Also adding to the advancement of the medium was Gil Kane's use of dynamic art.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Whereas previously, comics had mostly stuck with a six panel page consisting of six equal sized rectangles, Kane's panels changed in size and shape to offer a more emotional and visceral experience. The action and/or scene dictated the art instead of being forced into a rigid box structure. In addition, while there had been plenty of flying superheroes in the past, none flew quite like Hal Jordan. Kane’s art made Hal look more like he was gliding or swimming through the air than the usual leaping or bullet-like flying motion of other superheroes. His fluid poses made Hal a more graceful and, as a result, realistic-looking flying man.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}{{Or|date=March 2009}}

John Broome seemed to come up with stories centered on a common theme and then run them together within a fairly short time. For example, ''Green Lantern #2-4'' each contained stories involving the [[anti-matter]] universe of [[Qward]], issues #12 and #15 featured "Zero Hour" stories{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} , and issues #8 and #12 involved Hal being sent to the year 5700 AD in the guise of Pol Manning.

Starting in issue #17, [[Gardner Fox]] joined the book to share writing duties with John Broome. The quartet of Schwartz, Broome, Fox, and Kane remained the core creative team until 1970.

===The era of social conscience===
Starting with issue #76, [[Dennis O'Neil]] took over scripting duties and [[Neal Adams]] took over as artist. This issue is one of the comics which is considered to have ushered in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It is worth noting that Neal Adams actually drew his first cover in Green Lantern #63 in the late Silver Age. The collaboration of O'Neil and Adams produced the most famous and celebrated runs on Green Lantern.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Julius Schwartz remained editor and hand-selected the two{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} to revitalize the title, whose sales had been slipping. O’Neil and Adams had already begun preparation for the classic run in the form of their re-workings of another DC character: [[Green Arrow]].

Green Arrow was a character originally created by DC in 1941 (then known as National Comics). He was a wealthy businessman named Oliver Queen who wore a green [[Errol Flynn]]-esque [[Robin Hood]] costume and shot “trick” arrows in his efforts to fight crime. His characterization was fairly basic (borrowing heavily from [[Batman]] but lacking the depth and tragedy of that character{{Or|date=March 2009}}) and as such remained a second or third string hero throughout the Golden Age. However, the character managed to survive the fifties (during which most superhero comics were eliminated) by being a backup character in [[Adventure Comics]]. In 1961, DC added Green Arrow to the roster of the [[Justice League of America]], but he still remained in the background.

[[Image:GLGA76BS.jpg|thumb|250px|Three panels ushering in the O'Neil/Adams run in ''Green Lantern'' #76.]]
This changed in 1968 with ''Justice League of America #66''. Written by Denny O’Neil, Green Arrow started to show resentment toward his fellow superheroes who wielded great power (as he himself, possessing exceptional skill but no actual super-powers, did not), but did little to help the ordinary people with ordinary problems. O’Neil continued to push Green Arrow’s tolerance for his peers, and a little less than a year later, Neal Adams (not working in any sort of cooperation with O’Neil) redesigned Arrow, giving him a goatee and a new outfit. ''Justice League of America #74'' (still being written by O’Neil) introduced [[Black Canary]] as Arrow’s love interest and issue #75 left him broke, his company and fortune stolen from him. O’Neil wanted to recreate Green Arrow to better represent a modern Robin Hood, but felt a rich man would be a poor champion of the downtrodden.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Some time after this, Schwartz invited O’Neil to take over ''Green Lantern''. Wanting to represent his own political beliefs in comics and take on social issues of the late sixties and early seventies, O’Neil came up with the idea of pitting Hal Jordan, who as an intergalactic cop stood for not only Law and Order but The Establishment, against Oliver Queen, who O’Neil had characterized as a profoundly outspoken liberal and stood for the Counter-Culture Movement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The first issue he wrote had Green Lantern capturing a street "punk" who was pushing around a man. All around him, people start throwing things at the bewildered Jordan. As he steps in to attack, he is stopped by Green Arrow, who explains that the man he defended was a [[slum lord]] "fat cat" and goes even further to show Lantern the conditions of the slum. At the roof, in a now famous scene, an elderly African-American man grills Jordan as to why he allowed [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] against African-Americans to continue on Earth, when he saved [[Tomar-Re|"the orange skins"]] and [[Korugar|"the purple skins"]] from exactly that.

Following Schwartz's approval of the story, Neal Adams was brought in to replace Gil Kane, much to the surprise of Denny O'Neil. And yet, the pair had already been working together on [[Batman]] (where Adams successfully reconstructed the character into a more dramatic "Dark Knight"), Adams had been the one to redesign Green Arrow's costume, and the artist had a growing reputation for one who did not back down and pushed for innovative, good ideas{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and therefore, was the perfect candidate to work with O'Neil.{{Or|date=March 2009}}

The pair tackled a number of social issues including corruption, sexism, cults, consumerism, the environment, racism, poverty, and even (subtly) child molestation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} However, none were more shocking and controversial{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} than the issue explored [[Snowbirds Don't Fly|in the famous "Snowbirds Don't Fly" issues #85 and #86]]. Neal Adams drew the cover, which showed Green Arrow’s youthful [[side-kick]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], shooting [[heroin]]. Editor Julius Schwartz did not want it published.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Neither did publisher [[Carmine Infantino]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} But over at [[Marvel Comics]], [[Stan Lee]] had green-lit ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]] #96'', which featured pills and presented an anti-drug message ''without'' the [[Comics Code Authority]] seal. Facing opposition and controversy, the Comics Code Authority revised its rules in regard to what could and could not be presented in comic books and, while still restrictive, became more lenient. As a result,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} DC Comics approved Adams’ cover and O’Neil wrote a two-part story involving drugs with Speedy being hooked. Green Arrow, who was usually presented as being the more understanding and mentoring of the Arrow/Lantern duo, now had his world turned upside-down, not only unable to understand his own part in leading Speedy toward drugs, but even coming off as uncompassionate toward the troubled youth. With this story, Adams and O’Neil not only tackled a difficult social ill, but looked inward at the ways that their “champion of the everyman” could be wrong.{{Or|date=March 2009}} New York [[John V. Lindsay|Mayor John V. Lindsay]] wrote a letter to DC Comics in response to the issue commending them, which was printed in issue #86.

Due to losing sales ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' was canceled, one of many titles that ended publication under the reign of Carmine Infantino. Julius Schwartz had a reprint of an older story published for issue #88 and saw the comic he began back in 1959 come to an end in 1972 with issue #89. However, he had Denny O’Neil and Neal Adams do one last story together, stretched out over ''Flash #217-219'' as a backup story. Green Lantern continued to appear in backup stories of ''Flash'' from 1972 until the ''Green Lantern'' title was resumed in 1976.

===The '80s exile===
In comics published in the early [[1980s in comics|1980s]], Jordan was exiled into space for a year by the Guardians in order to prove his loyalty to the Green Lantern Corps, having been accused of paying too much attention to Earth when he had an entire "sector" of the cosmos to patrol. When he returned to Earth, he found himself embroiled in a dispute with Carol Ferris. Faced with a choice between love and the power ring, Jordan chose to resign from the Green Lantern Corps. The Guardians called upon Jordan's backup, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], to regular duty as his replacement.

In 1985, the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' saw Jordan once again take up the mantle of Green Lantern, even as the Guardians withdrew from his dimension for a while to consort with their female counterparts, the [[Zamarons]]. The new Corps, with seven members residing on Earth, included several aliens, John Stewart, and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]. For a while, Jordan was romantically involved with an alien Lantern named [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]], for which he came under fire; a difference in time between Earth and her planet meant that in earth years, she was roughly fourteen years old. The alien Lanterns took a more direct hand in human affairs, a fact not appreciated by human governments. ([[Kilowog]] helped create the [[Rocket Red]]s for the [[Soviet Union]]). Eventually, the Earth corps broke up, several members returning to their home sectors. The Guardians soon returned to this dimension, and Jordan worked with them to rebuild the fractured Corps.

===1990s===
During this time, the character's origin story is re-told and expanded in two limited series by Gerard Jones, ''[[Emerald Dawn]]'' and ''Emerald Dawn II''. The first series expanded the role of the Corps in his origin and also provided more details about his childhood and his relationship with his father and brothers, while the sequel detailed the role of Jordan in the downfall of Sinestro.

In the 1992 [[prestige format]] [[graphic novel]] ''Green Lantern: [[Ganthet#Ganthet's Tale|Ganthet's Tale]]'' (ISBN 1-56389-026-7) (story by [[Larry Niven]], script & art by [[John Byrne]]), Hal Jordan first encounters [[Ganthet]], one of the [[Guardians of the Universe]]. He asks Hal to help Ganthet battle a renegade Guardian, Dawlakispokpok (or Dawly, for short) who has attempted to use a [[Time travel|time machine]] to change history.

[[Image:Greenl50.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover to ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #50 (March 1994). Hal Jordan becomes Parallax. Art by Darryl Banks.|thumb]]
In the 1994 ''[[Emerald Twilight]]'' storyline in ''Green Lantern'' vol. 3, #48-50, the villainous alien [[Mongul]] comes to Earth in a plot to take advantage of [[The Death of Superman|the death of Superman]]. Jordan defeats Mongul, but not before [[Coast City]] (Jordan's former home) is destroyed and all of its inhabitants murdered. He tries to use his ring to recreate the city, but the Guardians condemned this use of the ring for personal gain and demand that Jordan come to Oa for trial. Angered at what he saw as the Guardians' ungrateful and callous behavior, Jordan goes [[insane]] and attacks Oa to seize the full power of the Central Power Battery, destroying the Corps in the process. He then renounces his life as Green Lantern, adopting the name [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]].

As Parallax, he initiates the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'', attempting to rewrite history to his own liking, but he is eventually defeated by a gathering of heroes. Jordan is replaced by [[Kyle Rayner]] as the Green Lantern of Earth when Rayner comes into possession of the last power ring, created from the shattered remains of Jordan's. In the 1996 ''[[Final Night]]'' miniseries and crossover storyline, Jordan returns and sacrifices his life to reignite the Sun (which had been extinguished by the [[Sun-Eater]]).

During the [[Emerald Knights]] storyline, when Kyle Rayner goes on an accidental time-traveling trip, he ends up unintentionally drawing a past version of Hal into the present where Hal is shocked to learn of the crimes his future self had committed as Parallax.<ref name=GL106>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #106</ref>

In the 1999 mini-series ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'', Jordan becomes the newest incarnation of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].<ref>{{gcdb series|id=7101|title=Day of Judgment}}</ref> Soon after assuming this mantle, Jordan chooses to bend his mission from a spirit of vengeance to one of redemption, also making other appearances through some of DC Comics' other story lines, such as advising [[Superman]] during the ''Emperor [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'' storyline (Where the Joker steals the reality-warping power of [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]) and erases all public knowledge of [[Wally West]]'s identity as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] after his terrible first battle with [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]. He also appeared in a 4-part story arc in the series ''Legends of the DC Universe'' (issues #33-36). A new ''Spectre'' series (''The Spectre'' (vol. 4)) based on this premise, however, lasted only 27 issues before cancellation due to poor sales.

===2000s===
Following up on the ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'' miniseries, DC Comics subsequently began a new ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) series starting with issue #1 (July 2005), with Hal Jordan once again the main character. Trying to rebuild his life, Hal Jordan has moved to the nearly deserted Coast City, which is slowly being reconstructed. He has been reinstated as a Captain in the United States Air Force, and works in the Test Pilot Program at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. The series introduces new supporting characters for Hal, most notably a man from Hal's past, Air Force's General Jonathan "Herc" Stone, who learned Hal's secret as Green Lantern during a battle with the Manhunters and acts as his ally. He also begins to develop a romantic attraction with his fellow pilot, the beautiful Captain [[Jillian Pearlman|Jillian "Cowgirl" Pearlman]].<ref name=GL1>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #1 (May 2005)</ref><ref name=GL2>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #2 (June 2005)</ref><ref name=GL3>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #3 (August 2005)</ref> The returning characters also include Carol Ferris, Tom Kalmaku, and Hal's younger brother James Jordan with his sister-in-law Susan and their children, Howard and Jane.

The Green Lantern Corps also has been successfully rebuilt. Despite the revelation that Hal's past villainous activity was because of the influence of Parallax, many of Hal's fellow Corps officers (except Kilowog,Salaak, Stewart, Gardner, and Rayner) are unwilling to trust him. Despite being freed from Parallax, his experience also has led Hal occasionally to lack of confidence and self-doubts. Hal also become friends with Kyle Rayner after their first battle with Parallax.

In his new title, he faces revamped versions of his Silver Age foes such as [[Hector Hammond]], [[Shark (comics)|The Shark]] and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]].<ref name=GL4>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #4 (August 2005)</ref><ref name=GL5>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #5 (November 2005)</ref><ref name=GL6>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #6 (December 2005)</ref>

Hal helps briefly with the attack of the [[OMACs]] and [[Brother Eye]].<ref name=IC6>''Infinite Crisis'' #6</ref> He also fights alongside a group of heroes against the Society, defending [[Metropolis(comics)|Metropolis]]. [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], leads the Green Lantern Corps attack against [[Superboy-Prime]] with Hal appearing in the group.<ref name=IC7>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref>

As part of DC's retconning of the entire universe; as of ''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #10, the book has skipped ahead [[One Year Later|one year]], bringing drastic changes to Hal Jordan's life, as with every other hero in the DC Universe. It is revealed that Jordan spent time as a P.O.W. in an un-named conflict and has feelings of guilt from his inability to free himself and his fellow Captives.<ref name=GL17>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #17 (November 2006)</ref>

A new account of Green Lantern's origins was released in the (2008) ''Green Lantern'' series. In this ''new'' origin, Hal Jordan, is working as an assistant mechanic under [[Tom Kalmaku]] himself, barred from flying due to his insubordination while in the [[United States Air Force|U.S.A.F.]] and his employers lingering guilt about his father's death in the line of duty, when [[Abin Sur]], fighting [[Atrocitus]] of the Five Inversion, crashes near Coast City.<ref name="GL29">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #29 (March 2008)</ref><ref name="GL30">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #30 (April 2008)</ref>

Hal and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps find themselves at war with [[Sinestro]] and his army, the [[Sinestro Corps]] during the events of the [[Sinestro Corps War]]<ref name=GLSCS>''Green Lantern Sinestro Corps Special''</ref> As a Green Lantern native to Earth, Hal is featured in the [[Final Crisis]] mini-series by [[Grant Morrison]].<ref name=FC1>''Final Crisis'' #1</ref>

In the Agent Orange story arc, Hal Jordan is briefly in command of [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Agent Orange]]'s power battery after he steals it from Agent Orange in a battle. The orange light of avarice converses with Jordan, his costume changes, and he becomes the new Agent Orange. However, [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Larfleeze]] quickly takes his power battery back from Jordan.<ref name=GL42>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #42 (June 2009)</ref>

Jordan is also a character of focus in the new ''Justice League of America'' series as a charter member of the revamped JLA. He is also involved in the first plotline of the ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' monthly series, teaming up first with [[Batman]] and later [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. When teamed with the fledgling Supergirl, Hal is very impressed with her cleverness, although he finds her flirtatious behavior somewhat unnerving.<ref name=BB2>''Brave and the Bold'' (vol. 3) #2</ref>

In the ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'' mini-series, Hal leads his own ''Justice League'' with [[Green Arrow]], [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Shazam]], Supergirl, [[Congo Bill#Congorilla|Congorilla]], [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], [[Batwoman]], and the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] in order to avenge the deaths of [[Martian Manhunter]] and Batman.<ref name=JLCJ1>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Jordan eventually recruits some of the former [[Teen Titans|Titans]] members for the League's new lineup, including Batman's successor [[Dick Grayson]], Donna Troy, and Starfire.

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Hal allies himself with six other Lantern Corps during The War of Light. He finds himself facing many of his deceased allies, enemies, and people he failed to save reanimated as undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]s under the control of the Green Lantern Corps' ancient enemy [[Nekron]]. Hal finds himself not only teaming up with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (otherwise known as [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]), who is also resurrected from his death, but also must work with his enemies Sinestro, Atrocitus, Larfleeze, and his former love Carol Ferris (who is now a [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]] once more).

==Other versions==
As with other characters published by DC Comics, many alternative universe versions and analogues of the character have appeared within both the Green Lantern series and other titles. In [[Action Comics]] #856, a [[Bizarro]] version of Hal, called Yellow Lantern, is featured. Yellow Lantern possessed a [[Sinestro Corps]] ring and used to inflict fear among [[Htrae]]'s inhabitants.

The Green Lantern of [[Earth-5]] is shown to be the Hal Jordan of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel's]] world in the new 52 multiverse. He is killed in [[Countdown: Arena]] #2 by [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]. A Green Lantern named Hal Jordan III, grandson of the original Hal Jordan, from the world of [[Batman Beyond]]. He is labeled as Green Lantern of Earth-12. He loses his left arm in battle with Monarch.

The character has also appeared in and been the focus of many Elseworlds titles such including ''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'', ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]'', ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', ''[[Green Lantern: Evil's Might]]'' and the John Byrne penned ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]] 2'' and a part of the Frank Miller ''Dark Knight'' universe, appearing in ''[[All Star Batman and Robin]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''.

In the DC/Marvel Company crossover series [[Amalgam Comics]], there appeared to be two amalgams of Hal. The [[Iron Lantern]] was the amalgam of Hal Jordan and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. His identity was known as Hal Stark. Another unknown amalgam of Hal Jordan appeared in ''Speed Demon'' #1, in which the Speed Demon killed him, as apparently this Jordan had committed a horrible crime.

Hal Jordan is a character in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', which featured a [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] between DC and Marvel Comics. Despite the fact that both teams travel to both of their respective universes, this is one of the few comics featuring multiple universes that remains in (DC) continuity.

An alternate version of Hal Jordan also appeared in the Pocket Universe Earth created by the [[Time Trapper]]. He, along with various other heroes who had no superpowers in this reality, teamed up with a good version of [[Lex Luthor]] to stop three evil Kryptonians who had escaped from the [[Phantom Zone]]. Hal Jordan piloted an advanced jet craft that was easily destroyed by the Kryptonians.

Though Jordan was never one of the main characters in the award-winning mini-series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', a version of him from the Earth-22 (A post ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]) made a cameo on the end of the storyline" ''Thy Kingdom Come''" story arc on the issue of ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 3) #22, during Batman's funeral.

A new version of [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]], the villainous Green Lantern analogue of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], has recently appeared and is stated as being the "original" (though previously unseen) iteration of the character. He has mysteriously reappeared after having been presumed dead years earlier. It is implied that he was reborn in his reality as a direct result of Jordan's resurrection in ''Green Lantern: Rebirth''.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #50</ref>

==In other media==
{{Main|Green Lantern in other media}}

===Animated television===
====''The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure''====
*Hal Jordan made his first cartoon appearance in 1967 in an [[eponym]]ously-titled segment of ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' cartoon by [[Filmation]]. In it, he fought evil with the aid of a blue-skinned, pointed-eared sidekick [[Kairo (Superman/Aquaman Hour)|Kairo]], Hal's Venusian Helper. It is revealed that Hal is a member of the [[Justice League|JLA]]. In these cartoons, Hal Jordan was voiced by [[Gerald Mohr]].

====''Super Friends''====
*Green Lantern was featured as a 'guest hero' in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]''. Unfortunately, his powers were consistently misrepresented, such creating vehicles for transportation with his ring such as a "Lantern Jet," ignoring the fact that the power ring traditionally allows him to simply will himself to fly. Also, whenever Green Lantern would use his ring to create something, such as a life raft or a double-bladed transport helicopter, the final product would often be shown with its appropriate colors, instead of the same green shade as the power beam.
*Hal Jordan and his archnemesis Sinestro were also regulars in ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' which aired 1978–1979. One notable episode featured a re-telling of Hal's origin in which the dying Abin Sur passes on his ring. The character would continue to be brought back for the subsequent ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' shows. [[Michael Rye]] voiced the character for all three shows.

Releasing a discharge of power from his ring, he seemingly perished in the blast alongside his fellow Lanterns, with his ring going across the universe in search of another wielder.

*A nod to Hal Jordan was made in ''Ninja Turtles'' (2003) 7th season episode "The Super Power Struggle". The character in reference was Al Gordon, The Green Mantle. An emerald cape gives him super powers, however it is not triggered by will power. The character lost the cape after a fight with his arch nemesis, Mechazar. A kid found it and kept it as a collectible for more than 40 years. The character in modern day looks like Hal Jordan from 1990 to 2004 with the gray streaks of hair. He reclaims the cape and repairs it to resume the identity of The Green Mantle once again.

*Kirby Krackle composed a song about Hal Jordan called "Ring Capacity" that hasn't been added to any album although it has been announced they will add it to their next album.

*In ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' episode "The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition", Raj says he likes Green Lantern, but thinks it's "pretty lame" that he can be defeated by the color yellow. When Sheldon remarks that only the modern Green Lantern is vulnerable to yellow, Leonard inserts that the Golden Age version was vulnerable to wood. Raj then says: "Great, so I can take them both out with a No. 2 pencil?".

* Tom Clancy's Op-center novel ''Divide and Conquer'' mentions that the United States assistant outer secretary is named Hal Jordan and that he has a wife named Barri Allen-Jordan, referring to the Flash.
