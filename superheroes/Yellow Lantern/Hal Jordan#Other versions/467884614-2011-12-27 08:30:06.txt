'''Harold "Hal" Jordan''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] known as [[Green Lantern]], the first human shown to join the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. Jordan is the second DC Comics character to adopt the Green Lantern moniker. Jordan was created in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]], and made his first appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #22 (October 1959) to replace the original Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book| last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Green Lantern | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopaedia | pages = 144–147 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

In 1994, the story "[[Emerald Twilight]]" saw Hal Jordan turn into the [[supervillain]] '''[[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'''. Later, in the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries, he attempts cosmic genocide. He was replaced by [[Kyle Rayner]] as the new Green Lantern for the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]]. In 1996's crossover story "[[The Final Night]]", he attempted to return to his heroic roots by dying to save the Earth, and later returned as a spirit of redemption in the persona of the '''[[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]'''. Hal Jordan was resurrected in the 2004 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'', which revealed that Parallax was actually an alien parasitic entity that influenced his prior villainy. He subsequently returned to the Green Lantern Corps and was the protagonist of the fourth volume of ''Green Lantern''. He is portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]] as the main protagonist in the 2011 film ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''.

Hal Jordan was ranked 7th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=IGN|first=IGN|title=100 Greatest Superheroes of all time|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/7|work=IGN|publisher=IGN|accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===Recreated for the Silver Age===
After achieving great success in 1956 in reviving the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] character ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'', DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] looked toward recreating the Green Lantern from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Like The Flash, Schwartz wanted this new character to have a different secret identity, origin, and personality than his 1940s counterpart. A long time [[science-fiction]] fan and [[literary agent]], Schwartz wanted a more sci-fi based Green Lantern, as opposed to the mystical powers of [[Alan Scott]], the forties Green Lantern. He enlisted writer [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and artist [[Gil Kane]], who in 1959 would reintroduce Green Lantern to the world in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]] #22'' (September–October 1959).

The character was a success, and it was quickly decided to follow-up his three issue run on ''Showcase'' with a self-titled series. ''Green Lantern #1'' began in July–August 1960 and would continue until #84 in April–May 1972.

[[Image:Showcase 22.png|thumb|left|Cover to ''Showcase'' #22 (October 1959), the first appearance of Hal Jordan. Art by [[Gil Kane]].]]
This creative team was responsible for introducing many of the major characters in Hal Jordan's life. First and foremost was [[Carol Ferris]], Jordan's love interest. She was in charge of Ferris Aircraft, and as such, Hal's boss. While she preferred Green Lantern to Hal Jordan, she took an active role in trying to win him over, even going so far as to propose to him in the old [[Leap year|Leap Year]] tradition. Although she gave Jordan some attention, her job and company always came first. Ferris was a strong-willed woman of authority at a time when this was rare, especially in comic books.

Another unique addition to Green Lantern's supporting cast was his best friend, [[Thomas Kalmaku|Tom Kalmaku]], who was both Hal's mechanic and the chronicler of his super-hero adventures, after suceeding in working out his identity. An [[Inuit]] (Eskimo) from Alaska, Tom's nickname was "Pie" or "Pieface", in reference to Eskimo Pie ice cream sandwiches. Like "Chop Chop" from the [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk]] comics, this nickname is today understandably viewed as racist and has been downplayed by most modern writers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} However, unlike "Chop Chop", Tom was actually a competent and intelligent character with a well-rounded personality, not a stereotypical buffoon. Despite the unfortunate nickname, Tom Kalmaku was among the first minority characters to be portrayed in this manner and broke new ground for mainstream comic books. Tom would later be followed by another trail-blazing minority character, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], the first African-American super-hero of the DC Universe.

Jordan's masters, the mysterious [[Guardians of the Universe]], were physically based on [[David Ben-Gurion]], the first [[Prime Minister of Israel]], and were developed from an idea Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring [[Captain Comet]] in ''[[Strange Adventures]] #22'' (July, 1952) entitled "Guardians of the Clockwork Universe".<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/03/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-148 comic book urban legends revealed #148], [[comicbookresources.com]]</ref>

Schwartz and company also allowed Jordan to have a family, which was another rare thing at this time in superhero comics. While he didn't have a wife or children of his own, he had many interactions with his two older brothers, Jack, a district attorney, and Jim, a more comical figure. A reporter, Sue Williams, suspected Jim of being Green Lantern due to his appearence and his reputaion of being scatterbrained. 

Starting in issue #17, [[Gardner Fox]] joined the book to share writing duties with John Broome. The quartet of Schwartz, Broome, Fox, and Kane remained the core creative team until 1970.

==="Relevant comics"===
Starting with issue #76, [[Dennis O'Neil]] took over scripting and [[Neal Adams]], who had drawn the cover of issue #63, became the series' artist. This issue is one of the comics which is considered to have ushered in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The collaboration of O'Neil and Adams produced the most famous and celebrated runs on Green Lantern.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Julius Schwartz remained editor and hand-selected the two{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} to revitalize the title, the sales of which had been slipping. O'Neil and Adams had already begun preparation for the classic run in the form of their re-workings of another DC superhero, the archer [[Green Arrow]].

[[Image:GLGA76BS.jpg|thumb|250px|Three panels ushering in the O'Neil/Adams run in ''Green Lantern'' #76.]]
Wanting to represent his own political beliefs in comics and take on social issues of the late sixties and early seventies, O'Neil devised the idea of pitting Hal Jordan, who as an intergalactic cop stood for not only law and order but The Establishment, against Oliver Queen (Green Arrow), who O’Neil had characterized as an outspoken liberal and stood for the counter-culture movement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The first issue he wrote had Green Lantern capturing a street"punk who was pushing around a man. All around him, people start throwing things at the bewildered Jordan. As he steps in to attack, he is stopped by Green Arrow, who explains that the man he defended was a [[slum lord]]  and goes even further to show Lantern the conditions of the slum. At the roof, in a now famous scene, an elderly African-American man grills Jordan as to why he allowed [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] against African-Americans to continue on Earth, when he saved "the orange skins" and "the purple skins" from exactly that.

Following Schwartz's approval of the story, Neal Adams was brought in to replace Kane, much to O'Neil's surprise. The pair had previously done a [[Batman]] (where Adams successfully reconstructed the character into a more dramatic "Dark Knight"), and Adams had redesigned Green Arrow's costume. The pair tackled a social issues including corruption, sexism, cults, consumerism, the environment, racism, poverty, and even (subtly) child molestation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} However, none were more shocking and controversial{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} than the issue explored [[Snowbirds Don't Fly|in the famous "Snowbirds Don't Fly" issues #85 and #86]]. Neal Adams drew the cover, which showed Green Arrow’s youthful [[side-kick]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], shooting [[heroin]]. Editor Julius Schwartz did not want it published.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Neither did publisher [[Carmine Infantino]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} But over at [[Marvel Comics]], [[Stan Lee]] had green-lit ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96, which featured pills and presented an anti-drug message ''without'' the [[Comics Code Authority]] seal. Facing opposition and controversy, the Comics Code Authority revised its rules in regard to what could and could not be presented in comic books and, while still restrictive, became more lenient. As a result,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} DC Comics approved Adams' cover and O'Neil wrote a two-part story involving drugs with Speedy being hooked. New York [[John V. Lindsay|Mayor John V. Lindsay]] wrote a letter to DC Comics in response to the issue commending them, which was printed in issue #86.

Due to low sales ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' was cancelled. Schwartz had a reprint of an older story published for issue #88 and saw the comic he began back in 1959 come to an end in 1972 with issue #89. However, he had  O’Neil and  Adams do one last story together, stretched out over ''Flash'' #217-219 as a backup story. Green Lantern continued to appear in backup stories of ''Flash'' from 1972 until the ''Green Lantern'' title was resumed in 1976.

===1980s exile===
From Green Lantern #151 (April 1982) until #172 (January 1984), Jordan was exiled into space for a year by the Guardians in order to prove his loyalty to the Green Lantern Corps, having been accused of paying too much attention to Earth when he had an entire "sector" of the cosmos to patrol. When he returned to Earth, he found himself embroiled in a dispute with Carol Ferris. Faced with a choice between love and the power ring, Jordan chose to resign from the  Corps. The Guardians called upon Jordan's backup, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], to regular duty as his replacement.

In 1985, the "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" storyline that rebooted much of DC Comics' character continuity saw Jordan  again take up the mantle of Green Lantern. The new Corps, with seven members residing on Earth, included several aliens, John Stewart, and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]. Jordan became romantically involved with an alien Lantern named [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]], for which he came under fire; a difference in time between Earth and her planet meant that in Earth years, she was over 250 years old, while on her planet she was only 14 years old. The alien Lanterns took a more direct hand in human affairs, a fact not appreciated by human governments. ([[Kilowog]] helped create the [[Rocket Red]]s for the [[Soviet Union]]). Eventually, the Earth corps broke up, several members returning to their home sectors. The Guardians soon returned to this dimension, and Jordan worked with them to rebuild the fractured Corps.

===1990s===
During this time, the character's origin story is re-told and expanded in two limited series by Gerard Jones, ''[[Emerald Dawn]]'' and ''Emerald Dawn II''. The first series expanded the role of the Corps in his origin and also provided more details about his childhood and his relationship with his father and brothers, while the sequel detailed the role of Jordan in the downfall of Sinestro.

In the 1992 [[prestige format]] [[graphic novel]] ''Green Lantern: [[Ganthet#Ganthet's Tale|Ganthet's Tale]]'' (ISBN 1-56389-026-7) (story by [[Larry Niven]], script & art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]), Hal Jordan first encounters [[Ganthet]], one of the [[Guardians of the Universe]]. He asks Hal to help Ganthet battle a renegade Guardian, Dawlakispokpok (or Dawly, for short) who has attempted to use a [[Time travel|time machine]] to change history.

[[Image:Greenl50.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover to ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #50 (March 1994). Hal Jordan becomes Parallax. Art by Darryl Banks.|thumb]]
In the 1993 ''[[The Death of Superman#Reign of the Supermen!|Reign of the Supermen!]]'' storyline, the villainous [[Hank Henshaw]] disguised as a reborn Cyborg Superman enlists the alien tyrant [[Mongul]] and his forces and comes to Earth in a plot to take advantage of [[The Death of Superman|the death of Superman]]. In the process, [[Coast City]] (Jordan's former home) is destroyed and all of its seven million inhabitants murdered, bringing Jordan to take revenge on Mongul, who has replaced it with Engine City, with which he plans to turn Earth into a new Warworld. Jordan was off world at the time of the attack on his hometown, having returned well after its destruction. Angered, he flies into Engine City and makes short work of Mongul's guards. Jordan then bum-rushes Mongul, who at that moment was seconds away from killing a weakened Superman. Since Mongul's skin pigment was yellow and Engine City was powered by Kryptonite gas, Jordan had a somewhat difficult time fighting the hulking alien. After the fight results in Jordan's arm and knee being broken, he takes advantage of Mongul's arrogance and uses his ring to create power armor for himself with which he used to lift Steel's ([[John Henry Irons]]') hammer and strike Mongul with it. The blow was so powerful that the hammer was shattered into pieces and Mongul was knocked out and eventually incarcerated. It was later revealed that the Cyborg Superman's wife came from Coast City, and he destroyed it as he wanted to remove all traces of his past life.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #46</ref> This leads into the ''[[Emerald Twilight]]'' three-part arc: Jordan uses his ring to recreate the city as an instrument in the process of overcoming his grief, but a Guardian admonishes him for using the ring for personal gain and summons him to Oa for trial.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #48</ref> Angered at what he sees as the Guardians' ungrateful and callous behaviour, Jordan goes [[Insanity|insane]] and attacks Oa to seize the full power of the Central Battery, destroying the Corps in the process, taking their power rings and leaving them to die in space, and ending the arc when he kills [[Kilowog]], [[Sinestro]] who has been resurrected to fight him but has his neck snapped, and all the Guardians except for [[Ganthet]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #50</ref> He then renounces his life as Green Lantern, adopting the name [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] after absorbing the Power Battery's vast powers. After he emerges from the Central Power Battery, he walks past and looks at the dead Guardians and steps on his former ring, crushing it in the process.

Jordan is replaced by [[Kyle Rayner]] as the Green Lantern of Earth when Rayner comes into possession of the last power ring, created from the shattered remains of Jordan's. Shortly afterward, Guy Gardner has visions of Oa's destruction and his yellow power ring's energy (being powered by residual Green Lantern's energy) is at abnormal levels. Soon after, Gardner goes to Oa to investigate. He brings [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] (Ferrin Colos), [[The Ray]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Captain Atom]], [[Alan Scott]] and [[Arisia]] with him for back up. Upon arrival they discover Kilowog's corpse. Jordan, using stealth, attacks them, defeating them quick. Guy tricks Hal into thinking he is dead by making a fake dead construct of himself. He engages in battle with Parallax, absorbing his energy as they fight. But ultimately Jordan is too powerful for Gardner and defeats him in minutes, destroying his yellow power ring and punching out his eye. After the battle Hal sends them all back to Earth warning them to leave him alone in the future. Not long afterwards, Parallax attempts to rewrite history to his own liking with the help of [[Hank Hall|Extant]] in ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]].'' Parallax destroys the [[Time Trapper]] and attempts to remake the universe into a perfect, peaceful place. The process causes time disruptions through out time. Superman, Kyle Rayner and [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] call upon Earth's heroes to stop this crisis. Parallax reveals himself as the enemy by knocking out Superman with a single blow. Parallax and Exant battle the wide array of heroes. They are eventually defeated, with Green Arrow shooting an arrow into Jordan's heart as Kyle Rayner holds him in a full-nelson. Later, in the 1996 ''[[Final Night]]'' miniseries/crossover storyline, Jordan returns and sacrifices his life to reignite the Sun (which had been extinguished by the [[Sun-Eater]]).

During the [[Emerald Knights]] storyline, when Kyle Rayner goes on an accidental time-travelling trip, he ends up unintentionally drawing a past version of Hal into the present where Hal is shocked to learn of the crimes his future self had committed as Parallax.<ref name=GL106>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #106</ref>

In the 1999 mini-series ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgement]]'', Jordan becomes the newest incarnation of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], released from [[Purgatory]] after a [[fallen angel]] attempted to take that power.<ref>{{gcdb series|id=7101|title=Day of Judgment}}</ref> Soon after assuming this mantle, Jordan chooses to bend his mission from a spirit of vengeance to one of redemption, also making other appearances through some of DC Comics' other story lines, such as advising [[Superman]] during the ''Emperor [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'' storyline (Where the Joker steals the reality-warping power of [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]) and erases all public knowledge of [[Wally West]]'s identity as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] after his terrible first battle with [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], which led to his wife miscarrying their twins. He also appeared in a 4-part story arc in the series ''Legends of the DC Universe'' (issues #33-36). A new series based on this premise, titled ''The Spectre'' (volume 4), ran for 27 issues from 2001 to 2003.

===2000s===
Following up on the ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'' miniseries, DC Comics subsequently began a new ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) series starting with issue #1 (July 2005), with Hal Jordan once again a Green Lantern. Trying to rebuild his life, Hal Jordan has moved to the nearly deserted Coast City, which is slowly being reconstructed. He has been reinstated as a Captain in the United States Air Force, and works in the Test Pilot Program at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. The series introduces new supporting characters for Hal, most notably a man from Hal's past, Air Force's General Jonathan "Herc" Stone, who learned Hal's secret as Green Lantern during a battle with the Manhunters and acts as his ally. He also begins to develop a romantic attraction with his fellow pilot, the beautiful Captain [[Jillian Pearlman|Jillian "Cowgirl" Pearlman]].<ref name=GL1>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #1 (May 2005)</ref><ref name=GL2>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #2 (June 2005)</ref><ref name=GL3>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #3 (August 2005)</ref> The returning characters also include Carol Ferris, Tom Kalmaku, and Hal's younger brother James Jordan with his sister-in-law Susan and their children, Howard and Jane.

The Green Lantern Corps also has been successfully rebuilt. Despite the revelation that Hal's past villainous activity was because of the influence of Parallax, many of Hal's fellow Corps officers (except Kilowog, Salaak, Stewart, Gardner, and Rayner) are unwilling to trust him. Despite being freed from Parallax, his experience also has led Hal occasionally to lack of confidence and self-doubts. Hal also become friends with Kyle Rayner after their first battle with Parallax.

In his new title, he faces revamped versions of his Silver Age foes such as [[Hector Hammond]], [[Shark (comics)|The Shark]] and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]].<ref name=GL4>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #4 (August 2005)</ref><ref name=GL5>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #5 (November 2005)</ref><ref name=GL6>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #6 (December 2005)</ref>

Hal helps briefly with the attack of the [[OMACs]] and [[Brother Eye]].<ref name=IC6>''Infinite Crisis'' #6</ref> He also fights alongside a group of heroes against the Society, defending [[Metropolis(comics)|Metropolis]]. [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], leads the Green Lantern Corps attack against [[Superboy-Prime]] with Hal appearing in the group.<ref name=IC7>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref>

As part of DC's retconning of the entire universe; as of ''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #10, the book has skipped ahead [[One Year Later|one year]], bringing drastic changes to Hal Jordan's life, as with every other hero in the DC Universe. It is revealed that Jordan spent time as a P.O.W. in an un-named conflict and has feelings of guilt from his inability to free himself and his fellow Captives.<ref name=GL17>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #17 (November 2006)</ref>

A new account of Green Lantern's origins was released in the (2008) ''Green Lantern'' series. In this ''new'' origin, Hal Jordan, is working as an assistant mechanic under [[Tom Kalmaku]] himself, barred from flying due to his insubordination while in the [[United States Air Force|U.S.A.F.]] and his employers lingering guilt about his father's death in the line of duty, when [[Abin Sur]], fighting [[Atrocitus]] of the Five Inversion, crashes near Coast City.<ref name="GL29">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #29 (March 2008)</ref><ref name="GL30">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #30 (April 2008)</ref>

Hal and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps find themselves at war with [[Sinestro]] and his army, the [[Sinestro Corps]] during the events of the [[Sinestro Corps War]]<ref name=GLSCS>''Green Lantern Sinestro Corps Special''</ref> As a Green Lantern native to Earth, Hal is featured in the [[Final Crisis]] mini-series by [[Grant Morrison]].<ref name=FC1>''Final Crisis'' #1</ref>

In the Agent Orange story arc, Hal Jordan is briefly in command of [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Agent Orange]]'s power battery after he steals it from Agent Orange in a battle. The orange light of avarice converses with Jordan, his costume changes, and he becomes the new Agent Orange. However, [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Larfleeze]] quickly takes his power battery back from Jordan.<ref name=GL42>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #42 (June 2009)</ref>

Jordan is also a character of focus in the new ''Justice League of America'' series as a charter member of the revamped JLA. He is also involved in the first plotline of the ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' monthly series, teaming up first with [[Batman]] and later [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. When teamed with the fledgling Supergirl, Hal is very impressed with her cleverness, although he finds her flirtatious behavior somewhat unnerving.<ref name=BB2>''Brave and the Bold'' (vol. 3) #2</ref>

In the ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'' mini-series, Hal leads his own ''Justice League'' with [[Green Arrow]], [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Shazam]], Supergirl, [[Congo Bill#Congorilla|Congorilla]], [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], [[Batwoman]], and the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] in order to avenge the deaths of [[Martian Manhunter]] and Batman.<ref name=JLCJ1>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Jordan eventually recruits some of the former [[Teen Titans|Titans]] members for the League's new lineup, including Batman's successor [[Dick Grayson]], Donna Troy, and Starfire.

===2010s===
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Hal allies himself with six other Lantern Corps during The War of Light. He finds himself facing many of his deceased allies, enemies, and people he failed to save reanimated as undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]s under the control of the Green Lantern Corps' ancient enemy [[Nekron]]. Hal finds himself not only teaming up with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (otherwise known as [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]), who is also resurrected from his death, but also must work with his enemies Sinestro, Atrocitus, Larfleeze, and his former love that he has sort of got back together with Carol Ferris (who is now a [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]] once more). Hal fights the guardian, "Scar", of which he defeats according to the prophecy from the "Book of Oa". 

After the events of ''Brightest Day: Green Lantern'', the storyline continues into ''[[War of the Green Lanterns]]''. DC Comics revealed the covers.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #65</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #59</ref><ref>''Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors'' #9</ref> that Hal will be joining the Sinestro Corps during "War of the Green Lanterns". Hal and Guy are captured by Krona and forced to watch Krona taunt Hal that his friends including Carol are stuck in the book and Hal has more important things to do then worry about one or two earth creatures.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #66 (June 2011)</ref> However, Hal and Guy escape from Krona's forces and reclaim their Green Lantern rings to fight Krona and his entity-possessed Guardians.<ref>''Green Lantern Emerald Warriors'' #10 (May 2011)</ref> During the final battle, Hal manages to free Carol, Sinestro and the others from the Book of the Black. Also, Sinestro becomes a Green Lantern again. Hal kills Krona, releasing the entities from the Guardians. However, the Guardians believing Hal to be the most dangerous Green Lantern, discharge him from the Corps, strip him of his ring and return him to Earth.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #67 (July 2011)</ref> It is revealed that the Guardians are afraid of Jordan because they believe what happened to Krona would eventually happen to them if they allow him to continue being a Green Lantern.<ref>''War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath'' #1 (July 2011)</ref>

Jordan is featured as a part of Justice League series relaunch following the universe-altering events of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]''. The title takes place five years prior as Jordan assists [[Batman]] against [[Darkseid|a mysterious threat]].<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2, #1 (August 2011)</ref> In this it is shown he is already friends with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and each know the other's secret identity.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2, #2 (October 2011)</ref>

Meanwhile, in the "present," Jordan is back to his civilian Earth life due to the events of War of the Green Lanterns storyline being considered canon in the new continuity. He's also been discharged from the United States Air Force. Jordan is arrested and Carol Ferris bails him out. She offers him a job, but not as a pilot. They go on a date but Ferris is enraged when Jordan fails to propose marriage. He is then confronted by Sinestro who offers him a Green Lantern ring.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 5, #1 (September 2011)</ref> Sinestro offers Hal a ring he created himself and has complete control over it, telling Hal if he wants his real ring back he will help him destroy the Sinestro Corps who have enslaved Korugar during his absence.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 5, #2 (October 2011)</ref> Before they leave for Krougar Hal wants to say goodbye to [[Carol Ferris]] but [[Sinestro]] will not let him, stating that Doing what he needs is more important than Hal's failed romance. When the two arrive at Korugar, Hal is tasked by Sinestro in deactivating the Yellow Power Battery, as he explains that only a Green Lantern can do it. However, when Hal gets to the Battery, it begins to disintegrate him. Before Hal is fully disintegrated, he expresses his belief that Sinestro set him up. However Sinestro actually feels shock to Hal's seeming death.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 5, #3 (November 2011)</ref> With his last power left in his ring Hal creates an image of Carol to apologize to her.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 5, #4 (December 2011)</ref>

==Other versions==
As with other characters published by DC Comics, many alternative universe versions and analogues of the character have appeared within both the Green Lantern series and other titles. In [[Action Comics]] #856, a [[Bizarro]] version of Hal, called Yellow Lantern, is featured. Yellow Lantern possessed a [[Sinestro Corps]] ring and used to inflict fear among [[Htrae]]'s inhabitants.

The Green Lantern of [[Earth-5]] is shown to be the Hal Jordan of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel's]] world in the new 52 multiverse. He is killed in [[Countdown: Arena]] #2 by [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]. A Green Lantern named Hal Jordan III, grandson of the original Hal Jordan, from the world of [[Batman Beyond]]. He is labelled as Green Lantern of Earth-12. He loses his left arm in battle with Monarch.

The character has also appeared in and been the focus of many Elseworlds titles such including ''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'', ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]'', ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', ''[[Green Lantern: Evil's Might]]'' and the John Byrne penned ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]] 2'' and a part of the Frank Miller ''Dark Knight'' universe, appearing in ''[[All Star Batman and Robin]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''.

In the DC/Marvel Company crossover series [[Amalgam Comics]], there appeared to be two amalgams of Hal. The [[Iron Lantern]] was the amalgam of Hal Jordan and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. His identity was known as Hal Stark. Another unknown amalgam of Hal Jordan appeared in ''[[List of Amalgam Comics publications#Speed Demon|Speed Demon]]'' #1, in which the [[Speed Demon (Amalgam Comics)|Speed Demon]] killed him, as apparently this Jordan had committed a horrible crime.

Hal Jordan is a character in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', which featured a [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] between DC and Marvel Comics. Despite the fact that both teams travel to both of their respective universes, this is one of the few comics featuring multiple universes that remains in (DC) continuity.

An alternate version of Hal Jordan also appeared in the Pocket Universe Earth created by the [[Time Trapper]]. He, along with various other heroes who had no superpowers in this reality, teamed up with a good version of [[Lex Luthor]] to stop three evil Kryptonians who had escaped from the [[Phantom Zone]]. Hal Jordan piloted an advanced jet craft that was easily destroyed by the Kryptonians.

Though Jordan was never one of the main characters in the award-winning mini-series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', a version of him from the Earth-22 (A post ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]) made a cameo on the end of the storyline" ''Thy Kingdom Come''" story arc on the issue of ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 3) #22, during Batman's funeral.

A new version of [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]], the villainous Green Lantern analogue of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], has recently appeared and is stated as being the "original" (though previously unseen) iteration of the character. He has mysteriously reappeared after having been presumed dead years earlier. It is implied that he was reborn in his reality as a direct result of Jordan's resurrection in ''Green Lantern: Rebirth''.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #50</ref>

In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Hal Jordan was reckless as a flying ace. He alongside with Carol Ferris was on a F-22 Raptor entering Western Europe territory before the [[Shark (comics)|Shark]] attacks. Hal forces the Shark to crash his jet into Carol's jet, and both of them barely got out of the ejection system. Upon their return to America, Hal was about to fly the jet. However, he witnesses the spaceship crash on Earth and was approached by the ship's survivor, Abin Sur, asking for help.<ref>''Flashpoint: Hal Jordan'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> However, Abin Sur is subsequently taken into custody by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the government to be questioned about his reasons for being on Earth.<ref>''Flastpoint: Abin Sur - The Green Lantern'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Later, when [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] [[invisible plane]]s invade over [[Coast City]], Hal and Carol manage to shoot down the invisible planes and the Hydra that they dropped. Later, Hal is volunteered by the President of the United States for a mission to use a [[Green Arrow|Green Arrow Industries]] nuclear weapon to bomb Western Europe.<ref>''Flashpoint: Hal Jordan'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Later, Hal is ready to fly on the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] with the Green Arrow nuclear weapon attempting to destroy Western Europe at the end of the Atlantean/Amazon war.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref> During the battles on New Themyscira, Hal possesses the remaining nuclear weapon, but his firing mechanism jams. Hal's only option is to fly through New Themyscira in a [[suicide attack]], causing a process which destroys not only New Themyscira's invisible shield, but Hal with it. Afterwards, [[Thomas Kalmaku]] gives Carol a note saying that Hal was afraid to say that he had always loved her. Carol sees the engagement ring that he was going to propose to her.<ref>''Flashpoint: Hal Jordan'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>

===Animated television===
====''The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure''====
Hal Jordan made his first cartoon appearance in 1967 in an [[eponym]]ously-titled segment of ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' cartoon by [[Filmation]]. In it, he fought evil with the aid of a blue-skinned, pointed-eared sidekick [[Kairo (Superman/Aquaman Hour)|Kairo]], Hal's Venusian Helper. It is revealed that Hal is a member of the [[Justice League|JLA]]. In these cartoons, Hal Jordan was voiced by [[Gerald Mohr]].

====''Super Friends''====
*Green Lantern was featured as a 'guest hero' in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]''. Unfortunately, his powers were consistently misrepresented, such creating vehicles for transportation with his ring such as a "Lantern Jet," ignoring the fact that the power ring traditionally allows him to simply will himself to fly. Also, whenever Green Lantern would use his ring to create something, such as a life raft or a double-bladed transport helicopter, the final product would often be shown with its appropriate colors, instead of the same green shade as the power beam.
*Hal Jordan and his archnemesis Sinestro were also regulars in ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' which aired 1978–1979. One notable episode featured a re-telling of Hal's origin in which the dying Abin Sur passes on his ring. The character would continue to be brought back for the subsequent ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' shows. [[Michael Rye]] voiced the character for all three shows.

====''Duck Dodgers''====
[[Image:Duck dodgers Hal Jordan.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Hal Jordan in ''Duck Dodgers'']]
Hal Jordan also appeared in a 2003 episode of the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' animated series entitled "The Green Loontern", in which Duck Dodgers is mistakenly given a Green Lantern uniform by his dry cleaners. Donning it, he meets the Corps and fights [[Sinestro]] before meeting Hal (voiced by [[Kevin Smith]]), who is wearing Dodgers' too-small uniform.

====DC animated universe====
[[File:HalJ.jpg|thumb|right|Hal Jordan in ''Justice League Unlimited'', with [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] and [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] behind him and [[Batman]] to the right.]]

In the DC Animated Universe, it doesn't appear Jordan is or ever was a Green Lantern.  [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] is instead Earth's primary Green Lantern, with a guest appearance on [[Static Shock]] establishing that Sinestro is Stewart's arch-nemesis.  Jordan's origin as a Green Lantern is also given to Stewart's backup in the DCAU, [[Kyle Rayner]].  

In the [[Superman: The Animated Series]] episode, In Brightest Day, [[Kyle Rayner]] crashes into Hal Jordan's plane during a battle with [[Sinestro]].

Hal Jordan makes a physical appearance in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[The Once and Future Thing]] Part II: Time Warped". When time becomes fluid, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] is unexpectedly replaced by Hal. He quickly introduces himself to his bewildered teammates and continues on as if nothing happened, explaining that the ring has brought him "up to speed". Later, as the assembled heroes close in on the time-warping villain responsible, Hal reverts back to John, causing an annoyed [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] to say "Make up your mind!". Hal was voiced by [[Adam Baldwin]] in this episode.

====''The Batman''====
In the fourth [[season finale]] of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', "[[The Joining, Part Two|The Joining]]", the Justice League was introduced. Hal Jordan was included among its members, in a non-speaking cameo. He and the other members of the League play a role in the show's fifth season. He appears in the episode "Ring Toss" where he helps Batman take on Sinestro and a ring-powered [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], and in the finale "Lost Heroes", both times voiced by [[Dermot Mulroney]].

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
Hal Jordan appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Eyes of Despero!", voiced by [[Loren Lester]]. He is first seen leading many other Green Lanterns into battle against [[Despero]], only to have them be turned against him by Despero's mind control. Releasing a discharge of power from his ring, he seemingly perished in the blast alongside his fellow Lanterns, with his ring going across the universe in search of another wielder. It makes its way to [[Batman]], sending him to space. Hal, the [[missing in action]] Lanterns, and the [[Guardians of the Universe]] were revealed to be alive and in the ring near the end. Hal later makes a cameo appearance as a member of the Justice League of America in a flashback sequence shown at the beginning of "Sidekicks Assemble!" He is also mentioned in "Darkseid Descending!", where Guy Gardner and [[Booster Gold]] get into a fight over who gets to have Hal's former room on the [[Justice League Satellite]].

====''Young Justice''====
Both Hal Jordan and John Stewart appear as members of the JLA in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series.<ref>{{Cite web| author = G-Man | title =Comic-Con: Brave and the Bold & Young Justice Panel | publisher = Comic Vine | date =2010-07-24 | url =http://www.comicvine.com/news/comic-con-brave-and-the-bold-young-justice-panel/141716/ | accessdate = 2010-07-26}}</ref> Hal makes a non-speaking appearance at the end of the pilot episode, "Independence Day", where he and John use their rings to contain [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] after he is defeated by [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Aqualad]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]. He then appears helping to bring Mount Justice back online. In the second episode "Welcome to Happy Harbor", Kid Flash mentions that Superman and Green Lantern hollowed out Mount Justice, but it is unclear to which Green Lantern Kid Flash was referring.  In the episode "Failsafe" Hal and John Stewart accompany Batman to make contact with an alien fleet headed to Earth.  Hal and John are attacked by an alien weapon that is able to penetrate their ring-shields and disintegrate them.  However, the whole experience was a mental excercise by Martian Manhunter. [[Steven Blum]] will provide his voice later in the series.

====''Green Lantern: The Animated Series''====
Hal Jordan will be the main protagonist in ''[[Green Lantern in other media#Green Lantern: The Animated Series|''Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'', where he will be voiced by [[Josh Keaton]].<ref>http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1104/07/index.htm</ref>

*A nod to Hal Jordan was made in ''Ninja Turtles'' (2003) 7th season episode "The Super Power Struggle". The character in reference was Al Gordon, The Green Mantle. An emerald cape gives him super powers, however it is not triggered by will power. The character lost the cape after a fight with his arch nemesis, Mechazar. A kid found it and kept it as a collectible for more than 40 years. The character in modern day looks like Hal Jordan from 1990 to 2004 with the gray streaks of hair. He reclaims the cape and repairs it to resume the identity of The Green Mantle once again.

*The pop/rock band [[The Roy Clark Method]] released "Sector 2814", a song about Hal Jordan's fall after the ''[[The Death of Superman#Reign of the Supermen!|Reign of the Supermen!]]'' series, on their 2002 album ''[[Mild-Mannered Supermen]]''. A second version of the song appeared on their [[The Roy Clark Method (album)|self-titled]] second album in 2005.<ref>[http://webzoom.freewebs.com/altmusicisdead/07%20Sector%202814.wma Sector 2814 by The Roy Clark Method.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/royclarkmethod The Roy Clark Method official website.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
