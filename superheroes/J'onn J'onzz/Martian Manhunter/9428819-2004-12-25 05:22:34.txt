J'onn J'onzz, the '''Martian Manhunter''', is a fictional [[comic book]] hero appearing in [[DC Comics]]. He is a native of the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and possesses powers beyond those of normal human beings, including [[telepathy]] and the ability to [[shapeshifting|change shape]]. His usual appearance is of a tall hairless green-skinned [[humanoid]].

==History==

J'onn J'onzz first appeared in 1955, in a back-up story in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #225 written by [[Joe Samachson]] and illustrated by [[Joe Certa]]. In the story, J'onn J'onzz was accidentally [[Teleportation|teleported]] to Earth by a human scientist, who immediately had a heart attack and died, leaving the Martian stranded. Fortunately, he was able to use his powers to fit in; adopting a human-like appearance and calling himself "John Jones", he joined the [[police]] force, secretly using his alien powers to help the inhabitants of his new home planet.

Later, during the revival in [[superhero]]es that became known as the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the Manhunter from Mars adopted a more superhero-y ''modus operandi'', openly fighting crime in his real green-skinned form.

The history of the Martian Manhunter is closely linked with that of the [[Justice League]] - he was a founding member of the superhero team in the 1960s, and his appearances with the League kept him in the public eye long after his own series (which ran as a back-up in ''Detective Comics'' and later in ''House of Mystery'') was cancelled.

In addition to serving in the League under his own identity, he also joined (under duress) under the alias of "[[Bloodwynd]]".

The Martian Manhunter received his own ongoing series in [[2000]]. Written by [[John Ostrander]], it lasted 36 issues before being cancelled due to low sales. Outside of this, the Manhunter appears predominantly in the [[Justice League]] comic book. He is, famously, the only character to be involved with every "incarnation" of the league.

He also had a short appearance in the [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]] comic, in the album ''[[The Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes|Preludes and Nocturnes]]'', where [[Dream (Sandman)|Morpheus]], the dreamlord, inquired him about the whereabouts of his Dreamstone.

==In other media==

In the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]], the Martian Manhunter's history is even more closely tied with that of the League.
In the series, the Justice League originates as a temporary uniting of Earth's heroes against an [[alien invasion]]; the invaders had previously invaded Mars, wiping out all the inhabitants except J'onn J'onzz, who travels to Earth to warn of the invaders, and joins the fight against them. When the invaders are defeated, he chooses to remain on Earth as a member of the League.
