The '''Martian Manhunter''' ('''J'onn J'onzz'''), is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[DC Comics]].  He is a native of the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and possesses powers beyond those of normal human beings, including [[telepathy]] and the ability to [[shapeshifting|change shape]].  His usual appearance is of a tall, hairless, green-skinned [[humanoid]].  He is highly sensitive to fire; in some stories this weakness is a physical weakness, and in others it is psychological.  A recent story in the JLA comic book indicates that the [[Guardians of the Universe]] instilled the aversion to fire into the Martians to prevent them from overrunning the universe.

==History==
J'onn J'onzz first appeared in 1955, in a back-up story in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #225 written by [[Joseph Samachson]] and illustrated by [[Joe Certa]].  In the story, J'onn J'onzz was accidentally [[Teleportation|teleported]] to Earth by a human scientist, who immediately had a heart attack and died, leaving the Martian stranded.  Fortunately, he was able to use his powers to fit in; adopting a human-like appearance and calling himself "John Jones", he joined the [[police]] force, secretly using his alien powers to help the inhabitants of his new home planet.

Later, during the revival in [[superhero]]es that became known as the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the Manhunter from Mars adopted a more characteristically superheroic ''modus operandi'', openly fighting crime in his real green-skinned form.

Later comics have revealed that Mars was dead when J'onn was taken, killed by a mental plague deliberately started by his brother [[Malefic]]. It has also been stated that, prior to becoming a superhero in his real form, he took the identity of the Bronze Wraith, and fought crime with the Justice Experience (a group that essentially existed to fill the gap in [[post-Crisis]] continuity where the Silver Age should be).

[[Image:MartianManhunter.jpg|thumb|left|MM trying (and failing) to relax in his true form and reflecting on his history with the 'League]]The history of the Martian Manhunter is closely linked with that of the [[Justice League]] - he was a founding member of the superhero team in the 1960s, and his appearances with the League kept him in the public eye long after his own series (which ran as a back-up in ''Detective Comics'' and later in ''House of Mystery'') was cancelled.  During the Justice League International series, J'onn was shown to be obsessed with [[Oreos]], thanks in no small part to the influence of [[Captain Marvel]]; the story of how he got over this addiction was later told in his series (which, in a [[retcon]], referred to them as "Chocos").

It was also in Justice League International that it was revealed that his familiar appearance was not his true Martian form, but a "compromise" form between his true self (described by [[Hawkman]] as "like... like [[Gumby]]!") and a human appearance.  This concept would be refined in his own series, which would explain his real form was private and that, even on Mars, his "public" appearance was the familiar version.

In addition to serving in the League under his own identity, he also joined (under duress) under the alias of "[[Bloodwynd]]".

The Martian Manhunter received his own ongoing series in 2000.  Written by [[John Ostrander]], and illustrated by [[Tom Mandrake]] (with fill in art provided by [[Bryan Hitch]], among others), it lasted 36 issues before being cancelled due to low sales.  Outside of this, the Manhunter appears predominantly in the [[Justice League]] comic book.  He is, famously, the only character to be involved with every "incarnation" of the League. (From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, J'onn was absent from the JLA and, indeed, from the DC Universe entirely, having left to find New Mars.  This entire storyline was [[retcon]]ned out during the Crisis, and it is now assumed he ''was'' with the team at this time.)

Also, he has had a few short appearences in the [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]] comic, in the album [[The Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes|Preludes and Nocturnes]], in which [[Dream (DC Comics)|Morpheus]], the dreamlord, inquired him about the whereabouts of his Dreamstone. He also appeared in the final volume of Sandman, [[The Sandman: The Wake|The Wake]], having a conversation with Batman and Clark Kent.

In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''JLA'', and his own 2000 series, it was established that the Martian Manhunter was the most recognized hero in the Southern Hemisphere, and that he maintained a number of different secret identities, many of them outside the United States.  However following two incidents in which John Jones separated from the Martian Manhunter, he has decided to focus on his original human identity and retire the others.

[[Image:Jla89.jpg|thumb|left| JLA #89: Fernus Vs. Plastic Man]] In an attempt to conquer his fear of flames, the Martian Manhunter made a deal with a flame-wielding villainess named Scorch, who wanted his telepathic help dealing with her own mental issues.  This story leads us to find that 20,000 years ago, there was an extremely dangerous race of beings called 'The Burning', which caused large fires to help themselves asexually reproduce.  The Guardians of the Universe split these creatures into the Green Martians and the [[White Martians]], changed their reproductive behavior, and gave them an inherent fear of fire in order to stop their species from destroying much of the universe.  When the Martian Manhunter confronts his fear of fire, he reverts into one of these ancient creatures, changing his name to Fernus, using the genetic memory pools of The Burning race to identify threats, such as [[Vandal Savage]] who killed one of The Burning on ancient Earth.  This same genetic memory made him hate the [[Green Lantern]].

Fernus' powers seem to be increased compared to J'onn's as well; for example, he can phase other beings rather than just himself, allowing him a new way to kill someone.  The implications of this mean he could also shape-shift other people too.  He has access to either pyrokinesis or metamorphic powers, that keep him aflame (even during space travel).  He can breathe fire of such intensity it can damage Scorch (who had previously been thought immune to damage through fire).  His strength allows him to totally dominate the Justice League in combat even without his mental attacks.  He can heal himself from almost total destruction within seconds.  In short, Fernus is a much more powerful version of the most powerful being on Earth.

Although Superman concedes that the Martian Manhunter is the most powerful being on the planet, the Justice League eventually defeats Fernus by re-enlisting Plastic Man, who is immune to the psychic powers of the Martian Manhunter, and has superior shape-changing abilities.  The story also hints that this is the reason that [[Plastic Man]] was originally brought to the Justice League by [[Batman]], who wanted a balance in place in case the Martian Manhunter ever got out of control.

{{spoiler}}

Though J'onn was thought killed in the recent explosion of the Justice League Watchtower, JLE member [[Manitou Dawn]] received a [[telepathic]] vision of J'onn assuring her that he ''will reveal himself, in time'' but needs her help to keep an eye on a mysterious, newly-powerful telepath - the mind-controlling villain [[Key (comics)|Key]] - whose abilities he had always managed to dampen before.  Whether Dawn was contacted by a living J'onn, or merely his [[ghost]], is unknown.  Likewise in question is J'onn's motivation for entrusting guard duties to the female [[shaman]]. [[Manitou Dawn]] has since tried to contact J'onn in the astral plane, without success. J'onn has since resurfaced (in [[Infinite Crisis]]), unconscious and hooked up to a strange building, reminiscent of the vibrational forks from [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] (with the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s corpse attached to it), along with [[Lady Quark]], [[The Ray]], [[Black Adam]] and [[Breach]]. Apparently, [[Superboy]] Prime took J'onn with him before he blew the Watchtower apart, and somehow J'onn had managed to keep some conciousness and telepatic abilities to warn [[Manitou Dawn]].

==Other media==
J'onn J'onzz (he was never referred to as the Martian Manhunter, or even as a Martian) appeared in the 1997 live action made-for-TV movie Justice League of America.  He appeared to find shapeshifting difficult, and no mention was made of any other powers.  He was played by [[David Ogden Stiers]].

In the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]], the Martian Manhunter's history is even more closely tied with that of the League.

In the series, the Justice League originates as a temporary uniting of Earth's heroes against an [[alien invasion]]; the invaders had previously invaded Mars, wiping out all the inhabitants except J'onn J'onzz, who travels to Earth to warn of the invaders, and joins the fight against them.  When the invaders are defeated, he chooses to remain on Earth as a member of the League.  His original Martian form is loosely similar to his well-known form, but his skin is scaly, his head and some of his extremities end in sharp points, his eyes are further apart, and he has no nose.  In the series, he adopts his well-known form when Batman is skeptical to believe an alien he has just met: J'onn responds by transforming into his famous form and suggesting that Batman would be more comfortable with this appearance.  Soon after defeating the aliens that destroyed Mars and invaded Earth, J'onn was enlisted as a member of the newly formed Justice League.

During his time with the League, J'onn assisted in finding [[Morgaine Le Fay]] only to be countered with images of Mars restored by the witch.  Upon sweeping through the mind of the demon, [[Etrigan]], he realized her manipulation and destroyed the Philospher's Stone, which she had been searching for.

After the Watchtower was destroyed when Batman plunged it into the Thanagarian Hyperspace Bypass, the League was reformed to enlist over 50 other members into a new Watchtower where J'onn would monitor all missions.  Unfortunately, the two years he had spent up on the Watchtower had caused J'onn to become extremely remote from the peoples of Earth, even to the point (as [[Wonder Woman]] points out) of disliking humanity.  Once Diana revealed this about J'onn, he decided to resign from active duty in the League to live among Earth's citizens and learn more about them. J'onn J'onzz is voiced by [[Carl Lumbly]].
