The '''Martian Manhunter''' ('''J'onn J'onzz''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[publication]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Joseph Samachson]] and artist Joe Certa, the character first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #225 (Nov. 1955).

The character of J'onn J'onzz has featured in other DC Comics-endorsed products such as [[video game]]s, [[television series]], [[animated film]]s, and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

The Martian Manhunter debuted in the back-up story "''The Strange Experiment of [[Dr. Erdel]]''" in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #225 (Nov. 1955), written by [[Joseph Samachson]] and illustrated by Joe Certa; the character is a green-skinned [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[humanoid]] from the planet Mars, who is pulled to earth by an experimental [[teleportation]] beam (originally presented as an attempted communication device) constructed by Dr. Erdel.  The shock of the encounter kills Dr. Erdel and leaves J'onn with no method of returning home. The character decides to fight crime while waiting for [[Martian]] technology to advance to a stage that will enable his rescue. To that end, he [[human disguise|adopts the identity]] of John Jones, a detective in the fictional Apex City (later [[retcon]]ned as [[Chicago]]).

During this period, the character and his back story differ in some minor and some significant ways from modern treatments. Firstly, as with his counterpart, the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] [[Superman]], his power range is poorly defined, and his powers expand over time as the plot demands. The addition of precognitive abilities (''Detective Comics'' #226) are quickly followed by telepathy and flight,<ref>''[[Detective Comics]]'' #227 (January 1956).</ref><ref>''Detective Comics'' #228 (February 1956).</ref> "Atomic vision", super-hearing,<ref>''Detective Comics'' #231 (May 1956).</ref> and many other powers. In addition, his customary weakness to fire is only manifested when he is in his native Martian form.

A more significant difference is that at this time, there is no suggestion that Mars is a dead planet or that the character is the last of his kind. Many of the tales of the time feature either Martian technology or the appearance of other Martian characters, ''Detective Comics'' #236 (October 1956), for example, features the character making contact with the planet Mars and his parents.

J'onn eventually reveals his existence to the world, after which he operates openly as a superhero and becomes a charter member of the [[Justice League]]. During the character's initial few years as a member of the Justice League, he was often used as a substitute for Superman in stories (just as [[Green Arrow]] was, for [[Batman]]) as DC Comics were worried about using their flagship characters too often in Justice League stories because of fears of overexposure.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #273 (November 1959).</ref> The Martian and the archer inaugurated the team-up format of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]''.<ref>''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #50, October–November 1963.</ref> J'onzz would appear there one other time, working with fellow JLAer the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]].<ref>''The Brave and the Bold'' #56, October–November 1964.</ref>

The detective John Jones is ostensibly killed in action by the Idol Head of Diabolu, an artifact which generates supernatural monsters. J'onn abandons the civilian identity as he decides fighting this new menace will take a great deal of his time.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #326 (April 1964).</ref> At this point his feature moves to ''[[House of Mystery]]'', where J'onn spent the next few years in battle against the Idol Head.<ref>''House of Mystery'' #143 (June 1964) to #158 (April 1966).</ref> Shortly after its defeat he takes the persona of Marco Xavier in order to infiltrate the international crime cartel known as [[Vulture (DC Comics)|VULTURE]], which he defeats in the final installment of his original series.<ref>''House of Mystery'' #160 (July 1966) to #173 (May–June 1968).</ref>

As Superman and Batman were allowed by DC to become fully active members of the Justice League, J'onzz's appearances there dwindled. He last participated in a mission in his original tenure in #61 (March 1968), shortly before his solo series was discontinued (''HoM'' #173, May–June 1968). In #71, his people finally came to Earth for him, and he left with them to found and become leader of [[New Mars]]. However, over the next fifteen years J'onn appeared sporadically in various DC titles. In 1972, Superman was teleported to New Mars.<ref>''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #212, June 1972.</ref> J'onzz briefly returned to Earth by spaceship in 1975.<ref>''JLA'' #115, January–February 1975.</ref> J'onn made another trip to Earth shortly thereafter,<ref>''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #s 449, January–February through 451, March–April 1977.</ref> leading to Superman and Batman fighting alongside him on New Mars.<ref>''World's Finest'' #245, June–July 1977.</ref> Three years later, he was discovered playing cosmic-level chess with [[Despero]], using JLAers as the pieces.<ref>''JLA'' #s 177, April & 178 May 1980.</ref> The Martian again encountered Superman in outer space.<ref>''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #27, November 1980.</ref> He permanently resurfaced in the DC Universe in 1984.<ref>''JLA'' #228, July 1984.</ref> Shortly thereafter, the League had several members resign (among many other changes), leaving an opening for the Manhunter to take.<ref>''JLA'' #233, December 1984.</ref> In staying on Earth, he decided to revive his John Jones identity, this time as a private detective, but had to explain "his" twenty-year disappearance.<ref>''JLA'' #248, March 1986.</ref> This contradicts J'onzz's final story in the back of ''Detective Comics'', wherein everyone was led to believe that Jones was killed.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #326, April 1964.</ref>

[[Image:MartianManhunter.jpg|185px|thumb|left|J'onn J'onzz, trying (and failing) to relax in his true form and reflecting on his history with the League]]

In early 1987 DC revamped its struggling ''[[Justice League of America]]'' series by relaunching the title as ''[[Justice League International]]''. This new series, written by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J.M. DeMatteis]] with art by [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] (and later [[Adam Hughes]]), added quirky humor to the team's stories. J'onn is present from the first issue and within the stories is used as a [[wikt:straight man|straight man]] for other characters in comical situations. The series also added a number of elements to his back story that have remained to the present (such as J'onn's obsession with [[Oreo]] cookies, partially due to [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s influence).

The 1988 four issue miniseries ''Martian Manhunter'' by J.M. DeMatteis and [[Mark Badger]] further redefined the character and changed a number of important aspects of both his character and his origin story. It is revealed that Dr. Erdel did not die and that the character's humanoid appearance was due to physiological trauma and attempts to block out the death of his race, his familiar appearance a "compromise" between his true form and a human appearance based upon Erdel's mental concept of what a Martian should look like. Later series [[retcon]] that his real form is private and that, even on Mars, his "public" appearance was the familiar version. The native name for Mars is said to be "Ma'aleca'andra" in his native tongue (a nod to "Malacandra", the name used by the inhabitants of Mars in [[C. S. Lewis]]' novel ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]''). The series also adds to [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], the idea that J'onzz was not only displaced in space but in time and the Martian race, including J'onzz' wife and daughter, has been dead for thousands of years.

The 1990s saw the character continue to serve in many different versions of the Justice League of America. In addition to serving in the League under his own identity, he also joins (under duress) disguised  as "[[Bloodwynd]]"{{Issue|date=April 2009}}.

The 1992 miniseries ''American Secrets'' explored the adventures of the characters against the backdrop of a changing America during the 1950s. Written by [[Gerard Jones]] and with art by [[Eduardo Barreto]], the series finds the Manhunter drawn into a murder mystery that rapidly escalates into paranoia and alien invasion.

''Martian Manhunter'' began as an ongoing series in 1998, written by [[John Ostrander]] and illustrated by [[Tom Mandrake]] (with fill-in art provided by [[Bryan Hitch]] among others). The series lasted 36 issues before being canceled due to low sales. Ostrander established that Martian Manhunter is the most recognized hero in the Southern Hemisphere, and that he maintains a number of different secret identities, many of them outside the United States. However, following two incidents later in the series in which John Jones separates from Martian Manhunter{{Issue|date=April 2009}}, he decides to focus on his original human identity and retire the others.

The series establishes that J'onn has a disturbed brother, Ma'alefa'ak, who uses his shapeshifting abilities to pose as J'onn, capturing and torturing [[Jemm|Jemm, Son of Saturn]], and [[terraforming]] part of Earth to resemble Mars (areoforming). This is all part of a grand plan designed to convince the rest of the Justice League that J'onn has turned into a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]. However, J'onn is able to clear his name and defeat Ma'alefa'ak despite having most of his body destroyed in an exploding spaceship (he is later{{Issue|date=April 2009}} able to regenerate his body from his severed hand).

The series also further established the history of both the Manhunter and the Saturnian race. The first issue revealed that there was a "real" human John Jones, a police detective who is murdered by corrupt colleagues, and that J'onn subsequently assumed his identity to complete an important court case.

In issues of ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]],<ref>"Trial By Fire," ''JLA'' #84 (Early October 2003) - #89 (Late December 2003)</ref> J'onn attempts to conquer his fear of fire and makes a deal with a flame-wielding villainess named [[Scorch (comics)|Scorch]], who wants J'onzz' telepathic help in dealing with her own mental issues. The story served to redefine his traditional aversion to fire - he is now invulnerable to flames unless they are "flames of passion" or of some other "psychic significance." This change is forgotten about in later series and adventures {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

[[Image:MartianManhunterCv2.png|185px|left|thumb|Cover artwork for ''Martian Manhunter'' vol. 3, #2 (Nov, 2006)<br>by Al Barrionuevo]]

During the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, the character is feared killed in an attack on the Justice League's HQ{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. He is later{{Issue|date=April 2009}} revealed to be alive and a captive of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] After ''Infinite Crisis'', most of DC's series [[One Year Later|jumped ahead one year]], having the weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' fill in the missing time. In ''52'' #24, it is revealed that the character had been working behind the scenes in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] for its role in the death of [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]].

Using the events of ''[[World War III (comics)|World War III]]'' as a catalyst, DC Comics redesigned the appearance of the character, changing his costume and giving an appearance that more closely resembles that of his Martian form. Those changes were further explored during a ''Martian Manhunter'' [[limited series]] that spun out of the ''[[DCU: Brave New World]]'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]. Written by A.J. Lieberman with art from Al Barrionuevo and Bit, the series portrayed a Manhunter more mistrustful of humanity and their actions towards each other. The miniseries focuses on J'onn's search for other survivors of Mars.

Following this miniseries, J'onn was intended to be in [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. He appeared in the third issue of the ''Outsiders: Five Of A Kind'' series with [[Thunder (comics)|Thunder]], and joined the team afterwards. Due to the change of writers, he is quickly written out within the last two issues{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. He is next seen working undercover during the events of the limited series ''[[Salvation Run]]''.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #3 (March 2008).</ref> At the end of the series, J'onn is left captured and alone on an alien planet.

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1 (2008), written by [[Grant Morrison]] the character is killed, with the death being further developed in  the one-shot, ''Final Crisis: Requiem''. The character next appears in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]])<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref><ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #44 (July 2009)</ref> At the end of the miniseries, the character is resurrected.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref> Following this, the character is featured in the weekly ''[[Brightest Day]]'' series. During the series, J'onn encounters another surviving green Martian: D'kay D'razz, a scarred and warped psychopath who wants J'onn to be her mate.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Martian Manhunter possesses a wide variety of superhuman powers and abilities, which have been shown inconsistently throughout the years.

In the current DC continuity, many of his powers are similar to those of [[Superman]], including super strength close to that of Superman (though as shown in the Death of Superman crossovers, he was no match for Doomsday), flight, invulnerability, super-breath, and "Martian vision" (a term designating both the ability to see through solid objects and the ability to project beams of energy from his eyes).  Superman once said of the Manhunter, "He is the most powerful being on the face of the earth".<ref>''JLA'' #86 (Early November 2003).</ref>

During the 1990s, it was stated that the source of his flight and "Martian vision" is a limited form of telekinesis{{Issue|date=October 2009}} (he had occasionally{{Issue|date=October 2009}} demonstrated more traditional uses of telekinesis to levitate and animate objects during his ''[[Detective Comics]]'' and ''[[House of Mystery]]'' appearances). His "Martian Vision" energy beams have sometimes been shown to knock foes backwards, which could (theoretically) be due to their telekinetic nature{{Issue|date=October 2009}}.  On most occasions, however, these energy beams are depicted as heating objects rather than delivering a concussive impact.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Martian Manhunter possesses the power of [[shapeshifting]], which he employs for various effects (adopting human or monstrous appearance, elongating his limbs, growing to immense size, altering the chemical composition of his body, etc.).

J'onn can become intangible, passing harmlessly through solid objects.  He can also render himself invisible.

He is a powerful telepath, capable of both perceiving the thoughts of others and of projecting his own thoughts.  He often acts as a "switchboard" between minds in order to coordinate the Justice League's actions. The extent of his telepathic abilities is great; several times he has connected his mind to the entire population of Earth{{Issue|date=October 2009}}.

In the Alex Ross series [[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]], J'onn's "telepathy" is described in terms provocatively similar to the concept of [[grok | grokking]] from Robert Heinlein's [[Stranger in a Strange Land]]. In an internal monologue, the Manhunter says: "Since the first moment I chose this form and set foot on this world, I experienced it in ways no other human could. The humans call it telepathy. But that is only what it is like. There is no human word for how we martians coexist with others.. We don't read minds. We share in other beings' thoughts." 

J'onn is also capable of absorbing energy projectiles such as beams and other energy waves.

He has demonstrated regenerative abilities, once able to regenerate his entire body from only his severed head but with great strain<ref>''Justice League vs Predator'' <!-- Was this actually published? --></ref>{{Issue|date=October 2009}} (due to the loss of mass, he found it necessary to incorporate new matter from the Martian sand). Early appearances of the character show him as able to breathe underwater; the last time he displayed this power was when he encountered [[Zauriel]] in the sea of [[San Francisco]] in ''JLA'' #6. The Manhunter has sometimes been said to possess nine senses, but these additional senses are poorly-defined and generally ignored by most writers{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Aside from his superhuman powers, the Manhunter is also a skilled and very capable detective. As Batman mentions in his file, "in many ways, Martian Manhunter is like an amalgam of Superman and the Dark Knight himself."<ref>''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' #1 (October 2005) - 12 (August 2007)-from Bruce Wayne's private files in the Batcomputer.</ref>{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}<!-- Would Batman's own files read "...the Dark Knight himself"? And surely this is not in all TWELVE issues? -->

J'onn J'onzz have also demostrated de ability of generate and manipulate heat or energy beams, waves and blasts.

===Weakness===
One of the Martian Manhunter's signature traits is his vulnerability to flame. Although it has been an element of the character since his earliest appearances, writers have depicted it with great inconsistency throughout the character's long career. In some instances, it is portrayed as a physical susceptibility inherent to the Martian race, while at other times it has been explained as a personal psychosomatic disorder{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The degree of vulnerability has also been wildly inconsistent, in some cases capable of stripping away his powers and killing him, while at other times simply inflicting pain or delirium with no actual danger of physical harm{{Issue|date=January 2010}}. This weakness has been diminished or cured on more than one occasion, only to have it return with a vengeance in a later story{{Issue|date=January 2010}}. Thus, it is difficult to define.

In his earliest appearances, the character was shown as having a weakness to fire while in his native Martian form.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #233 (July 1956).</ref> Over time, this was developed into the character having [[wikt:pyrophobia|pyrophobia]], with fire being the Martian's "[[wikt:Achilles heel|Achilles heel]]", equivalent to Superman's weakness to [[kryptonite]]. Exposure to fire typically causes J'onn to lose his ability to maintain his physical form, 'melting' into a pool of writhing green plasma. One portrayal explained that the flame weakness was tied into Martian telepathy, with fire causing so much chaos in Martian minds that they collapse{{Issue|date=October 2009}}. Most recently it was revealed, during the ''Trial By Fire'' storyline,<ref>''JLA'' #84 (Early October 2003) - 89 (Late December 2003).</ref> that this fear was instilled on a genetic level by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] 20,000 years ago to weaken what was then a very aggressive species on the verge of interstellar conquest - this act split the race into the Green Martians and [[White Martian#DC Comics|White Martian]]s, though no mention is made of the pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] third race known as the [[List of alien races in DC Comics#Y |Yellow Martians]].<ref>First seen in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' vol. 1 #104 (February 1959).</ref> At the end of the arc, this weakness was partially removed, with J'onn explaining that only fires of "psychic significance" were of harm to him, such as flames of suffering or passion (this was seemingly a roundabout way of limiting his weakness to flames of a mystical or pyrokinetic nature{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}).

===Other portrayals===
In the various appearances of the character in other media (see below), the specific details of J'onn J'onzz' demonstrated powers and weakness to fire have varied greatly.

D'kay goes insane as a result of the complete isolation until she was beamed to earth by Dr. Erdel. Once on Earth, the assault of thoughts thrusts her into greater extent depths of insanity, and she attacks Dr. Erdel and his daughter, leaving her permanently scarred as D'kay escaped. In desperation, D'kay stole the identity of a human and completely erased all memory of her previous identity. J'onn's death in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' message put cracks in these telepathic memory blocks, but she did not regain her memories until J'onn's resurrected in ''[[Blackest Night]]''.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #12 (October 2010)</ref> D'kay is desperate to recreate the Martian race with J'onn to the point where she even attempted to kill [[Miss Martian]] because she perceived a threat to her claim to J'onn.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #8 (August 2010)</ref> D'Kay's body is distorted and includes an extra mouth at her torso which manifests from her broken mind.

{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Within the publications of [[DC Comics]], many alternate versions of the characters have appeared. Some of those have appeared in stories that set within the shared fictional DC Universe and others in self-contained stories.
*Those alternative versions have appeared in a range of genres and time periods and many appear in ''[[Elseworlds]]'' stories featuring a Justice League, including ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', ''[[JLA: Act of God]]'', ''[[Justice Riders]]'', the fantasy-themed ''League of Justice'', the World War II-set ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files]]'', and John Ostrander's dark ''[[JLA: Destiny]]'' which features a world without [[Superman]] or [[Batman]]. Other notable stories provide a more pessimistic future for the character.

===Parodies and analogues===
There have been few parodies of Martian Manhunter made in recent times, due to the concentration on more well-known heroes like Superman and Batman.

*Martian Anteater - a member of [[Just'a Lotta Animals]]
*Jack From Jupiter - a member of The Seven in the [[Garth Ennis]] series, [[The Boys (comics)|The Boys]].
*[[Mr. Martian]], CH'kk Kk'xx (Chuck Cox) - a [[Big Bang Comics]] hero
*Martian Man in the [[Guardians of the Globe]] from ''[[Invincible (comics)|Invincible]]''
*[[List of characters in Top 10#M'rrgla Qualtz, the Libra Killer|Vigilante from Venus]] - a female character in ''[[Top 10 (comic book)|Top Ten]]''

*The [[Freedom City]] sourcebook for the role-playing game ''[[Mutants & Masterminds]]'' includes pastiches of many popular superheroes, including Pseudo, a shapeshifting alien telepath who is a member of the [[Freedom League (Freedom City)|Freedom League]], which is an analogue for the Justice League
* Stalker from the [[Stormwatch (comic)|"secret" Stormwatch team]].
* [[Shapesmith]] from the [[Invincible (comics)|Invincible]] series is also a Martian superhero with shapeshifting powers. He was inspired by Martian Man, an earlier hero in that universe who appeared to be a more direct analogue of J'onn as part of the original Guardians of the Globe.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Phil Morris as John Jones.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] as '''John Jones''' in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.]]

===Justice League of America (TV movie)===
J'onn J'onzz, is played by [[David Ogden Stiers]], in the 1997 ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]'' [[live-action]] [[television pilot]]. He has difficulty shapeshifting, and no mention is made of any other powers.

===Justice League (animated series)===
J'onn J'onzz appears in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]], voiced by [[Carl Lumbly]]. In this series, J'onzz' history is even more closely tied with that of the League. In the series, the Justice League originates as a temporary uniting of Earth's heroes against an [[alien invasion]]; the invaders had previously invaded Mars, wiping out all the inhabitants except J'onn J'onzz, who travels to Earth to warn of the invaders and join the fight against them.

For the animated series, executive producer Bruce Timm revised and reduced J'onn's powers somewhat; his superstrength was downplayed (though he was still seen performing great feats of strength on occasion), his superspeed, invisibility and Martian vision are not present, and emphasis was placed on his telepathy, shapeshifting and density alteration, specifically his ability to become intangible. J'onzz only increased his density sporadically on the series, usually noticeable by a glowing blue aura surrounding his body{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

In season two episode Comfort and Joy, J'onn lands on a childs roof and reaches down the chimney for cookies, which are drawn like [[Oreos]]. In the comics, J'onn has always displayed a liking for the cookie called Chocos, which are essentially Oreos{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

Like the other member in the first two seasons he is used on a semi regular basis. In Tabula Rasa, he becomes disappointed in humanity after hearing their thoughts, showing how selfish some humans are. His faith is somewhat restored when he mentally spies on a group of people seeking a lost little girl. Spying on one guy who thought "I'm freezing my butt off for the girl and I don't even know her. But I know how I would feel if she were mine." It's J'onn who turns the tide in the battle with [[A.M.A.Z.O]] allowing him to simulate his powers. When [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] tells A.M.A.Z.O he has all their powers, J'onn tells him to use them well, leading to A.M.A.Z.O. telepathically discovering Luthor's true intentions and turning on him.

In the third, fourth and part of the fifth season he is in the Watchtower manning it. He takes the place of [[Kalibak]] when [[Wally West|Flash]] goes with [[Mister Miracle]] and [[Big Barda]] to save [[Oberon]]. In task force X he fights off [[Rick Flagg|Flag]], [[Bette Sans Souci|Plastique]], [[Captain Boomerang]] and [[Deadshot]] single handedley. He leaves the tower at the end of season 4 to battle Luthor with the rest of the original seven. He leaves the tower again to help Wonder Woman against [[Killer Frost]], [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]] and [[Giganta]]. At the end of that same episode he leaves the League, claiming he was too detached from humanity to serve them, and makes [[Mister Terrific]] the new man in charge of dispatching the League. He returns in the series finale taking the form of an elderly Asian man and seemed to have found love. He reunites with the League and helps to fend off the invasion.
