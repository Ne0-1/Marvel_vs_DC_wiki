'''Martian Manhunter''' is the [[superhero]] alias of '''J'onn J'onzz''', alternately known as '''John Jones''' or the '''Manhunter from Mars''', a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in the back-up story "''The Strange Experiment of Dr. Erdel''" in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #225 (November 1955), written by [[Jack Miller (writer)|Jack Miller]] and illustrated by Joe Certa.

J'onzz is a native of the planet [[Mars]], also known as Ma'aleca'andra in his native tongue. (This is a nod to "Malacandra", the name used by the inhabitants of Mars in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s novel ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]''. This is a much later addition and not part of the original version of the character). His usual public appearance is as a tall, hairless, green-skinned [[humanoid]] with a pronounced brow. 

==Fictional character biography==
In his debut story, J'onn J'onzz is accidentally [[Teleportation|teleported]] to Earth by scientist Dr. Mark Erdel, who immediately has a [[heart attack]] and dies, leaving the Martian stranded. He is able to use his powers to disguise his appearance, adopting the identity of police detective John Jones. 

He joins the police force, secretly using his powers to help the inhabitants of Earth. Later revisions of this story have him replacing a deceased police detective and locate these stories to the fictional city of Middleton, [[Colorado]].

Later comics [[retcon]]ned several new details into the origin story, such as the revelation that Mars was dead when J'onn was taken, killed by a mental plague deliberately started by his brother [[Ma'alefa'ak]], and that, prior to becoming a superhero in his familiar form, he took the identity of the [[Bronze Wraith]] and fought crime with the [[Justice Experience]], a group that was created to fill the gap between the eras of the [[JSA (comics)|Justice Society of America]] and the [[Justice League of America]].
In the DC/Vertigo comic The Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes, it is revealed that Martians worshipped Dream, appearing to them as a large flaming skull deity called Lord L'Zoril who had power over dreams.

== Publication history ==

The character makes his first appearance in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #225, cover dated November [[1955]]. This origin story sets up a number of important character points, many of which have carried onto the modern age with little or no change. In this first story, the character is pulled to earth by a experimental [[teleportation]] beam constructed by Dr. Erdel, the shock of the encounter kills Dr. Erdel and leaves J'onn with no method of returning home. The character decided to fight crime while waiting for Martian technology to advance to a stage that will enable his rescue. To that end, he adopts the identity of John Jones, a [[Chicago]] detective. 

During this period, the character and his back story differ in some minor and some significant ways from modern treatments. Firstly, as with his counterpart, the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver age]] [[Superman]], his power range is poorly defined, and his powers expand over time as the plot demands. The addition of precognitive abilities (''Detective Comics'' #226) are quickly followed by telepathy and flight <ref>''Detective Comics'' #227</ref><ref>''Detective Comics'' #228</ref>, "Atomic vision", super-hearing <ref>''Detective Comics'' #231</ref> and many other powers. in addition, his customary weakness to fire is only manifested when he is in his native Martian form. 

A more significant difference, is that at this time, there is no suggestion that Mars is a dead planet or that the character is the last of his kind. Many of the tales of the time feature either Martian technology or the appearance of other Martian characters, ''Detective Comics'' #236 (October 1956), for example, features the character making contact with the planet Mars and his parents. 

J'onn eventually reveals his existence to the world, after which he operates openly as a superhero and becomes a charter member of the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Detective Comics'' #273 (November 1959)</ref> He abandons the detective John Jones identity when Jones is ostensibly killed in action.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #326 (April 1964)</ref> J'onn spent the next several years involved in mystical adventures involving the Idol Head of Diabolu.<ref>''House of Mystery'' #143 (June 1964)</ref>  He later takes the persona of Marco Xavier in order to infiltrate the international crime cartel known as [[VULTURE]].<ref>''House of Mystery'' #160 (July 1966) to ''House of Mystery'' #173 (May–June 1968)</ref> 

His appearances with the League kept him in the public eye long after his own series were canceled. He is a founding member of the team, and served as a member during many of its various incarnations. From the late 1960s until the late 1970s, J'onn was absent from the JLA, having left Earth to find and become leader of New Mars. This time period is later [[retcon]]ned during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', and his period of absence is never again referenced. 

[[Image:MartianManhunter.jpg|185px|thumb|left|J'onn J'onzz, trying (and failing) to relax in his true form and reflecting on his history with the League]]

In early 1987 DC decided to revamp its struggling ''[[Justice League of America]]'' series by relaunching the title as ''[[Justice League International]]''. This new series, written by Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis with art by [[Kevin Maguire]] (and later [[Adam Hughes]]), added quirky humor to the team's stories. J'onn is present from the first issue and within the stories is used as a [[straight man]] for other characters in comical situations. The series also added a number of elements to his back story that have remained to the present (such as J'onn's obsession with [[Oreo]] cookies, partially due to [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s influence).

The 1988 four issue mini-series ''Martian Manhunter'' by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Mark Badger]]  further redefined the character and changed a number of important aspects of both his character and his origin story. It is revealed that Dr. Edskel did not die and that the character's  humanoid appearance was due to physiological trauma and attempts to block out the death of his race, his familiar appearance  a "compromise" between his true form and a human appearance based upon Edskel's concept of what a Martian should look like. Moreover, the series notes that his real form is private and that, even on Mars, his "public" appearance was the familiar version. The series also adds to canon, the idea that J'onzz was not only displaced in space but in time and the Martian race, including J'onzz' wife and daughter, has been dead for thousands of years. 

The 1990s sees the character continue to serve in many different versions of the Justice League of America. In addition to serving in the League under his own identity, he also joins (under duress) as "[[Bloodwynd]]". 

The 1992  mini-series ''American Secrets'' explored the adventures of the characters against the backdrop of a changing America during the 1950s. Written by [[Gerard Jones]] and with art by [[Eduardo Barreto]], the series finds the Manhunter drawn into a murder mystery that rapidly escalates into paranoia and alien invasion. 

''Martian Manhunter'' began as an ongoing series in 1998, written by [[John Ostrander]] and illustrated by [[Tom Mandrake]] (with fill-in art provided by [[Bryan Hitch]] among others). The series lasted 36 issues before being canceled due to low sales. Ostrander established that Martian Manhunter is the most recognized hero in the Southern Hemisphere, and that he maintains a number of different secret identities, many of them outside the United States. However, following two incidents later in the series in which John Jones separates from Martian Manhunter, he decides to focus on his original human identity and retire the others. 

The series establishes that J'onn has a disturbed brother, Ma'alefa'ak, who uses his shapeshifting abilities to pose as J'onn, capturing and torturing [[Jemm|Jemm, Son of Saturn]], and [[terraforming]] part of Earth to resemble Mars. This is all part of a grand plan designed to convince the rest of the Justice League that J'onn has turned into a [[sociopath]]. However, J'onn is able to clear his name and defeat Ma'alefa'ak despite having most of his body destroyed in an exploding spaceship. (He is later able to regenerate his body from his severed hand.)

The series also further established the history of both the Manhunter and the Saturnian race. The first issue revealed that there was a "real" human John Jones, a police detective who is murdered by corrupt colleagues, and that J'onn subsequently assumed his identity to complete an important court case.

In issues of ''JLA'' written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], J'onn attempts to conquer his fear of fire and makes a deal with a flame-wielding villainess named [[Scorch (comics)|Scorch]], who wants J'onzz' telepathic help in dealing with her own mental issues.  The story served to redefine his traditional adverse to fire - he is now invulnerable to flames unless they are "flames of passion" or of some other "psychic significance." This change is forgotten about in later series and adventures {{Fact|date=July 2008}}.

[[Image:MartianManhunterCv2.png|185px|left|thumb|Cover artwork for ''Martian Manhunter'' vol. 3, #2 (Nov, 2006)<br>by Al Barrionuevo]] 

During the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series, the character is feared killed in an attack on the Justice League's HQ. He is later revealed to be alive and a captive of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]. After ''Infinite Crisis'', most of DC's series [[One Year Later|jumped ahead one year]], having the weekly series ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' fill in the missing time. In ''52'' #24, it is revealed that the character had been working behind the scenes in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] for its role in the death of [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]].

Using the events of ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]'' as a catalyst, DC Comics redesigned the appearance of the character, changing his costume and giving an appearance that more closely resembles that of his Martian form. Those changes were further explored during a ''Martian Manhunter'' [[limited series]] that spun out of the ''[[DCU: Brave New World]]'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]. Written by A.J. Lieberman with art from Al Barrionuevo and Bit, the series portrayed a Manhunter more mistrustful of humanity and their actions towards each other. The mini-series focuses on J'onn's search for other survivors of Mars. 

Following this mini-series, J'onn was intended to be in [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He appeared in the third issue of the ''Outsiders: Five Of A Kind'' series with [[Thunder (comics)|Thunder]], and joined the team afterwards. Due to the change of writers, he is quickly written out within the first two issues. He is next seen working undercover during the events of the limited series ''[[Salvation Run]]''. At the end of the series, J'onn is left captured and alone on an alien planet. [[Image:Death of Manhunter.jpg|225px|right|thumb|The Martian Manhunter's murder at the hands of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]. Art from ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1 by [[J.G. Jones]].]] 

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1, [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] summons a [[boom tube]] for him at the behest of the [[Human Flame]], who then kills him in front of an onlooking  [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He is buried on [[Mars]], where many of his colleagues attend the graveside burial service. The events of those two issues are explored in the one-shot, ''Final Crisis: Requiem''.

==Powers and abilities==
Martian Manhunter possesses a wide variety of superhuman powers, many of which are virtually identical to those of [[Superman]], including superhuman strength, speed, durability, flight and "Martian vision" (a term designating both the ability to see through solid objects and the ability to generate optic heat beams). During the 90s, it was stated that J'onn also possesses a form of telekinesis, which is the source of his flight and destructive "Martian vision" beams. Early appearances of the character showed him as able to breathe underwater. The last time he displayed this power was when he encountered [[Zauriel]] in the sea of San Francisco in ''JLA'' #6. 

The Martian Manhunter also possesses the power of [[shapeshifting]], which he employs for various effects (e.g., adopting human or monstrous appearance, elongating his limbs, growing to immense size).  He can also render himself invisible, and is able to become intangible so as to pass harmlessly through solid objects. He can also change the genetic makeup of his body becoming made up of materials like steel or stone. 

In addition to these abilities, J'onn is a powerful telepath, capable of both perceiving the thoughts of others and of projecting his own thoughts.  He often acts as a "switchboard" between minds in order to coordinate the Justice League's actions. The extent of his telepathic abilites are exceptional; several times he has connected to the entire planet Earth.  He has also demonstrated regenerative abilities, once able to regenerate himself from only his severed hand but with great strain (due to the loss of mass he found it necessary to incorporate new matter from Martian sand). The Manhunter has sometimes been said to possess nine different senses, although these additional senses are poorly defined and generally ignored by most writers.

Aside from his superhuman abilities, he is also a cunning and logical detective. As Batman mentions in his file, that "''in many ways, Martian Manhunter is like an amalgam of Superman'' ''and the Dark Knight himself.''"<ref>[[Justice (comic book)|Justice]]'' #1-12-from Bruce Wayne's private files in the Batcomputer </ref>  

===Weakness===
One of the Martian Manhunter's signature traits is his vulnerability to flame. Although it has been an element of the character since his earliest appearances, writers have depicted it with great inconsistency throughout the character's long career. In some instances, it's portrayed as a physical susceptibility inherent to the Martian race, while at other times it has been explained as a personal psychosomatic disorder. The degree of vulnerability has also been wildly inconsistent, in some cases capable of stripping away his powers and killing him, while at other times simply inflicting pain or delirium with no actual danger of physical harm. This weakness has been diminished or cured on more than one occasion, only to have it return with a vengeance in a later story. Thus, it is difficult to describe in a definitive manner.
 
In his earliest appearances, the character was shown as having a weakness to fire while in his native Martian form.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #233</ref> Over time, this was developed into the character having [[wiktionary:pyrophobia|pyrophobia]], with fire being the Martian's "[[wiktionary:Achilles heel|Achilles heel]]", equivalent to Superman's weakness to [[kryptonite]]. Exposure to fire typically causes J'onn to lose his ability to maintain his physical form, 'melting' into a pool of writhing green plasma. One portrayal explained that the flame weakness was tied into Martian telepathy, with fire causing so much chaos in Martian minds that they collapse. Most recently it was revealed, during the ''Trial By Fire'' storyline,<ref>''Justice League of America'' #84–89</ref> that this fear was instilled on a genetic level by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] 20,000 years ago, when they split the original "Burning" Martians into the [[Green Martians]] and [[White Martian#DC Comics|White Martian]]s. At the end of the arc, this weakness was partially removed, with J'onn explaining that only fires of psychic significance were of harm to him, such as flames of suffering or passion (this was seemingly a roundabout way of limiting his weakness to flames of a mystical or pyrokinetic nature). Following ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''One Year Later'', it has been shown that J'onn's weakness to fire has changed once again. Martians are no longer afraid of fire, but they lose their powers in its presence, physical fire and intense heat can injure and kill a Martian.

==Other versions==

Within the publications of [[DC Comics]], many Alternate versions of the characters have appeared. Some of those have appeared in stories that set within the shared fictional DC Universe and others in self-contained stories. Those alternative versions have appeared in a range of genres and time periods and many appear in ''[[Elseworlds]]'' stories featuring a Justice League, including ''[[JLA: The Nail]]''; ''[[JLA: Act of God]]''; the fantasy-themed ''League of Justice'', the World War II-set ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files]]'' and John Ostrander's dark ''[[JLA: Destiny]]'' which features a world without [[Superman]] or [[Batman]]. Other notable stories provide a more pessimist future for the character. ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', features a J'onn mentally shattered from his attempts to understand humanity, while Frank Miller's dystopian ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' has a powerless alcoholic J'onn (murdered by [[Dick Grayson|Joker/Dick Grayson]]). 

Within the shared DC Universe, J'onn appears in the 30th century as an acquaintance of [[Dream Girl]] and assists the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] against [[Mordru]].<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' v4 #43 (May 1993) to ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' v4 #50 (Late November 1993)</ref> In the Grant Morrison penned series, ''[[DC One Million]]'', a version of the character is shown merging with [[Mars]] and turning it into a home for humanity and other races. 

In ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #52, a new 52-Earth Multiverse is revealed. On Earth-3, the many-membered [[Crime Syndicate|Crime Society of America]] exists, with a monstrous version of J'onn J'onnz showcased in ''52'' #52 (but not in subsequent ''Countdown'' appearances of the Society). ''Countdown to Adventure'' #1 depicts the [[Forerunner (comics)|Forerunner]] planet, in an alternate universe (Earth-48) where the races of the planets and dwarf planets in the universe conquer Earth; the leader of the Martian army and populace is General J'onzz.

==In other media==

===Justice League of America (TV movie)===
[[Image:Martian Manhunter JLA Live Action.JPG|thumb|right|185px|Martian Manhunter as he appears in the [[Justice League of America (1997 film)|''Justice League'' 1997 pilot]].]]

J'onn J'onzz, is played by [[David Ogden Stiers]], in the 1997 ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]'' [[live-action]] [[television pilot]]. He has difficulty shapeshifting, and no mention is made of any other powers.

===Justice League (animated series)===
J'onn J'onzz appears in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]], voiced by [[Carl Lumbly]]. In this series, J'onzz' history is even more closely tied with that of the League. In the series, the Justice League originates as a temporary uniting of Earth's heroes against an [[alien invasion]]; the invaders had previously invaded Mars, wiping out all the inhabitants except J'onn J'onzz, who travels to Earth to warn of the invaders and join the fight against them. 

[[Image:Mmsheet.jpg‎|185px|thumb|left|J'onn J'onzz as he appears in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.]] 

For the animated series, executive producer Bruce Timm revised and reduced J'onn's powers somewhat; his superstrength was downplayed (though he was still seen performing great feats of strength on occasion), his superspeed, invisibility and Martian vision are not present, and emphasis was placed on his telepathy, shapeshifting and density alteration, specifically his ability to become intangible. J'onzz only increased his density sporadically on the series, usually noticeable by a glowing blue aura surrounding his body.

In season two episode Comfort and Joy, J'onn lands on a childs roof and reaches down the chimney for cookies, which are drawn like oreos. In the comics, J'onn has always displayed a liking for the cookie called Chocos, which are essentially Oreos.

Like the other member in the first two seasons he is used on a semi regular basis.  In Tabula Rasa, he becomes dissapointed in humanity after hearing their thoughts, showing how selfish some humans are.  His faith is somewhat restored when he mentally spies on a group of people seeking a lost little girl.  Spying on one guy who thought "I'm freezing my butt off for the girl and I don't even know her.  But I know how I would feel if she were mine."  It's J'onn who turns the tide in the battle with [[A.M.A.Z.O]] allowing him to simulate his powers.  When [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] tells A.M.A.Z.O he has all their powers, J'onn tells him to use them well.

In the third, fourth and part of the fifth season he is in the Watchtower manning it.  He takes the place of [[Kalibak]] when [[Wally West|Flash]] goes with [[Mister Miracle]] and [[Big Barda]] to save [[Oberon]].  In task force X he fights off [[Rick Flagg|Flag]], [[Bette Sans Souci|Plastique]], [[Captain Boomerang]] and [[Deadshot]] single handedley.  He leaves the tower at the end of season 4 to battle Luthor with the rest of the original seven.  He leaves the tower again to help Wonder Woman against [[Killer Frost]], [[Black Manta|Devil Ray]] and [[Giganta]].  At the end of that same episode he leaves the League, claiming he was too detached from humanity to serve them, and makes [[Mister Terrific]] the new man in charge of dispatching the League.  He returns in the series finale taking the form of an elderly Asian man and seemed to have found love.  He reunites with the League and helps to fend off the invasion.

===Smallville===
[[Image:Phil Morris as John Jones.jpg|thumb|170px|Phil Morris as John Jones from ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'']]
The character is introduced to the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' in the episode "''[[Smallville (Season 6)#Static|Static]]''". [[Phil Morris]] portrays John Jones in the Season 6 episode "''[[Smallville (Season 6)#Labyrinth|Labyrinth]]''".<ref>[http://www.cwtv.com/shows/smallville/episodes/612 Shows - ''Smallville'' - Episode Guide - ''Labyrinth''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Though his name is never given (he gives Clark the name John Jones in the deleted scenes on the season 6 DVD disc 4 episode 12 and reveals his home as Mars, adding that he was charged with watching over young Kal-El), he relates to Clark that he is "from Mars." In the setting of a mental institution, which is only Clark's fantasy, it is not immediately clear whether he is just a delusional patient or really communicating with Clark through his dream. Characters have frequently referred to him as ''The Martian Manhunter''. This version of the Martian Manhunter has some preternatural talents, including flight, telepathy, superhuman strength and healing. In Clark's asylum vision he wears a loose blue robe about his shoulders that recalls the Manhunter's [[cape]]. In the animated spin-off series ''Justice & Doom'' (available online and on Season Six DVDs), John is shown to shapeshift into his Martian form aboard an [[Satellite|artificial satellite]]. John's true form is seen on the show several episodes prior, not played by Morris and cloaked in shadow, with only the shape of him suggested and the telltale glowing red eyes. It this iteration, John is apparently working for Jor-El to protect Clark. In "Labyrinth", his weakness to fire is mentioned. In Season 8, "Odyssey" he saved Clark from imminent death by flying towards the sun. However, this caused him to lose all of his abilities. In the episode "Prey", he has explicitly adopted the name "John Jones", and has joined the Metropolis police force as a detective. He also lends a hand in the episode "Bloodline" where he allows Kara to use his crystal to defeat the phantom Faora, although he does not make an on-screen appearance.

===The Batman===
[[Image:The Joining.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Martian Manhunter as he appears in ''The Batman''.]]
Martian Manhunter appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]. In addition to the character's standard powers, he also displays [[telekinetic]] abilities. He uses the guise of Detective John Jones to warn Batman about "The Joining", a coming alien threat to [[Gotham City|Gotham]]. Despite not being in continuity, his appearance is very much like his appearance on the ''Justice League'' series (the only real difference being that he wears shorts).

===Justice League: The New Frontier===
[[Image:Pict 2008-04-08 09-23-309.jpg|thumb|170px|Martian Manhunter as he appears in ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''.]]
J'onn J'onzz appears in ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]],'' playing a pivotal role against Earth's ancient evil The Centre.  In the film, J'onn's origin is once again retold, with more focus on his roles as a detective and a refugee than a superhero and finding faith within humanity. He also seems to have an infatuation with [[Soft drink|soda pop]]. He is voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]]. In his "superhero form", he has human-like instead of all-red eyes, hearkening back to his appearance in early comic stories.

===The Original===
In ''Action Comics'' #16 (September 1939), the Zatara story is called ''Terror from Saturn''. A teleportation beam plucks Zatara from Earth to Saturn where he meets Porra who is the spitting image of the Martian Manhunter.

===Videogames===
*The Martian Manhunter is prominently featured in the videogame ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Daniel Riordan (actor)|Daniel Riordan]].

*The ''Justice League'' animated version of Martian Manhunter appeared in both the [[Game Boy Advance]] games ''[[Justice League: Injustice for All]]'' and ''[[Justice League: Chronicles]]''.

*Martian Manhunter is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

===Parodies and analogues===
There have been few parodies of Martian Manhunter made in recent times, due to the concentration on more well-known heroes like Superman and Batman.
