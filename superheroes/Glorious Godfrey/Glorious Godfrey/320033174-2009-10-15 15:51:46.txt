==Fictional character biography==
Godfrey has a sister named [[Amazing Grace (comics)|Amazing Grace]] who is also a member of [[Darkseid]]'s Elite.  Both siblings have similar powers.  Whereas Amazing Grace's speciality is manipulation, Godfrey's is persuasion.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Godfrey remained a relatively unimportant character until 1986 (he had a total of 3 appearances over a decade and a half), when the first crossover since the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' was published.  In it, [[Darkseid]] attempts to deprive the world of its heroes, not only so that they would be ineffective against Darkseid, but also in the hope that the people of Earth would more willingly surrender to his rule.
[[Image:GloriousGodfrey.png|thumb|left|150px|G. Gordon Godfrey,<br> artist [[John Byrne]].]]  The first phase of the plan consists simply of creating immense amounts of collateral damage by sending creatures to Earth to fight the [[superhero]]es.  The public begins to resent the heroes in their midst, and therefore Darkseid starts the second phase of his plan by sending the master manipulator Glorious Godfrey to Earth.

Assuming the identity of G. Gordon Godfrey, he starts a hate-campaign towards the superheroes that proves to be very effective, riling the public, ultimately leading to a presidential decision to outlaw any superheroic action.  The final phase of this plan, consists of the Apokoliptian warhounds, cybernetic creatures that are bonded to human hosts, for which Godfrey is able to find an ample amount of 'volunteers' amongst his hypnotized public.  He leads his charges to Washington D.C., only to be confronted by a cadre of assembled heroes.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The heroes are able to defeat the Warhounds and break up the public, and Godfrey makes one last ploy, where he tries on the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]] in hopes of obtaining his awesome might.  Instead, the helmet [[mindwipe|mindwipes]] Godfrey, leaving him nothing more than an empty shell that is sent to the [[Belle Reve]] prison, where he would later be broken out of by the [[Female Furies]] under the order of Darkseid.

Godfrey has subsequently made brief appearances in assemblages of all the Apokoliptian Gods.

===''Final Crisis''===

In the ''[[Final Crisis]] Sketchbook'', there is a sketch of a character called "Reverend G. Godfrey Goode" who shares many physical characteristics with Glorious Godfrey.  The sketchbook goes on to say that "This passionate [[televangelist]] plays a central role in the evil gods' occupation of Earth."  The sketchbook also features "reinventions" of many other New Gods.

In ''Final Crisis'' #1 Reverend Godfrey Good (no "e") appears on a TV news report, decrying the situation in [[Bl√ºdhaven]].  He later assists Darkseid in gaining a new body.  In ''Final Crisis'' #5, Godfrey, Mokkari and Simyan, soon after reporting the status of their tasks for Darkseid, are allowed to collapse as their bodies wear out.  Their pleas for Darkseid to recreate them go ignored.

==In other media==
A different version of Glorious Godfrey appeared in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series.  In the two part episode "Eclipsed" '''"Glorious" G. Gordon Godfrey''' (voiced by [[Enrico Colantoni]]) is the host of a [[sensationalist]] talk show which he uses to attack the Justice League's credibility.  It is not revealed if he is connected with Darkseid or has his powers of persuasion; it appears that he is a normal human.  After the Justice League successfully prevented the destruction of the [[sun]], his sponsors dropped him and the network moved his show to four o'clock in the morning.

At one point on his talk show, Godfrey holds up a book called ''The Innocent Seduced'' and refers to its author, Dr. Frederic.  This is a reference to ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', an actual book written by [[Fredric Wertham]] which had great influence during the early 1950s and accused comic books of corrupting minors. 

This version of Godfrey had blonde hair, rather than the comic version's orange.
