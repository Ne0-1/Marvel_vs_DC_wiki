The '''Spider-Slayers''' are a series of fictional [[robot]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The robots are depicted as being specifically designed to hunt down, capture, or kill [[Spider-Man]].

==Publication history==
The Spider-Slayers first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
''See [[List of Spider-Slayers]] for a full breakdown of all versions of the Spider-Slayer.''

The first series of robots were originally designed and built by Dr. [[Spencer Smythe]] with the financial backing of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] who piloted them for the pleasure of personally hunting the [[superhero]] he hated for capture. However, Spider-Man always managed to defeat each robot in turn. Smythe's continual efforts to perfect his machines backfired on him, leading to himself being fatally contaminated by [[radiation poisoning]] from the building materials of his creations. Blaming both Jameson and Spider-Man for this, he attempted, as a final act, to murder them both, but died just before Spider-Man thwarted the attempt.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #191-192</ref>

Later, Jameson commissioned another scientist, Dr. [[Marla Madison]], to create a new and improved Spider-Slayer.{{issue|date=December 2012}} While that attempt failed, he eventually fell in love with her and married her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #167-168</ref>

In ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #19 (1985), Smythe's son, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair]], emerged as the new builder of Spider-Slayers. He swore revenge on Spider-Man, repeatedly attacking the superhero with his own series of Slayers. Smythe later mutated into a humanoid Spider-Slayer, but remains a minor foe.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The original Spider-Slayer was seen among the robots and machines in the [[Reanimator (comics)|Reanimator's]] collection. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] later destroyed the Spider-Slayer when the Reanimator attempted to use it against him. It was later used by J. Jonah Jameson to attack the [[She-Hulk]] after she had married his son [[John Jameson (comics)|John]], but it was destroyed.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #603, Jameson (now Mayor of New York) has some old Spider-Slayers sent to him from storage, to better equip his "Anti-Spider Squad" to take down Spider-Man. The Spider-Slayer technology is combined with that of the [[Mandroid]] suits. However, the "Spider-Slayer Squad" wearing the suits quit their jobs after Spider-Man saves them and New York from a dirty bomb.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Despite not being technically related to the Smythe's and Madison's creations, when Spider-Man refits all the Octobots confiscated from [[Doctor Octopus]] and kept in the New York Police Precinct to carry an antidote able to reverse the mutations turning all the New York population into Man-Spiders, he humorously renames them his own ''Spider-Slayers''.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672</ref>

When the Goblin King and his Goblin Underground group cause havoc in Manhattan, Mayor J. Jonah Jameson unveils the Goblin-Slayers which he plans to use against the Goblin-related threats. Mary Jane Watson voices her concern that the Goblin-Slayers used to be former Spider-Slayers.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28</ref> Mayor J. Jonah Jameson orders Chief Pratchett to send one of the Goblin Slayers to the robbery location and then head to chase the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body). After Don Lamaze sacrifices his life to get out of the Goblin King's trap, the Superior Spider-Man confronted by a legion of Spider-Slayers with Mayor J. Jonah Jameson's face projected on the front faceplate. Mayor J. Jonah Jameson replies that he's done with being blackmailed by him and he doesn't care if he loses everything as long as he can finally bring down Spider-Man. The Superior Spider-Man tries to fight the Spider-Slayers, but discovers that they're far stronger than all the previous ones. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are deactivated remotely by [[Spider-Man 2099]], who confronts the Superior Spider-Man about who he really is and the reasons behind his actions of late. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are reactivated to Spider-Man 2099's shock. The Goblin King's voice rings out declaring that he has taken control of the Spider-Slayers as well which grab both Spider-Men by their heads as the Goblin King comments that Norman Osborn now runs this city.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #29</ref>

In a ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' storyline following Smythe's death, dealers illegally sell Spider-Slayers to foreign nations.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/20689-spider-man-2099-swings-again-in-new-ongoing-series-with-peter-david.html</ref> However, after Miguel accompanies Tiberus Stone on one such deal, he ends up fighting the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] (who was hired by Alchemax to further test the Spider-Slayers) as Stone is captured by the local rebels,<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #3</ref> Miguel defeating the Scorpion by tricking the Spider-Slayers into attacking him, while Stone's encounter with the rebels prompts him to change his mind about the original deal.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

==List of Spider-Slayers==
{{main|List of Spider-Slayers}}

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Spider-Slayers were built by the [[Tinkerer]] under the order of General [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]], to be used in case [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] ever went rogue. When clones of Spider-Man begin running rampant Nick Fury and a battalion of Spider-Slayers travel to the Parker residence to arrest Peter, only to encounter the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], the latter which the Slayers take down (reverting it to [[Gwen Stacy]]). The Slayers later kill a [[Kaine Parker|disfigured clone of Spider-Man]]. and [[Mac Gargan#Ultimate Scorpion|imprisoned another unstable clone of Peter Parker/Spider-Man]] in [[SHIELD]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #99</ref><ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #100</ref><ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #101</ref><ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #102</ref><ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103</ref><ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #104</ref>

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, the Spider-Slayers are tall (about eight feet) robots that balance on a large sphere, wield two arm-cannons, and have a sphere for their heads. They turned out in fact not to be manned but controlled remotely by the Tinkerer.

===MC2===
While trying to apprehend a dimension-hopping supervillain in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] reality, [[Spider-Girl]] is accidentally sent into [[Earth-616]]'s past, where she encounters the first Spider-Slayer. Mistaking her for its quarry, the Slayer attacks Spider-Girl, who manages to evade the machine due to Jameson and Smythe being distracted by how different "Spider-Man" looks. Spider-Girl later returns to her own universe and time, while Spider-Man defeats the Slayer in the same way he did in the original story.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Tom DeFalco|penciller = Pat Olliffe|inker = Al Williamson|story = Father's Day/Slayers, Spiders, and Torches, Oh My|title = Spider-Girl|volume = 1|issue = #10-11|date = July 1999 - August 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, J. Jonah Jameson (fearing Peter Parker would take revenge on him due to outing him as Spider-Man) has Alistair Smythe construct a Spider-Slayer to protect him. When Peter's family breaks into Jonah's home looking for Peter's journal (given to him by the [[Green Goblin]]) Jonah, using the Slayer, attacks. Hitting Peter's wife [[Gwen Stacy]] just as Peter arrives, Jonah's slayer is ripped to shreds by the hero.<ref>''House of M: Spider-Man'' #3</ref><ref>''House of M: Spider-Man'' #4</ref>

The ''House of M'' Slayer resembled a humanoid robot with claws and a glowing core in the chest similar to [[Iron Man]]'s armor. Like early models in the mainstream universe it had a view screen depicting the controller in place of a face.

=== What If ===
After [[Aunt May]] and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] are killed in a space shuttle crash caused by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], J. Jonah Jameson adopts Peter Parker, and blames the deaths of their loved ones on Spider-Man. Obsessed with taking Spider-Man down, Jameson commissions the creation of the Spider-Slayer and the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] formula, the latter of which is ingested by [[Flash Thompson]]. The serum warps Flash's mind and causes him to go on a rampage, which ends when he is subdued by Spider-Man (who reveals he is Peter Parker to Jameson) and the Spider-Slayer, controlled by Jameson. Jameson realizes how irrational his hatred of Spider-Man is, and decides to help his adopted son fight crime using the Spider-Slayer.<ref>{{Cite comic

===Television===
* The [[List of Spider-Slayers#Mark I|first Spider-Slayer]] appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series. This version was built by a man named Henry Smythe. In this adaptation instead of steel coils that shoot out of the robots body, it only has two metallic tentacle-like arms, and also possesses a periscope. In the episode "Captured by J. Jonah Jameson", it pursued [[Spider-Man]] all over the city. After Spider-Man tricked the Spider-Slayer with a dummy of himself, Henry takes the Spider-Slayer back to his house to work on it.

[[File:Spidermanep4.jpg|thumb|right|The Spider Slayers combined in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series.]]
* The Spider-Slayers appear in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series. They appear as the main antagonists in the second and third episodes. In "The Spider Slayer", the Spider-Slayers being commissioned by [[Norman Osborn]] for hunting Spider-Man with Spencer Smythe at the controls. The 'Black Widow' Spider-Slayer was finally destroyed and the factory exploded with Spencer still in it. This culminated in [[Alistair Smythe]] working for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] when his father was presumed dead. In "Return of the Spider-Slayers", Alistair would go on to not only recreate the 'Black Widow' Spider-Slayer, but simultaneously unleashes the 'Tarantula' Spider-Slayers and 'Scorpion' Spider-Slayer. In this depiction, the three Spider-Slayers could join together as a massive engine of destruction. In "Tablet of Time", Alistair would build another Spider-Slayer called the "Mega Slayer", a heavily armed humanoid robot operated by remote. As punishment for repeated failures and being partially responsible for [[Richard Fisk]]'s arrest in "The Man Without Fear", Kingpin's new chief scientist Herbert Landon genetically mutated Alistair into the 'Ultimate Spider-Slayer' as seen in "The Ultimate Slayer". In this form, Alistair was capable of walking again and was incredibly strong and resilient, and also had twin horns growing from his shoulders, both of which were organic laser guns. Though Alistair broke free from Kingpin's controls when Spider-Man revealed what really happened to Spencer. In "The Wedding", Kingpin used Smythe's duplicate of the 'Mega Slayer' to stop Goblin Glider-riding Robots sent by Smythe and [[Harry Osborn]] to crash Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s wedding. It was destroyed while helping Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. The ''[[List of Spider-Slayers#Mark X|Alien Spider Slayer]]'' (Mark X) was removed from the 1990s ''Spider-Man'' TV series but the design was featured in both the Animated Series Toy Line by Toy Biz and the Sega Genesis ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game released in 1995.
* A Spider-Slayer like concept called the '''[[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel Prowlers]]''' appear in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series. The Sentinel Prowler is a prototype version of the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].
* The Spider-Slayers appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister 6]]''. There two variations: '''[[Kaine Parker|Project Kaine]]''' (voiced primarily by [[Drake Bell]] (in Spider-Man's likeness)<ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 1">{{cite episode|title=The Spider Slayers Pt. 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=21|airdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref> and briefly by [[Scott Porter]] (in Scarlet Spider's likeness)<ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 1"/>) and the '''Delta-Nine Synthezoids''' which consist of '''Bone Spider''' and '''Goliath Spider''' (both voiced by [[Imari Williams]]<ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 2">{{cite episode|title=The Spider Slayers Pt. 2|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=22|airdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>) and '''Ghost Spider''' (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]]<ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 2"/>). Both versions are a part of a secret [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] project where the DNA of [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) is combined with [[Arnim Zola]]'s synthezoids. Kaine resembles a pale version of Spider-Man with a green mark across his chest spider symbol and highly resistant to damage with the capability of reattaching lost limbs. Bone Spider's additional ability enables him to extend his bony protrusions and claws, Goliath Spider's additional abilities give him super-strength and a metallic exoskeleton, and Ghost Spider's additional ability can teleport make him intangible. They appear in "The Spider-Slayers" story-arc as a central character. Kaine makes himself known when he feeds off of Peter and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. When the two move through HYDRA's secret lab, Kaine uses more Spider-Man synthezoids in fighting Spider-Man and Spider-Woman. Following the imperfect synthezoids' defeat, Kaine traps Spider-Man and Spider-Woman until the prototype synthezoid is sliced in half by [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] (Ben Reilly). [[Doctor Octopus]] uses Scarlet Spider synthezoids as protection when the three Spiders move further through the secret lab only for the more perfect synthezoids to be beaten by Scarlet Spider and Spider-Woman. Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider take Doc Ock to Hydra Island where the three encounter the Delta-Nine Synthezoids in a showdown. After it's revealed that Scarlet Spider is an advanced Synthezoid version spliced with Spider-Man's DNA (similar to the [[Clone Saga]]) with implanted memories, Doc Ock reveals that Scarlet Spider was originally meant to be the Delta-Nine Synthezoids' leader. As the two heroes struggle against the Delta-Nine Synthezoids, Doc Ock (with improved Nano-tech) comes to the Spiders' aid and imprison the Delta-Nine Synthezoids. After Zola's reactivation, Doc Ock betrayed Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider and left the heroes to the clones' wrath. Zola (via HYDRA Island's nanotechnology) traps Scarlet Spider and Spider-Man, making Scarlet Spider fall into his dark side but convinces the Delta-Nine Synthezoids to not attack Spider-Man as the Web Warriors arrived. With help from the newfound allies, Spider-Man was able to defeat Zola. Escaping the HYDRA Island's destruction and placing the Delta-Nine Synthezoids into stasis pods, the Web Warriors and the Delta Nine Synthezoids go off to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. Meanwhile, Kaine regenerates in a mutated, misshapen form with spiked tentacles out of his sides and infiltrates the Triskelion. Kaine attacks [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy]] and feeds off the group's energy. When Scarlet Spider attempts to overload Kaine with an energy transmitter, the process is interrupted which makes Kaine stronger. Powered up with a bulkier physique, Kaine begins dominating over the Web-Warriors, making Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider resort to assistance from the Delta-Nine Synthezoids (Bone Spider, Goliath Spider and Ghost Spider). But having gained enough intelligence to be disdainful towards humans, Kaine is able to coherce the Delta-Nine Synthezoids as the new alpha into turning on the Web Warriors. Although the Delta-Nine Synthezoids are eventually defeated by the Web Warriors, Kaine absorbs the Delta-Nine Synthezoids into his body mass, transforming into the '''Ultimate Spider-Slayer''', a hulking hybrid of the other Spider-Slayer synthezoids. Nigh-unstoppable, Kaine attempts to absorb Scarlet Spider. However, [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] rushes towards Kaine with the energy transmitter and enters Kaine's hybrid body, successfully managing to overload Kaine's hybrid form to explode into synthetic goop.
* A Spider-Slayer appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Horizon High" Pt. 2. It appears as a giant robot secretly created by [[Spencer Smythe]] that invades Horizon High to steal some of [[Harry Osborn]]'s devices. There were some organics thrown into its creation. After two different difficult battles with the Spider-Slayer, Spider-Man was able to destroy it. In the episode "Party Animals," Alistair Smythe controls another Spider-Slayer in its fight with Spider-Man. After it's fight with Spider-Man, Alistair sets the Spider-Slayer to self-destruct causing Spider-Man to fling it's different parts high into the sky. It turns out that this was part of Alistair Smythe's audition to enroll in Osborn Academy where Norman Osborn states that he passed.

* Humanoid Spider-Slayers armed with flame throwers appear as enemies in the final Ultimate segment in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''. In-game, it is stated that these Slayers were built with the intention of handling [[Alternative versions of Venom#Ultimate Spider-Man|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. When Carnage escapes and begins wreaking havoc throughout the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] releases them to handle the situation, but they also end up attacking [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] as well due to the black suit.

There were also four larger robots were created by Oscorp R&D head Alistair Smythe. The first is the S-01 (a massive arachnid-like machine that is a larger version of the Hunters) which was released into [[Central Park]] after the outbreak of the Cross-Species outbreak where Spider-Man defeats it by getting it fire one of its own missiles into its mouth. The second is the S-02 (a giant tentacled snake-like burrowing machine) released to kill Spider-Man after Smythe injected himself with the failed cure which Spider Man defeated by getting it to suck up a radio antenna. The third and final is the S-03 which can be best described as a Colosseum with legs that Spider Man and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] were able to defeat via taking out its legs.
