The '''Spider-Slayers''' are a series of fictional [[robot]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] that were specifically designed to hunt down, capture, and/or kill [[Spider-Man]].

The first number of robots were originally designed and built by Spencer Smythe with the financial backing of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] who piloted them for the pleasure of personally hunting the [[superhero]] he hated for capture.  However, Spider-Man always managed to defeat each robot in turn.  Smythe's continual efforts to perfect his machines backfired on him, leading to himself being fatally contaminated by [[radiation poisoning]] from the building materials of his creations.  Blaming both Jameson and Spider-Man for this, he attempted, as a final act, to murder them both, but died just before Spider-Man thwarted the attempt.

Later on, Jameson commissioned another scientist, Dr. Marla Madison, to create a new and improved Spider-Slayer.  While that attempt failed, he eventually fell in love with her and married her.

Still later, Smythe's son, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistaire]], who had sworn revenge on Spider-Man, repeatedly attacked the superhero with his own series of Slayers, and was no more successful.  Smythe was later mutated into a humanoid Spider-Slayer, but remained a minor foe.

==Other media depiction==
The [[1960s]] [[animated series]] had a story that was a faithful adaptation of the first Spider-Slayer story, although the scientist was named Henry Smythe.

The [[1990s]] series had the Slayers being commissioned by [[Norman Osborn]] for hunting Spider-Man.
