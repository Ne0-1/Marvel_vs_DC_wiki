The '''Spider-Slayers''' are a series of fictional [[robot]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] that were specifically designed to hunt down, capture, and/or kill [[Spider-Man]].

The first number of robots were originally designed and built by Dr. [[Spencer Smythe]] with the financial backing of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] who piloted them for the pleasure of personally hunting the [[superhero]] he hated for capture.  However, Spider-Man always managed to defeat each robot in turn.  Smythe's continual efforts to perfect his machines backfired on him, leading to himself being fatally contaminated by [[radiation poisoning]] from the building materials of his creations.  Blaming both Jameson and Spider-Man for this, he attempted, as a final act, to murder them both, but died just before Spider-Man thwarted the attempt.

Later on, Jameson commissioned another scientist, Dr. [[Marla Madison]], to create a new and improved Spider-Slayer.  While that attempt failed, he eventually fell in love with her and married her.

Still later, Smythe's son, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair]], who had sworn revenge on Spider-Man, repeatedly attacked the superhero with his own series of Slayers, and was no more successful.  Smythe was later mutated into a humanoid Spider-Slayer, but remained a minor foe.

Mentioned by Nick Fury at the end of Ultimate Spider-Man #99. Fury sends out the Slayers after seeing the Ultimate Scorpion/Peter clone in the Baxter Building, telling the dispatcher to send the Slayers and a cleanup crew to Queens, "because (it was) gonna be messy,".

They are seen towards the end of issue #100, led by Nick Fury, and surrounding Peter's house. In Ultimate Marvel continuity, the Spider-Slayers are tall (about 8 feet) robots that balance on a large sphere, wield two arm-cannons, and have a sphere for their heads. They turned out in fact not to be manned but controlled remotely by the Ultimate [[Tinkerer]], and were also able to level a pulse beam that knocked out [[Carnage (comics)|Ultimate Carnage]].

==Other media depiction==
The [[1960s]] [[animated series]] had a story that was a faithful adaptation of the first Spider-Slayer story, although the scientist was named Henry Smythe.

The [[1994]] [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]] had the Slayers being commissioned by [[Norman Osborn]] for hunting Spider-Man. This culminated in [[Alistair Smythe]] working for the Kingpin; he would go on to not only recreate the "Black Widow" Spider-Slayer, but also at the same time to unleash the "Tarantula" and "Scorpion" Spider-Slayers. In this depiction, the three Spider-Slayers could join together as a massive engine of destruction.

Later, Alistair build an another Slayer called the "Mega Slayer".  The Mega Slayer is a mechanical robot that is not a spider that can shoot missiles and lasers. 

Alistair left the Kingpin's service after, as punishment for repeated failures, the Kingpin's new chief scientist, the mutate Gerbert Landon, genetically mutated him into the "Ultimate Spider-Slayer". In this form, Alistair was capable of walking again and was incredibly strong and resilient. He also had twin horns growing from his shoulders, both of which were organic laser guns.

The Slayers appeared in the video game adaptation of [[Spider-Man: The Movie]] where they had been created by Oscorp to hunt down Spider-Man but they wound up hunting the [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]] instead. The Scorpion came near [[Spider-Man]] and they had to fight them. They resembled mechanical spiders.
