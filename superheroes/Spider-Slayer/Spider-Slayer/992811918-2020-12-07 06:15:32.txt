The '''Spider-Slayers''' are a series of fictional [[robot]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Spencer Smythe]], they were designed specifically to hunt down, capture, or kill [[Spider-Man]]. A new generation of Spider-Slayers was later created by Spencer's son, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair Alphonso Smythe]].

The Spider-Slayers have been featured in a number of Spider-Man adaptations outside of comics, including animated series and video games.

==Publication history==
The Spider-Slayers first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 (June 1965) and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=29}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
:''See [[List of Spider-Slayers]] for a full breakdown of all versions of the Spider-Slayer.''

The first series of robots were originally designed and built by Prof. [[Spencer Smythe]] with the financial backing of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who piloted them for the pleasure of personally hunting the [[superhero]] he hated for capture and public unmasking. However, Spider-Man always managed to defeat each robot in turn. Smythe's continual efforts to perfect his machines backfired on him, leading to himself being fatally contaminated by [[radiation poisoning]] from the building materials of his creations. Blaming both Jameson and Spider-Man for this, he attempted, as a final act, to murder them both, but died just before Spider-Man thwarted the attempt.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #191-192</ref>

At one point, Jameson commissioned another scientist, Dr. [[Marla Madison]], to create a new and improved Spider-Slayer.{{issue|date=December 2012}} While that attempt failed, he eventually fell in love with her and married her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #167-168</ref>

In ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #19 (1985), Smythe's son, [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair]], emerged as the new builder of the Spider-Slayers. He swore revenge on Spider-Man, repeatedly attacking the superhero with his own series of Slayers. Smythe later mutated into a humanoid Spider-Slayer, but remains a minor foe.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The original Spider-Slayer was seen among the robots and machines in the [[Reanimator (comics)|Reanimator]]'s collection. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] later destroyed the Spider-Slayer when the Reanimator attempted to use it against him. It was later used by J. Jonah Jameson to attack the [[She-Hulk]] after she had married his son [[John Jameson (comics)|John]], but it was destroyed again.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #603, Jameson (now Mayor of New York) has some old Spider-Slayers sent to him from storage to better equip his "Anti-Spider Squad" to take down Spider-Man. The Spider-Slayer technology is combined with that of the [[Mandroid]] suits. However, the "Spider-Slayer Squad" wearing the suits quit their jobs after Spider-Man saves them and New York from a dirty bomb.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Despite not being technically related to the Smythes' and Madison's creations, when Spider-Man refits all the Octobots confiscated from [[Doctor Octopus]] and kept in the New York Police Precinct to carry an antidote able to reverse the mutations turning all the New York population into Man-Spiders, he humorously renames them his own ''Spider-Slayers''.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672</ref>

When the Goblin King and his Goblin Underground group cause havoc in Manhattan, Mayor J. Jonah Jameson unveils the Goblin-Slayers which he plans to use against the Goblin-related threats. Mary Jane Watson voices her concern that the Goblin-Slayers used to be former Spider-Slayers.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28</ref> Mayor J. Jonah Jameson orders Chief Pratchett to send one of the Goblin Slayers to the robbery location and then head to chase the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body). After Don Lamaze sacrifices his life to get out of the Goblin King's trap, the Superior Spider-Man confronted by a legion of Spider-Slayers with Mayor J. Jonah Jameson's face projected on the front faceplate. Mayor J. Jonah Jameson replies that he is done with being blackmailed by him and he does not care if he loses everything as long as he can finally bring down Spider-Man. The Superior Spider-Man tries to fight the Spider-Slayers, but discovers that they are far stronger than all the previous ones. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are deactivated remotely by [[Spider-Man 2099]], who confronts the Superior Spider-Man about who he really is and the reasons behind his actions of late. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are reactivated, to Spider-Man 2099's shock. The Goblin King's voice rings out, declaring that he has taken control of the Spider-Slayers as well, which grab both Spider-Men by their heads as the Goblin King comments that Norman Osborn now runs this city.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #29</ref>

In a ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' storyline following Smythe's death, dealers illegally sell Spider-Slayers to foreign nations.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/20689-spider-man-2099-swings-again-in-new-ongoing-series-with-peter-david.html</ref> However, after Miguel accompanies Tiberus Stone on one such deal, he ends up fighting the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] (who was hired by Alchemax to further test the Spider-Slayers) as Stone is captured by the local rebels,<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' (vol. 2) #3</ref> Miguel defeating the Scorpion by tricking the Spider-Slayers into attacking him, while Stone's encounter with the rebels prompts him to change his mind about the original deal.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' (vol. 2) #4</ref>

Mistaking her for its quarry, the Spider-Slayer attacks Spider-Girl who manages to evade the machine due to being distracted by how different "Spider-Man" looks. Spider-Girl later returns to her own universe and time, while Spider-Man defeats the Spider-Slayer in the same way he did in the original story.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Tom DeFalco|penciller = Pat Olliffe|inker = Al Williamson|story = Father's Day/Slayers, Spiders, and Torches, Oh My|title = Spider-Girl|volume = 1|issue = #10-11|date = July 1999 - August 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* The [[List of Spider-Slayers#Mark I|first Spider-Slayer]] appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series episode "Captured by J. Jonah Jameson". This version was built by Henry Smythe and is equipped with two metallic tentacle-like arms. It pursued Spider-Man until the web-slinger tricked it with a dummy. Following this, Smythe took the Spider-Slayer back to his house to make adjustments.[[File:Spidermanep4.jpg|thumb|The Black Widow, Tarantula, and Scorpion Spider-Slayers combined in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series.|alt=]]
* The Spider-Slayers appear in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man animated series]]''. In its self-titled episode, Spencer Smythe, with help from [[Norman Osborn]], builds a Spider-Slayer called the '<nowiki/>'''Black Widow'''<nowiki/>' to hunt down Spider-Man. However, it is destroyed after a battle with the hero at Spencer's lab, resulting in its creator's apparent death. In "Return of the Spider-Slayers", Spencer's son Alistair joins the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], recreates the Black Widow, and builds the '<nowiki/>'''Tarantula'''<nowiki/>' and '<nowiki/>'''Scorpion'''<nowiki/>' Spider-Slayers, which are able to combine together. In "Tablet of Time", Alistair creates the '<nowiki/>'''Mega Slayer'''<nowiki/>', a heavily armed android he can operate remotely. In "The Ultimate Slayer", as punishment for his repeated failures, Kingpin's chief scientist Herbert Landon genetically mutates Alistair into the '''Ultimate Spider-Slayer''', who has organic laser guns growing from his shoulders in addition to superhuman strength and resilience. Alistair eventually breaks free from the Kingpin's control after Spider-Man helps him discover that Spencer is still alive and Kingpin placed him in [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic suspension]]. In "The Wedding", the Kingpin uses a duplicate of the Mega Slayer to stop Goblin Glider-riding robots sent by Alistair and the second [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] from crashing Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s wedding, though it is destroyed while helping Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. The show was also supposed to feature the ''[[List of Spider-Slayers#Mark X|Alien Spider Slayer]]'' (Mark X), which was released as part of the Animated Series Toy Line by Toy Biz, and also served as a boss in the [[Spider-Man (1995 video game)|video game adaptation]] of the show, but was cut for unknown reasons.
* A Spider-Slayer like concept called the '''[[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel Prowlers]]''' appear in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series. The Sentinel Prowlers are a prototype version of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].
* The Spider-Slayers appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister 6]]''. These Spider-Slayers are creations of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Doctor Octopus]], who combined Spider-Man's DNA with [[Arnim Zola]]'s Synthezoids. The group consists of '''[[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]''' (voiced by [[Drake Bell]]), '''[[Scarlet Spider]]''' (voiced by [[Scott Porter]]), and the '''Delta-Nine Synthezoids''': '''Bone Spider''', '''Goliath Spider''' (both voiced by Imari Williams), and '''Ghost Spider''' (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]]). Kaine is an imperfect Synthezoid who is highly resistant to damage, can reattach lost limbs, and feed off Spider-Man or the other Spider-Slayers' life energy. Scarlet Spider, later named [[Ben Reilly]] by [[Aunt May|May Parker]], is an [[Clone Saga|almost perfect clone]] of Spider-Man barring a facial scar and powers. Bone Spider has claws and spikes all over his body; Goliath Spider is the strongest Spider-Slayer who can turn his body into metal; and Ghost Spider can teleport, become intangible, and perform bio-electric attacks. Scarlet Spider is introduced in the two-part episode "Hydra Attacks" and becomes an ally of Spider-Man before being revealed as a spy for Doctor Octopus, though he eventually redeems himself. In the three-part episode "The Spider-Slayers", Spider-Man encounters Kaine before he, [[Mary Jane Watson|Spider-Woman]], and Scarlet Spider follow him to one of Doc Ock's labs, where they defeat Kaine and numerous Synthezoid versions of Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider. Following this, Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider take Doctor Octopus to HYDRA Island to learn more about Scarlet Spider's origins, where they encounter the Delta-Nine Synthezoids and Doc Ock reveals Scarlet Spider is the most advanced of the Synthezoids who was intended be the Delta-Nine Synthezoids' leader. As Doctor Octopus makes his escape, Zola reawakens and commands the Delta-Nine Synthezoids to attack Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider, but they eventually defeat them and free them from Zola's control. The Delta-Nine Synthezoids are placed in stasis pods and taken to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. Unbeknownst to the heroes initially, Kaine returns in a mutated, misshapen form with spiked tentacles to infiltrate the Triskelion. After the Web Warriors fail to defeat him, Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider release the Delta-Nine Synthezoids to help, but Kaine absorbs them and becomes the "'''Ultimate Spider-Slayer'''". He is finally defeated after [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] uses an energy transmitter to overload Kaine, causing him to explode.<ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 1">{{cite episode|title=The Spider Slayers Pt. 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=21|airdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 2">{{cite episode|title=The Spider Slayers Pt. 2|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=22|airdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref><ref name="The Spider-Slayers Pt. 3">{{cite episode|title=The Spider-Slayers Pt. 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=23|airdate=October 22, 2016}}</ref>
* The Spider-Slayers appear in the 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series. These versions resemble spiders and come in human-sized, mecha-sized, and miniature variants. The original Spider-Slayers were created by Spencer Smythe, though [[Oscorp]] stole his schematics and created their own versions. In the episode "Horizon High" [Pt. 2], one of Spencer's Spider-Slayers attacks the eponymous school to steal [[Harry Osborn]]'s devices before it is eventually destroyed by Spider-Man. In "Party Animals", Alistair Smythe remotely operates one of Oscorp's Spider-Slayers to fight Spider-Man. In "Ultimate Spider-Man", another one of Spencer's Spider-Slayer attacks Oscorp and fights Spider-Man as a distraction while Spencer steals the company's genetically-modified spiders. Later, Spencer and Alistair pilot giant Spider-Slayers in an attepmt to capture the [[Miles Morales|Ultimate Spider-Man]] before the other one, though both robots are eventually destroyed by their quarry and the original Spider-Man. In "The Rise of Doc Ock" [Pts. 3 & 4] and "The Hobgoblin" [Pt. 1], Alistair operates human-sized Spider-Slayers while operating as part of the Osborn Commandos and the [[Sinister Six|Sinister Five]], respectively. In "Spider-Island" [Pt. 5], several of Oscorp's Spider-Slayers are used by Harry, [[Anya Corazon]] and the Spider-Men against the Man-Spiders before the [[Raymond Warren (comics)|Jackal]] deactivates them. In "Living Brain", miniature Spider-Slayers are used as security by Oscorp against Ultimate Spider-Man and the [[Living Brain|eponymous character]]. In "Goblin War" [Pt. 1], Alistair uses miniature Spider-Slayers as security against Spider-Man, [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]], and Spider-Girl during their investigation of the Goblin Nation.

* The Spider-Slayers appear in the 2002 ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game. These versions are human-sized mechanical spiders created by Oscorp to hunt down Spider-Man. However, they attacked the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] as he also has arachnid DNA. All the Spider-Slayers are eventually destroyed by the combined efforts of Spider-Man and the Scorpion.
* The Spider-Slayers appear in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''. These versions are large humanoid robots armed with [[Flamethrower|flamethrowers]] that were created by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as a counter-measure to [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]]. They appear in the final [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] segment of the game, wherein they are dispatched when [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] breaks free and takes over the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. Due to [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] wearing his symbiote suit at the time, the Spider-Slayers initially attacked him as well. During the final battle with Carnage, several reprogrammed Spider-Slayers help Spider-Man defeat the symbiote.
* The Spider-Slayers appear in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game. These versions are called S-Bots and were created by Oscorp under the supervision of [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Alistair Smythe as a counter-measure for the cross-species experiments. They consist of Sentries (which come in three variants: Medical, Combat, and Advanced Combat), Seekers (used to track down cross-species), and Hunters (arachnid-like flying robots called in by the Seekers to eliminate cross-species once they are found). There are also three special robots created specifically for citywide threats: S-01, a larger version of the Hunter that cannot fly, but can shoot lasers and homing missiles; S-02, a giant tentacled snake-like robot equipped with large drills that allow it to tunnel through buildings and underground; and S-03, a massive, heavily armed scorpion-like machine. The S-01 is deployed early on in the game and wreaks havoc in the city in its search for cross-species until Spider-Man destroys it. S-02 is later sent by Smythe to specifically kill Spider-Man, who destroys it. S-03 is manually operated by Smythe near the end of the game in his attempt to spread the [[Nanorobotics|nanobot]]-based cross-species antidote, and is destroyed by the combined efforts of Spider-Man and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].
* The Hunters and Seekers return in [[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'']] video game, used by the Enhanced Crime Task Force to hunt down Spider-Man if his hero reputation is too low.
