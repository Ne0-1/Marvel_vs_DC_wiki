'''Viper''' a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is a foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men]].  The character was created by [[Jim Steranko]] and first appeared in Captain America vol.1 #110 (February [[1969]]), under the name '''Madame Hydra'''.

==Character biography==

It is known that Viper was orphaned as a child in [[Eastern Europe]] and that part of her face was scarred at one time, but this is obviously no longer the case. She arose through the ranks of the elite criminal underworld through sheer ruthlessness, treachery, and the cunning of her black heart.

She first appeared as a leader of [[HYDRA]] under the codename '''Madame Hydra''' and frequently came into conflict with [[Captain America]] and the organization known as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

She severed ties with HYDRA in ''Captain America'' vol. 1 #170 (February, [[1974]]). In ''Captain America'' vol. 1 #180 (December, [[1974]]), Madame Hydra helped Jordan Stryke, a [[supervillain]] codenamed Viper, escape custody in [[Virginia]], only to proceed in [[assassin]]ating him and usurping his codename. The previous Viper was the founder and leader of the supervillain association known as the [[Serpent Squad]]. Later, in one of her many terrorist acts, she would try to gain control of the similarly themed organisation called [[Serpent Society]], attempting to assassinate its leader [[Sidewinder]], but she was betrayed by [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]] and arrested by [[Captain America]].

The Viper is a professional [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and has her own organization. She has come into conflict with many superheroes and supervillains over the years. Her [[nihilism]] and tendency to spread death around her has made it hard for other villains to associate with her. Only the [[Red Skull]] has found it a charming tendency and pursued a relationship with her for a while. The relationship ended when the Skull found out Viper was using his resources to finance [[List of massacres|massacre]]s with no apparent financial benefit for either of them.

In ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' vol. 1 #42- #44 (February - June, [[1982]]), Viper was apparently revealed to be Merriem Drew. Drew was the mother of Spider-Woman and was considered deceased since [[1931]].  The issue revealed Merriem had become allied to [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]] and was granted longevity in return. ''Captain America'' vol. 1 #281 (May, [[1983]]), revealed that Chthon had actually granted Viper [[False memory|false memories]] of mothering Jessica as part of a plan to place both women under his control. Whether Viper actually has extraordinary longevity was left uncertain.

Viper has also had conflict with the [[X-Men]]. She first came into contact with them upon trying to assassinate [[Mariko Yashida]] on behalf of her ally and presumed lover [[Silver Samurai]]. She once nearly killed the X-Men member, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. She also faced the [[New Mutants]] and was considered responsible for the demise of [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] for a while (Karma was only wounded and was abducted by the [[Shadow King]] for his own reasons).

Later she black-mailed [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] into marrying her as a means to secure her criminal empire in [[Madripoor]]. Although this was a marriage of convenience, she did request to consummate the arrangement. They have since divorced. Her body was once briefly inhabited by the spirit of [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]].

She is a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], and has also associated with the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] and resumed her ties with the Silver Samurai.

==Powers and abilities==

Viper has no superhuman abilities but her reflexes and agility are of the order of an Olympic athlete. She is a great swordsman and even greater marksman with most long range weapons.  She utilizes experimental weaponry. A brilliant strategist and tactician, Viper is highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld. She is also a master of stealth and espionage.  Perhaps her greatest strengths are her influence and the financial resources at her disposal due to her stature in [[organized crime]]. Viper may or may not have supernaturally augmented longevity.
