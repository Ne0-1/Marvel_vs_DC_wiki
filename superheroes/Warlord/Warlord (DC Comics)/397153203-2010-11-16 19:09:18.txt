'''''The Warlord''''' is a [[sword and sorcery]] [[comic book]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The series and titular character debuted in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 (November [[1975 in comics|1975]]), and was created by [[Mike Grell]]. 

==Publication history==
The title ''The Warlord'' comes from the comic's main character, Travis Morgan, who obtains the name of "The Warlord" in the first few issues as he fights for the freedom of the people of [[Skartaris]]. DC attempted an unsuccessful update of Warlord in 2006 with [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] writing and Bart Sears providing the art. This series was canceled after ten issues due to low sales.

In March 2008, Grell stated that he was working on a proposal to DC for a new ''Warlord'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=148802 |title=World Balloon: Mike Grell |accessdate=2008-06-06 |last=Brady |first=Matt |date=2008-03-03 |publisher=[[Newsarama]]}}</ref> It was announced in July 2008 that Warlord would be returning as an [[ongoing series]] written by Mike Grell in time for the original series' 35th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080727-SDCCWarlordGRell.html |title=SDCC '08 - Mike Grell: The Return of Warlord |accessdate=2008-08-16 |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=2008-07-27 |publisher=[[Newsarama]]}}</ref> The series started in April 2009, drawn by Joe Prado.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Series===
{{quote box|align=left|width=300px|quote= In the savage world of Skartaris, life is a constant struggle for survival. Here, beneath an unblinking orb of eternal sunlight, one simple law prevails: If you let down your guard for an instant you will soon be very dead.|source=1st Issue Special #8}}

[[Vietnam]] veteran [[SR-71]] pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the Earth's crust while flying over the north pole in 1969<ref>''Warlord'' (vol. 3) #10 (March 2010)</ref>  and landed in the underground world of [[Skartaris]], a place strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Pellucidar]]. There Travis, wielding his .44 [[AutoMag (pistol)|AutoMag]] pistol and joined by Shamballah's Princess (later Queen) Tara, a scantily-dressed savage, became the Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer [[Deimos (comics)|Deimos]] as well as various kings. He gained various sidekicks such as [[Machiste]], [[Shakira (comics)|Shakira]]<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher|Fleisher, Michael]] | Story = The Citadel of Fear | Title = Warlord | Volume = 1 | Issue = 115 | Date = March, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 5 | Panel = 2}}</ref>, a Russian scientist named Mariah<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher|Fleisher, Michael]] | Story = The Citadel of Fear | Title = Warlord | Volume = 1 | Issue = 115 | Date = March, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 6 | Panel = 2}}</ref> and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer Morgan. In one story arc Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future (Issue 84).

Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to Oliver Queen ([[Green Arrow]])<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 1) #28</ref>, he is in reality based more upon his creator, Mike Grell, a former member of the Air Force. Grell is caricatured in Warlord's first appearance, ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 and is clearly sporting the signature shaggy goatee.<ref>''Warlord'' (vol. 1) #35</ref> 

''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'', another DC Comics sword & sorcery title, began as a six-page backup feature in ''Warlord''. Another backup feature was ''The Barren Earth'' which was concluded in a four-issue limited series after a lengthly run in the ongoing ''The Warlord'' series.

===Current status===
Issue #1 (June 2009) of the new series begins with an explorer finding perfectly preserved [[dinosaur]] remains in the [[Himalayas]]. She takes the head of one to a doctor and an expedition is set up to retrieve more samples. The team is spotted by the Chinese government and flee into the caves after losing several members. They discover a portal and after walking through find themselves in [[Skartaris]]. Travis Morgan is attacked by a giant bird and kills it with the help of Shakira. Refugees enter Shamballah and Morgan discovers that a new god has taken over the Shadow Kingdom and has overrun the Kingdom of Kiro, [[Machiste]]'s homeland. One of the refugees is injured and he surprisingly carries a gunshot wound.<ref>''Warlord'' (vol. 3) #1 (June 2009)</ref>

Issue #12 saw the death of Travis Morgan. The machinations of Deimos' return pit Travis Morgan against Tinder. Just as Morgan realizes that Tinder is in fact his son Joshua, he becomes distracted and Tinder mortally wounds him. Travis Morgan's final words were "I thought I'd have more time." Morgan was then cremated and Tinder becomes the new Warlord.

Issue #13 marks Joshua Morgan, a.k.a. Tinder, as his official debut in the role of the Warlord. His costume is reminiscent of Travis Morgan's black outfit when he first arrived in Skartaris. Instead of carrying a sword and a gun as Travis did, Tinder carries a sword, a dagger, a quiver of arrows and a bow.

==Other versions==
A six issue limited series ran from January to June 1992, written and drawn by [[Mike Grell]].

A 3rd Warlord series was launched in 2006, produced by writer [[Bruce Jones]] and artist [[Bart Sears]]. This series restarted the concept and started with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris and was canceled after 10 issues. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue nine finished on a cliffhanger, while issue #10 had a standalone story set sometime in the future. This relaunch has been largely ignored throughout the DC continuity.

==In other media==
