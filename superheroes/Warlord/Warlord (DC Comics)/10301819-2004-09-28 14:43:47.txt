[[DC Comics]] published a [[comic book]] called '''''The Warlord''''' from  [[1976]].  [[Vietnam]] veteran pilot Travis Morgan, the title character, passes through a dimensional barrier to the underground [[sword and sorcery]] world of Skartaris, in a move strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Barsoom]].  [[Mike Grell]] created the character.

The book was DC's answer to [[Marvel Comics]]'s popular ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' title.  ''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'' was a spinoff of Warlord.
