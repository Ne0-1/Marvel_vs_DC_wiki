'''''The Warlord''''' is a [[sword and sorcery]] [[comic book]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The series and titular character debuted in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 (Nov. 1975), and was created by [[Mike Grell]]. 

==Publication history==
The title ''The Warlord'' comes from the comic's main character, Travis Morgan, who obtains the name of The Warlord in the first few issues as he fights for the freedom of the people of ''[[Skartaris]]''. DC attempted an unsuccessful update of Warlord in 2006 with [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] writing and Bart Sears providing the art. This series was canceled due to low sales after only ten issues.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Series===
[[Vietnam]] veteran [[SR-71]] pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the earth's crust while flying over the north pole and landed in the underground world of [[Skartaris]], a place strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Pellucidar]]. There Travis, wielding his .44 AutoMag pistol and joined by scantily-dressed female barbarian Tara, became the Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer Deimos as well as various kings.  He gained various sidekicks such as [[Machiste (comics)|Machiste]], Shakira, a Russian scientist named Mariah and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer Morgan. In one story arc Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future (Issue 84).

Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to Oliver Queen ([[Green Arrow]]) (as pointed out in issue 28 of [[Green Arrow]]), he is in reality based more upon his creator, Mike Grell, a former member of the Air Force. Grell is caricatured in Warlord's first appearance, ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 (see also ''Warlord'' #35), and is clearly sporting the signature shaggy goatee.

''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'', another DC Comics sword & sorcery title, began as a six-page backup feature in ''Warlord''. ''The Barren Earth'' was another backup feature, and after a lengthy run was concluded in a four-issue limited series.

===Modern series===
The new series started in 2006 and was authored by [[Bruce Jones]] and [[Bart Sears]] did not take up where the old one left off but instead restarted the concept and started with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris. This reboot was canceled after 10 issues. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue nine finished on a cliff-hanger, while issue #10 had a standalone story set sometime in the future.
