==Publication history==
=== Vol. 1 ===
DC debuted ''The Warlord'' title with the Jan./Feb. 1976 issue, but it went on an eight-month hiatus following issue #2, picking up again in Oct./Nov. 1976. The title lasted 133 issues until Winter 1988. Creator Mike Grell wrote and drew the comic for six years, handing over the art chores after issue #59 (July 1982); he continued writing the comic through issue #71 (July 1983).<ref>However, the last two years of Grell's scripts were ghost-written by his then-wife, Sharon (Wright) Grell, as revealed in the letter column of a later issue.</ref>

''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'', another DC Comics sword & sorcery title, began as a six-page backup feature in ''Warlord''. Another backup feature was ''The Barren Earth'' which was concluded in a four-issue limited series after a lengthy run in ''The Warlord''. A continuation of [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'' series, by [[Jim Starlin]], was featured as a backup for several issues (#37-39 and 42-47) as well.  ''[[Arak (comics)|Arak, Son of Thunder]]'', created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Ernie Col√≥n]], first appeared in a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] in ''Warlord'' #48 (August 1981).<ref>"''Arak, Son of Thunder'', described as an 'Indian/Viking,' makes his debut in a preview insert in ''Warlord'' #48, on sale in May." as noted in "Thomas's Indian/Viking to Roam Medieval Europe" Catron, Michael ''[[Amazing Heroes]]'' #1 June 1981 pp. 29-30</ref> A [[DC Comics Bonus Book|Bonus Book]] in issue #131 (September 1988) featured artist [[Rob Liefeld]]'s first work for DC.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/44933/ ''Warlord'' #131] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

=== Limited series ===
A six issue limited series ran from January to June 1992. It was written by [[Mike Grell]] and pencilled by Dameon Willich with inks by [[Rick Hoberg]] (#1-3) and Tim Burgard (#4-6).

=== Vol. 2 ===
DC attempted an unsuccessful update of Warlord in 2006 with [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] writing and [[Bart Sears]] providing the art. This series restarted the concept, and started with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue #9 finished on a cliffhanger, while issue #10 had a standalone story set sometime in the future. This series was canceled after ten issues due to low sales, and has been largely ignored throughout DC continuity. 

=== Vol. 3 ===
DC announced in July 2008 that Warlord would be returning as an [[ongoing series]] written by Mike Grell in time for the original series' 35th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080727-SDCCWarlordGRell.html |title=SDCC '08 - Mike Grell: The Return of Warlord |accessdate=2008-08-16 |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=2008-07-27 |publisher=[[Newsarama]]}}</ref> The series started in April 2009,<ref>Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 338 "Mike Grell was back at the helm for the return of DC's greatest sword-and-sorcery hero - Travis Morgan, the Warlord."</ref> featuring art by Joe Prado and Chad Hardin. It ended in August 2010 at issue #15.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Series===
{{quote box|align=left|width=300px|quote= In the savage world of Skartaris, life is a constant struggle for survival. Here, beneath an unblinking orb of eternal sunlight, one simple law prevails: If you let down your guard for an instant you will soon be very dead.|source=''1st Issue Special'' #8}}

[[Vietnam]] veteran [[SR-71]] pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the Earth's crust while flying over the north pole in 1969<ref>''Warlord'' (vol. 3) #10 (March 2010).</ref> and landed in the underground world of [[Skartaris]], a place strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Pellucidar]]. There Travis, wielding his .44 [[AutoMag (pistol)|AutoMag]] pistol and joined by Shamballah's Princess (later Queen) Tara, a scantily dressed savage, became the Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer [[Deimos (comics)|Deimos]] as well as various kings. He gained various sidekicks such as [[Machiste]], [[Shakira (comics)|Shakira]],<ref name=Warlord115>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher|Fleisher, Michael]] | Story = The Citadel of Fear | Title = Warlord | Volume = 1 | Issue = 115 | Date = March, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 5 | Panel = 2}}</ref> a Russian scientist named Mariah<ref name=Warlord115 /> and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer Morgan. In one story arc<ref>Burket, Cary, writer. "Hail to the Chief," ''The Warlord'' #84 (Aug. 1984).</ref> Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future.

Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to Oliver Queen ([[Green Arrow]]),<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 1) #28</ref> he is in reality based more upon his creator, Mike Grell, a former member of the Air Force.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Grell is caricatured in Warlord's first appearance, ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 and is clearly sporting Warlord's signature shaggy goatee.<ref>''Warlord'' (vol. 1) #35 (July 1980).</ref>

===Current status===
Volume 3 of the series begins with an explorer finding perfectly preserved [[dinosaur]] remains in the [[Himalayas]]. She takes the head of one to a doctor and an expedition is set up to retrieve more samples. The team is spotted by the Chinese government and flee into the caves after losing several members. They discover a portal and after walking through find themselves in [[Skartaris]]. Travis Morgan is attacked by a giant bird and kills it with the help of Shakira. Refugees enter Shamballah and Morgan discovers that a new god has taken over the Shadow Kingdom and has overrun the Kingdom of Kiro, [[Machiste]]'s homeland. One of the refugees is injured and he surprisingly carries a gunshot wound.<ref>''Warlord'' (vol. 3) #1 (June 2009)</ref>

Issue #12 of the series saw the death of Travis Morgan. The machinations of Deimos' return pit Travis Morgan against Tinder. Just as Morgan realizes that Tinder is in fact his son Joshua, he becomes distracted and Tinder mortally wounds him. Travis Morgan's final words were "I thought I'd have more time." Morgan is cremated and Tinder becomes the new Warlord.

Issue #13 marks Joshua Morgan, a.k.a. Tinder, as his official debut in the role of the Warlord. His costume is reminiscent of Travis Morgan's black outfit when he first arrived in Skartaris. Instead of carrying a sword and a gun as Travis did, Tinder carries a sword, a dagger, a quiver of arrows and a bow.

==Other versions==
===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Warlord is the pirate of a fleet when Warlord was attacked by pirate Deathstroke in battle stealing their loot. During the battle, Warlord's crew was killed while Warlord escaped using the hovercraft.<ref>''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager''#1 (June 2011)</ref> Later, Warlord plans to attack Deathstroke and retrieve Jenny Blitz who has been in stasis since she was stolen from him. Warlord ambushed Deathstroke and his fleet and demanded that they surrender. But in answer Deathstroke shot Warlord's right eye using a scoped sniper rifle.  He had been aiming for Warlord's mouth. Deathstroke fired once more at Warlord's ship only to have it unexpectedly blow up. Each ship in Warlord's fleet subsequently exploded. The ships had been destroyed by Jenny Blitz, now released from her stasis tube due to an earlier skirmish between Ocean Master and Icicle, one of Deathstroke's crewmen. Jenny appears to be able to project explosive force from her hands.<ref>''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>
