'''''The Warlord''''' was a [[sword and sorcery]] [[comic book]] published by [[DC Comics]] from [[1976]] - [[1989]]. It was created, written, and drawn by [[Mike Grell]]. The title ''The Warlord'' comes from the comic's main character, Travis Morgan, who obtains the name of The Warlord in the first few issues as he fights for the freedom of the people of '''Skartaris'''. DC attempted an unsuccessful update of Warlord in 2006 with [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] writing and [[Bart Sears]] providing the art. This series has been cancelled, and its final issue (#10) will be released in November 2006.

==History==
===Original Series===
[[Vietnam]] veteran [[SR-71]] pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the earth's crust while flying over the north pole and landed in the underground world of [[Skartaris]], a place strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Pellucidar]]. There Travis, wielding his military-issue .44 caliber pistol, became the Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer Deimos as well as various kings. He was later joined by scantily-dressed female barbarian Tara and gained various sidekicks such [[Machiste (comics)|Machiste]], [[Shakira (comics)|Shakira]], and his magic-wielding daughter [[Jennifer Morgan]]. In one story arc Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future (Issue 84).

Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to Oliver Queen ([[Green Arrow]]) (as pointed out in issue 28 of [[Green Arrow]]), he is in reality based more upon his creator, Mike Grell, a former member of the Air Force. Grell is caricatured in Warlord's first appearance, ''[[First Issue Special]]'' #8 (see also Warlord #35), and is clearly sporting the signature, shaggy goatee.

The book was DC's answer to [[Marvel Comics]]'s popular ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' title. ''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'' was another DC Comics sword & sorcery title, but was not a spinoff of Warlord. It began as a six-page supplement in the back of Warlord during its regular run. ''The Barren Earth'' was another series (with a more science-fiction [[Dune universe|Dune]] bent) that ran as a Warlord supplement, and after a lengthy run was concluded in a four issue limited series.

===Modern Series===
The new series did not take up where the old one left off but instead restarted the concept and started with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris. This reboot was not a success with comicbook readers and the series was cancelled after ten issues. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue nine finished on a cliff-hanger, while issue ten had a stand-alone story set sometime in the future.
