==Teaser==
In the savage world of Skartaris,<br> 
life is a constant struggle for survival. <br> 
Here, beneath an unblinking orb of eternal <br> 
sunlight, one simple law prevails: <br> 
''If you let down your guard for an instant you will soon be very dead.''

==Synopsis==
[[Vietnam]] veteran pilot Travis Morgan passes through a dimensional barrier to the underground world of Skartaris, in a move strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Pellucidar]]. There Travis became the Warlord and fought various evil sorcerers like Demos as well as kings. He was later joined by scantly-dressed female barbarian Tara and gained various sidekicks like Machiste and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer.

The book was DC's answer to [[Marvel Comics]]'s popular ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' title. ''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'' was another DC Comics sword & sorcery title, but was not a spinoff of Warlord.

In [[1992]], DC published a six-part mini-series, entitled ''Ballad''.

Some say that his looks resemble that of [[Green Arrow]].

==Other Media==
Warlord has appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' where [[Green Lantern]], [[Supergirl]], [[Star-Spangled Kid|Stargirl]], and [[Stripesy|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] stumbled onto Skartaris and teamed up with him to stop Deimos and his unlikely allies ([[Metallo]] and [[Silver Banshee (comics)|Silver Banshee]] of the [[Legion of Doom]]) from stealing a huge piece of [[kryptonite]] rock. He was voiced by [[Paul Guilfoyle]].
