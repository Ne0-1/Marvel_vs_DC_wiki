'''''The Warlord''''' is a [[sword and sorcery]] [[comic book]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The series and titular character debuted in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 (November [[1975 in comics|1975]]), and was created by [[Mike Grell]]. 

==Publication history==
The title ''The Warlord'' comes from the comic's main character, Travis Morgan, who obtains the name of The Warlord in the first few issues as he fights for the freedom of the people of ''[[Skartaris]]''. DC attempted an unsuccessful update of Warlord in 2006 with [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] writing and Bart Sears providing the art. This series was canceled due to low sales after only ten issues.

In March 2008, Grell stated that he was working on a proposal to DC for a new ''Warlord'' series<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=148802 |title=World Balloon: Mike Grell |accessdate=2008-06-06 |last=Brady |first=Matt |date=2008-03-03 |publisher=[[Newsarama]]}}</ref> and it was announced in July that Warlord would be returning as an [[ongoing series]] in time for the 35th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080727-SDCCWarlordGRell.html |title=SDCC '08 - Mike Grell: The Return of Warlord |accessdate=2008-08-16 |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=2008-07-27 |publisher=[[Newsarama]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Series===
{{quotebox|align=left|width=300px|quote= In the savage world of Skartaris, life is a constant struggle for survival. Here, beneath an unblinking orb of eternal sunlight, one simple law prevails: If you let down your guard for an instant you will soon be very dead.|source=1st Issue Special #8}}

[[Vietnam]] veteran [[SR-71]] pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the earth's crust while flying over the north pole and landed in the underground world of [[Skartaris]], a place strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Pellucidar]]. There Travis, wielding his .44 [[AutoMag (pistol)|AutoMag]] pistol and joined by scantily-dressed female barbarian Tara, became the Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer Deimos as well as various kings.  He gained various sidekicks such as [[Machiste (comics)|Machiste]], [[Shakira (comics)|Shakira]]<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher|Fleisher, Michael]] | Story = The Citadel of Fear | Title = Warlord | Volume = 1 | Issue = 115 | Date = March, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 5 | Panel = 2}}</ref>, a Russian scientist named Mariah<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher|Fleisher, Michael]] | Story = The Citadel of Fear | Title = Warlord | Volume = 1 | Issue = 115 | Date = March, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 6 | Panel = 2}}</ref> and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer Morgan. In one story arc Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future (Issue 84).

Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to Oliver Queen ([[Green Arrow]]) (as pointed out in issue 28 of [[Green Arrow]]), he is in reality based more upon his creator, Mike Grell, a former member of the Air Force. Grell is caricatured in Warlord's first appearance, ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 (see also ''Warlord'' #35), and is clearly sporting the signature shaggy goatee.

''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'', another DC Comics sword & sorcery title, began as a six-page backup feature in ''Warlord''. ''The Barren Earth'' was another backup feature, and after a lengthy run was concluded in a four-issue limited series.

==Other versions==
A new Warlord series was launched in 2006, it was produced by writer [[Bruce Jones]] and artist [[Bart Sears]]. This series did not take up where the old one left off but instead restarted the concept and started with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris. This reboot was canceled after 10 issues. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue nine finished on a cliff-hanger, while issue #10 had a standalone story set sometime in the future. This relaunch has been largely ignored throughout the DC continuity.
