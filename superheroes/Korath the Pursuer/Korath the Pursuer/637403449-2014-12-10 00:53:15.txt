==Powers and abilities==
Korath is a member of the alien Kree race, who was augmented by an unknown experimental cyber-genetic engineering process. He has superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. He also has the ability to psionically locate individuals by tracing their brain patterns. Like other Kree, Korath has the inability to breathe in Earth's atmosphere without a special apparatus or breathing serum.

Korath is an expert in cyber-genetic engineering. He is trained in the martial skills of the ancient Kree, and is a competent but relatively inexperienced armed and unarmed combatant.

Korath wears an armored battle-suit and helmet composed of unknown alien materials. He wields two 1Â½ foot beta-batons which generate electrical force capable of stunning opponents into unconsciousness on contact or disrupting functions of electrical devices. By adjusting the batons, Korath can stun beings as powerful as [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]] or even intangible beings. He is capable of flight via electrically powered turbines in his boots.
