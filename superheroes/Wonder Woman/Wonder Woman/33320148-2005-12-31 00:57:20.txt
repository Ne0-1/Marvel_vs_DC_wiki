'''Wonder Woman''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero|superheroine]]. Co-created by [[William Moulton Marston]] with his wife [[Elizabeth (Sadie) Holloway Marston]], ''Wonder Woman'' first appeared in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #8 (December, 1941).  She was one of the first female superheroes and is still arguably the most [[fame|famous]]. 

In most adaptations, Wonder Woman is Princess Diana of the [[Amazons|Amazon]] warrior tribe of [[Greek mythology]].  (Note that Diana is the Roman name for the Greek goddess on whom this character is based; Artemis is her Greek name.) The Amazon ambassador to the larger world, she possesses several superhuman abilities and gifts from the [[Greek Gods]], including the [[Lasso of Truth]], created from the [[Golden Girdle of Gaea]] and indestructable silver bracelets, formed from the [[Shield of Aegis]]. For several years she was described, in the [[splash page]] of each story, as being "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], swifter than [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and stronger than [[Hercules]]." She is also a member of the [[Justice League]].

Marston designed Wonder Woman as a distinctly [[feminism|feminist]] character and many subsequent writers, especially those of the 1980s and afterwards, have written her as such. 

Outside the [[comic book]] community, she is known for a popular, although often campy, [[Wonder Woman (television series)|television adaptation]] which starred [[Lynda Carter]] and aired from 1975 until 1979.  She has also been featured on the all-star [[animation|animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' in the 1970s and 80s and ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' in the 2000s.

==History==
===Her origin and her creator===
[[William Moulton Marston]] was an educational consultant in 1940 for Detective Comics, Inc. (now known as DC Comics).  Marston saw that the DC line was filled with images of super men such as [[Green Lantern]], [[Batman]], and their flagship character [[Superman]].  Seeing all these male heroes, Marston was left wondering why there was not a female hero.  

Thus inspired, Marston developed the character of ''Wonder Woman'' with his wife [[Elizabeth (Sadie) Holloway Marston]] who  served as the partial model for this unconventional and liberated woman.  The other inspiration was found in Olive Byrne, an equally unconventional individual, who lived with the couple in a  [[polygamy|polygamous]]/[[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship.

Marston then introduced the idea to [[Max Gaines]] (then head of DC Comics) who was intrigued by the concept and told Marston that he could create the female comic book hero&mdash;a ''Wonder Woman''.  Marston did that, using a [[pen name]] that combined his own middle name with the middle name of Gaines: Charles Moulton. 

Marston was also the creator of the systolic blood-pressure test, which led to the creation of the polygraph ([[lie detector]]).  From this work, Marston had been convinced that women were more honest and reliable than men, and could work faster and more accurately.  During his lifetime, Marston championed the causes of women of the day.

In a 1943 issue of ''[[The American Scholar]]'', Marston said: 
:"Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power.  Not wanting to be girls, they don't want to be tender, submissive, peace-loving as good women are.  Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness.  The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman."

===Early days===
[[Image:Wonderwoman1.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The first issue of ''Wonder Woman'', Summer 1942.  Art by [[H.G. Peter]].]]
In December 1941, Wonder Woman made her debut in ''All Star Comics'' #8. Following this exposure in the second largest selling comic in DC's line, she was featured in ''Sensation Comics'' #1 (January 1942), and six months later in her own self-titled book (Summer 1942), making her  the first super-heroine to have her own comic book.  Until his passing in 1947, Dr. Marston wrote all of Wonder Woman's appearances.  Artist [[H.G. Peter]] (previously best known for his [[Gibson Girl]] illustrations) drew the book, giving it a simplistic but identifiable "female" style that contrasted with other super-hero comic books of the day.

Armed with her bulletproof bracelets, [[magic (illusion)|magic]] [[lasso]], and her [[Amazons|Amazonian]] training, Wonder Woman was the archetype of the perfect woman from the mind of her creator, Dr. Marston.  She was beautiful, intelligent, strong, but still possessed a soft side.  At that time, her powers came from "Amazon concentration", not as a gift from the gods.

Wonder Woman's "magic lasso" was supposedly forged from the Magic Girdle of [[Aphrodite]], which [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] (Wonder Woman's mother) was bequeathed by the Goddess.  To make the lasso, the god [[Hephaestus]] had borrowed the Olympian belt, removed links from it, and forged the magic lasso from it.  It was unbreakable, infinitely stretchable, and could make all who are encircled obey the commands of the wielder, most notably to tell the truth.

In Wonder Woman's origin story, an intelligence officer in the [[United States Army]] named [[Steve Trevor]] crashed his plane on Paradise Island, the isolated homeland of the Amazons. He was nursed back to health with a "Purple Ray" by the Amazon princess Diana, who fell in love with him. When the goddess Aphrodite declared that it was time for an Amazon to travel to "Man's World" and fight the evil of the [[Nazis]], a tournament was held to determine who was to be the Amazon champion. Although she was forbidden by her mother, Queen Hippolyte, to participate in the tournament, Princess Diana did so nevertheless by using a mask. After winning the tournament and revealing her true identity, Queen Hippolyte relented and allowed her daughter to become Wonder Woman. Diana brought Steve Trevor back to the outside world, and she soon adopted the secret identity of nurse Diana Prince (by taking the place of her exact double by that name) in order to be close to him as he recovered from his injuries. After he recovered, Steve Trevor became Wonder Woman's crimefighting partner and romantic interest.

Wonder Woman was also aided by the Holiday Girls (led by the Rubenesque, sweets-addicted [[Etta Candy]]), who were a sorority that would help Wonder Woman in a time of emergency, or vice versa.  Based partly on comedian [[Hugh Herbert]], Etta was the only member of the Holliday Girls who stood out, with her distinctive figure and propensity for saying "Woo-woo" all the time, and was - after Steve Trevor and Diana herself - the most lasting character in the series.

[[Image:Bindme.jpg|right|thumb|For Wonder Woman, [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] is not just a crime-fighting technique.]]
Images of men putting women into [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] commonly appeared on the covers of ''Sensation Comics'' and ''Wonder Woman'' from 1942 to 1947.  In Wonder Woman issue #3, it is Wonder Woman herself who takes the dominant side, tying other women up, and, in one memorable scene, dressing them up in [[Fursuit|deer outfits]] and chasing them through the forest, only to tie them up later and display them on a platter.  This subtle, yet identifiable, sexual [[subtext]] to the book has been noted by comic book historians, who have debated whether it was an outlet for Dr. Marston's own sexual fantasies (recent biographies indicate that he was an avid practitioner of bondage); or whether it was meant (unconsciously or otherwise) to appeal to the developing sexuality of young readers.

During this same early period, Wonder Woman joined the [[Justice Society of America]] as its first female member.  The Justice Society was the first super-team, featured in ''All Star Comics,'' and times being what they were, Wonder Woman, despite being one of the most powerful members, was the group's secretary.

From her inception, Wonder Woman was not out to just stop criminals, but to reform them.  On a small island off Paradise Island was Transformation Island, a rehabilitation complex created by the Amazons to house and reform criminals.  A large concept in his concept of Wonder Woman was one of "loving submission", in which one would be kind to others and be willing to surrender to them out of [[agape]].  This has often being parodied as male criminals being so enamored with her beauty that they surrender to enjoy her company however briefly in some fashion.

===After Marston===
In 1947, William Moulton Marston died, leaving Wonder Woman to be written by [[Robert Kanigher]].  While H.G. Peter still illustrated the stories, Wonder Woman became less of a feminist and more of a traditional American heroine.  Peter remained on the title through #97, when the elderly artist was fired.  Peter died soon afterward.

In later stories, her abilities expanded.  Her earrings gave her air to breathe in outer space, her "invisible plane" (originally a propeller driven fighter that looked like either a P-40 Warhawk or P-51 Mustang, but soon upgraded to a jet aircraft, given that era's level of aviation technology level of progress) was given an origin, her tiara was found to be an unbreakable boomerang, and a two-way wrist radio like [[Dick Tracy]]'s was installed in one of her bracelets allowing her to communicate with Paradise Island.

===Dr. Wertham and the 1960s===
In 1954, Dr. [[Frederic Wertham]] wrote his controversial book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]],'' which expounded on his anti-comic book views, and is seen by many comic book historians as the death of the Golden Age.  Facing likely government censorship, the comic book industry established the [[Comics Code Authority]].  In the era of the Code, Wonder Woman no longer spoke out as a feminist, and was left to moon over Steve Trevor, and as time wore into the Silver Age, she also fell for Merman and Birdman.

Wonder Woman experienced many changes through the mid-1950s and throughout the 1960s.  Wonder Woman's origin was revamped, with her powers instead being derived from a combination of the Greek and Roman deities.

In the 1960s, regular scripter [[Robert Kanigher]] adapted gimmicks which had worked for [[Superman]] under the editorship of [[Mort Weisinger]].  As with [[Superboy]], Wonder Woman's "untold" career as the teenage [[Wonder Girl]] was chronicled.  Then followed Wonder Tot, in which the infant Amazon princess in her star-spangled jumper went on improbable adventures with a [[genie]] she'd rescued from an abandoned treasure chest.  The next step for Kanigher was to team all three ages of Wonder Woman in what were labeled "Impossible Tales," with her mother, Hippolyta joining in the adventures as "Wonder Queen."

Writer [[Bob Haney]] - apparently unaware that Wonder Girl was not a separate character - included her in his new team the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], consisting of sidekicks [[Nightwing|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Aqualad]], and, joining shortly thereafter, [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]].  Some years later, an origin was provided in which Wonder Girl was revealed to be Donna Troy, an orphan that Wonder Woman saved and given super powers by the Amazons' healing [[Purple Ray (comics)|Purple Ray]].

===The Diana Prince/I Ching Era===
[[Image:WonderWoman1970s.jpg|thumb|right|By the late 1960s, Wonder Woman had more in common with [[Emma Peel]] than superheroes.]]

At the end of the 1960s, Wonder Woman surrendered her powers to remain in "Man's World" (partly to assist Steve Trevor, who was facing criminal charges) rather than accompany her fellow Amazons into another dimension so they could "restore their magick."

Now a [[Mod (lifestyle)|mod]] boutique owner, the powerless Diana Prince soon came under the wing of a Chinese mentor known as I Ching.  Under I Ching's guidance, Diana was trained to use her body as a weapon, learning [[martial arts]] and weapons skills, and proceeded to undertake secret agent-style adventures.

The new format of the comic book was strongly influenced by the [[Emma Peel]] era of the then-popular British spy series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.  It also bore some similarities to the later TV series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', with Diana being an inexperienced student to I Ching's master. Diana Prince also resembled the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] [[Black Canary]], who ran a flower shop by day, fought crime by night, and had a detective boyfriend, while Diana Prince ran a boutique, fought crime, and had private detective allies in [[Tim Trench]] and [[Jonny Double]]. Soon after the "new" ''Wonder Woman'' began, the editors removed one-by-one her connections to the superhero world, most notably killing off Steve Trevor (though the character would later be revived).  One exception was a one-on-one confrontation with [[Catwoman]].

This period of the comic book has its supporters and its detractors.  Some critics welcomed the change from campy super-heroics to more serious, "topical" storytelling in the wake of the ''[[Batman]]'' TV series.  Others felt that the comic had abandoned its history.  Storylines included secret agent-style plots, as well as some occult tales.  One controversial cover showed Diana Prince brandishing a [[machine gun]] and firing at an airplane; contrary to the traditional depiction of Wonder Woman, the updated version of Diana Prince was not against killing in order to defend herself or others.

The revised series attracted some writers not normally associated with comic books, most notably science fiction author [[Samuel R. Delany]], who wrote two issues.

This storyline lasted for two years, with Wonder Woman finally being restored to her powers and costume in the early '70s.  Part of the credit for the revival of Wonder Woman as a superhero was due to a campaign in which feminist [[Gloria Steinem]] - who was offended to see the most famous female superhero depowered - had a hand.  The 1972 first issue of Steinem's ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' featured Wonder Woman in her 1940s costume on the cover, and contained an essay in appreciation of the character.  Ironically, the change in format was originally an acknowledgement of the [[Women's liberation]] movement.  The I Ching era, despite the controversy, would continue to resonate for some years to come, both in the comic book and in live action adaptations of ''Wonder Woman'' a few years later.  The 1974 [[Cathy Lee Crosby]] telefilm, and the second and third seasons of Lynda Carter's popular series (see below), would borrow heavily from the characterization of Diana Prince in the early 1970s.

Following the return of the "original" Wonder Woman to the comic books, a major two-year story arc consisted of the heroine's attempt to be readmitted to the [[Justice League of America]], the organization she quit after giving up her powers.  To prove her worthiness to rejoin the JLA, Wonder Woman voluntarily underwent 12 "trials" (analogous to the 12 labors of [[Heracles|Hercules]]), each of which was monitored in secret by a different member of the JLA.

Wonder Woman had barely won readmittance to the JLA when DC Comics ordered another format change.  The popularity of the ''Wonder Woman'' TV series, which was initially set during [[World War II]], resulted in DC setting the comic book in this era as well (this was made possible due to DC Comics' [[multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] concept, which established that the 1970s Wonder Woman and the 1940s original version lived on two separate, yet parallel, worlds: The 1970s version on [["Earth-One"]], and the 1940s version on "Earth-Two").  When the TV series later changed its setting to the 1970s, the comic book followed suit.

Wonder Woman fought a series of "epic" battles through the 1970s and 1980s, until the character was thought to have been slain during ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1986. But in reality, she had been thrown backwards through time, devolving back into the clay from which she had been formed. Thus setting the stage for her eventual re-vamping.

===Post-''Crisis''===
[[Image:Wwpereztpb.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover to ''Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals'' TPB. Art originally from the cover to ''Wonder Woman'' (v2) #1, by George Perez.]]

Post-''Crisis'', Wonder Woman was [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]]ed in 1987.  Writer [[Greg Potter]], who previously created the ''[[Jemm, Son of Saturn]]'' series for DC, was hired to rework the character.  He spent several months behind the scenes working with editor Janice Race on new concepts before being joined by writer/artist [[George Pérez]].  Potter dropped out of writing the series after issue #2, and Perez became the sole plotter with help from writer [[Len Wein]], who wrote the series' finished dialogue.

Comic book fans and critics consider Perez's 60-issue run one of the highlights of Wonder Woman's history.  Pérez and Potter gave her a pro-woman personality, and Perez's extensive research into [[Greek mythology]] gave more depth and verisimilitude to Wonder Woman's world than in her previous incarnation.

In her new incarnation, Wonder Woman was Diana, a princess and an emissary from Paradise Island (called Themyscira) to Patriarch's world (read: man's world).  She possessed incredibly stunning beauty, a gift from the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. From [[Athena]], she received the gift of wisdom; from [[Demeter]], the power and strength of the earth; from [[Hestia]], sisterhood with fire; and from [[Artemis]], a rapport with animals and the instincts and prowess of a hunter.  Finally, from the god [[Hermes]], she received the gift of speed and the power of flight. 

Wonder Woman did not keep her identity a secret, and she was not at first a "superheroine".  Indeed, her character was in many ways that of a babe in the woods, innocent and without guile.  Diana spoke only Themyscirian, a combination of classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. She had to learn [[English language|English]] when she arrived in [[United States|America]], rather than knowing the language intuitively.  Nonetheless, Diana was trained as a warrior and had no compunction against using deadly force when called for.  Through Pérez's tenure on the book, Diana dealt with war, injustice, inequality, death, and conflicts involving the Olympian Gods.

The supporting characters of the comic were altered as well.  For instance, [[Steve Trevor]] was changed into an [[Air Force]] officer considerably older than Diana's apparent age, thus sidestepping the traditional romance between the two.  Instead, Trevor became involved with Etta Candy, who herself became a mature military officer of good standing and a large, but realistic physique.  The Greek war god [[Ares]] and the Greek witch [[Circe]] eventually were written to become two of Diana's greatest enemies.  Diana's enemy list also included the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] who was a woman who could transform into a powerful and ferocious feline-humanoid creature.

After Pérez left the series, other writers and artists tried to follow in his footsteps, with varying degrees of success.  [[William Messner-Loebs]] wrote the character respectfully and the series sold well, but the artwork done by [[Mike Deodato]] portrayed the Amazon in skimpy outfits and sexualized poses, which drew criticism from feminists, and also portrayed all the Amazons as exclusively Caucasian,( with the exception of Phillipus),including the Amazon, Euboea, who was already established as being of Asian descent during Perez's run.. His most remembered contribution to the title though was the introduction of the red-headed Amazon [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], who eventually took over the title of Wonder Woman for a short time.  [[John Byrne]] later tried a "back to basics" approach with mixed reviews, including a period with Diana's mother [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] as Wonder Woman.  [[Phil Jimenez]] produced a run which was likened in some ways to Pérez's, particularly since Jimenez' art bears a striking resemblance to his.

Recently, the writing on the series was turned over to Greg Rucka, whose initial story arc involved a book Wonder Woman had written which caused controversy.  The initial arc was full of political subtexts, but more recent storylines have involved the mythology aspect.

===Infinite Crisis===
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:WW2192ndsmall.jpg|The second printing cover to ''Wonder Woman'' v2 #219. Art by J.O. Ladrönn. The first printing cover did not reveal the ending.|thumb|180px]]
Wonder Woman took a dark turn during 2005, particularly in the final portion of the four part "Sacrifice" storyline, one of the major lead-ins to ''[[Infinite Crisis]].'' Issue #219 of the current ''Wonder Woman'' title ("Sacrifice," Part 4) ended with Diana breaking the long-standing do-not-kill code of DC superheroes. While under the mind control of [[Maxwell Lord]], [[Superman]] brutally beat [[Batman]] and engaged in a vicious fight with Wonder Woman, thinking she was his enemy [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. During the fight with Superman, she realized that even if she could somehow beat Superman the problem would not be solved, because he'd still be under the absolute mental control of Max Lord. She created a diversion that lasted long enough for her to race back to Max Lord and demand he tell her how to free Superman of his control. Bound in her lasso of truth Max replied, "Kill me," and Wonder Woman snapped his neck. (See ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' for more about this storyline.)  

The ramifications of this action are expected to resonate in the future; her relationships with both Superman and Batman are seriously strained.  (The cover of #220 shows Wonder Woman being arrested by police; however, no such event actually occurs within the issue itself.  Wonder Woman voluntarily surrendered to the authorities in issue #222.)  The status of Wonder Woman amongst the other heroes and the public at large is uncertain; in the final pages of ''The OMAC Project'', the Brother Eye satellite (the deranged [[Artificial Intelligence]] controlling the [[OMACs]]) broadcast the footage of Wonder Woman murdering Maxwell Lord, preceded by the word MURDER, to media outlets all over the world.

This isn't the first time Wonder Woman has been shown "crossing the line".  In [[Mark Waid]]'s mini-series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'', Wonder Woman is also shown taking a life, albeit in battle and directly in order to save the life of another.  However, it should be noted that ''Kingdom Come'' takes place in an alternate reality's future, and is therefore not canonical.

[[Image:InfinteCrisisCv3Perez.PNG|Cover to ''Infinite Crisis'' #3, by George Perez.|thumb|180px|left]]
In Issue #221, Wonder Woman defended herself from several [[OMACs]] who attacked her in her own home.  Having repelled the assailants, she was delivering an injured boy to the hospital at the close of the issue and saw a broadcast of the damaging video on the waiting room's television.  She witnessed first-hand how people viewing the footage reacted with fear and revulsion; Brother Eye had managed to kill the faith the world had in her.  At the start of [[Infinite Crisis]], [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] distrust her: the latter can only see her as a coldblooded murderer, the former sees in her an expression of the mentality that led several members of the League to decide to mindwipe their villains.   (When he tried to stop the League from mindwiping [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] after the villain brutally raped [[Sue Dibny]], Batman's memory was also altered.)

To make matters worse, in Infinite Crisis #2 Brother Eye, acting out of vengeance for the murder of Lord, initiated the final protocol ''Truth and Justice'' which aims at the elimination of all Amazons.  A full-scale invasion of Themyscira is set into motion, utilizing every remaining OMAC. Diana and her countrywomen, now isolated and alienated from the outside world, are fighting for their lives.  In ''Infinite Crisis'' #3, the Amazons prepare to destroy the OMACs with a powerful new weapon.  However, Wonder Woman realizes that Brother Eye is watching and transmitting, and that unleashing such destructive violence would only exacerbate the effects of her killing of [[Maxwell Lord]].  After the weapon (the Purple Ray of Death) is used once, Wonder Woman convinces the Amazons to shut it down.  She then calls upon Athena, who transports Paradise Island and the Amazons remaining on it to another dimension.  However, Wonder Woman chooses not to join them, and is left to face the OMACs alone.

The current ''Wonder Woman'' series will be among several which will be cancelled at the conclusion of the ''Infinite Crisis'' storyline, specifically as part of the "One Year Later..." event focused around the upcoming weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.  The final issue will be #226, to be released in February 2006 with the relaunch of the series taking place the following month.

==Wonder Woman Parodies/Homage==
Wonder Woman has inspired the creation of several other comic book characters:
*[[Image Comics]] have two pastiches of Wonder Woman such as:
**'''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]''' is a [[Image Comics]] comic by [[Rob Liefeld]], featuring Gloriana Demeter, a half-[[Amazon]], half-[[Demon]] warrior.  In the normal world, she goes by the alias Gloria West.
**''[[Invincible (comic)|Invincible]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s '''War Woman''' 

*[[Wildcats (comics)|Wildcats]] member '''[[Zealot (comics)|Zealot]]''' a Kherubim and a Coda warrior, Zealot is the former Majestrix of the Coda and helped develop their virtues and practices.  She has lived for thousands of years and has had many relationships with both humans and aliens alike.  After failing to follow her own rules under the Coda, she left their clan and they have hunted her since.  Zealot has a close friendship with Grifter though she is equally devoted to her sister, Savant. 

*'''[[Promethea]]''' is a young girl whose father is killed by a Christian mob in Alexandria in 411 AD.  She is taken in hand by the twin gods Thoth and Hermes who tell her that if she goes with them into the Immateria - a plane of existence home to the imagination - she will no longer be just a little girl, but a story living eternally.
 
*'''[[Power Princess]]''' (real name Zarda) is a member of the superhero group, the [[Squadron Supreme]].  Her character was originally developed as a thinly disguised analog of DC Comics' Wonder Woman.  Accordingly, her origin was as a native of Utopia Island (equivalent to the Marvel Universe's [[Inhumans|Attilan]]), a peace ambassador and a WWII superhero.  Since the debut of Marvel's MAX title [[Supreme Power]], the character was rebooted. Zarda no longer bears the moniker Power Princess or acts like a superhero.  She has alluded to similar origins to [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].

==In other media==
In 1944-45 there was a short-lived Wonder Woman daily comic strip, written by "Charles Moulton" and drawn by H. G. Peter.
 
The first attempt to translate Wonder Woman to the small screen was in 1967, when the success of the ''[[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman]]'' television show led to a flurry of copycat series.  [[Greenway Productions]], the company behind the ''Batman'' show, produced a four-and-a-half-minute ''Wonder Woman'' test reel starring [[Ellie Wood Walker]] as Diana Prince, [[Linda Harrison]] as Diana's Wonder Woman alter ego and [[Maudie Prickett]] as her mother.  As with ''Batman'', the reel took a comic slant on the character.  This pilot episode was never broadcast.
[[Image:Linda carter.gif|left|thumb|150px|[[Lynda Carter]] in costume as Wonder Woman.]]
Wonder Woman's first broadcast appearance is as a guest in a [[Brady Kids]] cartoon in 1972, entitled "Beware of Gifts Bearing Greeks".  (Wonder Girl, either Diana's younger sister or a teenaged version of Diana herself depending on which comics continuity is to be believed, had already appeared on television in a series of ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' cartoon shorts, part of the ''[[Batman]]/[[Superman]] Hour'' cartoon show.)  This was quickly followed by the heroine's inclusion in the long running ''[[Superfriends]]'' cartoon series.

Her second live-action outing was a [[TV movie]] made in 1974, starring [[Cathy Lee Crosby]] as a blonde non-superpowered Amazon.  This version owed little to the Wonder Woman comic book character current at the time of screening, being closer indeed to the "I Ching period" abandoned by the comic book some years before.
[[Image:PdPH2CC0001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Cathy Lee Crosby in the first Wonder Woman film.]]

Though not successful at the first attempt, network interest was such that within a year another pilot was in production.  Scripting duties were given to [[Stanley Ralph Ross]], who'd worked on the original pilot reel, but this time he was instructed to be more faithful to the comic book and create a subtle "high comedy".  The new [[TV series]] ran from (1976-1979), and starred [[Lynda Carter]] as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince and [[Lyle Waggoner]] as Steve Trevor, and is probably the best known version of the character. See [[Wonder Woman (television series)|''Wonder Woman'' (television series)]] for details.

Wonder Woman was also a team character in the various incarnations of the ''Super Friends'' [[animated series]] that aired on Saturday mornings throughout the 1970s and 1980s. This incarnation is voiced by [[Shannon Farnon]], and later by [[B.J. Ward]].

Animation TV series '''Justice League Unlimited''', 2004.]]The animated ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' series on the [[Cartoon Network]] in the 2000s was the first chance to add Wonder Woman (voiced here by [[Susan Eisenberg]]) to the [[DCAU]], her rights having been previously tied up in possible movies and television shows. To introduce her anew into a landscape already populated by famed and experienced heroes like Batman and Superman, [[Bruce Timm]] and his team decided to take a cue from the George Pérez newcomer-to-Man's-world interpretation. This Diana started off with complete innocence of Man's world, coupled with a certain adherance to Amazonian dogma and class structure (causing her teammates to react to her attitude by calling her "Princess" somewhat disdainfully). Also like the Pérez version, she does not keep a secret identity, and so she quickly becomes an international celebrity for her heroism (as seen in ''Maid of Honor''). Seemingly unique to this incarnation, though, is the noticable effect of Man's World on Diana. Her first appearances are marked by her constantly acting off of Amazonian beliefs and ideas (in ''Fury'', she questions how necessary men really are), but as time passes, she becomes more interested in men - in particular, Batman, with whom she has a consistently flirtatious relationship (a source of controversy among fans) - and also experiences the emotional excesses of Man's world, as compared to the Amazons (who are portrayed as emotionally stunted and stiff). She finds joy, but she also begins to develop a massive temper that on multiple occasions needs to be derailed by her teammates (''Hereafter'', ''Hawk and Dove'', ''Eclipsed'', and many more). After recent episodes that have dealt directly with her temper, Diana seems to be keeping it relatively in check and has adopted the role of ambassador of the Amazons (on the request of her mother) as first seen in ''To Another Shore'', making for another comic-borne trait that the DCAU Wonder Woman has taken to heart.

During the 1990s, there were many rumors of a possible Wonder Woman feature film at that time, but nothing came of it.  There are many who feel [[Lynda Carter]]'s portrayal has made it impossible for anyone suitable to be found to inherit the role (much as studios until recently had spent several years without success searching for a new actor to succeed [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Superman]]).

In 2005, a new [[Wonder Woman (film)|Wonder Woman film]] was announced with [[Joss Whedon]], who has considerable experience with female action heroes with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', writing and directing. Whedon has been quoted as saying his interpretation of the hero will not wear "star-spangled panties", raising concern that he may be planning to redesign the character in some way [http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/1779.asp], but he has also said that he will not do anything 'silly' with the character. [http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1498869/03222005/story.jhtml] The film is scheduled for release in 2007.

Wonder Woman also appeared in the ''[[Justice League Task Force]]'' [[Super Nintendo]] fighting game, as well as in a couple of Game Boy Advance games based on the ''Justice League'' TV show.

Recently, the Wonder Woman persona has been referenced in [[The OC]] where [[Summer Roberts]] (played by [[Rachel Bilson]]) dresses up as ''Wonder Woman'' in an attempt to win over [[Seth Cohen]] (who has an obsession over comics books, and is played by [[Adam Brody]]).

Sociologist Susan Hopkins in her text ''[[Girl Heroes]]'', juxtaposes the image of [[Lynda Carter]] as Wonder Woman with [[Girl Power]] action heroines of the late 1990s.

==Notes==
* According to DC comics official statistics, Wonder Woman stands 5 ft 11 in and weighs 140 lbs. 

* The prospect of Wonder Woman and [[Superman]] as a possible romantic couple has long been a question posed by fans, with the two characters occasionally being depicted as having a mutual on again/off again attraction to each other, perhaps because they view each other as male/female reflections of themselves. During the [[John Byrne]] era of Superman, the Man of Steel had intense dreams and fantasies about Wonder Woman, which he suspected might have been his subconcious telling him Wonder Woman was his most likely chance for a potential romantic partner. The idea of Wonder Woman and [[Aquaman]] as a couple has also been proposed, in part because of their frequent team pairings in the ''Super Friends'' cartoons, and also because it would be an allusion to Wonder Woman's Silver Age romance with Manno the Mer-Man. In the alternate future seen in ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' Superman and Wonder Woman became a couple and are expecting a child together.

* Wonder Woman's exact strength range has never been precisely determined, but it appears to be between the strength levels of Superman and [[Captain Marvel]].
