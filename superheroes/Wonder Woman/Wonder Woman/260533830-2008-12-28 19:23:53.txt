'''Wonder Woman''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[Superhero#Superheroines|superheroine]] created by [[William Moulton Marston]]. First appearing in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #8 (December 1941), she is one of three characters to have been continuously published by DC Comics since the company's 1944 inception (except for a brief hiatus in 1984).<ref>Hendrix, Grady. "Out for Justice". ''The New York Sun'' December 11, 2007</ref> 

Wonder Woman is a member of a fictional, all-female tribe of [[Amazons (comics)|Amazons]] (based on the [[Amazons]] of [[Greek mythology]]) who is sent to "man's world" as an ambassador. Among the Amazons she is known as Princess Diana (being the daughter of Amazon queen [[Hippolyta]]); in "man's world" she takes the secret identity of '''[[Diana Prince]]'''. Her powers include super strength, hand-to-hand combat ability, and sometimes (during the 1980s and 1990s) flight. She also makes use of her [[Lasso of Truth]] (which forces those bound by it to tell the truth), a pair of [[Wonder Woman's bracelets|bullet-deflecting bracelets]], and an [[invisible plane]].

Created during [[World War II]], the character was initially depicted fighting the [[Axis powers|Axis military forces]], as well as an assortment of [[supervillain]]s and [[supervillainess]]es. In later decades, some writers and their editors preferred to retain the World War II setting, while others updated the series to reflect an ongoing "present day." Wonder Woman has also regularly appeared in the team books ''[[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]]'' (from 1941) and ''[[Justice League]]'' (from 1960). Arguably the most popular and iconic superheroine in comics, she is informally grouped with [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] as one of a "Trinity" of DC characters who are regarded as especially important, both within their fictional universe and without. She was named the twentieth greatest comic book character by ''[[Empire Magazine]]''.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=20 ''Empire'' | The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In addition to comics, the character has appeared in other media &mdash; most notably the 1975-1979 [[live-action]] [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|''Wonder Woman'' TV series]] starring [[Lynda Carter]], but also in [[animation|cartoons]] such as the ''[[Super Friends]]'' and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''. Although a number of attempts have been made to adapt the character to live-action film, none have yet emerged from "[[development hell]]." An [[Wonder Woman (film)|animated film]] will be released in 2009, starring [[Keri Russell]] in the title role.

==History==
[[Image:SensationComics.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wonder Woman's first cover, ''Sensation Comics'' #1 (January 1942)]]
===Creation===

In an October 25, 1940 [[interview]] conducted by former student Olive Byrne (under the pseudonym "Olive Richard") and published in ''[[Family Circle]]'', titled "Don't Laugh at the Comics", [[William Moulton Marston]] described what he saw as the great educational potential of comic books (a follow up article was published two years later in 1942).<ref>Richard, Olive. ''[http://www.wonderwoman-online.com/articles/fc-marston.html Our Women Are Our Future].''</ref> This article caught the attention of comics publisher [[Max Gaines]], who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodicals and [[All-American Publications]], two of the companies that would merge to form the future [[DC Comics]]. At that time, Marston decided to develop a new superhero. 

In the early 1940s the DC line was dominated by superpowered male characters such as the [[Green Lantern]], [[Batman]], and its flagship character, [[Superman]]. According to the Fall 2001 issue of the [[Boston University]] alumni magazine, it was his wife [[Elizabeth Holloway Marston|Elizabeth]]'s idea to create a female superhero: 

{{Cquote|William Moulton Marston, a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph (forerunner to the magic lasso), struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero, one who would triumph not with fists or firepower, but with love. "Fine," said Elizabeth. "But make her a woman."<ref name="Bostonia">Lamb, Marguerite. (Fall 2001) [http://web.archive.org/web/20071208045132/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ "Who Was Wonder Woman?" ''Bostonia''.] Retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]] on December 8, 2007.</ref>}}

Marston introduced the idea to [[Max Gaines]], cofounder (along with Jack Liebowitz) of [[All-American Publications]] (Marston's  [[pseudonym]], Charles Moulton, combined his own and Gaines' middle names). Given the go-ahead, Marston developed ''Wonder Woman'' with Elizabeth (whom Marston believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman).<ref name="Bostonia"/> Marston was also inspired by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a [[polygamy|polygamous]]/[[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship.<ref>Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History'', (DC Comics, 2000), pp. 28-30.</ref> Both women served as exemplars for the character and greatly influenced the character's creation.<ref name="Bostonia"/>  

Marston was the creator of a systolic blood-pressure measuring apparatus, which was crucial to the development of the polygraph ([[polygraph|lie detector]]). Marston's experience with polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest and reliable than men, and could work more efficiently.<ref>Bunn, Geoffrey C. "The lie detector, ''Wonder Woman'', and liberty: the life and work of William Moulton Marston," ''History of the Human Sciences'' Vol. 10, No. 1 (1997): 91-119.</ref>  

"Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should, I believe, rule the world,"  Marston wrote.<ref>Hendrix, Grady. "Out for Justice". ''The New York Sun'' [[December 11]], [[2007]]</ref>  Although [[Gloria Steinem]] placed Wonder Woman on the first standalone cover of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' in 1972, Marston, writing in an earlier time, designed Wonder Woman to represent a particular form of female empowerment.  [[Feminism]] argues that women are equal to men and should be treated as such; Marston's representative of femininity is a 6-foot-tall Amazon wielding a golden lasso that forces obedience of those encircled. In Marston's mind, women not only held the potential to be as good as men: they could be superior to men.

In a 1943 issue of ''[[The American Scholar]]'', Marston wrote:
{{Cquote|Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power. Not wanting to be girls, they don't want to be tender, submissive, peace-loving as good women are. Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.}}

During this period, Wonder Woman joined the [[Justice Society of America]] <ref>''All Star Comics'' #12</ref> as the first female member; albeit as the group's secretary (the custom was for characters with their own books to hold honorary membership only).

===Evolution of the character===
{{Main|Publication history of Wonder Woman}}

Initially, Wonder Woman is an Amazon champion who wins the right to return [[Steve Trevor]] &mdash; a [[United States]] intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons' isolated island homeland &mdash; to "Man's World," and fight the evil of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and other crime.

During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Wonder Woman's origin was revamped,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #98</ref> along with other characters during the era.  The new origin story <ref>''Wonder Woman'' #105</ref>, increased the character's [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenic]] roots, receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], stronger than [[Hercules]], and swifter than [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]."

At the end of the 1960s, under the guidance of [[Mike Sekowsky]], Wonder Woman surrenders her powers to remain in Man's World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension. A [[Mod (lifestyle)|mod]] boutique owner, the powerless [[Diana Prince]] acquires a Chinese mentor named [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]]. Under I Ching's guidance, Diana learns [[martial arts]] and weapons skills, and engages in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology.

The character would later return to her superpowered roots and the [[World War II]]-era, (due to the popularity of the ''Wonder Woman'' TV series), in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' and the eponymous title, respectively.

Following the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' series, [[George Pérez]] and Greg Potter relaunched the character and wrote Wonder Woman as an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira]] to Patriarch's world. The four part "Sacrifice" storyline leading into the 2005 series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' ends with Diana breaking the longstanding do-not-kill code.

Diana's relationship with her mother, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], continues to evolve. The two were close when the series was relaunched in the 80's, but the relationship became strained when Diana found her mother had used magic to make Artemis the new Wonder Woman so she would die in Diana's place. The two would reunite after a long period of time only for Hippolyta to die during the Worlds at War storyline. She was brought back to life by Circe, but her actions during the Amazons Attack storyline would see her exiled to Themyscira and the Amazons stripped of their history by the Gods. Diana and her mother are on speaking terms once again. She has recently brought home [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Thomas Tressor]], better known as Nemesis, to meet Hippolyta. During this meeting it is revealed that Hippolyta has agreed with Diana's choice of a mate and made him a member of the Amazons. Her final comments before the couple leave the island is she hopes for Diana and Thomas to have many children as quickly as possible. <ref> Wonder Woman - Volume 3 Issue 24 - November 2008 by Gail Simone and Bernard Chang </ref>

==Powers and abilities==
<!-- Contains contested point -->
===Pre-Crisis===
Originally, Wonder Woman owed her abilities to the goddess Aphrodite creating Amazons superior to men, with Diana being the best of their best.

The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Wonder Woman was later updated by Marston to be able to will a tremendous amount of brain energy into her muscles and limbs by Amazon training, which endowed her with extraordinary strength and agility (''Sensation Comics'' #46, Oct. 1945); this was later reconfirmed by writer Robert Kanigher in the Silver Age (''Wonder Woman'' v1 #160, Feb. 1966). The [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|TV series]] show took up this notion; "...&nbsp; we are able to develop our minds and physical skills ..." ["Fausta: The Nazi Wonder Woman" 1976]; and in the first episode of ''[[Super Friends]]'' [1973] Diana states to Aquaman "...&nbsp; the only thing that can surpass super strength is the power of the brain". In early ''Wonder Woman'' stories,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 1, #1, #98 to 329 (1942 - 1986)</ref> Amazon training involves strengthening this ability using pure mental energy. Her powers would be removed in accordance with "Aphrodite's Law" if she allowed herself to be bound or chained by a male.<ref>[http://www.superdickery.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=559:more-crap-about-aphrodites-law&catid=34:suffering-sappho-index&Itemid=39 Panel featuring Aphrodite's Law - SuperDickery.com] Retrieved September 3, 2008.</ref>

With the inclusion of [[Wonder Girl]] and '''Wonder Tot''' in Diana's [[back-story]], writers provided new explanations of her powers; the character became capable of feats which her sister Amazons could not equal. ''Wonder Woman'' Volume One #105,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 1, #105 (1942 - 1986)</ref> reveals that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons and was imbued with the attributes of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[god]]s by Athena - "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], swifter than [[Hermes]], and stronger than [[Hercules]]."<ref>Hendrix, Grady. "Out for Justice." ''The New York Sun'' [[December 11]], [[2007]]</ref> Wonder Woman's Amazon training also gave her limited telepathy, profound scientific knowledge, and the ability to speak every language known to man. 

Although Wonder Woman’s mythos was returned to its original interpretation between 1966 and 1967, new abilities were added: super breath (to blow jet streams or transform water into snow); ventriloquism; imperviousness to extremes of heat and cold; ride the air currents as if flying; mental telepathy (even to project images); microscopic vision; the ability to vibrate into another dimension, and others which are listed in the ''Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes,'' Volume Two (1976).<ref> Michael L. Fleisher,'' The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes'', Volume 2, ''Wonder Woman'', (DC Comics, 2007; orig. pub. 1976)</ref>

Depending on the writer, Diana's invulnerability and power varied greatly with the story needs.

===Post-Crisis===
{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}
[[Image:Ww-sleep power.png|thumb|After a brief interrogation, Diana places the head of To-Choi Industries in a state of slumber.]]

Wonder Woman's body is a mystical creation made from the clay surrounding Themyscira. Through divine means, her disembodied soul was nurtured in and retrieved from the womb of the High Matriarch and sole progenitor of all Gods, Gaea. Once the soul was placed into the body it immediately came to life, and was blessed with metahuman abilities by six Olympian deities.

Demeter, the Goddess of agriculture and fertility, blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit Gaea, making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DCU. She has been observed assisting in preventing large chunks of the [[Moon]] from crashing onto the Earth,<ref>Titans/JLA: The Technis Imperative</ref> catching cavernous-sized asteroids,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} supporting the weight of bridges,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} hefting entire railroad trains,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} subway trains,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} ships and aircrafts.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

While not invulnerable, her body is considerably denser than most, providing her with the sufficient stamina to survive unprotected in harsh and extreme environments, although sufficient force focused to a small enough surface area, is able to penetrate her skin. This includes arrows and conventional firearms. 

Through her link to Gaea, Diana has a rapid healing ability, and has recovered quickly from explosions,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Zeus’s thunderbolts,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} and punches from a [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]-clone.

Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty, blessed Diana with great beauty and a loving heart.

Pallas Athena, the Goddess of wisdom and war, granted Diana great wisdom, intelligence and military prowess. It is Athena’s gift that has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages (including those of alien or animal origin), multiple complex crafts, sciences and philosophies, as well as her amazon legacy of over 3000 years of leadership, military strategy, and armed and unarmed combat. While not as skilled a warrior as certain other amazons, such as [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] or [[Nu'Bia]], Diana's combination of power and prowess makes her the greatest fighter of her race. More recently Athena bound her own eyesight to Diana's, granting her increased empathy, the ability to see in any environment, and sense others' emotions.

Artemis, Goddess of the hunt, animals and the Moon, graced Diana with the Eye of the Hunter and Unity with Beasts. The Eye of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses. Unity with Beasts grants her low level telepathy allowing her to communicate with all sorts of animal life, such as sharks, birds and dinosaurs, as well as bring them to an absolute calm.

Hestia, Goddess of the hearth, granted Diana Sisterhood with Fire. This power makes it almost impossible to lie to her. By using this gift, Diana can see through mirages, illusions and other forms of deception (such as shape shifting), and is highly resistant to telepathic attacks.

Hermes, the messenger God of speed, granted Diana superhuman speed, and the ability to fly. Through the an act of concentration, Diana can mystically defy the laws of gravity and propel herself through the air to achieve flight. Diana has been clocked moving at “invisible” or hypersonic speed (Mach 7 or above) both in the air and on the ground.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Additionally, she has outraced the Roman God of speed Mercury. She is swift enough to deflect bullets, lasers and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets.

In extreme situations, through prayer and meditation, Diana can channel power from the Godwave.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} However, she can only perform this act for a short time, as holding on to the power for longer periods would drive her insane.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Through prayer and meditation, Diana has been known to morph herself into the Earth and travel within it to escape imprisonment,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} alter her appearance and personality,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} and send her astral self to mystical planes.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} On certain occasions she has even brought her physical form into other realms.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Diana also received the gift of illusion from the God Proteus. By using this ability Diana was able to transform an ordinary piece of paper into a legal passport complete with full history and background of her alias.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} While time-travelling, Diana also altered her appearance to resemble Miss America, a native hero of the era.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Abilities:

Diana is an above Olympic-level athlete and acrobat. The “daughter” of more than 4000 warriors, Diana has been trained since infancy in the 3000 year old Amazon legacy of armed and unarmed combat. She is an accomplished military strategist.

Beyond her distinctive golden lasso, Diana has shown proficiency in the use of swords,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} archery,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} battleaxe,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} quarterstaff,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} bo staff,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} dagger,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} spear,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} nunchuku,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} throwing star,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} sai,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} tonfa,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} kama,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} escrima stick,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} baton,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} boomerang,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} shield,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} and has mastered Iaido.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Diana is an expert hand-to-hand combatant, having trained in various forms of unarmed fighting, including Shaolin,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Wing Chun,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Pa Kua,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Hsing-i,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} and Tai Chi Kung Fu styles,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Aikido,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Judo,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Jujitsu,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Ninpo,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Ninjutsu,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Taekwondo,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Hapkido,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Karate,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Capoeira,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Boxing,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Wrestling,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Kickboxing,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} and more archaic forms of combat practiced by the Amazons.

===Weapons===
{{See also|Lasso of Truth}}
Diana has an arsenal of powerful God-forged weapons at her disposal but her signature weapons are her indestructible Vambraces of the Aegis and the [[Lasso of Truth]].

The Vambraces, sometimes called bracelets, were formed from the remnants of [[Zeus]]' legendary [[Aegis]] shield at the request of Athena to be awarded to her champion. These forearm guards have thus far proved indestructible, and can absorb the impact of incoming attacks, such as deflecting [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]]s or energy blasts.<ref name="dc-ency-aw">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Wonder Woman's Magical Weapons | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 93  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> When Diana crosses them they provide her added protection by creating an invisible force field around her person.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Diana can also slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force, at one time used to stop a [[tidal wave]].{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

The Lasso of Truth, or Lariat of Hestia, is virtually unbreakable, even successfully restraining Superman,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Captain Marvel,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} and the Gods Ares and Hades.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} The Lasso burns with a magical aura called the Fires of Hestia, forcing anyone within the Lasso's confines to be truthful. The Fires can restore lost memories,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} dispel illusions,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} renew the wielder's body,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} protect those encircled by it from magical and nonmagical attacks,{{Fact|date=December 2008}} and even cure insanity.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Diana wields it with great precision and accuracy, and can use it as a whip, noose, or make it as sharp as a blade.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Wonder Woman's golden tiara has also doubled as a dagger and a throwing weapon. It was crafted from Apollo's discus, which returned to him whenever thrown, like a boomerang.

Diana used the Sandals of Hermes to cross the dimensional impasse between Themyscira and the outside world, but they were passed on first to Artemis, and later to Wonder Girl.

Diana also possesses the Gauntlets of Atlas, which magnifies the physical strength and stamina of the wearer by a factor of ten.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

The Golden Age and Silver Age Wonder Woman used an invisible airplane that could be controlled by mental commands. It was variously described as being either a creation of Amazon technology , alternately the legendary winged horse [[Pegasus]] transformed into an aircraft. Its appearance varied as well, originally having a [[propeller]] and later being drawn as a jet aircraft, resembling a fighter plane.

The Post-Crisis Wonder Woman has at her disposal a small lightweight disc of alien (Lansinar) technology that, when triggered by her thoughts, transforms into a transparent version of whatever object or vehicle that is appropriate for her needs. However, following the [[One Year Later]] continuity jump, Diana was given a new invisible plane, created by [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne Industries]], because her original Invisible Plane was stuck on Themyscira.

Diana occasionally uses additional weaponry in formal battle, such as ceremonial golden armor complete with golden wings, war-skirt and chest-plate, and a golden helmet in the shape of an Eagle's head. In the alternate [[Kingdom Come]] continuity, her deadliest piece of battle-gear is a magically forged sword, "The Sword of Hephaestus". Diana here described it as able to "carve the [[electron]]s off an [[atom]]."<ref>Kingdom Come Collection</ref>

After being handed the role of script-writer for close to two years though, Whedon still had not managed to write an actual script. "It was in an outline, and not in a draft, and they [studio executives] didn't like it. So I never got to write a draft where I got to work out exactly what I wanted to do."<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/joss_whedon AV Club Interview: Joss Whedon]</ref> In February 2007, Whedon departed from the project, citing script differences with the studio.<ref name="whedon">{{cite news | author=Joss Whedon | url=http://whedonesque.com/comments/12385 | title=Satin Tights No Longer. | publisher=Whedonesque | date=[[2007-02-02]] | accessdate=2007-02-03 }}</ref> Whedon reiterated: "I never had an actress picked out, or even a consistent front-runner. I didn't have time to waste on casting when I was so busy air-balling on the script."  Whedon stated that with the ''Wonder Woman'' project left behind, he would focus on making his film ''Goners''.<ref name="whedon" />

</blockquote>

A day before Whedon's departure from ''Wonder Woman'', Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures purchased a [[spec script]] written by Matthew Jennison and Brent Strickland. Set during World War II, the script impressed executives at Silver Pictures.<ref>{{cite news | author=Tatiana Siegel | coauthors=Borys Kit | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ifa3342614f951b4fc18bab50889c94af | title=Another 'Wonder Woman' for WB | publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' | date=[[2007-02-01]] | accessdate=2007-02-02 }}</ref> However, Silver has made clear that he purchased the script because he didn't want it floating around in the industry; although it has good ideas, he doesn't wish for the ''Wonder Woman'' film to be a [[period piece]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Ryan Rotten, Edward Douglas|title=Joel Silver's ''Wonder Woman'' Update|publisher=SuperHeroHype.com|date=[[2007-03-25]]|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5391|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> By April 2008, Silver hired Jennison and Strickland to write a new (modern day) script that would not depict Wonder Woman's origin, but explore Paradise Island's history.<ref>{{cite news | author = Stephanie Sanchez | title = ''Wonder Woman'' Still in Development says Joel Silver | publisher = IESB | date = [[2008-04-18]] | url = http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4742&Itemid=99 | accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

According to an August 2008 article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', featuring [[Warner Bros.]] president Jeff Robinov speaking about their DC property films, a Wonder Woman film is among other superhero films currently in "active development."<ref>Schuker, Lauren A.

====''Justice League'' film====
A ''[[Justice League#Film|Justice League]]'' film was slated for a 2009 release, before being put on indefinite hiatus in April 2008. It was based upon the [[DC Comics]] publication, the ''[[Justice League]]'' which has included a number of [[superhero]]es in the past including [[Superman]], [[Batman]], Wonder Woman, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Aquaman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Hawkman]], [[Black Canary]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>[http://imdb.com/title/tt0974015/ IMDB: Justice League of America]</ref> An [[October 29]], [[2007]] article quoted Joel Silver as stating that due to the impending release of ''Justice League'', the ''Wonder Woman'' film will be placed on moratorium:

:'They're going to make the Justice League movie, and we're kind of pausing on Wonder Woman now [...] Let them go ahead and do that picture [first]' [...] The Amazon superhero from the DC Comics series will be a major part of the upcoming JLA. 'And if that comes together, Wonder Woman will be a part of that story,' Silver said. 'And then we'll see where we go from there. But we struggled with it for a while. I hope that we can solve it and make it one day.'<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=45012 SciFi Wire, 10/29/07]</ref> 

A number of actresses had reportedly been under consideration for the role of Wonder Woman in the ''Justice League'' film. [[Jessica Biel]] was approached for the role, but passed on it,<ref>{{cite news | author = Nicole Sperling | url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2007/09/biel-passes-on-.html| title=Biel Passes on Wonder Woman role | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date = [[2007-09-27]] | accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref> while [[Missy Peregrym]],<ref>{{cite web | author = Mel Caylo | title = Missy Peregrym wants to play Wonder Woman | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] | date = [[2007-07-29]] | url = http://www.wizarduniverse.com/movies/wonderwoman/005417307.cfm | accessdate=2007-12-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref> [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Shannyn Sossamon]], and [[Christina Milian]]<ref>{{cite news | author = Shawn Adler | title = Mary Elizabeth Winstead Envisions Bulking Up For Wonder Woman | publisher = [[MTV]] | date = [[2007-10-26]] | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/10/26/mary-elizabeth-winstead-envisions-bulking-up-for-wonder-woman/ | accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref> expressed interest.

In an article in ''The Wall Street Journal'', [[Warner Bros.]] president Jeff Robinov said that they are interested in doing a Justice League film, but confirmed that the project that had been in development had been shelved. They are currently focusing on solo films for their DC properties.
