Wonder Woman's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] and was given a life to live as an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]], along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In recent years, DC changed her background with the [[retcon]] that she is the daughter of [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe. The character has changed in depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist [[George Perez]] gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Beedle |first=Tim |url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/12/26/ten-moments-that-mattered-wonder-woman-becomes-war |title=Ten Moments that Mattered: Wonder Woman Becomes War &#124; DC |website=Dccomics.com |date=December 25, 2013 |access-date=December 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108134755/http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/12/26/ten-moments-that-mattered-wonder-woman-becomes-war |archive-date=November 8, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |url=http://www.newsarama.com/18787-wonder-woman-kills-who-is-the-new-god-of-what-azzarello-explains-spoilers.html |title=WONDER WOMAN Kills...Who?

Wonder Woman's character was created during World War II; the character in the story was initially depicted fighting Axis military forces as well as an assortment of colorful [[supervillain]]s, although over time her stories came to place greater emphasis on characters, deities, and monsters from Greek mythology. Many stories depicted Wonder Woman rescuing herself from bondage, which defeated the "damsels in distress" trope that was common in comics during the 1940s.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://superdames.org/image/143332720966 |title = Superdames!: Photo}}</ref><ref>https://78.media.tumblr.com/f602627a65096985c1f0ef8fcb9766c9/tumblr_inline_o8cqw88EpY1rrbhi0_500.png</ref> In the decades since her debut, Wonder Woman has gained a cast of enemies bent on eliminating the Amazon, including classic villains such as [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], [[Cheetah (character)|Cheetah]], [[Doctor Poison]], [[Circe (character)|Circe]], [[Doctor Psycho]], and [[Giganta]], along with more recent adversaries such as [[Veronica Cale]] and the [[First Born (comics)|First Born]].

===1900s===
Modern historians divide the 20th-century history of American superhero comics into "ages," [[Golden Age of Comics|The Golden Age]] being the first.

====Creation====
In an October 25, 1940, interview with the ''Family Circle'' magazine, [[William Moulton Marston]] discussed the unfulfilled potential of the comic book medium.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=Charles|title=Suffering Sappho!

{{quote|William Moulton Marston, a psychologist already famous for inventing the [[polygraph]], struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero, one who would triumph not with fists or firepower, but with love. "Fine," said Elizabeth. "But make her a woman."}}

Marston introduced the idea to Gaines. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed ''Wonder Woman'', whom he believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman. Marston also drew inspiration from the bracelets worn by [[Olive Byrne]], who lived with the couple in a [[polyamorous]] relationship.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Les | last=Daniels | title=Wonder Woman: The Complete History | publisher=Chronicle Books | date=April 6, 2004 | pages=28–30 | isbn=978-0-8118-4233-4}}</ref> Wonder Woman debuted in [[All Star Comics 8|''All Star Comics''#8]] ([[cover date]] Dec/Jan 1941/1942, released in October 1941),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dcindexes.com/features/comic.php?comicid=2249 |title=All-Star Comics #8 |author=Library of Congress |website=dcindexes.com |publisher=Mike's Amazing World |access-date=May 19, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907075954/http://www.dcindexes.com/features/comic.php?comicid=2249 |archive-date=September 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> scripted by Marston.

Marston was the creator of a systolic-blood-pressure-measuring apparatus, which was crucial to the development of the polygraph ([[polygraph|lie detector]]). Marston's experience with polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest than men in certain situations and could work more efficiently.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Bunn | first=Geoffrey C. | title=The lie detector, ''Wonder Woman'', and liberty: The life and work of William Moulton Marston | journal=History of the Human Sciences | volume=10 | issue=1 | location=London | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=1997 | pages=91–119 | doi=10.1177/095269519701000105| s2cid=143152325 }}</ref>

Marston designed Wonder Woman to be an allegory for the [[Love leadership|ideal love leader]]; the kind of women who he believed should run society.

"Frankly, Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who, I believe, should rule the world", Marston wrote.<ref name="Hendrix2007">{{Cite news|title=Out for Justice|last=Hendrix|first=Grady|date=December 11, 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Sun]]}}</ref>

In a 1943 issue of ''[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]]'', Marston wrote:<ref>{{cite web|last=Tartakovsky|first=Margarita|title=A Psychologist and A Superhero|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/05/17/a-psychologist-and-a-superhero/|publisher=Psych Central|access-date=November 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519072637/http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/05/17/a-psychologist-and-a-superhero/|archive-date=May 19, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|date=May 17, 2011}}</ref>

Marston was an outspoken [[feminist]], [[polyamorist]], and firm believer in the superiority of women.<ref>https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/marston_william-moulton.htm</ref><ref name="Archived copy">{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/lgbt-superheroes-wonder-woman-lesbian-gay-queer-1201838274/ |title=LGBT Superheroes: Why 'Wonder Woman' Could Never Have Been the Lesbian Avenger We Still Need |access-date=July 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725123004/https://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/lgbt-superheroes-wonder-woman-lesbian-gay-queer-1201838274/ |archive-date=July 25, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all |date=June 7, 2017 }}</ref> He described [[Dominance and submission|bondage and submission]] as a "respectable and noble practice".

{{quote|The only hope for peace is to teach people who are full of pep and unbound force to enjoy being bound... only when the control of self by others is more pleasant than the unbound assertion of self in human relationships can we hope for a stable, peaceful human society.|William Moulton Marston}}

Wonder Woman often ended up in chains before inevitably breaking free. This not only represented Marston's affinity for bondage, but women's subjugation, which he roundly rejected. However, not everything about his creation was explicitly explained in any one source, which caused confusion among writers and fans for many years.

====Golden Age====
{{main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}
Initially, Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return [[Steve Trevor]]{{spaced ndash}}a United States intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons' isolated island homeland{{spaced ndash}}to "Man's World" and to fight crime and the evil of the [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''All Star Comics'' #8 (October 1941)</ref>

During this period, Wonder Woman joined the [[Justice Society of America]] as the team's secretary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Tim|title=Wonder Woman: Secretary Of The Justice Society Of America|url=http://thanley.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/wonder-woman-secretary-of-the-justice-society-of-america/|publisher=Straitened Circumstances|access-date=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607233855/http://thanley.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/wonder-woman-secretary-of-the-justice-society-of-america/|archive-date=June 7, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|date=June 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>''All Star Comics'' #12 (August/September 1942)</ref>

====Silver Age====
{{main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}
During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], under writer [[Robert Kanigher]], Wonder Woman's origin was revamped,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #98 (May 1958)</ref> along with other characters'. The new origin story increased the character's [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenic]] and mythological roots: receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become as "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], strong as [[Hercules]], and swift as [[Hermes]]."<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #105 (April 1959)</ref>

At the end of the 1960s, under the guidance of [[Mike Sekowsky]], Wonder Woman surrendered her powers in order to remain in Man's World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension. Wonder Woman begins using the alias [[Diana Prince]] and opens a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] boutique. She acquires a Chinese mentor named [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]], who teaches Diana [[martial arts]] and weapons skills. Using her fighting skill instead of her powers, Diana engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #179 (1968)</ref><ref name="Reed">{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Bill|title=365 Reasons to Love Comics|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/05/365-reasons-to-love-comics-64/|website=Comic Book Resources|access-date=March 5, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312235637/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/05/365-reasons-to-love-comics-64/|archive-date=March 12, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This phase of her story was directly influenced by the British spy thriller ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and [[Diana Rigg]]'s portrayal of [[Emma Peel]].<ref>"We were all in love with Diana Rigg and that show she was on." Mike Sekowsky, quoted in Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History'' (Chronicle, 2004), p. 129.</ref>

====Bronze Age====
{{main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}
In the early 1970s the character returned to her superhero roots in the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' and to the [[World War II]] era in her own title.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol 1 #204</ref> This, however, was ultimately due to the popularity of the TV series at the time also having Wonder Woman set in the WWII era, and was shifted back to the 1970s era once the TV show did the same.

With a new decade arriving, DC president [[Jenette Kahn]] ordered a revamp in Wonder Woman's appearance. Artist [[Milton Glaser]], who also designed the "bullet" logo adopted by DC in 1977, created a stylized "WW" emblem that evoked and replaced the eagle in her bodice and debuted in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1980s|author=Keith Dallas, Jason Sacks, Jim Beard, Dave Dykema, Paul Brian McCoy|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1605490465|pages=47–8}}</ref> The emblem in turn was incorporated by studio letterer [[Todd Klein]] onto the monthly title's logo, which lasted for a year and a half before being replaced by a version from Glaser's studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kleinletters.com/Blog/logo-study-wonder-woman-part-3/|title=Logo Study: WONDER WOMAN part 3|author=Klein, Todd|publisher=Klein Letters|date=January 18, 2008|access-date=April 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814175108/http://kleinletters.com/Blog/logo-study-wonder-woman-part-3/|archive-date=August 14, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=Todd Klein}}</ref> With sales of the title continuing to decline in 1985 (despite an unpublished revamp that was solicited), the series was canceled and ended in issue #329 (February 1986) written by Gerry Conway, depicting Steve Trevor's marriage to Wonder Woman.

The ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover of 1985 was designed and written with the purpose of streamlining most of DC's characters into one more-focused continuity and reinventing them for a new era, thus Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor were declared to come from the Earth-Two dimension, and along with all of their exploits, were erased from history, so that a new Wonder Woman character, story and timeline could take priority.

====Modern Age====
{{main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}
Following the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' series, [[George Pérez]], [[Len Wein]], and [[Greg Potter]] rewrote the character's origin story, depicting Wonder Woman as an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Pérez incorporated a variety of deities and concepts from Greek mythology in Wonder Woman's stories and origin. His rendition of the character acted as the foundation for the modern Wonder Woman stories, as he expanded upon the widely accepted origin of Diana being birthed out of clay. The relaunch was a critical and commercial success.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Mangels, Andy|date= January 1, 1989|title= Triple Threat The George Pérez Interview|journal= Amazing Heroes|issue= 156|page= 30|publisher= [[Fantagraphics Books]]|quote = ''Wonder Woman's'' sales are some of the best the Amazing Amazon has ever experienced, and the book is a critical and popular success with its weaving of Greek mythology into a feminist and humanistic atmosphere.|author-link= Andy Mangels}}</ref>

In 2011's [[The New 52]], DC Comics relaunched its entire line of publications to attract a new generation of readers, and thus released volume 4 of the ''Wonder Woman'' comic book title. [[Brian Azzarello]] and [[Cliff Chiang]] were assigned writing and art duties respectively and revamped the character's history considerably. In this new continuity, Wonder Woman wears a costume similar to her original Marston costume, utilizes a sword and shield, and has a completely new origin. No longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods, she is, instead, a [[demi-goddess]] and the natural-born daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]]. Azzarello and Chiang's revamp of the character was critically acclaimed, but highly divisive among longtime fans of the character.<ref>{{cite web|first=Joey|last=Esposito|title=The Best of DC Comics in 2011|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/14/the-best-of-dc-comics-in-2011-2|website=IGN|access-date=December 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007203245/http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/14/the-best-of-dc-comics-in-2011-2|archive-date=October 7, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last= Renaud| first= Jeffrey| title= Azzarello Lowers the Boom(Tube) on Wonder Woman| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40597| website= Comic Book Resources| access-date= August 22, 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120824065430/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40597| archive-date= August 24, 2012| url-status= live| df= mdy-all| date= August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Garcia|first=Joe|title=The Best & Worst of DC Comics' New 52, One Year Later|url=http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2012/09/05/the-best-worst-of-dc-comics-new-52-one-year-later/|publisher=Front Towards Gamer|access-date=September 5, 2012|quote=Despite being one part of the Justice League's "Holy Trinity", Wonder Woman never seems to get the recognition that she deserves.

In 2016, DC Comics once again relaunched all of its publications as part of the "[[DC Rebirth]]" continuity reboot, and the new fifth volume of ''Wonder Woman'' was released bi-monthly with writer [[Greg Rucka]]. This fifth volume of ''Wonder Woman'' is part of the "DC Universe", the current continuity established after Rebirth. Initially, the new series does not use a regular storyline that exists between each issue; instead two separate storylines share the book, with an installment of one story published every other issue, and those of the other storyline published in between those. This practice began with the storyline "The Lies" for the odd numbered issues, and "Year One" for the even numbered issues. The new storyline as presented in these issues effectively retcons the events from the previous New 52 series. "The Lies"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/03/03/wonder-woman-the-story-keeps-changing|title=Wonder Woman: The Story Keeps Changing|date=March 3, 2017|access-date=November 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014125526/http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/03/03/wonder-woman-the-story-keeps-changing|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> storyline reveals that a number of events from the previous ''Wonder Woman'' series in which Diana was made the Queen of the Amazons and the God of War, was in fact all an illusion created by a mysterious villain, and she had never once been back to Themyscira ever since she left, nor is she capable of returning there.

Wonder Woman appears in DC Rebirth with a revised look, which includes a red cape and light armor fittings. Along with her lasso and bracelets, she now regularly utilizes her sword and shield.

The "Diana Prince" identity has been part of Wonder Woman's history since her comics debut in 1941. In the early Golden Age stories, Wonder Woman served as a military secretary during World War II, using Prince as her cover. Later occupations Wonder Woman performed as Prince included translator at the United Nations, Air Force captain and ambassador, and in the '70s TV series, Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman used Prince to serve as an agent of the Inter-Agency Defense Command. In the [[DC Extended Universe]], Prince works as [[curator]] for the Department of Antiquities<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w54VkC1s1g |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801213753/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w54VkC1s1g |archive-date=August 1, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> at the extremely prestigious [[Louvre Museum]] and is held in very high esteem by the curator of the [[Gotham City]] Museum of Antiquities.

During Marston's run, Diana Prince was the name of an army nurse whom Wonder Woman met. The nurse wanted to meet with her fiancé, who was transferred to South America, but was unable to arrange for money to do so. As Wonder Woman needed a secret identity to look after Steve (who was admitted to the same army hospital in which Diana Prince worked), and because both of them looked alike, Wonder Woman gave the nurse money to go to her fiancé in exchange for the nurse's credentials and took Diana Prince as her alias.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> She started to work as an army nurse and later as an Air Force secretary.<ref name="Gutierrez"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Love Ya but You're Strange – That Time the Husband of Wonder Woman's Exact Double Chained Her to a Table|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/07/12/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-that-time-the-husband-of-wonder-womans-exact-double-chained-her-to-a-table/|website=Comic Book Resources|access-date=July 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715043851/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/07/12/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-that-time-the-husband-of-wonder-womans-exact-double-chained-her-to-a-table/|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The identity of Diana Prince was especially prominent in a series published in the early 1970s, in which she fought crime only under the Prince alias and without her mystic powers. To support herself, she ran a mod clothing boutique.<ref name="Hanley"/><ref name="Diana's Memory Album"/>

The Diana Prince alias also played an important role after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Wonder Woman was broadcast worldwide killing a villain named [[Maxwell Lord]], as he was mind controlling Superman into killing Batman. When Wonder Woman caught him in her lasso, demanding to know how to stop Superman, Maxwell revealed that the only way to stop him was to kill Lord, so as a last resort Diana snapped his neck.<ref name=WW219 /><ref name="Goldstein">{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|title=Defending Wonder Woman|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/01/defending-wonder-woman|website=IGN|access-date=August 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023125025/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/01/defending-wonder-woman|archive-date=October 23, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> To recover from the trauma of killing another person, the Amazon went into a self-imposed exile for one year.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref> On her return to public life, Diana realized that her life as a full-time celebrity superhero and ambassador had kept her removed from humanity.

The New 52 universe does not have a "Diana Prince" identity as stated in an interview by series writer Brian Azzarello.<ref>{{cite web|last=Azzarello|first=Brian|title=No, she (Wonder Woman) doesn't (have a secret identity|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/21/the-new-52-interviews-wonder-woman|website=IGN|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045811/http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/21/the-new-52-interviews-wonder-woman|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, when she and Superman began dating, for her civilian identity she used the Diana Prince alias whenever she was around Clark Kent; such as when she introduced herself to [[Lois Lane]] at Lois's housewarming party under that name.<ref>''Superman'' (Volume 3) #19</ref>

The DC Rebirth universe has not featured the Diana Prince identity as much in favor of Wonder Woman going by Diana of Themyscira in her downtime.

Princess Diana commands respect both as Wonder Woman and Diana Prince; her epithetical title – The Amazon Princess – illustrates the [[dichotomy]] of her character. She is a powerful, strong-willed character who does not back down from a fight or a challenge. Yet, she is a diplomat who strongly "[[The pen is mightier than the sword|favors the pen]]", and a lover of peace who would never seek to fight or escalate a conflict. She's simultaneously both the most fierce and most nurturing member of the [[Justice League]]; and her political connections as a United Nations Honorary Ambassador and the ambassador of a warrior nation makes her an invaluable addition to the team. With her powerful abilities, centuries of training and experience at handling threats that range from petty crime to threats that are of a magical or supernatural nature, Diana is capable of competing with nearly any hero or villain.

Many writers have depicted Diana in different personalities and tone; between both of her diametric extremes; that of a worldly warrior, a highly compassionate and calm ambassador, and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person, depending on the writer. What has remained constant, and is a mainstay of the character, is her nurturing humanity: her overwhelming belief in love, empathy, compassion, and having a strong conscience.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This trait had been the reason for her induction into the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]s.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (2010)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Star Sapphires|url=http://www.wonderali.com/2010/01/welcome-to-the-star-sapphires-2/|publisher=WonderAli|access-date=January 11, 2010|author=WonderAli|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529171046/http://www.wonderali.com/2010/01/welcome-to-the-star-sapphires-2/|archive-date=May 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Diana, after her death, was granted divinity as the Goddess of Truth by her gods for such faithful devotion.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #127 (November 1997)</ref> During her brief time as a god of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], Diana was replaced in the role of Wonder Woman by her mother, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #128 (December 1997)</ref> Unlike Diana receiving the title of Wonder Woman in honor, Hippolyta's role as Wonder Woman was meant to be a punishment for her betrayal in Artemis' death as well as for unintentionally killing her own daughter.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #129 (January 1998)</ref> However, Hippolyta eventually grew to enjoy the freedom and adventure the title came with. Whereas Diana used the Lasso of Truth as her primary weapon, Hippolyta favored a broad sword.

John Byrne, the writer that introduced the concept of Hippolyta as the first Wonder Woman, has explained his intentions in a post in his message board:

<blockquote>I thought George's one "mistake" in rebooting Wonder Woman was making her only 25 years old when she left Paradise Island. I preferred the idea of a Diana who was thousands of years old (as, if I recall correctly, she was in the TV series). From that angle, I would have liked to have seen Diana having been Wonder Woman in WW2, and be returning to our world in the reboot.

Not having that option, I took the next best course, and had Hippolyta fill that role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17792 |title=Wonder Woman revisited |publisher=Byrne Robotics |access-date=January 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518044601/http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17792 |archive-date=May 18, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

As Wonder Woman, Queen Hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with [[Jay Garrick]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #130–133 (February–May 1998)</ref> After this mission, she elected to join the [[Justice Society of America]] and remained in that era for eight years, where her teammates nicknamed her "Polly". During that time she had a relationship with [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted Grant]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #185 (November 2002)</ref> Hippolyta also made visits into the past to see her godchild [[Fury (DC Comics)|Lyta]], daughter of Hippolyta's protege Helena, the Golden Age Fury.{{Issue|date=February 2008}} These visits happened yearly from young Lyta's perspective and also accounted for Hippolyta's participation in the JSA/JLA team ups. When she returned from the past, Hippolyta took Diana's place in the [[Justice League|JLA]] as well.<ref>''JLA'' #18–23 (May–October 1998)</ref><ref>''JLA'' #30 (June 1999)</ref>

[[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall]] briefly served as Wonder Woman during Hippolyta's trials for a new Wonder Woman. [[Orana (DC comics)|Orana]], a character similar to Artemis, defeated Diana in a new contest and became Wonder Woman in pre-''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' continuity. Orana was killed during her first mission. Others who have donned the Wonder Woman persona include [[Nubia (comics)|Nubia]], [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassandra Sandsmark]], and [[Donna Troy]].

==Fictional character biography==
===20th century===
====Origin====
In her debut in ''All Star Comics'' #8, Diana was a member of a tribe of women called the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], native to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]{{spaced ndash}}a secluded island set in the middle of a vast ocean. [[Steve Trevor|Captain Steve Trevor]]'s plane crashes on the island and he is found alive but unconscious by Diana and fellow Amazon, and friend, Mala. Diana has him nursed back to health and falls in love with him. A competition is held amongst all the Amazons by Diana's mother, the Queen of the Amazons [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]], in order to determine who is the most worthy of all the women; Hippolyta charges the winner with the responsibility of delivering Captain Steve Trevor back to Man's World and to fight for justice. Hippolyta forbids Diana from entering the competition, but she takes part nonetheless, wearing a mask to conceal her identity. She wins the competition and reveals herself, surprising Hippolyta, who ultimately accepts, and must give in to, Diana's wish to go to Man's World. She then is awarded a special uniform made by her mother for her new role as Wonder Woman and safely returns Steve Trevor to his home country.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist =[[Harry G.

====Golden Age====
{{main|Golden Age of Comic Books}}
Coming to America for the first time, Wonder Woman comes upon a wailing army nurse who happens to look identical to her. Inquiring about her state, she finds that the nurse wanted to leave for South America with her fiancé but was unable due to shortage of money. As Wonder Woman needed a job and a valid identity to look after Steve (who was admitted in the same army hospital), she gives her the money she had earned earlier to help her go to her fiancé in exchange for her credentials. The nurse reveals her name as Diana Prince, and thus, Wonder Woman's secret identity was created, and she began working as a nurse in the army.<ref name="Gutierrez">{{cite web|last=Gutierrez|first=Jon|title=The 6 Worst Jobs Wonder Woman Ever Had|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/03/the_6_worst_jobs_wonder_woman_ever_had.php|publisher=Topless Robot|access-date=March 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401191036/http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/03/the_6_worst_jobs_wonder_woman_ever_had.php|archive-date=April 1, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|date=March 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G.

Wonder Woman then took part in a variety of adventures, mostly side by side with Trevor. Her most common foes during this period would be [[Nazi forces]] led by a German baroness named [[Paula von Gunther]], occasionally evil deities/demigods such as [[Ares (comics)|Mars]] and the [[Duke of Deception]], and then colorful villains like [[Hypnota]], [[Doctor Psycho]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=When We First Met – Wonder Woman's Golden Age Rogues|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/28/when-we-first-met-wonder-womans-golden-age-rogues/|website=Comic Book Resources|access-date=October 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101050244/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/28/when-we-first-met-wonder-womans-golden-age-rogues/|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Silver Age====
{{main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}
In the Silver Age, Wonder Woman's history received several changes. Her earlier origin, which had significant ties to [[World War II]], was changed and her powers were shown to be the product of the [[Greek mythology|gods']] blessings, corresponding to her epithet, "beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, stronger than Hercules, and swifter than Hermes".<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The complicated origin of Wonder Woman|url=http://marionetteblog.blogspot.in/2005/09/complicated-origin-of-wonder-woman.html|publisher=Dance of the Puppets|access-date=September 28, 2005|author=MARIONETTE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821210849/http://marionetteblog.blogspot.in/2005/09/complicated-origin-of-wonder-woman.html|archive-date=August 21, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The concepts of [[Wonder Girl]] and [[Wonder Tot]] were also introduced during this period.<ref>{{cite web| last= Hanley| first= Tim| title= A Book Look: Kanigher's Giant Birds| url= https://thanley.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/a-book-look-kanigher%E2%80%99s-giant-birds/| publisher= Straitened Circumstances| access-date= January 10, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110112084021/http://thanley.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/a-book-look-kanigher%E2%80%99s-giant-birds/| archive-date= January 12, 2011| url-status= live| df= mdy-all| date= January 10, 2011}}</ref>

''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #179 (Nov. 1969) showed Wonder Woman giving up her powers and returning her costume and title to her mother, in order to continue staying in Man's World. The reason behind this was that all the Amazons were shifting to another dimension, but Diana was unable to accompany them as she needed to stay behind to help Steve, who had been wrongly convicted.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Denny O'Neil| penciller=Mike Sekowsky| inker=Dick Giordano| story=Wonder Woman's Last Battle| title=Wonder Woman| volume=1| issue=179| date=November 1968}}</ref> Thus, she no longer held the title of Wonder Woman and after meeting and training under a blind martial arts mentor [[I Ching (comics)|I-Ching]], Diana resumed crime fighting as the powerless Diana Prince.

=====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''=====
The events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' greatly changed and altered the history of the [[DC Universe]]. Wonder Woman's history and origin were considerably revamped by the event. Wonder Woman was now an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] (the new name for Paradise Island) to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Various deities and concepts from [[Greek mythology]] were blended and incorporated into Wonder Woman's stories and origin. Diana was formed out of clay of the shores of Themyscira by [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]], who wished for a child; the clay figure was then brought to life by the Greek deities. The Gods then blessed and granted her unique powers and abilities{{spaced ndash}}beauty from Aphrodite, strength from Demeter, wisdom from Athena, speed and flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts from Artemis and sisterhood with fire and the ability to discern the truth from Hestia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Colluccio|first=Ali|title=Top 5: Wonder Woman Reboots|url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/top-5-wonder-woman-reboots/|publisher=iFanboy|access-date=April 10, 2012|quote=After she was "erased" from existence in the final pages of Crisis on Infinite Earths, George Perez, Len Wein and Greg Potter brought the Amazon Princess back to the DC Universe. While the basics of the story remained the same, Wonder Woman;s powers were adjusted to include Beauty from Aphrodite, Strength from Demeter, Wisdom from Athena, Speed and Flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter from Artemis, and Truth from Hestia. This run established Paradise Island as the mythical Amazon capital, Themyscira.

{{Main|War of the Gods (comics)}}
Starting in ''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #51, the Amazons, who had revealed their presence to the world in ''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #50, are blamed for a series of murders and for the theft of various artifacts. The Amazons are then taken into custody, Queen [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] is nowhere to be found and Steve Trevor is forced by General Yedziniak to attack Themyscira. These events lead to the "[[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]" occurring. The culprit of the murders, thefts and the framing of the Amazons is revealed to be the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], who "kills" Diana by reverting her form back into the clay she was born from.

Buying herself time by slicing Superman's throat with her tiara, Wonder Woman caught Lord in her Lasso of Truth and demanded to know how to stop his control over Superman. As the lasso forced the wearer to speak only the truth, Lord told her that the only way to stop him was to kill him.

In September 2011, DC Comics relaunched its entire publication line in an initiative called [[The New 52]]. Among the major changes to the character, Wonder Woman now appears wearing a new costume similar to her older one, and has a completely new origin. In this new timeline, Wonder Woman is no longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods. Rather, she is the [[demigod]]dess daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus: King of the Greek Gods. Her original origin is revealed as a cover story to explain Diana's birth as a means to protect her from Hera's wrath. Currently, Diana has taken on the role and title as the new "God of War".<ref>{{cite news| last=Ching| first=Albert| title=WONDER WOMAN Gets a NEW 52 Origin, Parent in November| url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/wonder-woman-new-origin-111010.html| work=Newsarama| access-date=October 10, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011104936/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/wonder-woman-new-origin-111010.html| archive-date=October 11, 2011| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Gregorian| first=Dareh| title=Zeus your daddy, Diana!| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/zeus_your_daddy_diana_ppW48O4ICruECUubnH5G1H| newspaper=New York Post| access-date=October 10, 2011}}</ref>

After the events of "[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]", Wonder Woman would don a new costume. She would also face Donna Troy, who is now reimagined as a villainous doppelgänger created by a vengeful Amazon elder, not only to physically defeat Wonder Woman but also to outmaneuver her in Themyscirian politics.

====''Earth 2''====
[[The New 52]] version of [[Earth-Two#The New 52|Earth 2]] was introduced in ''Earth 2'' #1 (2012). In that issue, the Earth 2 Wonder Woman is introduced via flashback. She, along with [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], are depicted dying in battle with forces from [[Apokolips]] five years in the past.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/who-is-who-on-earth-2.html| title=Who's Who on EARTH 2| work=Newsarama.com| access-date=January 9, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119035037/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/who-is-who-on-earth-2.html| archive-date=November 19, 2012| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}</ref> This Wonder Woman worshiped the deities of Roman mythology as opposed to the Greek; the Roman gods perish as a result of the conflict. An earlier version of the Earth-2 Wonder Woman, prior to the Apokoliptian invasion, is seen in the comic book ''[[Batman/Superman]]'', where she is seen riding a pegasus.

In ''Earth 2'' #8 (2013), Wonder Woman's adult daughter, [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]], is introduced. She is loyal to the Apokoliptian [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/01/09/looks-like-earth-2s-wonder-woman-left-a-certain-something-behind-spoilers/| title=Look's Like Earth 2's Wonder Woman Left a Certain Something Behind...

====DC Rebirth====
{{main|DC Rebirth}}
In 2016, DC Comics implemented [[DC Rebirth]], a relaunch of its entire line of comic books.

Following the events of the Darkseid War, Wonder Woman is told by the dying Myrina Black that on the night of Diana's birth, Hippolyta gave birth to a twin child. This child was revealed to be male, known as Jason, and is said to be incredibly powerful. Wonder Woman makes it her mission to find him.<ref>''Justice League'' #50 (2016)</ref> At the same time, she finds the truth behind her origin and history is now cluttered, as she remembers two versions: the pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' one, and the ''New 52'' rendition. She cannot locate [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] or her fellow Amazons and the Lasso of Truth does not work for her anymore.

The "Year One" storyline retells Diana's origin growing up on Themyscira. She lives an idyllic life and harbors interest for the outside world, and the first connection to it comes in the form of Steve Trevor, who crashes on the island and is the sole survivor. A contest is held to determine which Amazon is the best candidate to take Steve home, with Diana volunteering despite knowing the cost to leave the island is to never return. Diana wins the contest and departs with Steve. Once arriving in America, Diana is taken into custody by the government to discern her origins. She meets Etta Candy and Barbara Ann Minerva along the way. While incarcerated, Diana is visited by the gods in animal form and they bestow upon her powers of strength, speed, agility, durability, and flight. She discovers Ares, the god of war, is working to destroy humanity.  Accepting her new role in Man's World, Diana, with the help of the gods in animal form, subdues Ares with the lasso. Now called Wonder Woman, Diana becomes one of the world's greatest heroes.

The "Lies" story arc runs parallel with and explores Diana's search. No longer able to get into Mount Olympus, Diana tracks down Barbara Ann Minerva, the Cheetah, to get help.<ref>''Wonder Woman: Rebirth'' #1 (2016)</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' #1 (2016)</ref> Cheetah agrees to help in exchange for Diana aiding her in killing the god Urzkartaga and ending Minerva's curse. The pair battle their way through Urzkartaga's minions, the Bouda, and defeat Andres Cadulo, a worshiper of Urzkartaga that planned to sacrifice Steve Trevor to the plant god. Once reverted to her human form, Minerva agreed to help Wonder Woman find her way back to Paradise Island. During this time, Wonder Woman reconnects with Steve. Minerva eventually realizes Paradise Island is an embodiment of emotion instead of a physical place, so Wonder Woman and Steve head out to find the island. They succeed and Wonder Woman is greeted by her mother and sisters, though Steve senses something is wrong. Wonder Woman comes to realize nothing is as she remembers and, upon using the Lasso of Truth, discovers everything she thought she knew was a lie: she never really returned to Themyscira after departing with Steve years earlier. The revelation shatters Diana's mind and she is left nearly insane. Veronica Cale, a businesswoman who has been desiring to find Themyscira and the leader of Godwatch, sends a military group called Poison after her, but Diana's state has left her vulnerable and oblivious to the danger she and Steve are in. Steve wards them off long enough for them to be rescued, and reluctantly places Diana in a mental hospital so she can get help. While there, she comes to grasp the reality she thought she knew was false, eventually coming out of her stupor and able to rejoin the others in tracking down Veronica Cale, who is trying to find Themyscira.

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Doctor Poison attended the meeting established by the Riddler and mentioned a rumor that Wonder Woman was forcefully dragged back to Themyscira by her fellow Amazons.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> Wonder Woman comes out of hiding to address the United Nations, hoping to defuse the metahuman arms race. However, the summit is interrupted by Black Adam, the Creeper, and Giganta, who take advantage of the absence of most of Earth's superheroes to attack the UN at the time when the superheroes were confronting [[Doctor Manhattan]] on Mars.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #9. DC Comics.</ref>

===Powers and training===
[[File:WonderWoman1970s.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wonder Woman without special powers fighting crime as Diana Prince. Cover of ''Wonder Woman''#189 (July 1970). Art by [[Mike Sekowsky]].]]

Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete, acrobat, fighter and strategist, trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat, including exclusive Amazonian martial arts. With her godlike abilities of incalculable superhuman strength, nigh-invulnerability, speed, flight, healing factor and semi-immortality, Diana's fighting prowess is enhanced. In some versions, her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso.<ref>''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'' #4 (December 2008)</ref> Batman once called her the "best melee fighter in the world".<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13 (Nov. 2007)</ref> The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary.<ref name=WW219>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #219 (September 2005)</ref> In the New 52 continuity, her superior combat skills are the result of her Amazon training, as well as receiving further training from Ares, the God of War, himself, since as early as her childhood.<ref name="Azzarello2"/> The Golden Age Wonder Woman also had knowledge in psychology, as did her Amazon sisters.<ref>https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1e3a702785744b78d2c99d40c588ece5.webp</ref><ref>https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd44ee6ab515846cc0488d139e8652c9.webp</ref>

====Pre-''Crisis''====
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] had strength that was comparable to the Golden Age Superman. Wonder Woman was capable of bench pressing 15,000 pounds even before she had received her bracelets, and later hoisted a 50,000 pound boulder above her head to inspire Amazons facing the test.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G. Peter |title= Wonder Woman |issue= 13  | pages=3–5 | publisher= All American Comics| date=1945}}</ref> Even when her super strength was temporarily nullified, she still had enough mortal strength of an Amazon to break down a prison door to save Steve Trevor.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #6 (June 1942)</ref> In one of her earliest appearances, she is shown running easily at {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}}, and later jumps from a building{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and lands on [[Ball (foot)|the balls of her feet]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton | artist= [[Harry G. Peter]] |title= Sensation Comics|issue= 1  | pages=5–7 | publisher= All American Comics| date=1942}}</ref>

She was able to heal faster than a normal human being due to her birthright consumption of water from Paradise Island's Fountain of Eternal Youth.

Her strength would be removed in accordance with "Aphrodite's Law" if she allowed her bracelets to be bound or chained by a male.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/12/wonder-woman | title=Wonder Woman: A psychologist's creation| journal=[[Monitor on Psychology]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|location = Washington, D.C. | first=Nick|last=Joyce | date=December 2008|volume=39|issue=11| access-date=November 20, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108100232/https://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/12/wonder-woman | archive-date=November 8, 2020 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

She also had an array of mental and psychic abilities, as corresponding to Marston's interest in parapsychology and metaphysics. Such an array included ESP, astral projection, telepathy (with or without the [[Mental Radio]]), mental control over the electricity in her body, the Amazonian ability to turn brain energy into muscle power, etc.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G. Peter |title= Sensation Comics|issue= 46  | page=6 | publisher= J.R.

''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #105 revealed that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons, given life and power by four of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] gods (otherwise known as the [[Greek pantheon|Olympian deities]]) as gifts, corresponding to her renowned epithet: "Beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], swifter than [[Hermes]], and stronger than [[Hercules]]", making her the strongest of the Amazons.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> Wonder Woman's Amazon training gave her limited [[telepathy]], profound scientific knowledge,<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> and the ability to speak every language{{spaced ndash}}even [[caveman]]<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> and Martian languages.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #115">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #115 (July 1960)</ref>

Between 1966 and 1967, new powers were added, such as super breath.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Michael L. | last=Fleisher | title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 2: Wonder Woman | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] | date=September 1976 | isbn=978-0-02-080080-4}}</ref>

In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]] and [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze]] Ages of comics, Wonder Woman was able to further increase her strength. In times of great need, removing her bracelets would temporarily augment her power tenfold, but cause her to go [[Berserker|berserk]] in the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww166.htm |title=Amazon Archives |publisher=Amazon Archives |access-date=December 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112160815/http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww166.htm |archive-date=January 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww229.htm |title=Amazon Archives |publisher=Amazon Archives |access-date=December 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126115624/http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww229.htm |archive-date=January 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

These powers received changes after the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

====Post-''Crisis''====
In the Post-''Crisis'' universe, Wonder Woman receives her super powers as a blessing from [[Greek pantheon|Olympian deities]] just like the Silver Age version before, but with changes to some of her powers:<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1987)</ref>
* [[Demeter]], the goddess of agriculture and fertility, blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]], making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DC Universe and the strongest female hero in the [[DC Universe]]. This strength has allowed her to easily overwhelm [[Superman]] and [[Supergirl]]. She has also held her own against Darkseid. Her strength has no measurable limits and she can break the Chronus Scepter, which is universal in its destructive power. However, now Diana is the daughter of Zeus, king of the Greek Gods, so it is unclear as to how much of her power and strength is a direct result of her divine heritage.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://entertainment.time.com/2013/12/04/and-the-new-wonder-woman-is/|title = And the New Wonder Woman Is...|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = December 4, 2013|access-date = February 5, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140207212403/http://entertainment.time.com/2013/12/04/and-the-new-wonder-woman-is/|archive-date = February 7, 2014|url-status = live|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Her connection to the earth allows her to heal at an accelerated rate so long as she is in contact with the planet. In rare cases where she has been gravely injured, Diana showed the ability to physically merge with the earth, causing whatever injuries or poisons to be expelled from her body; such an act is considered sacred, and can only be used in extreme cases.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia">{{Cite book | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>
* [[Athena (DC Comics)|Pallas Athena]], the goddess of wisdom and war, granted Diana great wisdom, intelligence, and military prowess. Athena's gift has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages (including those of alien origin), multiple complex crafts, sciences and philosophies, as well as leadership, military strategy, and armed and unarmed combat. More recently, Athena bound her own eyesight to Diana's, granting her increased empathy.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Johns | first=Geoff | author-link=Geoff Johns | title=Wonder Woman: Land of the Dead | date=February 2006 | isbn=978-1-4177-5102-0}}</ref>
* [[Artemis (DC Comics)|Artemis]], goddess of the hunt, animals, and the Moon, graced Diana with the Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts, meaning Diana can communicate with all animals, including dinosaurs. The Eyes of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses, including telescopic vision and super hearing.
* [[Hestia]], goddess of hearth and home, granted Diana sisterhood with fire. This power has been shown to control the "Fires of Truth", which Diana wields through her lasso, making anyone bound by it unable to lie.<ref name="Beatty2003" /> This ability also grants her resistance to both normal and supernatural fire.
* [[Hermes (DC Comics)|Hermes]], the messenger god of speed, granted Diana superhuman speed and the ability to fly.<ref name="Beatty2003">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | title=Wonder Woman: The Ultimate Guide to the Amazon Princess | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | date=November 2003 | isbn=978-0-7894-9616-4 | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwomanultim00beat }}</ref> She is capable of flying at speeds approaching half the speed of light.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia"/> She can react quickly enough to deflect bullets, lasers, and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets.

* [[Aphrodite (DC Comics)|Aphrodite]], goddess of love, bestowed Diana with stunning beauty, as well as a kind heart.

While not completely invulnerable, she is highly resistant to great amounts of concussive force and extreme temperatures. However, edged weapons or projectiles applied with sufficient force are able to pierce her skin.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia"/><ref>Jimenez, Phil et al. [https://books.google.com/books?id=81F5RWxOdaAC&dq=wonder+woman&q=warp+core#v=onepage&q=gunfire&f=false ''The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia'']. Published by Random House Digital, Inc. 2010, pp. 271, 116, 244 & 165.</ref> Due to her divine origins, Diana can resist many forms of magical manipulation.

She is able to [[Astral projection|astrally project]] herself into various lands of myth. Her physical body reacts to whatever happens to her on the mythical astral plane, leaving her body cut, bruised, or sometimes strengthened once her mind and body are reunited. She can apparently leave the planet through meditation and did this once to rescue Artemis while she was in [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #56, 75, 77, 97 (July 1991&nbsp;– May 1995); ''Wonder Woman Special'' #1 (May 1992); ''[[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall#Requiem|Artemis: Requiem]]'' #1 (June 1996)</ref>

====''The New 52''====
After the [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]], Diana gained new powers. These new abilities, which included superhuman speed, durability, immortality, accelerated healing, and even flight came in addition to her previous attributed Olympian strength. She is now considered to be stronger than [[Hercules]]. In addition to her weaponry, Diana's bracelets can now create a thunderous explosion or expel lightning when she clashes them together. Diana can also manipulate lightning and create weapons out of lightning bolts. These new abilities are attributed to being the daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus. Her powers are now considered nearly unmeasurable if she goes without her Bracelets of Submission, which keep her demigod powers in check. She uses these powers in battle against the goddess Artemis and quickly renders her unconscious with ease with a series of carefully positioned counterattacks. While using her godly powers, her outfit and accoutrements lit up and her eyes glowed like her father's.<ref name="thanley.wordpress.com"/><ref name="Wonder Woman"/>{{Better source|reason=Wordpress is not 100% legible|date=February 2014}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2017/06/03/wonder-woman-movie-powers-abilities-dceu/|title=Wonder Woman's Movie Powers and Abilities Explained|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619072640/http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/06/03/wonder-woman-movie-powers-abilities-dceu/|archive-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

After becoming the God of War in the pages of ''Wonder Woman'', Diana inherits Ares's divine abilities. Diana has not exhibited her full powers as War, but is seen in ''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #8 to slip easily into telepathic rapport with a soldier, explaining "I am War. I know all soldiers, and they know me."

====''DC Rebirth''====
Following the Rebirth retcon, the "Year One" storyline explains that while put in a cell after coming to Man's World, Diana was visited by the Greek gods in animal form. Each gave her powers that would reveal themselves when she needed them to. She first displays strength when she accidentally rips the bars off her cell door when visited by Steve Trevor, Etta Candy, and Barbara Ann Minerva. Later on a trip to the mall, she discovers super speed, great durability, and the power of flight while fighting off a terrorist attack.

Wonder Woman is also immortal and doesn't age beyond prime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/DC_Nation_Vol_2_4|title=DC Nation Vol 2 4|website=DC Database}}</ref>

====''DC Universe''====
DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding in December 2017, opting to include everything under a larger "DC Universe" banner and naming. The continuity established by Rebirth continues across DC's comic book titles, including volume five of ''Wonder Woman''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rich|title=The End of DC Rebirth Announced at New York Comic-Con|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/06/end-dc-rebirth-announced-new-york-comic-con|website=bleedingcool|access-date=March 11, 2018|date=October 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205242/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/06/end-dc-rebirth-announced-new-york-comic-con/|archive-date=March 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bonthuys|first=Darryn|title=The Rebirth era is over, as a new direction begins in DC Universe|url=https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/rebirth-era-new-direction-begins-dc-universe|website=criticalhit|access-date=March 11, 2018|date=December 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312144545/https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/rebirth-era-new-direction-begins-dc-universe/|archive-date=March 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Technology===
Diana is an incredible scientist and physician in addition to her athleticism. She has an arsenal of powerful god-forged gear at her disposal, but her signature equipment are her indestructible bracelets and the [[Lasso of Truth]].

====Costume and armor====
[[File:Wonder Woman DC Comics.png|thumb|right|Wonder Woman by [[Jim Lee]]]]
Wonder Woman's outfit has varied over time, although almost all of her outfit incarnations have retained some form of red chestplate, blue subligaculum, golden tiara, bracelets, and her signature five-pointed star symbols. When Wonder Woman was first introduced, she wore a heavily patriotic skirt and red top which incorporated an American eagle and elements of the United States flag, reflecting the comic's origins during World War II. Later artists introduced what would become Wonder Woman's classic ensemble, adding an armored plate to her top whose design recalls a letter W and revealing blue short shorts, whose precise length varied from artist to artist. Other artists have experimented with different looks for Wonder Woman over the years, including an all-white mod jumpsuit, a biker outfit, a variation of her mainstream depiction featuring leather pants and a jacket, and a number of armoured battlesuits. Contemporary artists have attempted to emphasise Wonder Woman's traditional outfit as a red armored top with a blue [[gladiator]] skirt.

=====Golden Age=====
Wonder Woman's outfit design was originally rooted in American symbolism and iconography, which included her signature star symbols, a golden eagle on her chest, crimson red bustier, white belt, and a dark blue star spangled skirt/culotte.

She also had a pair of red glowing magnetic earrings which allowed her to receive messages from Queen Desira of the planet Venus.

=====Pre-''Crisis''=====
At the time of her debut, Wonder Woman sported a red top with a golden eagle emblem, a white belt, blue star-spangled [[culottes]], and red and golden go-go boots. She originally wore a skirt; however according to Elizabeth Martson, "It was too hard to draw and would have been over her head most of the time."<ref name="Wonder Woman">{{Cite book | last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria | last2=Chesler | first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title=Wonder Woman | chapter=Origins preface | publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston | date=1972 | isbn=0-03-005376-5 | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars }}</ref> This outfit was entirely based on the American flag, because Wonder Woman was purely an American icon as she debuted during World War II.<ref name=Cronin26963>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Wonder Woman Throughout The Years|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26963|website=ComicBookResources.com|access-date=September 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927210000/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26963|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Later in 1942, Wonder Woman's outfit received a slight change{{spaced ndash}}the culottes were converted entirely into skin-tight shorts and she wore sandals.<ref name=Cronin26963/> While earlier most of her back was exposed, during the imposition of the [[Comics Code Authority]] in the mid-1950s, Wonder Woman's outfit was rectified to make her back substantially covered, in order to comply with the Authority's rule of minimum exposure.<ref name=Cronin26963/> During [[Mike Sekowsky]]'s run in the late 1960s, Diana surrendered her powers and started using her own skills to fight crime. She wore a series of jumpsuits as her attire; the most popular of these was a white one.<ref name=Cronin26963/>

After Sekowsky's run ended in the early 1970s, Diana's roots were reverted to her old mythological ones and she wore a more modernized version of her original outfit, a predecessor to her "bathing suit" outfit.<ref name=Cronin26963/> Later, in 1976, her glowing white belt was turned into a yellow one.<ref name=Cronin26963/> For Series 3, artist Terry Dodson redrew her outfit as a strapless swimsuit.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/costume_indices/wwcost12.html| website=carolastrickland.com| title=Wonder Woman Costume| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612062341/http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/costume_indices/wwcost12.html| archive-date=June 12, 2017| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=====Post-''Crisis''=====
After ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', [[George Pérez]] rebooted the character in 1987. She wore an outfit similar to her 1970s one, but now with a larger glowing golden belt.<ref name=Cronin26963/> This outfit continued until [[William Messner-Loebs]]' run, which had Diana pass on the role of Wonder Woman to [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]].<ref name=Cronin26963/> No longer Wonder Woman, Diana sported a new black biker-girl outfit designed by artist [[Mike Deodato Jr]].<ref name=Cronin26963/> After [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took over writing and art duties, he redesigned the Wonder Woman outfit (Diana was reinstated as Wonder Woman at the end of Loebs' run) and joined the emblem and belt together.<ref name=Cronin26963/>

Her outfit did not receive any prominent change until after the 2005–2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. Similar to her chestplate, her glowing belt was also shaped into a "W".<ref name=Cronin26963/> This outfit continued until issue #600{{spaced ndash}}[[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s run of Wonder Woman's altered timeline changed her outfit drastically. Her outfit was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]] and included a redesigned emblem, a golden and red top, black pants, and a later discontinued blue-black jacket.<ref name=Cronin26963/>

It was later [[retcon]]ned by Gail Simone that Wonder Woman's outfit design had Amazonian roots. During a flashback in Vol. 3, Hippolyta is shown issuing orders to have a garment created for Diana, taking inspiration from the skies on the night Diana was born; a red [[harvest moon|hunter's moon]] and a field of stars against deep blue, and the eagle breastplate being a symbol of [[Athena]]'s avian representations.{{issue|date=September 2017}}

=====''The New 52''=====
Another major outfit change for Wonder Woman came about as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of its entire line of publications, ''[[The New 52]]''. The character's original one-piece outfit was restored, although the color combination of red and blue was changed to dark red and blue-black. Her chest-plate, belt and tiara were also changed from gold to a platinum or sterling silver color. Along with her sword, she now also utilizes a shield. She wears many accessories such as arm and neck jewelry styled as the "WW" motif. Her outfit is no longer made of fabric, as it now resembles a type of light, flexible body armor. Her boots are now a very dark blue rather than red. The design previously included black trousers, but they were removed and the one-piece look was restored during the time of publication.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polo|first=Susana|title=DC Inexplicably, Quietly Changes Wonder Woman's outfit...

=====''DC Universe''=====
Following the 2016 ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' continuity relaunch, Wonder Woman's outfit was redesigned to resemble the one worn in the film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. This outfit is a red bustier with a gold eagle, a blue leather skirt with gold edges with two stars, and knee-high red boots with gold knee guards and accents. Her tiara once again is gold with a red star. She occasionally wears a red cape with a gold clasp and edges.{{issue|date=September 2017}} She continues to wear this updated outfit in DC Universe, the continuity established after Rebirth.

=====''Wonder Woman'' (2017 film)=====
{{main|Wonder Woman (2017 film)}}
Her tiara's signature star symbol is now an eight pointed starburst.  According to designer [[Lindy Hemming]] and director [[Patty Jenkins]], every design decision made for [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] came down to the same question: "How would I want to live that's badass?"<ref name="themarysue.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.themarysue.com/wonder-woman-themyscira-image/ |title=New Wonder Woman Image; Patty Jenkins on Costumes |publisher=The Mary Sue |date=March 24, 2016 |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126120648/http://www.themarysue.com/wonder-woman-themyscira-image/ |archive-date=January 26, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> "To me, they shouldn't be dressed in armor like men.

When asked about the decision to give the Amazons [[High-heeled footwear|heeled sandals]], Jenkins explained that they also have flats for fighting, adding "It's total [[wish-fulfillment]] ... I, as a woman, want Wonder Woman to be sexy, hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same time ... the same way men want Superman to have ridiculously huge pecs and an impractically big body. That makes them feel like the hero they want to be. And my hero, in my head, has really long legs."<ref name="ew.com">{{cite web |last=Sperling |first=Nicole |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/24/wonder-woman-first-look-gal-gadot-robin-wright-connie-nielsen |title=Wonder Woman: Gal Gadot, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen first look |website=EW.com |date=March 23, 2016 |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127125635/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/24/wonder-woman-first-look-gal-gadot-robin-wright-connie-nielsen |archive-date=November 27, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This corresponds to the original intent by William Moulton Marston, who wanted his character to be alluringly feminine.

====Invisible Plane====
{{main|Invisible Plane}}
The Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age portrayals of Wonder Woman showed her using a silent and [[invisible plane]] that could be controlled by mental command<ref name="Sensation Comics #1">{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G. Peter |title= [[Sensation Comics]] #1  | page=10 | publisher= All American Comics| date=1942}}</ref> and fly at speeds up to {{convert|3000|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Charles Moulton| artist= Harry G. Peter|title= Sensation Comics|issue= 81  | page=5 | publisher= All American Comics| date=1947}}</ref> Its appearance has varied over time; originally it had a [[propeller]], while later it was drawn as a jet aircraft resembling a [[stealth aircraft]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Strickland|first=Carol A.|title=The Invisible Plane/Jet!|url=http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/misc_indexes/jetindex/jet.html|publisher=Carol A.

She grew increasingly powerful during and after the Silver Age, acquiring the power to ride wind currents and imitate flight over short distances.

Created by Diana herself, the Invisible Plane appeared in the earliest comic stories, including ''All-Star Comics'' #8, where it is shown as being able to fly at over {{convert|2000|mph|abbr=on}} and to send out rainbow rays that penetrate the mist around [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], as well as landing stealthily and having a built-in radio. Wonder Woman is seen storing the plane in a barn at an abandoned farm near Washington, D.C., where she goes as Lt. Prince and changes clothes in some of the earliest tales. In a story published shortly after, the plane flies at {{convert|40|mi}} a second.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Shortly thereafter, Wonder Woman is shown being able to summon it with her tiara, have it hover by the War Department, and extend from it a rope ladder with which she could board it. She uses the plane to fly into outer space, and frequently transports [[Etta Candy]] and the Holliday Girls, [[Steve Trevor]], and others. During the 1950s, the plane becomes a jet, and is often shown swooping over Lt. Prince's office; she strips out of her uniform at super speed and bounds to the plane. Though the plane was depicted as semi-transparent for the reader's convenience, in-story dialogue indicated that it actually was completely invisible, or at least able to become so as the need arose.<ref>''DC Comics Presents...'' #41. DC Comics.</ref> Wonder Woman continued to use the Invisible Plane for super speed, outer space, and multi-dimensional transport up until the unpowered era of Diana Prince. When Wonder Woman resumed superpowered, costumed operations in 1973, she continued to use the jet as before, but did glide on air currents for short distances. At one point, Aphrodite granted the plane the power to fly faster than the speed of light for any interstellar voyages her champion might undertake.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 1 #261. DC Comics.</ref> Thanks to tinkering by [[gremlin]]s, the Plane even developed intelligence and the power to talk.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 1 #312. DC Comics.</ref> The plane proved a good friend, eager to help his "mistress" and her loved ones in any way possible. It got along especially well with Steve Trevor.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Diana's bulletproof bracelets were formed from the remnants of [[Athena]]'s legendary shield, the [[Aegis]], to be awarded to her champion. The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she-goat, [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], who suckled Zeus as an infant. These forearm guards have thus far proven NIGH-indestructible (the Omega Beams of Grail have proven able to shatter them), and are able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks, allowing Wonder Woman to deflect [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]] fire and energy blasts.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Wonder Woman's Magical Weapons | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=93 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=New York City | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> Diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman's ears bleed.<ref name=WW219 /> Recently, she gained the ability to channel Zeus's lightning through her bracelets as well. Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation, because they were once part of the Aegis, and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #39 (February 2010)</ref> After the 2011 relaunch of the character, it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta<ref name="Clay"/> and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from Zeus in check.<ref name="Wonder Woman"/> In addition, Hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow Wonder Woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet. Each sword, marked with a red star, takes shape from a flash of lightning, and when Wonder Woman is done with them, the swords disappear, supposedly, back into her bracelets. As such, she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows, spears and energy bolts among others.<ref>Azzarello, Brian (w), Chiang, Cliff (p), Chiang, Cliff (i). Wonder Woman (vol. 4), #15. DC Comics.</ref>

The inspiration to give Diana bracelets came from the pair of bracelets worn by Olive Byrne, creator William Moulton Marston's research assistant and lover.<ref name=Lepore/> "Wonder Woman and her sister Amazons have to wear heavy bracelets to remind them of what happens to a girl when she lets a man conquer her," quoted Marston in a 1942 interview. "The Amazons once surrendered to the charm of some handsom Greeks and what a mess they got themselves into. The Greeks put them in chains of the Hitler type, beat them, and made them work like horses in the fields. Aphrodite, goddess of love, finally freed these unhappy girls. But she laid down the rule ("Aphrodite's Law") that they must never surrender to a man for any reason. I know of no better advice to give modern day women than this rule that Aphrodite gave the Amazon girls."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://joshua.hamman.org/2009/04/wonder-woman-1942-interview-w-william-moulton-marston/|title=Wonder Woman 1942 interview w/ William Moulton Marston|date=April 7, 2009}}</ref>

====Lasso of Truth====
{{main|Lasso of Truth}}
The ''Lasso of Truth'', or ''Lasso of Hestia'', was forged by [[Hephaestus]] from the golden girdle of Gaea.<ref name="Beatty2003" /> The original form of the Lasso in the Golden Age was called the Magic Lasso of Aphrodite. It compels all beings who come into contact with it to tell the absolute truth and is virtually indestructible;<ref name="Beatty2003" /> in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', [[Green Arrow]] mistakenly describes it as "the only lie detector designed by Zeus." The only times it has been broken were when Wonder Woman herself refused to accept the truth revealed by the lasso, such as when she confronted [[Rama Khan]] of Jarhanpur,<ref>''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #62 (March 2002)</ref> and by [[Bizarro]] in [[Matt Wagner]]'s non-canonical ''[[Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wagner | first=Matt | author-link= Matt Wagner | title=Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity | publisher=DC Comics | date=July 1, 2005 | isbn=978-1-4012-0187-6}}</ref> During the Golden Age, the original form of the Lasso had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them, even overriding the mind control of others; this was effective enough to defeat strong-willed beings like [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''War of the Gods'' #1 (September 1991). DC Comics.</ref> Diana wields the Lasso with great precision and accuracy and can use it as a whip or noose.

====Other items====
[[File:Purple Ray origin.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Diana rescues [[Steve Trevor]] from the sea and frantically creates the Purple Ray in order to heal him.]]

Diana occasionally uses additional weaponry in formal battle, such as ceremonial golden armour with golden wings, [[pteruges]], chestplate, and golden helmet in the shape of an eagle's head. She possesses a magical sword forged by [[Hephaestus]] that is sharp enough to cut the electrons off an atom.<ref name="Beatty2003"/> As early as the 1950s,<ref name="Showcase Presents Wonder Woman 2007">{{Cite book | last=Kanigher | first=Robert | title=Showcase Presents: Wonder Woman, Vol. 1 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | date=August 22, 2007 | isbn=978-1-4012-1373-2}}</ref> Wonder Woman's tiara has also been used as a razor-edged throwing weapon, returning to her like a boomerang.<ref name="Beatty2003"/> The tiara allows Wonder Woman to be invulnerable from telepathic attacks, as well as allowing her to telepathically contact people such as the Amazons back on Themyscira using the power of the red [[star ruby]] in its center.<ref name=WW219/> As a temporary inductee into the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphires]], Wonder Woman gained access to the violet power ring of love. This ring allowed her to alter her costume at will, create solid-light energy constructs, and reveal a person's true love to them. She was able to combine the energy with her lasso to enhance its ability.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} She also possessed a [[Mental Radio]] that could let her receive messages from those in need.<ref name="Sensation Comics #1"/>

Since her comic book debut in October 1941, Wonder Woman has appeared in a number of adaptations. These formats include films, television shows, and video games.

In the fine arts, and starting with the [[Pop art|Pop Art]] period and on a continuing basis since the 1960s, the character has been "appropriated" by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, most notably by [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Mel Ramos]], [[Dulce Pinzon]], and others<ref>{{Cite web|last=Art|first=Jim Kempner Fine|title=Ramos, Mel|url=https://jimkempnerfineart.com/mel-ramos.php|access-date=2020-07-13|website=Jim Kempner Fine Art|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=FEIDEN|first=DOUGLAS|title=Photographer Dulce Pinzon portrays immigrants as superheroes, showing off their successes with flying colors|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/photog-captures-super-heroics-immigs-article-1.1199813|access-date=2020-07-13|website=New York Daily News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Heartney|first1=Eleanor|last2=Heartney|first2=Eleanor|date=2015-04-14|title=POW!

Although created to be a positive role-model and a strong female character for girls and boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://superdames.org/image/121510631426|title=Superdames!: Photo|website=superdames.org}}</ref> Wonder Woman has had to deal with the [[misogyny]] that was commonplace in comic book industry for decades. For example, Wonder Woman was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]]. This roster included the original Flash and Green Lantern. Wonder Woman was an experienced leader and easily the most powerful of them all, yet was rendered a secretary. This would also be accompanied with her losing her powers or [[damsel in distress|getting captured]] on most Justice League adventures. During the 1950s and 1960s, comic writers regularly made Wonder Woman lovesick over [[Steve Trevor]], a Major in the United States Army. Stories frequently featured Wonder Woman hoping or imagining what it would be like to marry Steve Trevor.

In the controversial ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]] claimed Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a [[lesbian]] in a condemning way.<ref>{{citation|last=Wertham| first=Fredric |year=1954| title=Seduction of the Innocent| publisher=Rinehart & Company, Inc.|pages=192, 234–235}}</ref><!--Please keep these concise; redirect details to "Cultural impact of Wonder Woman"-->

[[Feminism|Feminist]] icon [[Gloria Steinem]], founder of [[Ms. (magazine)|''Ms.'' magazine]], was responsible for the return of Wonder Woman's original abilities.

However, Steinem disapproved of Wonder Woman being out of costume, and the controversial story line never happened.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/colloquy/download/colloquy_issue_twenty-four_/matsuuchi.pdf |title=Wonder Woman Wears Pants: ''Wonder Woman'', Feminism and the 1972 'Women's Lib' Issue| first=Ann |last=Matsuuchi| journal=Colloquy: Text Theory Critique| issue=24 |year=2012|publisher=archived at [[Monash University]]}}</ref>

The original significance of Wonder Woman had the intentions of influencing many women of all ages, displaying the physical and mental strengths, values, and ethical attributes that not only men acquire. "Wonder Woman symbolizes many of the values of the women's culture that feminists are now trying to introduce into the mainstream: strength and self-reliance for women; sisterhood and mutual support among women; peacefulness and esteem for human life; a diminishment both of 'masculine' aggression and of the belief that violence is the only way of solving conflicts," Steinem wrote at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2016/10/12/wonder-woman-75-how-superhero-icon-inspired-generation-feminists?cid=inbody:wonder-woman-new-trailer-goes-deeper-into-dianas-backstory|title=Wonder Woman at 75: How the superhero icon inspired a generation of feminists|work=SBS Movies|access-date=April 12, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413080743/http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2016/10/12/wonder-woman-75-how-superhero-icon-inspired-generation-feminists?cid=inbody:wonder-woman-new-trailer-goes-deeper-into-dianas-backstory|archive-date=April 13, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Marc DiPaolo introduces us to Wonder Woman's creator and history and he demonstrates how she is a "WWII veteran, a feminist icon, and a sex symbol" all throughout her "career". Wonder Woman stars in multiple films and is most commonly known for her red, white and blue one piece, and her tall, sexy assertiveness. What many people don't know is that she is a big part of history in the comic and superhero world because of how her character influences real life people of all ages, sexes, ethnicities, and races.

After the release of the 2017 film ''Wonder Woman'', many bloggers noted what they felt made ''Wonder Woman'' a feminist icon in the film. Zoe Williams for ''The Guardian'' said, "Yes, she is sort of naked a lot of the time, but this isn't objectification so much as a cultural reset: having thighs, actual thighs you can kick things with, not thighs that look like arms, is a feminist act. The whole Diana myth, women safeguarding the world from male violence not with nurture but with better violence, is a feminist act. Casting Robin Wright as Wonder Woman's aunt, re-imagining the battle-axe as a battler with an axe, is a feminist act. A female German chemist trying to destroy humans (in the shape of Dr Poison, a proto-Mengele before Nazism existed) might be the most feminist act of all."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/05/why-wonder-woman-is-a-masterpiece-of-subversive-feminism|title=Why Wonder Woman is a masterpiece of subversive feminism|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2017-06-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Alyssa Rosenberg for ''The Washington Post'' said, "...{{nbsp}}None of these experiences crushed me, of course, but I do wonder what it might have been like if they hadn't happened.The power of Wonder Woman, and one of the things that gives Jenkins's adaptation of the character such a lift, is in the answer to that question. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) doesn't have any idea what women and men are — or aren't — supposed to do. Even when she does encounter other people's ideas about gender roles, she doesn't automatically accept them, and she never lets anyone stop her. And the movie goes a step further and argues that it's not merely little girls all over the world who stand to gain if they can grow up free of the distorting influence of misogyny: a world like that would be liberating and wonderful for men in lots of ways, too."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/06/05/wonder-woman-is-a-beautiful-reminder-of-what-feminism-has-to-offer-women-and-men/|title=Opinion {{!}} 'Wonder Woman' is a beautiful reminder of what feminism has to offer women — and men|last=https://www.facebook.com/alyssa.rosenberg|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> Emma Gray for HuffPost said, "When it comes to pop culture, we speak often about representation; the simple yet often unfulfilled idea that it matters to see someone like you fill a variety of imagined roles on screen.

William Marston's earliest works were notorious for containing subversive "bondage and sapphic-undertones" subtext. Among Wonder Women's infamous catchphrases, "Suffering Sappho", was a direct reference to lesbianism. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' referred to her as the "lesbian counterpart to Batman" (whom he also identified as a homosexual). After Marston's death in 1947, DC Comics downplayed her sexuality and feminist origin. Wonder Women, without Marston's creative direction, become more "traditional" superhero fare; the lesbian relationships and sexual imagery disappeared from the "Wonder Woman" comic, along with Wonder Woman's super powers. During the [[Comics Code Authority]]-decades since, Wonder Woman's subversiveness had been gradually stripped away; subsequent comic book writers and artists either didn't know what do with her or barely hinted at Wonder Woman's erotic legacy.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

But under the new 1987 re-boot of the title, under the editorship of [[Karen Berger]], and with the writing and art of George Perez at the helm of the book, the same-sex appreciation by Wonder Woman and the Amazons was more than hinted-at and this was established quickly in the new run of the title. Upon her first sight of supporting character Vanessa Kapatelis (in issue #3), she is shown smiling upwards at Kapatelis, thinking to herself "I've never ''seen'' another woman quite ''like'' her...she's so ''young''...so ''vulnerable''...so ''beautiful''..."<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #3, page 18, panel 5 (April 1987)</ref> Three years later, in the first issue (#38) of a new decade, there is a story-line presenting a cultural exchange between appointed leaders from 'Man's World', who are the first mortals to visit Themyscira in this continuity, and the Amazons of Themyscira, in Themyscira, itself. The guest [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, Reverend Cantwell, asks the Amazon [[Mnemosyne]] "..."Don't you ''miss'' the ''sharing'' God intended for the sexes?" to which Mnemosyne replied "''Some'' do. They have sworn themselves to Artemis, the virgin hunter, and Athena, the chaste warrior. ''Others'' choose the way of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]. But ''most'' of us find satisfaction in each ''other'' -- three thousand years ''can'' be a long time, reverend.".<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #38, page 7, panel 6 (January 1990)</ref> Probably more than at any other time in the then nearly fifty-year history of the character, the Amazons were explicitly and unequivocally defined, in general, as lesbian. Additionally, Kevin Mayer, brother of the major supporting character Myndi Mayer, was openly gay and this was treated sympathetically.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) Annual #1, pages 39-40 (January 1990)</ref> By this time, DC Comics was a [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]-owned company, and had been for over 20 years.

Wonder Woman's signature weapon was her Lasso of Truth; consequently, much of her crime-fighting powers came from bondage, and her only exploitable weakness was, essentially, bondage. Grant Morrison and Yanick Paquette had teamed up to work on ''Wonder Woman: Earth One''.<ref name="fanbros.com"/> Paquette confirmed that he and Morrison would be bringing back the bondage theme that was popular in Wonder Woman comics during the 1940s. However, he stated that Morrison was looking for a way to not only modernize it, but to use the bondage theme as a form of [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]]. Paquette acknowledged that Wonder Woman has become more than just a beloved character, she is a symbol for feminism. "By bringing in sex and, yes, bondage, it reasserts [William Moulton Marston's core] idea that it is okay for women to have a healthy [[Libido|sexual appetite]]." Paquette elaborated more on this by pointing out the blatant double standards in comics when it comes to sex: "Could Wonder Woman really ever have a healthy and active sex life without it becoming political fodder for [[Fox News]]? And what of women and girls who want to be like her? Do we truly think they wouldn't be labeled sluts? I have my doubts."

Wonder Woman's [[BDSM|sexual and bondage themes]] in her earliest days were not without purpose, however. Her creator, William Moulton Marston, theorized that human relationships could be broken down into dominance, submission, inducement and compliance roles which were embedded into our psyche. Because males were, more often than not, dominant in societies, Marston believed that "Women as a sex, are many times better equipped to assume emotional leadership than are males."<ref>{{cite book|title=Wonder Woman Unbound : the Curious History of the World's Most Famous Heroine|first=Tim|last=Hanley|isbn=9781613749098|oclc=859187727|date=April 2014}}</ref> Marston wanted to convey his progressive ideals, through his use of bondage imagery, that women are not only capable of leadership roles, but should be in charge of society. Although Marston had good intentions with these themes, in Wonder Woman's early appearances, the bondage elements were controversial, as they were often seen to overly fetishize women in power rather than promote such women. Noah Berlatsky criticized this imagery in Wonder Woman's earliest days noting that "the comics take sensual pleasure in women’s disempowerment."<ref>{{cite book|title=Wonder Woman: New Edition with Full Color Illustrations|first=Noah|last=Berlatsky|oclc=1078908120}}</ref> Despite having the mixed messages of this imagery, Marston fiercely believed that women would soon rule the earth and meant to showcase his predictions through sexual themes in his stories. He was an open feminist while studying at Harvard where he once said "Girls are also human beings, a point often overlooked!"<ref>{{cite book |title=The secret history of wonder woman |first=Jill |last=Lepore |publisher=Vintage |year=2015 |isbn=9780804173407 |oclc=941724731}}</ref>
