'''Wonder Woman''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in American [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].<ref name="NYT-20141023" /> The character is a warrior princess of the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] (which are based on the [[Amazons]] of [[Greek mythology]]) and is known in [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|her homeland]] as '''Princess Diana of Themyscira'''. When outside her homeland, she is sometimes known by the [[secret identity]] '''[[Diana Prince]]'''. She is gifted with a wide range of superhuman powers and superior combat and battle skills. She possesses an arsenal of weapons, including the [[Lasso of Truth]], a pair of [[Wonder Woman's bracelets|indestructible bracelets]], a [[tiara]] which serves as a projectile, and (in older stories) a range of devices based on Amazon technology.

Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer [[William Moulton Marston]].<ref name="NYT-20141023" /> The character first appeared in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #8 in December 1941 and first cover-dated on ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #1, January 1942. The ''Wonder Woman'' title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously except for a brief hiatus in 1986.<ref name="Hendrix2007">{{Cite news | last=Hendrix | first=Grady | title=Out for Justice | newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] | date=December 11, 2007}}</ref> Her depiction as a heroine fighting for justice, love, peace, and [[gender equality]] has led to Wonder Woman being widely considered a [[Feminism|feminist icon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Curiel|first=Jonathan|title=Is Wonder Woman a Feminist Icon?

Wonder Woman has also regularly appeared in comic books featuring the superhero teams [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] (from 1941) and [[Justice League]] (from 1960).<ref name="schoollibraryjournal.com">{{cite web |last=Crawford |first=Philip |title=The Legacy of Wonder Woman |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6417196.html |date= |publisher=School Library Journal |accessdate=March 1, 2007 }}</ref>

In addition to the comics, the character has appeared in other media; most notably, the 1975–1979 [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|''Wonder Woman'' TV series]] starring [[Lynda Carter]], as well as [[animation|animated]] series such as the ''[[Super Friends]]'' and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''. Since Carter's television series, studios struggled to introduce a new live-action Wonder Woman to audiences, although the character continued to feature in a variety of toys and merchandise, as well as animated adaptations of DC properties, including a [[Wonder Woman (2009 film)|direct-to-DVD animated feature]]. Attempts to return Wonder Woman to television have included a [[Wonder Woman (2011 TV pilot)|pilot for NBC]] in 2011, closely followed by another stalled production for [[The CW]].<ref name="Vulture 2012-09">{{cite news|last=Adalian|first=Josef|title=The CW Is Developing a Wonder Woman Origins Series|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/09/cw-is-developing-wonder-woman-origins-series.html|accessdate=September 16, 2012 |date=September 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2013/07/cw-eyes-flash-series-with-arrows-greg-berlanti-andrew-kreisberg-david-nutter|title=CW Eyes 'Flash' Series With 'Arrow's Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg & David Nutter|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref> In 2013, [[Warner Bros.]] announced that actress [[Gal Gadot]] would portray Wonder Woman in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]],'' marking the character's feature film debut after over 70 years of history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://variety.com/2013/film/news/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-batman-vs-superman-1200918310/ |title=Gal Gadot to Play Wonder Woman in ‘Batman vs. Superman’|last=Kroll|first=Justin|publisher=''[[Variety (newspaper)|Variety]]''|date=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Main|Publication history of Wonder Woman}}
<!--This section is meant to be short for a reason. The main article is where all the details go.-->

===Creation===
In an October 25, 1940 interview with the ''Family Circle'' magazine, [[William Moulton Marston]] discussed the unfulfilled potential of the comic book medium.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=Charles|title=Suffering Sappho! A Look at the Creator & Creation of Wonder Woman|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7921|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=August 23, 2006|quote=In October 1940, the popular women's magazine "Family Circle" published an interview with Marston entitled "Don't Laugh at the Comics," in which the psychologist discussed the unfulfilled potential of the medium.}}</ref> This article caught the attention of comics publisher [[Max Gaines]], who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodicals and [[All-American Publications]], two of the companies that would merge to form [[DC Comics]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=Charles|title=Suffering Sappho! A Look at the Creator & Creation of Wonder Woman|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7921|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=August 23, 2006|quote=Maxwell Charles Gaines, then publisher of All-American Comics, saw the interview and offered Marston a job as an educational consultant to All-American and sister company DC Comics.}}</ref> At that time, it was suggested to Marston that he create his own new superhero; Marston's wife [[Elizabeth Holloway Marston|Elizabeth]] suggested to him that it should be a female:<ref name="Bostonia">{{cite web | last=Lamb | first=Marguerite | date=Fall 2001 | url=http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208045132/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/| archivedate=December 8, 2007 | title=Who Was Wonder Woman? | work=Bostonia }}</ref>

{{Quote|William Moulton Marston, a psychologist already famous for inventing the [[polygraph]] (forerunner to the magic lasso), struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero, one who would triumph not with fists or firepower, but with love. "Fine," said Elizabeth. "But make her a woman."}}

Marston introduced the idea to Gaines, co-founder of [[All-American Publications]]. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed ''Wonder Woman'' with Elizabeth, whom Marston believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman.<ref name="Bostonia" /> Marston was also inspired by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a [[polyamorous]] relationship.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Les | last=Daniels | title=Wonder Woman: The Complete History | publisher=Chronicle Books | date=April 6, 2004 | pages=28–30 | isbn=978-0-8118-4233-4}}</ref> Both women greatly influenced the character's creation.<ref name="Bostonia"/> Wonder Woman debuted in All Star Comics #8 (December 1941), scripted by Marston.

[[Image:SensationComics.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #1 (January 1942) was Wonder Woman's first cover appearance.]]
Marston was the creator of a systolic-blood-pressure-measuring apparatus, which was crucial to the development of the polygraph ([[polygraph|lie detector]]). Marston's experience with polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest in situations different than men and could work more efficiently.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Bunn | first=Geoffrey C. | title=The lie detector, ''Wonder Woman'', and liberty: The life and work of William Moulton Marston | journal=History of the Human Sciences | volume=10 | issue=1 | location=[[London]] | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=1997 | pages=91–119 | doi=10.1177/095269519701000105}}</ref>

"Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should, I believe, rule the world", Marston wrote.<ref name="Hendrix2007"/>

In a 1943 issue of ''[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]]'', Marston wrote:<ref>{{cite web|last=Tartakovsky|first=Margarita|title=A Psychologist and A Superhero|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/05/17/a-psychologist-and-a-superhero/|publisher=Psych Central}}</ref>

{{Quote|Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power. Not wanting to be girls, they don't want to be tender, submissive, peace-loving as good women are. Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.}}

Initially, Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return [[Steve Trevor]]{{spaced ndash}}a [[United States]] intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons' isolated island homeland{{spaced ndash}}to "Man's World" and to fight crime and the evil of the [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref name="All star comics 1">{{cite book | title=All Star Comics | publisher=DC Comics | year=1941  | volume=1 | issue=8}}</ref>

During this period, Wonder Woman joined the [[Justice Society of America]] as the team's secretary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Tim|title=Wonder Woman: Secretary Of The Justice Society Of America|url=http://thanley.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/wonder-woman-secretary-of-the-justice-society-of-america/|publisher=Straitened Circumstances|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>''All Star Comics'' #12 (August/September 1942)</ref>

=== Silver and Bronze Age ===
During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], under writer [[Robert Kanigher]], Wonder Woman's origin was revamped,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #98 (May 1958)</ref> along with other characters'. The new origin story increased the character's [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenic]] and mythological roots: receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], as strong as [[Hercules]], and as swift as [[Hermes]]."<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #105 (April 1959)</ref>

At the end of the 1960s, under the guidance of [[Mike Sekowsky]], Wonder Woman surrendered her powers in order to remain in Man's World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension. Wonder Woman begins using the alias [[Diana Prince]] and opens a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] boutique. She acquires a Chinese mentor named [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]], who teaches Diana [[martial arts]] and weapons skills. Using her fighting skill instead of her powers, Diana engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #179 (1968)</ref><ref name="Reed">{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Bill|title=365 Reasons to Love Comics|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/05/365-reasons-to-love-comics-64/|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=March 5, 2007}}</ref> This phase of her story was directly influenced by the British spy thriller ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and [[Diana Rigg]]'s portrayal of [[Emma Peel]].<ref>"We were all in love with Diana Rigg and that show she was on." Mike Sekowsky, quoted in Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History'' (Chronicle, 2004), p. 129.</ref>

In the early 1970s the character returned to her superhero roots in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' and to the [[World War II]] era in her own title.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol 1 #204</ref>

=== Modern Age ===
Following the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' series, [[George Pérez]], [[Len Wein]] and [[Greg Potter]] relaunched the character, writing Wonder Woman as an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Pérez incorporated a variety of deities and concepts from Greek mythology in Wonder Woman's stories and origin. His relaunch of the character acted as the foundation for the more modern Wonder Woman stories as he expanded upon the widely accepted origin of Diana being birthed out of clay. The relaunch was a critical and commercial success.<ref>{{cite journal |author= [[Andy Mangels|Mangels, Andy]]|date= January 1, 1989|title= Triple Threat The George Pérez Interview|journal= Amazing Heroes|issue= 156|page= 30|publisher= [[Fantagraphics Books]]|quote = ''Wonder Woman's'' sales are some of the best the Amazing Amazon has ever experienced, and the book is a critical and popular success with its weaving of Greek mythology into a feminist and humanistic atmosphere.}}</ref>

In August 2010 (issue #600), [[J. Michael Straczynski]] took over the series' writing duties and introduced Wonder Woman to an alternate timeline created by the Gods in which Paradise Island had been destroyed and the Amazons scattered around the world.<ref name="Who destroyed Paradise Island">{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/04/15/who-destroyed-paradise-island/ |title= Who destroyed Paradise Island? |publisher= DC Comics|date= April 15, 2010|accessdate= May 23, 2012 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t6ZHTeN|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl=}}</ref> In this timeline, Diana is an orphan raised in New York who is learning to cope with her powers. The entire world has forgotten Wonder Woman's existence and the main story of this run was of Diana trying to restore reality even though she does not properly remember it herself. A trio of Death Goddesses called [[List of Wonder Woman enemies|The Morrigan]] acted as the main enemy of Wonder Woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jms-talks-wonder-woman-100629.html |title= JMS Talks ''Wonder Woman's'' New Look and New Direction |first= Vaneta|last= Rogers|publisher=Newsarama|date= June 29, 2010 |accessdate= May 23, 2012 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t75Mih3 |archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Richard|last= George |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/110/1102826p2.html |title= Wonder Woman's New Era|publisher= IGN|date= July 7, 2010|accessdate= May 23, 2012|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t99HyMP|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl= }}</ref> In this run, Wonder Woman wore a [[Wonder Woman#Outfit|new costume]] designed by Jim Lee.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/books/30wonder.html | publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|last = Gustines|first = George Gene|authorlink = George Gustines| title= Makeover for Wonder Woman at 69 | date=June 29, 2010|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t9tT8Aw|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate = May 23, 2012}}</ref> Straczynski determined the plot and continued writing duties till Wonder Woman #605; writer [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]] then continued his run, which ultimately concluded in Wonder Woman #614.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ching|first = Albert|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jms-earth-one-sequel-101110.html |title= JMS Leaving ''Superman'' and ''Wonder Woman'' for ''Earth One'' Sequel |publisher=Newsarama|date= November 10, 2010|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67tAnOCPx|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= May 23, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2011, DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched its entire line of publications]] to attract a new generation of readers. [[Brian Azzarello]] and [[Cliff Chiang]] were assigned on writing and art duties respectively and revamped the character's history considerably. In this new continuity, Wonder Woman wears a costume similar to her original costume, but has a completely new origin. No longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods, she is, instead, a [[goddess]] and the natural-born daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]].

== Storylines ==

=== Golden Age ===
In her debut in ''All Star Comics'' #8, Diana was a member of a tribe of women named the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], native to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]{{spaced ndash}}a secluded island set in the middle of a vast ocean. [[Steve Trevor|Captain Steve Trevor]]'s plane crashes on the island and he is found alive but unconscious by Diana and a fellow Amazon. Diana has him nursed back to health and falls in love with him. A competition is held amongst all the Amazons by Diana's mother, the Queen of the Amazons [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyte]], in order to determine who is the most worthy of all the women; Hippolyte charges the winner with the responsibility of delivering Captain Steve Trevor back to man's world and to fight for justice. Hippolyte forbids Diana from entering the competition, but she takes part nonetheless, wearing a mask to conceal her identity. She wins the competition and reveals herself, surprising Hippolyte, who ultimately gives in to Diana's wish to go to Man's World. She then safely returns Steve Trevor back to his home and is awarded a special dress made by her mother for her new role as Wonder Woman.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist =[[Harry G.

Coming to America for the first time, Wonder Woman comes upon a weeping army nurse named Diana Prince. Inquiring about her state, she finds that the nurse wanted to leave for South America with her fiancé but was unable to due to shortage of money. As both of them looked identical and Wonder Woman needed a job and a valid identity to look after Steve (who was admitted in the same army hospital), she gives her the money she had earned earlier to help her go to her fiancé in exchange for her credentials. The nurse reveals her name as Diana Prince, and thus, Wonder Woman's secret identity was created, and she began working as a nurse in the army.<ref name="Gutierrez">{{cite web|last=Gutierrez|first=Jon|title=The 6 Worst Jobs Wonder Woman Ever Had|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/03/the_6_worst_jobs_wonder_woman_ever_had.php|publisher=Topless Robot|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist= [[Harry G.

Wonder Woman then took part in a variety of adventures, mostly side by side with Trevor. Her most common foes during this period would be [[Nazi forces]] led by a German baroness named [[Paula von Gunther]], occasionally evil deities/demigods such as [[Ares (comics)|Mars]] and the [[Duke of Deception]], and then supervillains like [[Angle Man]], [[Doctor Psycho]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|the Cheetah]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=When We First Met{{spaced ndash}}Wonder Woman's Golden Age Rogues|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/28/when-we-first-met-wonder-womans-golden-age-rogues/|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Silver Age===
In the Silver Age, Wonder Woman's history received several changes.

''Wonder Woman'' Vol 1 Issue #179 (Nov. 1968) showed Wonder Woman giving up her powers and returning her costume and title to her mother in order to continue staying in Man's World. The reason behind this was that all the Amazons were shifting to another dimension, but Diana was unable to accompany them as she needed to stay behind to help Steve, who had been wrongly convicted .<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Denny O'Neil| penciller=Mike Sekowsky| inker=Dick Giordano| story=Wonder Woman's Last Battle| title=Wonder Woman| vol=1| issue=179| date=November 1968}}</ref> Thus, she no longer held the title of Wonder Woman and after meeting and training under a blind martial arts mentor [[I Ching (comics)|I-Ching]], Diana resumed fighting crime as the powerless Diana Prince.

The events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' greatly changed and altered the history of the [[DC Universe]]. Wonder Woman's history and origin were considerably revamped by the event. Wonder Woman was now an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] (the new name for Paradise Island) to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Various deities and concepts from [[Greek mythology]] were blended and incorporated into Wonder Woman's stories and origin. Diana was formed out of clay of the shores of Themyscira by Hippolyta, who wished for a child; the clay figure was then brought to life by the Greek deities. The Gods then blessed and granted her unique powers and abilities{{spaced ndash}}beauty from Aphrodite, strength from Demeter, wisdom from Athena, speed and flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts from Artemis and sisterhood with fire and the ability to discern the truth from Hestia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Colluccio|first=Ali|title=Top 5: Wonder Woman Reboots|url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/top-5-wonder-woman-reboots/|publisher=iFanboy|accessdate=April 10, 2012|quote=After she was "erased" from existence in the final pages of Crisis on Infinite Earths, George Perez, Len Wein and Greg Potter brought the Amazon Princess back to the DC Universe. While the basics of the story remained the same, Wonder Woman;s powers were adjusted to include Beauty from Aphrodite, Strength from Demeter, Wisdom from Athena, Speed and Flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter from Artemis, and Truth from Hestia. This run established Paradise Island as the mythical Amazon capital, Themyscira. Perez's Diana is not only strong and smart, but graceful and kind{{spaced ndash}}the iconic Wonder Woman.}}</ref> Due to the reboot, Diana's operating methods were made distinctive from Superman and Batman's with her willingness to use [[deadly force]] when she judges it necessary. In addition, her previous history and her marriage to Steve Trevor were erased. Trevor was introduced as a man much older than Diana who would later on marry [[Etta Candy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mozzocco|first=J.

Starting in ''Wonder Woman'' Vol 2 #51, The Amazons, who had revealed their presence to the world in ''Wonder Woman'' Vol 2 #50, are blamed for a series of murders and for the theft of various artifacts. The Amazons are then taken into custody, Queen Hippolyta is nowhere to be found and Steve Trevor is forced by General Yedziniak to attack Themyscira. These events lead to the "[[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]" occurring. The culprit of the murders, thefts and the framing of the Amazons is revealed to be the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], who "kills" Diana by reverting her form back into the clay she was born from.

After the events of Convergence, Wonder Woman would don a new costume. She would also face Donna Troy, who is now reimagined as a villanous doppellganger created by a vengeful Amazon elder, not only to physically defeat Wonder Woman but also to outmaneuver her in Themyscirian politics.

====Earth 2====
[[The New 52]] version of [[Earth-Two#The New 52|Earth 2]] was introduced in ''Earth 2'' #1 (2012). In that issue, the Earth 2 Wonder Woman is introduced via flashback. She, along with [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], are depicted dying in battle with forces from [[Apokolips]] five years in the past.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/who-is-who-on-earth-2.html| title= Who's Who on EARTH 2| work=Newsarama.com | accessdate=January 9, 2013}}</ref> This Wonder Woman worshiped the deities of Roman mythology as opposed to the Greek; the Roman gods perish as a result of the conflict.

==Secret identity==
[[File:WonderWoman1970s.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|A Wonder Woman without special powers fighting crime as Diana Prince. Cover to Wonder Woman Vol 1#189 (July 1970), art by [[Mike Sekowsky]].]]
Wonder Woman has used the alias '''Diana Prince''', created by William Moulton Marston, as her secret identity.

During Marston's run, Diana Prince was the name of an army nurse whom Wonder Woman met. The nurse wanted to meet her fiancé, who was transferred to South America, but was unable to arrange for money to do so. As Wonder Woman needed a secret identity to monitor and look after Steve (who was admitted in the same army hospital Diana Prince worked at), and because both of them looked a lot like each other, Wonder Woman gave the nurse money to go to her fiancé in exchange for the nurse's credentials and took Diana Prince as her alias.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> She started to work as an army nurse and later as an Air Force secretary.<ref name="Gutierrez"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Love Ya but You're Strange – That Time the Husband of Wonder Woman's Exact Double Chained Her to a Table|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/07/12/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-that-time-the-husband-of-wonder-womans-exact-double-chained-her-to-a-table/|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>

The identity of Diana Prince was especially prominent in a series published in the 1960s, in which she fought crime only under the Prince alias and without her mystic powers. To support herself, she ran a mod clothing boutique.<ref name="Hanley"/><ref name="Diana's Memory Album"/>

The Diana Prince alias also played an important role after the events of Infinite Crisis. Wonder Woman was broadcast worldwide killing a villain named [[Maxwell Lord]], as he was mind controlling Superman into killing Batman. When Wonder Woman caught him in her lasso, demanding to know how to stop Superman, Maxwell revealed that the only way to stop him was to kill Lord, so as a last resort Diana snapped his neck.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) Issue #219</ref><ref name="Goldstein">{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|title=Defending Wonder Woman|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/01/defending-wonder-woman|publisher=IGN|accessdate=August 1, 2005}}</ref> To recover from the trauma of killing another person, the Amazon went into a self-imposed exile for one year.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref> On her return to public life, Diana realized that her life as a full-time celebrity superhero and ambassador had kept her removed from humanity. Because of this she assumed the persona of Diana Prince and became an agent at the Department of Metahuman Affairs. During a later battle with the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], a spell was placed on Diana leaving her powerless when not in the guise of Wonder Woman.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =Allan Heinberg| penciller =Terry Dodson| inker =Rachel Dodson| story = Who Is Wonder Woman Part 5| title = Wonder Woman Annual| volume = 3| issue = 1

In the current New 52 universe, Diana does not have a secret identity as stated in an interview by series writer Brian Azzarello.<ref>{{cite web|last=Azzarello|first=Brian|title=No, she (Wonder Woman) doesn't (have a secret identity|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/21/the-new-52-interviews-wonder-woman|publisher=IGN|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref> However, when she and Superman began dating, for her civilian identity she uses the Diana Prince alias whenever she is around Clark Kent such as when she introduced herself to [[Lois Lane]] at Lois's housewarming party under that name.<ref>''Superman'' (Volume 3) #19</ref>

==Characterization==
Many writers have depicted Diana in different personalities and tone; between that of a warrior, a highly compassionate and calm ambassador, and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person, depending on the writer. What has remained constant is her humanity: feeling compassion and giving love without discrimination.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} This trait had been the reason for her induction into the Star Sapphires.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (2010)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Star Sapphires|url=http://www.wonderali.com/2010/01/welcome-to-the-star-sapphires-2/|publisher=WonderAli|accessdate=January 11, 2010|author=WonderAli}}</ref>

Writer [[Gail Simone]] was applauded for her portrayal of Wonder Woman during her run on the series, with comic book reviewer Dan Phillips of [[IGN]] noting that "she's molded Diana into a very relatable and sympathetic character."<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Dan|title=Wonder Woman #16 review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/24/wonder-woman-16-review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

In the Golden Age, Wonder Woman adhered to an amazon code of helping any in need, even woman haters; and never accepting a reward for saving someone;<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist= [[Harry G. Peter]] |title=Wonder Woman #38  | page=5 | publisher= [[All American Comics]]| date=1949}}</ref> while conversely, the modern version of the character has been shown to perform lethal and fatal actions when left with no other alternative, exemplified in the killing of Maxwell Lord in order to save Superman's life.<ref name="Goldstein"/><ref>Wonder Woman (vol. 2) Issue #219</ref>

The New 52 version of the character has been portrayed to be a more young, headstrong, loving, fierce and wilful person.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Brian Azzarello stated in a video interview with DC Comics that they're building a very "confident", "impulsive" and "good-hearted" character in her. He referred to her trait of feeling compassion as both her strength and weakness.<ref>{{cite video |people= Azzarello|year= 2012 |title= NYCC 2012; Wonder Woman 101|url=http://www.dccomics.com/videos/nycc-2012-wonder-woman-101 |medium= |trans_title= |publisher=DC Comics|location=New York Comic Con  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= Wonder Woman's greatest strength is her compassion; her greatest weakness is her compassion |ref= }}</ref>

A distinctive element of her characterization is a group of signature mythological exclamations, such as "'''Great Aphrodite!'''" (historically the very first one), "'''Great Hera!'''",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cronin|first1=Brian|title=When We First Met – When Did Wonder Woman First Fly Her Invisible Jet?|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/06/17/when-we-first-met-when-did-wonder-woman-first-fly-her-invisible-jet/|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=26 November 2014|quote=In ''Wonder Woman'' #6, she says “Great Hera,” which soon became one of her top phrases…}}</ref> "'''Merciful Minerva!'''", and "'''Suffering Sappho!'''", some of which were contributed by Elizabeth Holloway Marston.<ref name="kpollitt">Pollitt, Katha.

==Powers and abilities==

===Pre-Crisis===
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] had strength that was comparable to the Golden Age Superman. Wonder Woman was capable of bench pressing 15,000 pounds even before she'd earned her bracelets, and later hoisted a 50,000 pound boulder above her head to inspire amazons facing the test.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist= [[Harry G. Peter]] |title= Wonder Woman #13  | pages=3-5 | publisher= [[All American Comics]]| date=1945}}</ref> Another example of her great strength was when she was able to tear a steel door off its hinges.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #6 (June 1942)</ref> In one of her earliest appearances, she is shown running easily at 60&nbsp;mph, and later jumps from a building and lands on the balls of her feet.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist= [[Harry G. Peter]] |title= [[Sensation Comics]] #1  | pages=5-7 | publisher= [[All American Comics]]| date=1942}}</ref>

She was able to heal faster than a normal human being due to her birthright consumption of water from Paradise Island's Fountain of Eternal Youth.

Her strength would be removed in accordance with "Aphrodite's Law" if she allowed her bracelets to be bound or chained by a male.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.superdickery.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=559:more-crap-about-aphrodites-law&catid=34:suffering-sappho-index&Itemid=39 | title=Panel featuring Aphrodite's Law | work=SuperDickery.com | accessdate=September 3, 2008}}</ref>

She also had an array of mental and psychic abilities, as corresponding to Dr. Marston's interest in parapsychology and mysticism. Such an array included ESP, astral projection, telepathy (with or without the [[Mental Radio]]), mental control over the electricity in her body, the Amazonian ability to turn brain energy into muscle power, etc.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist= [[Harry G.

Peter]] |title= Wonder Woman #5  | pages=14-15 | publisher= J.R. Publishing Co| date=1943}}</ref>

''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #105 revealed that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons, given life and imbued with the attributes of four of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[god]]s (otherwise known as the [[Greek pantheon|Olympian deities]]) as gifts. "Beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], swifter than [[Hermes]], and stronger than [[Hercules]]", making her the strongest of the amazons.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> Wonder Woman's Amazon training gave her limited [[telepathy]], profound scientific knowledge,<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> and the ability to speak every language known to man and beyond{{spaced ndash}}even [[caveman]]<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/><ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #115">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #115 (July 1960)</ref> and [[Martian]] language.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #115"/>

Between 1966 and 1967, new powers were added, such as super breath and telepathy.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Michael L. | last=Fleisher | title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 2: Wonder Woman | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] | date=September 1976 | isbn=978-0-02-080080-4}}</ref>

In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]] and [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze]] ages of comics, Wonder Woman was able to further increase her strength. In times of great need, removing her bracelets would temporarily augment her power tenfold, but cause her to go insane in the process.<ref>[http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww166.htm ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #166] (November 1966), [http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww229.htm ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #229] (March 1977)</ref>

These powers received changes after the events of [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

===Post-Crisis===
In the Post-Crisis universe, Wonder Woman receives her powers as a blessing from [[Greek pantheon|Olympian deities]] just like the silver age version before, but with changes to some of her powers:<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1987)</ref>
* [[Demeter]], the goddess of agriculture and fertility, blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]], making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DC Universe and the strongest female heroine of all in the [[DC Universe]]. Although, now Diana is currently the daughter of Zeus, king of the Greek Gods, so it's unclear as to how much of her power and strength is a direct result of her divine heritage.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://entertainment.time.com/2013/12/04/and-the-new-wonder-woman-is/|title = And the New Wonder Woman Is…|publisher= Time|date=December 4, 2013}}</ref> Her connection to the earth allows her to heal at an accelerated rate so long as she is in contact with the planet. However, as mentioned earlier, now that she is a Demigoddess, its been suggested that she heals extremely quickly also due to her divine heritage. In rare cases where she has been gravely injured, Diana showed the ability to physically merge with the earth, causing whatever injuries or poisons to be expelled from her body; such an act is considered sacred, and can only be used in extreme cases.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia">{{Cite book | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>
* [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], the goddess of wisdom and war, granted Diana great wisdom, intelligence, and military prowess. Athena's gift has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages (including those of alien origin), multiple complex crafts, sciences and philosophies, as well as leadership, military strategy, and armed and unarmed combat. More recently, Athena bound her own eyesight to Diana's, granting her increased empathy.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Johns | first=Geoff | author-link=Geoff Johns | title=Wonder Woman: Land of the Dead | date=February 2006 | isbn=978-1-4177-5102-0}}</ref>
* [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt, animals, and the Moon, graced Diana with the Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts. The Eyes of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses, including telescopic vision and super hearing.
* [[Hestia]], goddess of hearth and home, granted Diana sisterhood with fire. This power has been shown to control the "Fires of Truth", which Diana wields through her lasso, making anyone bound by it unable to lie.<ref name="Beatty2003" /> This ability also grants her resistance to both normal and supernatural fire.
* [[Hermes]], the messenger god of speed, granted Diana superhuman speed and the ability to fly.<ref name="Beatty2003">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | title=Wonder Woman: The Ultimate Guide to the Amazon Princess | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | date=November 2003 | isbn=978-0-7894-9616-4}}</ref> She is capable of flying at speeds approaching half the speed of light.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia"/> She can react quickly enough to deflect bullets, lasers, and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets.

Her physical body reacts to whatever happens to her on the mythical astral plane, leaving her body cut, bruised, or sometimes strengthened once her mind and body are reunited. She can apparently leave the planet through meditation, and did this once to rescue Artemis while she was in hell.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #56, #75, #77, #97 (July 1991&nbsp;– May 1995); ''Wonder Woman Special'' #1 (May 1992); ''[[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall#Requiem|Artemis: Requiem]]'' #1 (June 1996)</ref>

After the [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]], Diana has gained new powers. As the natural born daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus, she has inherited some of her father's powers, which are suppressed by wearing her bracelets. She uses these powers in battle against Artemis (the Goddess; not the Amazon) and quickly renders her unconscious with ease with a series of carefully positioned counterattacks. While using her godly strength, her costume and accoutrements lit up and her eyes glowed like her father's.<ref name="thanley.wordpress.com"/><ref name="Wonder Woman"/>{{Better source|reason=Wordpress is not 100% legible|date=February 2014}} After becoming the God of War in the pages of ''Wonder Woman'', Diana inherits his divine abilities. Diana has not exhibited her full powers as War, but is seen in ''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #5 to slip easily into telepathic rapport with a soldier, explaining "I am War. I know all soldiers, and they know me."

===Skills and resources===
Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete, acrobat, fighter and strategist, trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat, including exclusively Amazonian martial arts. In some versions, her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso.<ref>''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'' #4 (December 2008)</ref> Batman once called her the "best melee fighter in the world".<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13 (Nov. 2007)</ref> The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #219">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #219 (September 2005)</ref> In The New 52 continuity, her superior combat skills are the result of her amazon training, as well as receiving further training from Ares, the War God, himself, since as early as her childhood.<ref name="Azzarello2"/> The Golden Age Wonder Woman also had knowledge in psychology, as did her Amazon sisters.

Diana has an arsenal of powerful god-forged weapons at her disposal, but her signature weapons are her indestructible bracelets and the [[Lasso of Truth]].

====Aegis of Athena====
Her '''bulletproof bracelets''' were formed from the remnants of [[Athena]]'s legendary shield, the [[Aegis]], to be awarded to her champion. The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she-goat, [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], who suckled Zeus as an infant. These forearm guards have thus far proven indestructible and able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks, allowing Wonder Woman to deflect [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]] fire and energy blasts.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Wonder Woman's Magical Weapons | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=93 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=[[New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> Diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman's ears bleed.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #219"/> Recently, she gained the ability to channel Zeus's lightning through her bracelets as well. Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation, because they were once part of the Aegis, and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #39 (February 2010)</ref> After the 2011 relaunch of the character, it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and [[Hippolyta]]<ref name="Clay"/> and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she has inherited from Zeus in check.<ref name="Wonder Woman"/>  In addition, Hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow Wonder Woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet. Each sword, marked with a red star, takes shape from a flash of lightning, and when Wonder Woman is done with them, the swords disappear, supposedly, back into her bracelets. As such, she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows, spears and energy bolts among others.<ref>Azzarello, Brian (w), Chiang, Cliff (p), Chiang, Cliff (i). Wonder Woman v4, #15</ref>

The idea to give Diana's bracelets came from the suggestion of Olive Byrne, creator Marston's assistant and lover.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Secret History of Wonder Woman|last = Lepore|first = Jill|publisher = Alfred A. Knopf|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-385-35404-2|location = New York|pages = }}</ref>

====Lariat of Hestia====
The '''Lasso of Truth''', or Lariat of Hestia, was forged by [[Hephaestus]] from the golden girdle of Gaea.<ref name="Beatty2003" /> It compels all beings who come into contact with it to tell the absolute truth and is virtually indestructible;<ref name="Beatty2003" /> in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', [[Green Arrow]] mistakenly describes it as "the only lie detector designed by Zeus." The only times it has been broken were when Wonder Woman herself refused to accept the truth revealed by the lasso, such as when she confronted [[Rama Khan]] of Jarhanpur,<ref>''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #62 (March 2002)</ref> and by [[Bizarro]] in [[Matt Wagner]]'s non-canonical ''[[Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wagner | first=Matt | authorlink=Matt Wagner | title=Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity | publisher=DC Comics | date=July 1, 2005 | isbn=978-1-4012-0187-6}}</ref> It also at one time had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them, even overriding the mind control of others; this was effective enough to defeat strong-willed beings like [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''War of the Gods'' #1 (September 1991)</ref> Diana wields the lasso with great precision and accuracy and can use it as a whip or noose.

====Other items====
Diana occasionally uses additional weaponry in formal battle, such as ceremonial golden armour with golden wings, pteruges, chest-plate, and golden helmet in the shape of an eagle's head. She possesses a magical sword forged by [[Hephaestus]] that is sharp enough to cut the electrons off an atom.<ref name="Beatty2003" />

As early as the 1950s,<ref name="Showcase Presents Wonder Woman 2007">{{Cite book | last=Kanigher | first=Robert | title=Showcase Presents: Wonder Woman, Vol. 1 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | date=August 22, 2007 | isbn=978-1-4012-1373-2}}</ref> Wonder Woman's '''Tiara''' has also been used as a razor-edged throwing weapon, returning to her like a boomerang.<ref name="Beatty2003" /> The Tiara allows Wonder Woman to be invulnerable from telepathic attacks. It allows for Diana to telepathically contact people such as the Amazons back on Themyscira using the telepathic power of the red [[star ruby]] in the center of her Tiara.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #219"/>

The Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age portrayals of Wonder Woman showed her using a silent and '''[[Invisible plane]]''' that could be controlled by mental command via her Tiara<ref name="Sensation Comics #1">{{cite comic| writer=[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist= [[Harry G.

During the golden age Wonder Woman possessed a [[Purple Ray]] capable of healing even a fatal gunshot wound to the brain.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist= [[Harry G. Peter]] |title= [[Sensation Comics]] #50  | page=3 | publisher= [[All American Comics]]| date=1942}}</ref> She also possessed a [[Mental Radio]] that could let her receive messages from those in need.<ref name="Sensation Comics #1"/>

As a recent temporary inductee into the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphires]], Wonder Woman gained access to the violet power ring of love. This ring allowed her to alter her costume at will, create solid-light energy constructs, and reveal a person's true love to them. She was able to combine the energy with her lasso to enhance its ability.

Wonder Woman's outfit has varied over time, although almost all of her outfit incarnations have retained some form of breastplate, tiara, bracelets and her signature five-pointed star symbols, although the movie version played by Gal Gadot features a starburst on her tiara.<ref>{{cite web|last=Strickland|first=Carol A|title=Theatrical representations of motherhood; performances of mother-subjects; breastfeeding practices on and off-stage|url=http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/costume_indices/wwcost1.html | accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref> Although Wonder Woman's outfit design was originally rooted in American symbolism and iconography, it was later explained as having more Amazon roots. During a flashback in Vol. 3, Hippolyta is shown issuing orders to have a garment created for Diana, taking inspiration from the skies on the night Diana was born; a red [[harvest moon|hunter's moon]] and a field of stars against deep blue, and the eagle breastplate being a symbol of [[Athena]]'s avian representations.

The Golden Age Wonder Woman also had a pair of red magnetic earrings which allowed her to receive messages from Queen Desira of the planet Venus.

At the time of her debut, Wonder Woman sported a red top with a golden eagle emblem, a white belt, blue star-spangled [[culottes]] and red and golden go-go boots. She originally wore a skirt; however according to Elizabeth Martson, "It was too hard to draw and would have been over her head most of the time."<ref name="Wonder Woman">{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | chapter=Origins preface | publisher= Holt, Rinehart and Winston | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}</ref> This outfit was entirely based on the American flag, as Wonder Woman at that time was purely an American icon.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963">{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Wonder Woman Throughout The Years|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26963|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}</ref> Later in 1942, Wonder Woman's outfit received a slight change{{spaced ndash}}the culottes were converted entirely into skin-tight shorts and she wore sandals.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> While earlier most of her back was exposed, during the imposition of the [[Comics Code Authority]] in the mid-1950s, Wonder Woman's outfit was rectified to make her back substantially covered, in order to comply with the Authority's rule of minimum exposure.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> During [[Mike Sekowsky]]'s run in the late 1960s, Diana surrendered her powers and started using her own skill to fight crime. She wore a series of jumpsuits as her attire, most popular of these was a white one.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> After Sekowsky's run ended in the early 1970s, Diana's roots were reverted to her old mythological ones and she wore a more modernized version of her original outfit, a predecessor to her "bathing suit" outfit.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> Later, in 1976, her white belt was turned into a yellow one.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/>

After [[Crisis On Infinite Earths]], [[George Pérez]] rebooted the character in 1987. She wore an outfit similar to her 1970s one, but now with a larger golden belt.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> This outfit continued until [[William Messner-Loebs]]' run, which had Diana pass on the role of Wonder Woman to [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]].<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> No longer Wonder Woman, Diana sported a new black biker-girl outfit designed by artist [[Mike Deodato Jr]].<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> After [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took over writing and art duties, he redesigned the Wonder Woman outfit (Diana was reinstated as Wonder Woman at the end of Loebs' run) and joined the emblem and belt together.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/>

Her outfit did not receive any prominent change until after [[Infinite Crisis]]. Similar to her chest-plate, her belt was also shaped into a '''W'''.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> This outfit continued until issue #600{{spaced ndash}}[[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s run of Wonder Woman's altered timeline changed her outfit drastically. Her outfit was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]] and included a redesigned emblem, a golden and red top, black pants and a later discontinued blue-black jacket.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/>

Another major outfit change came after DC Comics relaunched its entire line of publications, dubbing the event [[The New 52]]. Her original swimsuit outfit was restored, although the color combination of red and blue was changed to dark red and blue-black. Her chest-plate, belt and tiara were also changed from gold to a platinum or sterling silver color. She wears many accessories such as arm and neck jewelery styled as the "WW" motif. Her outfit is no longer made of fabric, as it now resembles a type of light, flexible body armor. Her boots are now blue-black rather than red. The design previously included black trousers, but they were removed and the swimsuit look was restored during the time of publication.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polo|first=Susana|title=DC Inexplicably, Quietly Changes Wonder Woman's outfit... Again|url=http://www.themarysue.com/wonder-woman-1-cover-change/|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=July 13, 2011}}</ref> A war skirt was eventually added to the outfit.

After the events of Convergence, Diana gets a new armored suit with the classic armor and tiara returning.

Wonder Woman was named the 20th greatest comic book character by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=20 | title=The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters{{spaced ndash}}Wonder Woman | work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]}}</ref>  She was ranked sixth in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 14| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

Not all reaction to Wonder Woman has been positive. In the controversial ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]] claimed Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a [[lesbian]].<ref>Wertham, Fredric (1954) '' Seduction of the Innocent''., pp. 192, 234–235, Rinehart & Company, Inc.</ref>

[[Gloria Steinem]], founder of [[Ms. (magazine)]] was responsible for the return of Wonder Woman's original abilities; offended that the most famous female superhero had been depowered, Steinem had placed Wonder Woman (in costume) on the cover of the first issue of ''[[Ms. magazine|Ms.]]'' (1972)&nbsp;– [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]], DC Comics' owner, was an investor&nbsp;– which also contained an appreciative essay about the character.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |page= 154|quote= "After nearly five years of Diana Prince's non-powered super-heroics, writer-editor Robert Kanigher and artist Don Heck restored Wonder Woman's&nbsp;... well, wonder."|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9}}</ref> Wonder Woman's powers and traditional costume, were restored in issue #204 (January–February 1973).<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In 1972, just months after [[Roe v. Wade]], science fiction author [[Samuel R.

==Alternative versions==
{{main|Cultural impact of Wonder Woman|Alternative versions of Wonder Woman}}
Wonder Woman has appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books since her initial appearance including comic strips, film, television and video games.

The first serious attempt at creating a [[live action]] series on Wonder Woman was a [[Wonder Woman (1974 film)|1974 pilot movie]]. It was written and produced by [[John D. F. Black]], and starred [[Cathy Lee Crosby]] as Wonder Woman. This incarnation of the character was blonde, wore a red and blue jumpsuit, and acted more like a secret agent rather than a superhero.<ref name="CathyLeeCrosbywwTVshowsDVD">{{cite web | url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Wonder-Woman-Cathy-Lee-Crosby-Pilot/17833 | title=Wonder Woman{{spaced ndash}}'The Cathy Lee Crosby Pilot' from 1974 Comes to DVD at Last!| publisher=TvShowsOnDVD.com | date=May 12, 2012 | accessdate=December 30, 2012 | author=Lambert, David}}</ref><ref name="CathyLeeCrosbywwHardtofindfilms">{{cite web | url=http://shop.vendio.com/HARDTOFINDFILMS/item/2078968220/index.html | title=Wonder Woman TV movie pilot DVD 1974 Cathy Lee Crosby | publisher=Hard to Find Films | accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref> This pilot was not picked up for a regular television series. A successful television series based on Wonder Woman finally emerged in 1975, airing initially on [[ABC Television Network|ABC]] for its first season and [[CBS]] for its second and third season. This version of the character was written by [[Douglas S. Cramer]], and retained significant aspects from the comic book version. It starred [[Lynda Carter]] in the lead role as Wonder Woman and originally aired from 1975 to 1979.<ref name="CathyLeeCrosbywwHardtofindfilms" /><ref name="LyndacarterWWtv,com">{{cite web | url=http://www.tv.com/shows/wonder-woman/ | title=Wonder Woman | publisher=TV.com | accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref> The show earned solid ratings and helped Wonder Woman reach the peak of her popularity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Eric|title=The History of DC Comics on TV|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/09/the-history-of-dc-comics-on-tv?page=2|publisher=IGN|accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref>

Attempts have been made to produce a television series on the character in more recent times, but none have emerged successfully yet. In 2011, NBC released a [[Wonder Woman (2011 TV pilot)|pilot]] for a television series starring [[Adrianne Palicki]] as Wonder Woman. The pilot was not taken up for a regular series however.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/05/12/nbc-rejects-wonder-woman|title=NBC rejects 'Wonder Woman'|last=Rise|first=Lynette|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref> In 2012, it was revealed that [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], [[Warner Bros.

It also features Hippolyta, Steve, Lois, and Martha Kent, and has been described as the comic realization of an idea that couldn't be brought to life during ''Smallville'''s TV run because of the ''Wonder Woman'' NBC pilot.

In animation, Wonder Woman has appeared in a variety of shows{{spaced ndash}}notably ''[[Super Friends (1973 TV series)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and Warner Premiere animated films that feature the [[Justice League]]. In 2009, Warner Premiere released the [[Wonder Woman (2009 film)|Wonder Woman animated film]] featuring [[Keri Russell]] as the voice of Wonder Woman. The film was well received.<ref>{{cite web |title = Wonder Woman (2009) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1206448-wonder_woman/ |publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = November 27, 2009 }}</ref>

Wonder Woman appeared in ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', which was released in February 2014. The character is voiced by [[Cobie Smulders]]. This marked her first theatrical film appearance.
