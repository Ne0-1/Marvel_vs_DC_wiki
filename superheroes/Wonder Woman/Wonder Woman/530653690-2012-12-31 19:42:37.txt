'''Wonder Woman''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] [[Female superheroes|superheroine]] created by psychologist and writer [[William Moulton Marston]]. She first appeared in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #8 (December 1941). The ''Wonder Woman'' title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously except for a brief hiatus in 1986.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Her depiction as a heroine fighting for justice, love, peace, and [[sexual equality]] has also led to Wonder Woman being widely considered a [[Feminism|feminist icon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Curiel|first=Jonathan|title=Is Wonder Woman a Feminist Icon?

Wonder Woman is a [[warrior princess]] of the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] (based on the [[Amazons]] of [[Greek mythology]]) and is known in her homeland as '''Diana of [[Themyscira]]'''. She is gifted with a wide range of superhuman powers and superior combat and battle skills. She also possesses an arsenal of weapons, including the [[Lasso of Truth]], a pair of [[Wonder Woman's bracelets|indestructible bracelets]], a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in some stories, an [[Invisible plane|invisible airplane]].

Created during [[World War II]], the character was initially depicted fighting the [[Axis powers|Axis military forces]], as well as an assortment of [[supervillain]]s. Since then, Wonder Woman has gained a formidable cast of enemies bent on eliminating the Amazon, including classic villains such as [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] and [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] and newer ones like [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] and [[List_of_Wonder_Woman_enemies#Teams|The Circle]], as well as many gods and monsters from Greek mythology. Wonder Woman has also regularly appeared in comic books featuring the superhero teams [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] (from 1941) and [[Justice League]] (from 1960).<ref name="schoollibraryjournal.com">{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Philip|title=The Legacy of Wonder Woman|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6417196.html|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=03/01/2007}}</ref>

In addition to the comics, the character has appeared in other media; most notably, the 1975–1979 [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|''Wonder Woman'' TV series]] starring [[Lynda Carter]], as well as [[animation|animated]] series such as the ''[[Super Friends]]'' and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''. Although a number of attempts have been made to adapt the character to live-action film, none have yet emerged from [[development hell]]. An [[Wonder Woman (film)|animated film]] was released in 2009, with [[Keri Russell]] voicing the title role. In 2011, [[Adrianne Palicki]] starred in a TV series pilot of ''Wonder Woman'' that did not get picked up due to "scheduling issues". In September 2012, it was revealed that [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], home of the long-running Superman TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', was developing a potential Wonder Woman origin TV series titled ''Amazon''.<ref name="Vulture 2012-09">{{cite news|last=Adalian|first=Josef|title=The CW Is Developing a Wonder Woman Origins Series|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/09/cw-is-developing-wonder-woman-origins-series.html|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=9/6/12}}</ref> Wonder Woman has also appeared in the form of a variety of toys, merchandise and pin-ups.

{{Main|Publication history of Wonder Woman}}
<!--This section is meant to be short for a reason. The main article is where all the details go.-->

===Creation===
In an October 25, 1940 interview with the ''Family Circle'' magazine, [[William Moulton Marston]] discussed the unfulfilled potential of the medium.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=Charles|title=Suffering Sappho! A Look at the Creator & Creation of Wonder Woman|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7921|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=August 23, 2006|quote=In October 1940, the popular women's magazine "Family Circle" published an interview with Marston entitled "Don't Laugh at the Comics," in which the psychologist discussed the unfulfilled potential of the medium.}}</ref> This article caught the attention of comics publisher [[Max Gaines]], who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodicals and [[All-American Publications]], two of the companies that would merge to form [[DC Comics]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=Charles|title=Suffering Sappho! A Look at the Creator & Creation of Wonder Woman|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7921|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=August 23, 2006|quote=Maxwell Charles Gaines, then publisher of All-American Comics, saw the interview and offered Marston a job as an educational consultant to All-American and sister company DC Comics.}}</ref> At that time, Marston decided to develop a new superhero. ''Family Circle'' published a follow-up article two years later from issue of the [[Boston University]] alumni magazine, it was Marston's wife [[Elizabeth Holloway Marston|Elizabeth]]'s idea to create a female superheroine:<ref name="Bostonia">{{cite web | last=Lamb | first=Marguerite | date=Fall 2001 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071208045132/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/wonderwoman/ | title=Who Was Wonder Woman? | work=Bostonia | archivedate=December 8, 2007}}</ref>

{{Quote|William Moulton Marston, a psychologist already famous for inventing the [[polygraph]] (forerunner to the magic lasso), struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero, one who would triumph not with fists or firepower, but with love. "Fine," said Elizabeth. "But make her a woman."}}

Marston introduced the idea to Gaines, co-founder of [[All-American Publications]]. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed ''Wonder Woman'' with Elizabeth, whom Marston believed to be a model of that era's unconventional, liberated woman.<ref name="Bostonia" /> Marston was also inspired by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a [[polygamy|polygamous]]/[[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Les | last=Daniels | title=Wonder Woman: The Complete History | publisher=Chronicle Books | date=April 6, 2004 | pages=28–30 | isbn=978-0-8118-4233-4}}</ref> Both women served as exemplars for the character and greatly influenced the character's creation.<ref name="Bostonia"/> Wonder Woman debuted in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #8 (December 1941),<ref>{{cite web|title=Wonder Woman History|url=http://www.vex.net/~dq711/wonder_woman.htm|quote=Wonder Woman was born, first appearing in 1941 (All Star Comics #8}}</ref> scripted by Marston and with art by [[H. G. Peter|Harry G. Peter]]. Wonder Woman was initially named "Suprema" in Marston's first script, but this name was dropped.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coustan|first=Dave|title=Wonder Woman's Dirty Secrets|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/comic-books/wonder-woman2.htm|publisher=HowStuffWorks|quote=In response he wrote a story called "Suprema, The Wonder Woman" which gave rise to the new Wonder Woman character (minus the name Suprema) in All Star Comics, Sensation Comics and Detective Comics.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wonder Woman|url=http://www.uky.edu/Projects/Chemcomics/html/ww_21_cov.html|quote=Marston submitted his first script about "Suprema, the Wonder Woman" to editor Sheldon Mayer in February 1941 under the pseudonym Charles Moulton.  The Suprema name was quickly dropped, and Marston selected artist Harry Peter to draw the feature, over Mayer's objections. Wonder Woman made her first appearance in All Star Comics 8 (December 1941â€“January 1942), an origin story with an unusual combination of illustrations and text.}}</ref>  

[[Image:SensationComics.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #1 (January 1942) was Wonder Woman's first cover appearance]]
Marston was the creator of a systolic-blood-pressure-measuring apparatus, which was crucial to the development of the polygraph ([[polygraph|lie detector]]). Marston's experience with polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest and reliable than men and could work more efficiently.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Bunn | first=Geoffrey C. | title=The lie detector, ''Wonder Woman'', and liberty: The life and work of William Moulton Marston | journal=History of the Human Sciences | volume=10 | issue=1 | location=[[London]] | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=1997 | pages=91–119}}</ref>

"Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should, I believe, rule the world," Marston wrote.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite news | last=Hendrix | first=Grady | title=Out for Justice | newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] | date=December 11, 2007}}</ref>

In a 1943 issue of ''[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]]'', Marston wrote:<ref>{{cite web|last=Tartakovsky|first=Margarita|title=A Psychologist and A Superhero|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/05/17/a-psychologist-and-a-superhero/|publisher=Psych Central}}</ref> 

{{Quote|Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force, strength, and power. Not wanting to be girls, they don't want to be tender, submissive, peace-loving as good women are. Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.}}

Initially, Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return [[Steve Trevor]] — a [[United States]] intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons' isolated island homeland — to "Man's World" and to fight crime and the evil of the [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref name="All star comics 1">{{cite book | title=All Star Comics | publisher=DC Comics | year=1941 | Writer=William Moulton Marston | Artist=Harry G. Peter | Story=Introducing Wonder Woman | Vol=1 | Issue=8}}</ref>

During this period, Wonder Woman joined the [[Justice Society of America]] as the team's secretary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Tim|title=Wonder Woman: Secretary Of The Justice Society Of America|url=http://thanley.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/wonder-woman-secretary-of-the-justice-society-of-america/|publisher=Straitened Circumstances|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>''All Star Comics'' #12 (August/September 1942)</ref>

=== Silver and Bronze Age ===
During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], under writer [[Robert Kanigher]], Wonder Woman's origin was revamped,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #98 (May 1958)</ref> along with other characters'. The new origin story increased the character's [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenic]] and mythological roots: receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], as strong as [[Hercules]], and as swift as [[Hermes]]."<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #105 (April 1959)</ref>

At the end of the 1960s, under the guidance of [[Mike Sekowsky]], Wonder Woman surrendered her powers in order to remain in Man's World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension. Wonder Woman begins using the alias [[Diana Prince]] and opens a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] boutique. She acquires a Chinese mentor named [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]], who teaches Diana [[martial arts]] and weapons skills. Using her fighting skill instead of her powers, Diana engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #179 (1968)</ref><ref name="Reed">{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Bill|title=365 Reasons to Love Comics|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/05/365-reasons-to-love-comics-64/|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=5 March 2007}}</ref> 

In the early 1970s the character returned to her superhero roots in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' and to the [[World War II]] era in her own title.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol 1 #204</ref>

=== Modern Age ===
Following the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' series, [[George Pérez]], [[Len Wein]], and Greg Potter relaunched the character, writing Wonder Woman as an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira]] to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Pérez incorporated a variety of deities and concepts from Greek mythology in Wonder Woman's stories and origin. His relaunch of the character acted as the foundation for the more modern Wonder Woman stories as he expanded upon the widely-accepted origin of Diana being birthed out of clay. The relaunch was a critical and commercial success.<ref>{{cite journal |author= [[Andy Mangels|Mangels, Andy]]|date= January 1, 1989|title= Triple Threat The George Pérez Interview|journal= Amazing Heroes|issue= 156|page= 30|publisher= [[Fantagraphics Books]]|quote = ''Wonder Woman's'' sales are some of the best the Amazing Amazon has ever experienced, and the book is a critical and popular success with its weaving of Greek mythology into a feminist and humanistic atmosphere.}}</ref>

In August 2010 (issue #600), [[J. Michael Straczynski]] took over the series' writing duties and introduced Wonder Woman to an alternate timeline created by the Gods in which Paradise Island had been destroyed and the Amazons scattered around the world.<ref name="Who destroyed Paradise Island">{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/04/15/who-destroyed-paradise-island/ |title= Who destroyed Paradise Island? |publisher= DC Comics|date= April 15, 2010|accessdate= May 23, 2012 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t6ZHTeN|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl=}}</ref> In this timeline, Diana is an orphan raised in New York who is learning to cope with her powers. The entire world has forgotten Wonder Woman's existence and the main story of this run was of Diana trying to restore reality even though she does not properly remember it herself. A trio of Death Goddesses called [[List of Wonder Woman enemies|the Morrigan]] acted as the main enemy of Wonder Woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jms-talks-wonder-woman-100629.html |title= JMS Talks ''Wonder Woman's'' New Look and New Direction |first= Vaneta|last= Rogers|publisher=Newsarama|date= June 29, 2010 |accessdate= May 23, 2012 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t75Mih3 |archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Richard|last= George |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/110/1102826p2.html |title= Wonder Woman's New Era|publisher= [[IGN]]|date= July 7, 2010|accessdate= May 23, 2012|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t99HyMP|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl= }}</ref> In this run, Wonder Woman wore a [[Wonder_Woman#Costume|new costume]] designed by Jim Lee.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/books/30wonder.html | publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|last = Gustines|first = George Gene|authorlink = George Gustines| title= Makeover for Wonder Woman at 69 | date=June 29, 2010|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67t9tT8Aw|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate = May 23, 2012}}</ref> Straczynski determined the plot and continued writing duties till Wonder Woman #605; writer [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]] then continued his run, which ultimately concluded in Wonder Woman #614.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ching|first = Albert|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jms-earth-one-sequel-101110.html |title= JMS Leaving ''Superman'' and ''Wonder Woman'' for ''Earth One'' Sequel |publisher=Newsarama|date= November 10, 2010|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67tAnOCPx|archivedate= May 23, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= May 23, 2012 }}</ref>

====''The New 52''====
In 2011, DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched its entire line of publications]] to attract a new generation of readers. [[Brian Azzarello]] and [[Cliff Chiang]] were assigned on writing and art duties respectively and revamped the character's history considerably. In this new continuity, Wonder Woman wears a costume similar to her original costume, but has a completely new origin. No longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods, she is, instead, a [[demigod]]dess and the natural-born daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]]. Azzarello and Chiang's revamp of the character was critically acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joey|first=Esposito|title=The Best of DC Comics in 2011|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/14/the-best-of-dc-comics-in-2011-2|publisher=IGN|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Renaud|first=Jeffrey|title=Azzarello Lowers the Boom(Tube) on Wonder Woman|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40597|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Garcia|first=Joe|title=The Best & Worst of DC Comics’ New 52, One Year Later|url=http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2012/09/05/the-best-worst-of-dc-comics-new-52-one-year-later/|publisher=Front Towards Gamer|accessdate=September 5, 2012|quote=Despite being one part of the Justice League’s “Holy Trinity,” Wonder Woman never seems to get the recognition that she deserves.

== Fictional character biography ==

=== Golden Age ===
In her debut in ''All Star Comics'' #8, Diana was a member of a tribe of female women named the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], native to [[Themyscira|Paradise Island]] - a secluded island set in the middle of a vast ocean. [[Steve Trevor|Captain Steve Trevor]]'s plane crashes on the island and he is found alive but unconscious by Diana and a fellow Amazon. Diana has him nursed back to health and falls in love with him. A competition is held amongst all the Amazons by Diana's mother, the Queen of the Amazons [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyte]] in order to determine who is the most worthy of all the women and charge the winner with the responsibility of delivering Captain Steve Trevor back to man's world and to fight for justice. However, Hippolyte forbids Diana from entering the competition - who takes part nonetheless, wearing a mask to conceal her identity. She wins the competition and reveals her identity, surprising Hippolyte, who ultimately gives in to Diana's wish to go to Man's World. She then safely returns Steve Trevor back to his home and is awarded a special dress made by her mother for her new role as Wonder Woman.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =[[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]| artist =[[Harry G.

Coming to America for the first time, Wonder Woman comes upon a weeping army nurse named Diana Prince. Inquiring about her state, she finds that the nurse wanted to leave for South America with her fiancé but was unable to due to shortage of money. As both of them looked identical and Wonder Woman needed a job and a valid identity to look after Steve (who was admitted in the same army hospital), she gives her the money she had earned earlier to help her go to her fiancé in exchange of her credentials. The nurse reveals her name as Diana Prince, and thus, Wonder Woman's secret identity was created and she started working as a nurse in the army.<ref name="Gutierrez">{{cite web|last=Gutierrez|first=Jon|title=The 6 Worst Jobs Wonder Woman Ever Had|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/03/the_6_worst_jobs_wonder_woman_ever_had.php|publisher=Topless Robot|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref> 

Wonder Woman then took part in a variety of adventures, mostly side by side with Trevor. Her most common foes during this period would be [[Nazi forces]], and sometimes villains like [[Baroness Paula Von Gunther]], [[Cheetah (comics)|The Cheetah]], [[Doctor Psycho]] and [[Duke of Deception]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=When We First Met- Wonder Woman's Golden Age Rogues|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/10/28/when-we-first-met-wonder-womans-golden-age-rogues/|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Silver Age===
In the Silver Age, Wonder Woman's history received several changes. Her earlier origin, which had significant ties to [[World War II]], was changed and her powers were shown to be the product of the [[Greek mythology|Gods']] blessings – "beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, stronger than Hercules, and swifter than Mercury"<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The complicated origin of Wonder Woman|url=http://marionetteblog.blogspot.in/2005/09/complicated-origin-of-wonder-woman.html|publisher=Dance of the Puppets|accessdate=September 28, 2005|author=MARIONETTE}}</ref>  The concepts of Wonder Girl and Wonder Tot were also introduced during this period.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Tim|title=A Book Look: Kanigher’s Giant Birds|url=https://thanley.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/a-book-look-kanigher%E2%80%99s-giant-birds/|publisher=Straitened Circumstances|accessdate=January 10, 2011}}</ref>

''Wonder Woman'' Vol 1 Issue #179 (Nov. 1968) showed Wonder Woman giving up her powers and returning her costume and title to her mother in order to continue staying in Man's World. The reason behind this was that all the Amazons were shifting to another dimension, but Diana was unable to accompany them as she needed to stay back to help a wrongly-convicted Steve.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Denny O'Neil| penciller=Mike Sekowsky| inker=Dick Giordano| story=Wonder Woman's Last Battle| title=Wonder Woman| vol=1| issue=179| date=November, 1968}}</ref> Thus, she no longer held the title of Wonder Woman and after meeting and training under a blind martial arts mentor [[I Ching (comics)|I-Ching]], Diana resumed fighting crime as the powerless Diana Prince.

[[File:Wonder woman 02.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cover to ''Wonder Woman'' Vol 2 #1 (Feb. 1987), showing the character's look after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' reboot. Art by [[George Pérez]].]]
The events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' greatly changed and altered the history of the [[DC Universe]]. Wonder Woman's history and origin were considerably revamped by the event. Wonder Woman was now an emissary and ambassador from [[Themyscira]] (the new name for Paradise Island) to Patriarch's World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Various deities and concepts from [[Greek mythology]] were blended and incorporated into Wonder Woman's stories and origin. Diana was formed out of clay of the shores of Themyscira by Hippolyta, who wished for a child; the clay figure was then brought to life by the Greek deities. The Gods then blessed and granted her unique powers and abilities - beauty from Aphrodite, strength from Demeter, wisdom from Athena, speed and flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts from Artemis, and sisterhood with fire and the ability to discern the truth from Hestia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Colluccio|first=Ali|title=Top 5: Wonder Woman Reboots|url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/top-5-wonder-woman-reboots/|publisher=iFanboy|accessdate=04/10/12|quote=After she was “erased” from existence in the final pages of Crisis on Infinite Earths, George Perez, Len Wein and Greg Potter brought the Amazon Princess back to the DC Universe. While the basics of the story remained the same, Wonder Woman’s powers were adjusted to include Beauty from Aphrodite, Strength from Demeter, Wisdom from Athena, Speed and Flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter from Artemis, and Truth from Hestia. This run also established Paradise Island as the mythical Amazon capital, Themyscira. Perez’s Diana is not only strong and smart, but graceful and kind — the iconic Wonder Woman.}}</ref> Due to the reboot, her previous history and her marriage to Steve Trevor were erased. Trevor was introduced as a man much older than Diana who would later on marry [[Etta Candy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mozzocco|first=J.

{{Main|War of the Gods (comics)}}
Starting in ''Wonder Woman'' Vol 2 #51, The Amazons, who had revealed their presence to the world in ''Wonder Woman'' Vol 2 #50, are blamed for a series of murders and for the theft of various artefacts. The Amazons are then taken into custody, Queen Hippolyta is nowhere to be found and Steve Trevor is forced by General Yedziniak to attack Themyscira. These events lead to the "[[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]" occurring. The culprit of the murders, thefts and the framing of the Amazons is revealed to be the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], who "kills" Diana by reverting her form back into the clay she was born from. Later, Wonder Woman is brought back to life and together with [[Donna Troy]], battles Circe and ultimately defeats her.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer=George Pérez| penciller=George Pérez| copencillers=Cynthia Martin| inker=Cynthia Martin| story = War of the Gods, Chapter One: Hellfire's Web| title=War of the Gods| volume=1| issue=1| date=September, 1991| publisher =DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic| writer=George Pérez| penciller=George Pérez| copencillers=Cynthia Martin| inker=Cynthia Martin| story=The Holy Wars| title =War of the Gods| volume=1| issue=2| date=October, 1991| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic| writer=George Pérez| penciller=George Pérez| copencillers=Cynthia Martin |inker=Cynthia Martin| story=Casualties of War| title=War of the Gods| volume=1| issue=3| date=November, 1991| publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic| writer=George Pérez| penciller=George Pérez| story=In the Beginning...

Wonder Woman tried to stop Superman, Lord (who was unable to mind control her) made Superman see her as his enemy Doomsday trying to kill [[Lois Lane]]. Superman then attacked Wonder Woman, and a vicious battle ensued. Buying herself time by slicing Superman's throat with her tiara, Wonder Woman caught Lord in her Lasso of Truth and demanded to know how to stop his control over Superman. As the lasso forced the wearer to speak only the truth, Lord told her that the only way to stop him was to kill him. Left with no choice, Wonder Woman snapped Lord's neck and ended his control over Superman.<ref name=infinitecrisisguideign /> Unknown to her, the entire scene was broadcast live around every channel in the world by [[Brother Eye]]. The viewers were not aware of the entire situation, and saw only Wonder Woman murdering a Justice League associate.

==Secret identity==
[[File:WonderWoman1970s.jpg|thumbnail|left|A powerless Wonder Woman fighting crime as Diana Prince. Cover to Wonder Woman Vol 1 #189 (July, 1970), art by [[Mike Sekowsky]]]]
Wonder Woman uses the alias '''Diana Prince''', which was created by William Moulton Marston, as her secret identity.

During Marston's run, Diana Prince was the name of an army nurse whom Wonder Woman met. The nurse wanted to meet her fiancé, who was transferred to South America, but was unable to arrange for money to do so. As Wonder Woman needed a secret identity to monitor and look after Steve (who was admitted in the same army hospital Diana Prince worked at), and because both of them looked identical, Wonder Woman gave the nurse money to go to her fiancé in exchange for the nurse's credentials and took Diana Prince as her alias.<ref name="Gutierrez"/> She also started to work as an army nurse and later as an Air Force secretary.<ref name="Gutierrez"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=LOVE YA BUT YOU’RE STRANGE – THAT TIME THE HUSBAND OF WONDER WOMAN’S EXACT DOUBLE CHAINED HER TO A TABLE|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/07/12/i-love-ya-but-youre-strange-that-time-the-husband-of-wonder-womans-exact-double-chained-her-to-a-table/|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=JULY 12, 2012}}</ref> 

The identity of Diana Prince played an important part in Wonder Woman's adventures during the 1960s, which featured a de-powered Diana fighting crime without her mystic powers. As she was no longer Wonder Woman, she used the Diana Prince alias while fighting crime and ran a mod boutique as a business.<ref name="Hanley"/><ref name="Diana's Memory Album"/> 

The "Diana Prince" alias again gained an important role to play in Wonder Woman's adventures after the events of Infinite Crisis. Wonder Woman was broadcast worldwide killing a villain named [[Maxwell Lord]], as he was mind controlling Superman into killing Batman. When Wonder Woman caught him in her lasso, demanding to know how to stop Superman, Maxwell revealed that the only way to stop him was to kill him, so as a last resort Diana snapped his neck.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) Issue #219</ref><ref name="Goldstein">{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|title=Defending Wonder Woman|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/01/defending-wonder-woman|publisher=IGN|accessdate=August 1, 2005}}</ref> Due to the trauma of killing another person, the Amazon went into a year's exile in order to rediscover herself.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref> Once she returned to public life, Diana realized that her life as a full-time celebrity superhero and ambassador had kept her removed from humanity. Because of this she donned the persona of Diana Prince and became an agent at the Department of Metahuman Affairs. During a later battle with [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], the witch placed a spell on Diana leaving Wonder Woman powerless when in the role of Diana Prince.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =Allan Heinberg| penciller =Terry Dodson| inker =Rachel Dodson| story = Who Is Wonder Woman Part 5| title = Wonder Woman Annual| volume = 3| issue = 1

In the current ''New 52'' universe, Diana does not have a secret identity as stated in an interview by series writer Brian Azzarello.<ref>{{cite web|last=Azzarello|first=Brian|title=No, she (Wonder Woman) doesn't (have a secret identity|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/21/the-new-52-interviews-wonder-woman|publisher=IGN|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref>

==Characterization==
While many writers have depicted Diana in different personalities, what has remained constant is her ability to feel compassion and give love without discrimination. This trait had been the reason for her induction into the Star Sapphires.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (2010)}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Star Sapphires|url=http://www.wonderali.com/2010/01/welcome-to-the-star-sapphires-2/|publisher=WonderAli|accessdate=January 11, 2010 by|author=WonderAli}}</ref> The modern version of the character has been shown to perform lethal and fatal actions when left with no other alternative. A primary example of this is when she killed Maxwell Lord in order to save Batman's life.<ref name="Goldstein"/><ref>Wonder Woman (vol. 2) Issue #219</ref>

Wonder Woman's personality and tone has wavered between that of a typical warrior, a highly compassionate and calm Ambassador, and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person. Writer [[Gail Simone]] was applauded for her portrayal of Wonder Woman during her run on the series, with comic book reviewer Dan Phillips of [[IGN]] noting that "she's molded Diana into a very relatable and sympathetic character."<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Dan|title=Wonder Woman #16 review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/24/wonder-woman-16-review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

''The New 52'' version of the character has been portrayed to be a more young, headstrong, loving, fierce and wilful person. Brian Azzarello stated in a video interview with DC Comics that they're building a very "confident", "impulsive" and "good-hearted" character in her. He also referred to her trait of feeling compassion as her strength and weakness both.<ref>{{cite video |people= Azzarello|year= 2012 |title= NYCC 2012; Wonder Woman 101|url=http://www.dccomics.com/videos/nycc-2012-wonder-woman-101 |format= |medium= |language=English |trans_title= |publisher=DC Comics|location=New York Comic Con  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= Wonder Woman's greatest strength is her compassion; her greatest weakness is her compassion |ref= }}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

===Pre-Crisis===
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]], compared to a normal human being, was much stronger - an example of this is when she was able to tear a steel door off its hinges.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #6 (June 1942)</ref> In one of her earliest appearances, she is shown running easily at 60&nbsp;mph, and later jumps from a building and lands on the balls of her feet.<ref>''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #1 (January 1942)</ref>

Her powers would be removed in accordance with "Aphrodite's Law" if she allowed herself to be bound or chained by a male. However the effects of this varied.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.superdickery.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=559:more-crap-about-aphrodites-law&catid=34:suffering-sappho-index&Itemid=39 | title=Panel featuring Aphrodite's Law | work=SuperDickery.com | accessdate=September 3, 2008}}</ref>

''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #105 revealed that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons and was imbued with the attributes of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[god]]s by Athena — "beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], wise as [[Athena]], as swift as [[Hermes]], and as strong as [[Hercules]]."<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> Wonder Woman's Amazon training also gave her limited [[telepathy]], profound scientific knowledge,<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/> and the ability to speak every language known to man and beyond- even [[caveman]]<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #105"/><ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #115">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #115 (July 1960)</ref> and [[Martian]] language.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #115"/>

Between 1966 and 1967, new powers were added, such as super breath and telepathy.<ref>{{Cite book | first=Michael L. | last=Fleisher | title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 2: Wonder Woman | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] | date=September 1976 | isbn=978-0-02-080080-4}}</ref>

In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]] and [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze]] ages of comics, Wonder Woman was able to further increase her strength. In times of great need, removing her bracelets would temporarily augment her power tenfold, but go insane in the process.<ref>[http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww166.htm ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #166] (November 1966), [http://www.amazonarchives.com/ww229.htm ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #229] (March 1977)</ref>

These powers received changes after the events of [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

===Post-Crisis===
In the Post-Crisis universe, Wonder Woman receives her powers as a blessing from the [[Greek mythology#Greek pantheon|Olympian deities]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1987)</ref>

[[Demeter]], the goddess of agriculture and fertility, blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]], making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DC Universe and the strongest female heroine of all in the [[DC Universe]].<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia">{{Cite book | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], the goddess of wisdom and war, granted Diana great wisdom, intelligence, and military prowess. Athena's gift has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages (including those of alien origin), multiple complex crafts, sciences and philosophies, as well as leadership, military strategy, and armed and unarmed combat. More recently, Athena bound her own eyesight to Diana's, granting her increased empathy.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Johns | first=Geoff | author-link=Geoff Johns | title=Wonder Woman: Land of the Dead | date=February 2006 | isbn=978-1-4177-5102-0}}</ref> [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt, animals, and the Moon, graced Diana with the Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts. The Eyes of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses, including telescopic vision and super hearing. [[Hestia]], goddess of hearth and home, granted Diana sisterhood with fire. This power has been shown to control the "Fires of Truth," which Diana wields through her lasso, making anyone bound by it unable to lie.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> This ability also grants her resistance to both normal and supernatural fire. [[Hermes]], the messenger god of speed, granted Diana superhuman speed and the ability to fly.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | title=Wonder Woman: The Ultimate Guide to the Amazon Princess | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | date=November 2003 | isbn=978-0-7894-9616-4}}</ref> She is capable of flying at speeds approaching half the speed of light.<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia"/> She is swift enough to deflect bullets, lasers, and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets. After the 2011 relaunch of the character, Wonder Woman does not naturally possess the power of flight. She gains it once she is hit by a feather thrown by Hermes.<ref name="Wonder Woman 2012">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #12 (Sept. 2012)</ref><ref name="thanley.wordpress.com">{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Tim|title=Wonder Woman #12 Review OR I Really Didn’t See That Coming At All!!|url=http://thanley.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/wonder-woman-12-review-or-i-really-didnt-see-that-coming-at-all/|publisher=Straitened Circumstances|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref> 

While not invulnerable, she is highly resistant to bodily harm and capable of withstanding great concussive force<ref name="The DC Comics Encyclopedia"/><ref>Jimenez, Phil et al [http://books.google.ca/books?id=81F5RWxOdaAC&dq=wonder+woman&q=warp+core#v=onepage&q=gunfire&f=false The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia] Published by Random House Digital, Inc. 2010, p. 271, 116, 244 & 165.</ref>

She is able to [[Astral projection|astrally project]] herself into various lands of myth. Her physical body reacts to whatever happens to her on the mythical astral plane, leaving her body cut, bruised, or sometimes strengthened once her mind and body are reunited. She can apparently leave the planet through meditation, and did this once to rescue Artemis while she was in hell.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #56, #75, #77, #97 (July 1991&nbsp;– May 1995); ''Wonder Woman Special'' #1 (May 1992); ''[[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall#Requiem|Artemis: Requiem]]'' #1 (June 1996)</ref>

After the [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]], Diana has gained new powers. As the natural born daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus, she has inherited some of her father's powers, which is suppressed by wearing her bracers. She uses these powers in battle against Artemis (the Goddess; not the Amazon) and quickly renders her unconscious with a series of carefully positioned counter-attacks. While using her godly strength, her costume and accoutrements lit up and her eyes glowed like her father's.<ref name="Wonder Woman"/><ref name="thanley.wordpress.com"/>

===Skills and resources===
Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete, acrobat, fighter and strategist, trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat, including exclusively Amazonian martial arts. In some versions, her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso.<ref>''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'' #4 (December 2008)</ref> Batman once noted her as the "best melee fighter in the world".<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13 (Nov. 2007)</ref> The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #219">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #219 (September 2005)</ref> In ''The New 52'' continuity, her superior combat skills are the product of her training with Ares in her childhood.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = Azzarello, Brian| artist = Chiang, Cliff| story = The Lair of the Minotaur!| title =Wonder Woman| volume =4| issue =0| date = November 2012}}</ref>

Diana has an arsenal of powerful god-forged weapons at her disposal, but her signature weapons are her indestructible bracelets and the [[Lasso of Truth]].

Her '''bulletproof bracelets''' were formed from the remnants of [[Athena]]'s legendary shield, the [[Aegis]], to be awarded to her champion. The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she-goat, Amalthea, who suckled Zeus as an infant. These forearm guards have thus far proven indestructible and able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks, allowing Wonder Woman to deflect [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]] fire and energy blasts.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Wonder Woman's Magical Weapons | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=93 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=[[New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> Diana can also slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman's ears bleed.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #219"/> Recently, she gained the ability to channel Zeus's lightning through her bracelets as well. Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation, because they were once part of the Aegis, and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #39 (February 2010)</ref> After the 2011 relaunch of the character, it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta<ref name="Clay"/> and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she has inherited from Zeus in check.<ref name="Wonder Woman"/>

The '''Lasso of Truth''', or Lariat of Hestia, was forged by [[Hephaestus]] from the golden girdle of Gaea.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> It is virtually indestructible;<ref name="ReferenceB"/> the only times it has been broken were when Wonder Woman herself refused to accept the truth revealed by the lasso, such as when she confronted [[Rama Khan]] of Jarhanpur,<ref>''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #62 (March 2002)</ref> and by [[Bizarro]] in [[Matt Wagner]]'s non-canonical ''[[Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wagner | first=Matt | authorlink=Matt Wagner | title=Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity | publisher=DC Comics | date=July 1, 2005 | isbn=978-1-4012-0187-6}}</ref> It also at one time had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them, even overriding other kinds of mind control; this was effective enough to defeat strong-willed beings like Captain Marvel.<ref>''War of the Gods'' #1 (September 1991)</ref> Diana wields the lasso with great precision and accuracy and can use it as a whip or noose.

As early as the 1950s,<ref name="Showcase Presents Wonder Woman 2007">{{Cite book | last=Kanigher | first=Robert | title=Showcase Presents: Wonder Woman, Vol. 1 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | date=August 22, 2007 | isbn=978-1-4012-1373-2}}</ref> Wonder Woman's '''Golden Tiara''' has also doubled as a dagger, and throwing weapon, returning to her like a boomerang.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> It is also possible for Diana to contact Amazons back on Themyscira using the telepathic power of the red star shaped, [[star ruby]], in the centre of her tiara.<ref name="Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #219"/>

The Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age portrayals of Wonder Woman showed her using an '''[[Invisible plane]]''' that could be controlled by mental command. Its appearance varied as well; originally it had a [[propeller]], while later it was drawn as a jet aircraft resembling a [[stealth aircraft]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Strickland|first=Carol A.|title=The Invisible Plane/Jet!|url=http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/misc_indexes/jetindex/jet.html|publisher=Carol A. Strickland}}</ref> 

Diana occasionally uses additional weaponry in formal battle, such as ceremonial golden armour with golden wings, pteruges, chest-plate, and golden helmet in the shape of an eagle's head. She also possesses a sword forged by Hephaestus that is sharp enough to cut the electrons off an atom.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

As a recent temporary inductee into the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphires]], Wonder Woman gained access to the violet power ring of love. This ring allowed her to alter her costume at will, create solid-light energy constructs, and reveal a person's true love to them. She was able to combine the energy with her lasso to enhance its ability.

== Costume ==
<!-- Please keep the photo updated to the latest costume -->
[[File:Wonder Woman New 52 Jim Lee.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Wonder Woman's New 52 costume. Panel from ''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #3 (Nov. 2011). Art by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Scott Williams]].]]
Wonder Woman's costume has varied over time, although almost all of her costume incarnations have retained some form of breastplate, tiara, bracelets and her signature star symbols. 

At the time of her debut, Wonder Woman sported a red top with a golden eagle emblem, a white belt, a star-spangled blue skirt and red and golden go-go boots. This costume was entirely based on the American flag, as Wonder Woman at that time was purely an American icon.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963">{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Wonder Woman Throughout The Years|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26963|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref> Later in 1942, Wonder Woman's costume received a slight change- the skirt was converted entirely into skin-tight shorts and she wore sandals.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> While earlier most of her back was exposed, during the imposition of the [[Comics Code Authority]] in the mid-1950s, Wonder Woman's costume was rectified to make her back substantially covered, in order to comply with the Authority's rule of minimum exposure.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> During [[Mike Sekowsky]]'s run in the late 1960s, Diana surrendered her powers and started using her own skill to fight crime. She wore a series of jumpsuits as her attire, most popular of these was a white one.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> After Sekowsky's run ended in the early 1970s, Diana's roots were reverted back to her old mythological ones and she wore a more modernized version of her original costume, a predecessor to her "bathing suit" costume.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> Later, in 1976, her white belt was turned into a yellow one.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/>

After [[Crisis On Infinite Earths]], [[George Pérez]] rebooted the character in 1987. She wore a costume similar to her 1970s one, but now with a larger golden belt.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> This costume continued until [[William Messner-Loebs]]' run, which had Diana pass on the role of Wonder Woman to [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]].<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> No longer Wonder Woman, Diana sported a new black biker-girl costume designed by artist [[Mike Deodato Jr]].<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> After [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took over writing and art duties, he redesigned the Wonder Woman costume (Diana was reinstated as Wonder Woman at the end of Loebs' run) and joined the emblem and belt together.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/>

Her costume did not receive any prominent change until after [[Infinite Crisis]]. Similar to her chest-plate, her belt was also shaped into a '''W'''.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/> This costume continued until issue #600- [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s run of Wonder Woman's altered timeline changed her costume drastically. Her costume was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]] and included a redesigned emblem, a golden and red top, black pants and a later discontinued blue-black jacket.<ref name="Cronin article&id=26963"/>

Another major costume change came after DC Comics relaunched its entire line of publications, dubbing the event ''[[The New 52]]''. Her original swim-suit costume was restored, although the color combination of red and blue was changed to red and dark blue. Her chest-plate, belt and tiara were also changed from gold to a metallic gray. She also wears many accessories such as arm and neck jewellery. The design previously included black trousers, but they were removed and the swimsuit look was restored during the time of publication.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polo|first=Susana|title=DC Inexplicably, Quietly Changes Wonder Woman’s Costume...

==Alternative versions==
{{main|Wonder Woman in other media|Cultural impact of Wonder Woman|Alternative versions of Wonder Woman}}
Wonder Woman has appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books since her initial appearance including comic strips, film, television and video games.

The first serious attempt at creating a [[live-action]] series on Wonder Woman was a [[Wonder Woman (1974 film) |1974 pilot movie]]. It was written and produced by [[John D. F. Black]], and starred [[Cathy Lee Crosby]] as Wonder Woman.

Attempts have been made to produce a television series on the character in more recent times, but none have emerged successfully yet.
