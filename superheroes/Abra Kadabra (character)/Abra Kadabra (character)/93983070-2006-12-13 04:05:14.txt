==Fictional character biography==
Abra Kadabra is from the 64th century, at a time when science has made stage magic obsolete. However, he wanted a career as a performing magician, so he went back in time to find an audience to entertain and soon clashed with the Flash ([[Barry Allen]]). 

One of his more heinous acts was kidnapping [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], the girlfriend of [[Wally West]] (Barry Allen's protege and successor), during their wedding and erasing her from history, though he was ultimately defeated. He also tricked five [[Rogues (comics)|rogues]] into selling their souls to [[Neron]] so he could gain real magic powers.

Abra Kadabra is mentioned in Neil Gaimans [[Books of Magic]] miniseries. In the fourth issue Timothy Hunter escorted by Mister E visit the 64th century and the inhabitants tell them they have selected their "date-line" to send the "Madchild Abhararakadhararbarakh". Timothy Hunter responds "Abracadabra?" and Mister E tells him not to talk to the inhabitants of this time, and so they then continue their path into the future.

==Abra Kadabra in other media==
Abra Kadabra appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Flash and Substance" as a background character in the bar frequented by Flash's enemies.
