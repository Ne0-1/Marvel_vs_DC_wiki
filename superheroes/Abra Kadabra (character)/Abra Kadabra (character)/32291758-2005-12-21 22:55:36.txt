'''Abra Kadabra''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and a primary foe of [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]]. He first appeared in ''Flash #128'' [http://twotubman.t35.com/Flash/Flash128.jpg] and then reappeared in ''Flash #133''  [http://twotubman.t35.com/Flash/Flash133.jpg]. He hails from the 64th century where science seems like magic. Bored with how dull life is, he went back in time to find an audience to entertain and soon clashed with Flash II ([[Barry Allen]]). 

One of his most heinous act was kidnapping [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], the girlfriend of [[Wally West]] (Flash III), during their wedding and erasing her from history, but he was ultimately defeated. He also tricked five [[Enemies of the Flash|rogues]] into selling their souls to [[Neron]] so he could gain real magic powers.
