==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Flash 133.jpg|125px|left|thumb|''The Flash'' #133 (December, 1962), cover art by [[Carmine Infantino]]]]
Abra Kadabra is from the 64th century, at a time when science has made [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] obsolete. However, he desires a career as a performing magician, so he goes back in time to find an audience to entertain and soon clashes with the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]). He is an actual [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]].

In one of his many confrontations with the Flash, Abra Kadabra's technology is damaged and his body becomes insubstantial and wraith-like.  After his body is returned to normal, he is captured by a bounty hunter named Peregrine, and returned to his native century to serve a death sentence, although he is saved by the Flash before he can be executed.  Shortly after returning to the 21st century, during the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, he forgoes his technological implements and tricks five [[Rogues (comics)|rogues]] into selling their souls to [[Neron]] so he can gain genuine magical powers.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  Abra Kadabra later kidnapped [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], the girlfriend of [[Wally West]] (Barry Allen's protege and successor), during their wedding and erases her from history, though he is ultimately defeated.

Abra Kadabra is mentioned in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Books of Magic]]'' miniseries. In the fourth issue [[Timothy Hunter]], escorted by [[Mister E]], visits the 64th century, described by E as a time when the differences between magic and technology have become blurred.  The inhabitants tell them they have selected their "date-line" to send the "Madchild Abhararakadhararbarakh". Timothy Hunter responds "Abracadabra?" and Mister E tells him not to talk to the inhabitants of this time, and so they then continue their path into the future.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Abra Kadabra became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

In "[[One Year Later]]", he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]). Though Inertia is defeated, Kadabra and the other Rogues successfully beat Bart to death, though not before Kadabra recognizes that Bart is too young to be the Flash they are used to dealing with.

Abra Kadabra is one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. Upon coming across the planet's local pygmies, Abra Kadabra deciphers its language and uses it to locate a "safe zone" for him and the other Rogues before leading the other villains dispatched there to it.

He was a member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] who joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.

He was last seen in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'', being attacked by Professor Zoom. His fate is unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Abra Kadabra is a powerful sorcerer and can achieve virtually any feat with his spells. Originally his powers were all due to 64th century scientific technology although they seemed to be the purest magic. Later, Kadabra's powers are augmented to include true [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] when he struck a deal with Neron.

==In other media==
Abra Kadabra appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]" as a background character in the bar frequented by Flash's enemies.
