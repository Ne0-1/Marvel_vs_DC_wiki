==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Flash 133.jpg|125px|left|thumb|''The Flash'' #133 (December, 1962), cover art by [[Carmine Infantino]]]]
Abra Kadabra is from the 64th century, at a time when science has made [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] obsolete. However, he desires a career as a performing magician, so he goes back in time to find an audience to entertain after stealing a time machine and inventing a device to paralyze the guards, and soon clashes with the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]). He has a hypnotic device that makes people clap regardless of their thoughts, which he uses to force applause from audiences even when they don't applaud his magic tricks. He finds his magic is being overlooked, so decides to involve himself in important events. When the Flash tries to stop a crime he is committing, he makes the Flash clap, enabling him to escape. He is able to send the Flash into space after challenging him to a fight at the theatre, but the Flash is able to change the course of the planetoid he is on so he is sent back to Earth, and finds Kadabra took his left-behind costume, meaning he can follow the impulses, and Kadabra is jailed. But he hypnotizes the Governor using a ray from a device made out of pots and pans, to let him out, and starts staging a puppet show where the Flash is defeated by a puppet called Captain Cream-Puff. When the Flash passes a poster advertising Kadabra, he is turned into a puppet and used in the performance. But the Scarlet Speedster is able to restore himself slightly using the organic matter in his brain, which was not transformed, and then reverse Kadabra's ray so he is restored completely. He again defeats Kadabra.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

In one of his many confrontations with the Flash, Abra Kadabra's technology is damaged and his body becomes insubstantial and wraith-like.{{Issue|date=July 2010}} After his body is returned to normal, he is captured by a bounty hunter named Peregrine, and returned to his native century to serve a death sentence, although he is saved by the Flash before he can be executed.{{Issue|date=July 2010}} Shortly after returning to the 21st century, during the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, he forgoes his technological implements and tricks five [[Rogues (comics)|rogues]] into selling their souls to [[Neron]] so he can gain genuine magical powers.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Abra Kadabra later kidnapped [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], the girlfriend of [[Wally West]] (Barry Allen's protege and successor), during their wedding and erases her from history, though he is ultimately defeated.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Abra Kadabra is mentioned in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Books of Magic]]'' mini-series. In the fourth issue [[Timothy Hunter]], escorted by [[Mister E]], visits the 64th century, described by E as a time when the differences between magic and technology have become blurred. The inhabitants tell them they have selected their "date-line" to send the "Madchild Abhararakadhararbarakh". Timothy Hunter responds "Abracadabra?" and Mister E tells him not to talk to the inhabitants of this time, and so they then continue their path into the future.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaiman|first=Neil|title=The Books of Magic|year=1991|publisher=DC Comics|location=Book IV: The Road to Nowhere|isbn=9781563890826}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Abra Kadabra is a powerful sorcerer and can achieve virtually any feat with his spells.

Later, Kadabra's powers are augmented to include true [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] when he struck a deal with Neron.<ref>''Underworld Unleashed'' #1 (November 1995)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Abra Kadabra appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Flash and Substance". He appears as a background character in the bar frequented by Flash's enemies.
* Abra Kadabra appears in the teaser of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Chill of the Night" voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. Batman teams up with [[Zatanna]] to stop him from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. While Batman holds back the people he possessed, Zatanna battles Kadabra and traps him in her hat. She later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle,He appeared in the anthology episode "Four Star Spectacular" where he is the secondary antagonist in the Flash segment. He only came to the present because he wanted to see if the Flash dies at the hands of the [[Mirror Master]]. However, because of his interruption, Flash easily defeated the Mirror Master. This caused Abra Kadabra to kill him with his wand (actually it is Flash's mirror duplicate made by the Mirror Master's device). It shocked him so much that he returned to the future to see if he has made any alternations.
* Abra Kadabra appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Denial" again voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. He and [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] work together in order to claim the Helmet of Fate which started with Abra Kadabra abducting Kent Nelson when he was seeing [[Madame Xanadu]]. [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] confirms that he uses futuristic technology to simulate magic. He managed to subdue [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and Artemis until Kid Flash (wearing the Helmet of Fate) was able to strip him of his technology making him vulnerable to Superboy's punch. He is seen briefly in "Terrors" as one of the inmates at [[Belle Reve]].
