The mysterious Stick is a sensei who trained the young [[Daredevil|Matt Murdock (Daredevil)]] to control his senses and taught him the acrobatic martial arts that would make him so formidable.

Unlike Matt Murdock, Stick was born blind so he has trained his techniques to a very dangerous style enabling him to protect himself better than a seeing person could. Stick is the master of the Chaste, a group of mistical ninja which seek spiritual purity and enlightment as well as physical toughness. They have feuded with their rival group, The Hand, for centuries in a legendary secret war that stretches back to feudal Japan.

Stick has made it his mission to keep the Chaste pure and clean from any evil infection. He forbade another of his prominent students, Elecktra Natchios, from staying between their lines because of her vengeful personality, in spite of her formidable progress.

Stick is quite punishing and arrogant with his charges. He encountered the [[X-Men|X-man]] [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] when he was in his feral state and brough him back to reasoning, in part because of continued battering from his bo staff and hard nose advising.
