'''Stick''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[American comic book]] character owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who appears in their shared [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
The mysterious Stick is a blind [[sensei]] who trained [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]].
Stick has made it his mission to keep the [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste]] pure and clean from any evil infection. He forbade another of his prominent students, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], from remaining in their ranks because of her vengeful personality, in spite of her formidable progress.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Stick is quite punishing and arrogant with his charges. He encountered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in his feral state and brought him back to reasoning, in part because of continued battering from his [[b≈ç]] and hard nosed advising.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Eventually, the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] sought to wipe out Stick and the good warriors of the Chaste altogether. Stick thwarted an assassination attempt by four Hand operatives; he then summoned the other members of his order to New York City. With the assistance of his clan, Stick defeated Kirigi, the Hand's most lethal ninja at the time. The Hand regrouped and attacked Stick and his band of warriors that now included Daredevil and his former lover, the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. The Hand had almost overpowered the small band of warriors, when Stick and Shaft resorted to an ancient technique that drained the life force from all ninja present. Unfortunately, the technique resulted in the explosion of Stick and his comrade as a result of the excess energy they had absorbed. Despite their losses and the escape of the superheroes, The Hand considered the destruction of their nemesis and leader of their enemy a victory and turned their attention to other schemes.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Years later, the Hand again turned its attention to the leaderless Chaste, once again attempting to destroy them. This time they sought to prevent the Chaste's members from locating the new-born child that would bear Stick's reincarnated soul. The Hand severely crippled Stick's soldiers, reducing their number to a handful of warriors. The few remaining traveled to New York, seeking the assistance of Daredevil. Reluctantly, the Man Without Fear aided his former mentor's disciples, returning with them to Japan. Once there, The Hand attacked the Chaste and Daredevil relentlessly. Fighting alongside Daredevil, the Chaste barely managed to escape and safeguard their master's reincarnated spirit.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] later resurrects Stick to use as one of his fighters during the new [[Marvel: Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]].<ref>''All-New, All-Different Marvel Point One'' #1</ref>
