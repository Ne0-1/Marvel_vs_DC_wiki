'''Stick''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[American comic book]] character owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who appears in their shared [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
Stick first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #176 and was created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].

==Fictional character biography==
The mysterious Stick is a blind [[sensei]] who trained [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]].

Stick has made it his mission to keep the [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste]] pure and clean from any evil infection. He forbade another of his prominent students, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], from remaining in their ranks because of her vengeful personality, in spite of her formidable progress.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Stick is quite punishing and arrogant with his charges. He encountered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in his feral state and brought him back to reasoning, in part because of continued battering from his [[b≈ç]] and hard nosed advising.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Eventually, the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] sought to wipe out Stick and the good warriors of the Chaste altogether. Stick thwarted an assassination attempt by four Hand operatives; he then summoned the other members of his order to New York City. With the assistance of his clan, Stick defeated Kirigi, the Hand's most lethal ninja at the time. The Hand regrouped and attacked Stick and his band of warriors that now included Daredevil and his former lover, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. The Hand had almost overpowered the small band of warriors, when Stick and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Shaft|Shaft]] resorted to an ancient technique that drained the life force from all ninja present. Unfortunately, the technique resulted in the explosion of Stick and his comrade as a result of the excess energy they had absorbed. Despite their losses and the escape of the superheroes, The Hand considered the destruction of their nemesis and leader of their enemy a victory and turned their attention to other schemes.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Years later, the Hand again turned its attention to the leaderless Chaste, once again attempting to destroy them. This time they sought to prevent the Chaste's members from locating the new-born child that would bear Stick's reincarnated soul. The Hand severely crippled Stick's soldiers, reducing their number to a handful of warriors. The few remaining traveled to New York, seeking the assistance of Daredevil. Reluctantly, the Man Without Fear aided his former mentor's disciples, returning with them to Japan. Once there, The Hand attacked the Chaste and Daredevil relentlessly. Fighting alongside Daredevil, the Chaste barely managed to escape and safeguard their master's reincarnated spirit.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

As part of ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] resurrects Stick to compete for him in the third iteration of the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Al Ewing|penciller = Paco Medina|inker = Juan Vlasco|colorist = David Curiel|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Mark Paniccia and Chris Robinson|story = Chess Not Checkers|title = All-New, All-Different Marvel Point One|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 7 October 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> During the fourth on-panel battle, Stick secretly allies with the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] of Earth-1611, a reluctant member of the opposing team assembled by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. When their alliance is revealed, the two are vaporized by [[Punisher 2099]]'s Molecular Disintegrator.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Al Ewing|penciller = Paco Medina|inker = Juan Vlasco|colorist = David Curiel|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Mark Paniccia|story = Cheat Code|title = Contest of Champions|volume = 2|issue = #5|date = 3 February 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> While experimenting with the Iso-Sphere, the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] unintentionally brings Stick back in the form of an elderly [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. In the final battle, Stick sheds his disguise, distracts the Maestro by using his ability to manipulate energy to resurrect the Sentry, and instructs Outlaw on how to use the Iso-Sphere to end the Contest of Champions. Stick is afterward shown back on Earth, where he forms a new superhero team with Outlaw, [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], Guillotine, and White Fox.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Al Ewing|penciller = Rhoald Marcellius|inker = Rhoald Marcellius|colorist = Andrew Crossley|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Mark Paniccia and Chris Robinson|story = Earth's Fightiest Heroes|title = Contest of Champions|volume = 2|issue = #10|date = 20 July 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>
