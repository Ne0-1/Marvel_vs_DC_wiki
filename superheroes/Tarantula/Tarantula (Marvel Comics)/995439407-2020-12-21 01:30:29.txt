The '''Tarantula''' is a [[fictional character]] name used by several characters, usually [[supervillain]]s, appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Publication history==
The character was introduced in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #134 (July 1974).<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 74|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [Gerry] Conway and [Ross] Andru would introduce another major addition to Spider-Man's rogues gallery when the Tarantula debuted in this first chapter of a two-part tale.}}</ref> Writer [[Gerry Conway]] recalled how he created the character: {{quote|During the political upheavals in South America during the 1970s, there was a real sense that we, the United States, were somewhat culpable, both for supporting the repressive regimes that were in power, and in [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|the case of Chile]], actually assisting in the overthrow of the democratically elected government. So, in that environment, a character like the Tarantula was inherently political. But the real reason I wanted to write that particular story was something said by my good friend [[Don Glut]], who was also writing for Marvel at the time. Don once asked, "Why aren't there international heroes from smaller countries, a [[Third World|third-world]], or [[Old World|old-world]] [[Captain America]], like say, Captain Serbo-Croatia?" We laughed, but I really liked that notion: Just because the United States came up with their guy, why stop there? Why stop with the larger countries, the superpowers?<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #44| pages= 13–14|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}} Acting as a patriotic enforcer for the oppressive dictatorship of the fictional South American country of Delvadia (essentially a Delvadian equivalent to Captain America), his defining marks are his red stretch costume with a black tarantula on its chest and the poisonous spikes attached to his gloves and boots.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=336}}</ref> The character was killed off in the early 1980s, but the Tarantula identity has been carried on by a series of successors.

Prior to the original depiction, a character with the Tarantula name appeared in ''[[Phantom Rider|Ghost Rider]]'' #2 (April 1967). There is no connection between this character and any of the other depictions.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Anton Miguel Rodriguez===
'''Antonio "Anton" Miguel Rodriguez''' is the first character to use the Tarantula codename. 

He was a revolutionary terrorist in the small fictional South American republic of Delvadia, and was expelled from his small organization after murdering a guard for no reason during a robbery. Anton then went over to the side of the repressive fascist-dictatorship government, where they created the Tarantula identity for him to serve as a government operative and his country's counterpart to [[Captain America]]. After alienating his masters, the Tarantula embarks on a criminal career in the United States. He hijacks a Hudson River dayliner to rob the passengers and hold them for ransom; his plan, however, is disrupted by [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #134-135</ref> He escapes prison with the original [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]'s help who sought revenge on Spider-Man; however, the Tarantula is again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #147-148</ref> He is then hired by [[Lightmaster]] to assist [[Kraven the Hunter]] in committing various kidnappings and murders, but is again thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #1-3</ref> The Tarantula then joins forces with [[Senor Muerte / Senor Suerte#Jaime and Phillip|Senor Suerte]] to steal the "Madbombs" and use them for extortion, but this time is defeated by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #224</ref>

The Tarantula is hired by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]] to silence an informer, but is again thwarted by Spider-Man. The Brand Corporation then orders him to kill Spider-Man. In an attempt to bestow him with spider-powers, the Tarantula is injected with a mutagenic serum and placed in an electrolyte bath. The [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will o' The Wisp]] disrupts the mutagenic process, causing him to start transforming into a gigantic, monstrous, spider-like being. He falls into Jamaica Bay, but survives the plunge and continues to mutate, and then battles Spider-Man atop a tall New York City building. Horrified and disgusted with what he has become, he leaps off the building, begging for the police officers gathered below to kill him. Hit by a hail of gunfire, the Tarantula strikes the street below and dies.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #233-236</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, a clone of Tarantula is among the clones that were created thanks to the new [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]]'s New U Technologies.<ref>''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref> He was involved in a fight with the other cloned supervillains until it was broken up by a clone of the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]].<ref>''Prowler'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

===Luis Alvarez===
'''Luis Alvarez''' is the second character to use the Tarantula codename. He was a special government operative and a former captain in the Delvadian militia, but not given to terrorist activities. Acting more as a death squad/government enforcer, he is chosen by Delvadian government officials to be the second Tarantula, and undergoes a mutagenic treatment to increase his already-considerable physical abilities, wearing an identical costume.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #35-36</ref> He is sent to the United States by the Delvadian government to eliminate political refugees from that country, and to kill Spider-Man for what happened to the first Tarantula, but Spider-Man and [[U.S. Agent|Captain America]] defeat him.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #137-138</ref> Working as a mercenary, the Tarantula teams up with the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]] to eliminate Spider-Man where he nearly kills [[Flash Thompson]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #341. Marvel Comics.</ref> but this plan failed and he is defeated by Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #343. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Tarantula later battles the Punisher and [[Batroc the Leaper]].<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 2) #64-72</ref> Eventually, he is caught and murdered by the [[The Jury (comics)|Jury]].<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #2-4</ref>

===Third version===
An unnamed character is the third character to use the Tarantula codename. 

A patron at the Bar With No Name, he and several other villains get into a brawl with Spider-Man and [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ron Zimmerman|penciller = [[John McCrea (comics)|John McCrea]]|inker = James Hodgkins|story = Part One|title = Spider-Man: Get Kraven|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = August 2002|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> The Tarantula later fights the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]], and is defeated by a "debugging incantation" cast by [[Nico Minoru]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Brian K.

Years later, the Tarantula resurfaces as an ally of the Black Cat, and as one of the villains taking advantage of the gang war raging in the Third Precinct.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott and Christos N.

In a prelude to the "Hunted" storyline, the Tarantula is among the animal-themed characters captured by the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and the [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] on Kraven the Hunter's behalf. He is among those whom [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] publicly reveals as the [[Savage Six]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 5) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Tarantula was among the supervillains fought by [[Old Man Logan]] for [[Mysterio]]'s location, and [[Miss Sinister]] telepathically took the Tarantula's information then killed him.<ref>''Dead Man Logan'' #1</ref>

===Jacinda Rodriguez===
'''Jacinda Rodriguez''' is the fourth character to use the Tarantula codename, and the daughter of Anton Miguel Rodriguez.<ref>http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/tarantuladaughter.htm</ref> She and Marie Batroc were hired by the East Winds to go after [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]], Taskmaster and [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]], however, Taskmaster surprised both the Tarantula and her partner and gunned down the two females.<ref>''Agent X'' #6</ref> The Tarantula is later seen as an operative of Delvadia alongside the Devil-Spider, assisting Spider-Man and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] in confronting El Facóquero (aka the Warthog), Delvadia's druglord and [[Norman Osborn]]'s body double.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #25</ref>

===Maria Vasquez===
'''Maria Vasquez''' is the fifth character to use the Tarantula codename. 

She wanted to avenge her sister Rosa Vasquez who was killed in the [[Civil War (comics)|Stamford Incident]] but this went against her father Fernandez Vasquez preferring a safer profession of putting her intelligence to good use. After her father is killed by ninjas while visiting Rosa's grave by [[Ricadonna]], Maria killed the ninjas herself and able to injure Ricadonna but unable to kill her father's killer as desired.<ref>''Heroes For Hire'' Vol. 2 #4-5</ref>

Along with the [[Heroes For Hire]]'s members, the Tarantula's paid to locate and put a stop to a dangerous group of thieves who had been using advanced exoskeletons to aid in robberies regardless of collateral damage or death left behind; their investigation involved stopping the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and [[Man-Ape]] with the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s destruction.<ref>''Heroes For Hire'' Vol. 2 #6-8</ref>

The Heroes For Hire later went to the [[Savage Land]] thanks to [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] to capture [[Moon-Boy]] and [[Devil Dinosaur]] for study by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to which the group refused to pay before solving problems with the [[Hulk (character)|Hulk]], resulting in the Tarantula getting into an argument with S.H.I.E.L.D. which raised some tension between the two teams. During this time, the Tarantula also came close to having a relationship with [[Shang-Chi]] and fought with the Heroes For Hire against the Hulk, after which she left the group after disbandment.<ref>''Heroes For Hire'' Vol. 2 #8-15</ref>

===Kaine===
{{Main|Kaine Parker}}
Kaine, a clone of Peter Parker, used the Tarantula alias for his hulking Man-Spider form during the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline thanks to the original Jackal and [[Queen (Marvel Comics)|Adriana Soria]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #666</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Anton Miguel Rodriguez was a great athlete with incredible agility, leaping skills and excellent in hand-to-hand combat. Additionally, he wore gloves with retractable razor-sharp finger claws and boots with two retractable razor-sharp spikes loaded with drugs that would render his victim unconscious, or other harmful or lethal drugs and poisons. He was educated in military school, was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and was skilled in various martial arts, particularly in kickboxing. When he was mutated into a giant tarantula-like creature thanks to the Brand Corporation's mutagenic serum, he gained superhuman strength and the ability to adhere to surfaces. However, in his final mutation into a human-sized tarantula, while he possessed superhuman strength, his limbs were not structured to enable him to lift (press) weights. Just before his death, he developed the ability to shoot organic webbing from his buttocks.

Luis Alvarez had his strength, stamina, agility and reflexes enhanced to peak human levels, thanks to Dr. Karl Mendoza's formula. Like Rodriguez, he also wore retractable razor-sharp finger claws in his gloves, and two retractable razor-sharp spikes in his boots anointed with harmful or lethal drugs and poisons. Also, like his predecessor, he was educated in military school, was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and was skilled in various martial arts, particularly in kickboxing.

Maria Vasquez is highly skilled in hand to hand combat. She is skilled in using the blades on her wrists and the toes of her boots as very effective weapons. She is also a skilled detective, capable of observation and forensic investigation, as well as an exceptional marksman who is also skilled in sharpshooting and knife throwing.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|universe]] equivalent of Tarantula is a clone of [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker), wearing a variant black costume of Spider-Man's while having Man-Spider features of six arms, fangs and spiky hair, and possessing superhuman strength, reflexes, equilibrium and a spider-sense. Created by ambitious mastermind [[Doctor Octopus]] (with the CIA's consent), he tries to prevent Kaine's kidnapping mutation of [[Mary Jane Watson]]. During his genetic template's and [[Spider-Woman (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Woman]]'s fight with Doctor Octopus, the Tarantula attacks his maker and is killed as a result.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #100–103</ref>

===Earth-1048===
During the ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' storyline, the [[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Earth-1048]] version of Tarantula is shown to sport mechanical spider legs. He was robbing the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] when he was attacked by Spider-Man. After immobilizing the Tarantula with a web bomb, Spider-Man is visited by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] of Earth-616 (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) as the Tarantula breaks free. As the Superior Spider-Man gets in the way of the web bomb, the Tarantula gets away. The two later find the Tarantula robbing a research facility and defeat him, while the Superior Spider-Man's spider-bots disable the Tarantula's mechanical spider legs. Both Spider-Men swing off, while the Tarantula is arrested by the police.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>
