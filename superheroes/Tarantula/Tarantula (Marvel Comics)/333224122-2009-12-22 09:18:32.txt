'''Tarantula''' is the alias of a number of [[fictional character]]s appearing in publications from [[Marvel Comics]].

==Clay Riley==
'''The Tarantula''' is a Zorro-like western-era villain equipped with a [[scourge]] and has a mysterious Mexican accent. He first appears in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' #2 (April, 1967).

==Anton Miguel Rodriguez==
'''Anton Miguel Rodriguez''', known as the Tarantula, is a supervillain who wears a red stretch costume with a black tarantula on its chest. He's equipped with poisonous stingers attached to his boots. He was first introduced in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #134 (July 1974).

===Fictional character biography===
As a revolutionary terrorist in the small fictional South American republic of Delvadia, '''Anton Miguel Rodriguez''' was expelled from his small organization after murdering a guard without reason during a robbery. Anton then went over to the side of the repressive fascistic-dictatorship government, where they created the identity of the '''Tarantula''' for him to serve as a government operative and his country's counterpart to [[Captain America]].  After alienating his masters, the Tarantula embarked on a criminal career in the United States.  In his first appearance, he hijacked a Hudson River dayliner to rob the passengers and hold them for ransom; his plan was disrupted by [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #134-135</ref> He escaped prison with the help of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], who sought revenge on Spider-Man; however, the Tarantula was defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #147-148</ref> He was then hired by [[Lightmaster]] to assist [[Kraven the Hunter]] in committing various kidnappings and murders, but was again thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #1-2</ref> Tarantula then joined forces with [[Senor Muerte / Senor Suerte#Jaime and Phillip|Senor Suerte]] to steal the "Mad-bombs" and use them for extortion, but was this time defeated by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #224</ref>

Tarantula was hired by the [[Brand Corporation]] to silence an informer, but was thwarted by Spider-Man. The Brand Corporation then ordered him to kill Spider-Man.  In an attempt to bestow him with spider powers, he was injected with a mutagenic serum and placed in an electrolyte bath.  Unfortunately for Rodriguez, [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]] disrupted the mutagenic process, causing Tarantula to start transforming into a gigantic, monstrous spider-like being. Rodriguez remained relatively humanoid at first (at least, he functioned on a bipedal level). However, after several more skirmishes with both the Wisp and Spider-Man, he rapidly continued to mutate into a fully arachnid appearance. He fell into Jamaica Bay, but survived the plunge and continued to mutate, and then battled Spider-Man atop a tall New York City building. Horrified and disgusted with what he had become, he leapt off the building, begging for the police officers gathered below to kill him. In a hail of gunfire, Rodriquez struck the street below and died.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #233-236</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
In addition to being a great athlete with incredible agility and leaping skills and being excellent in hand to hand combat, Anton wore gloves with retractable razor-blades and boots with retractable razor-sharp points loaded with drugs that would render his victim unconscious, or other harmful or lethal drugs and poisons. He was educated in military school and was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, skilled in various martial arts, but particularly in kickboxing. When he was mutated into a giant Tarantula like creature thanks to the Brand Corporation's mutagenic serum, he gained superhuman strength and the ability to adhere to surfaces. Also just before his death he gained the ability to shoot organic webbing from his backside.

==Luis Alvarez==
The next Tarantula (real name '''Luis Alvarez''') wears a costume identical to that of Rodriguez and is also a special government operative, a former captain in the Delvadian militia, but not given to terrorist activities. He acts more as a death squad/government enforcer. He was chosen by Delvadian government officials to be the second Tarantula, and underwent a mutagenic treatment to increase his physical abilities.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #35-36</ref> He was sent to the United States by the Delvadian government to eliminate political refugees from that country, and to kill Spider-Man for what happened to the first Tarantula; however, he was defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #137</ref> Later working as a mercenary, he teamed up with the [[Punisher]] during the EuroHit story, more specifically in ''Punisher'' vol. 2, #64-67. The Tarantula battled the Punisher, and [[Batroc the Leaper]].<ref>''Punisher'' #68-72</ref> Eventually he was caught by the [[The Jury (comics)|Jury]] and had his neck broken by [[Wysper]].<ref>http://www.samruby.com/Villains/Tarantula/tarantula2.htm</ref>{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Powers and abilities===
This Tarantula had his strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes enhanced to peak human levels thanks to Dr. Karl Mendoza's formula. Like the previous Tarantula, he wore retractable blades in his gloves, and retractable spikes in his boots, anointed with harmful or lethal drugs and poisons. Also like his predecessor, he was educated in military school and was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, skilled in various martial arts, but particularly in kickboxing.

==Maria Vasquez==

===Civil War===
The new Tarantula, '''Maria Vasquez''', debuted in the new ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series. Even [[Misty Knight]], her team leader knows nothing about her history. Tarantula has a bad attitude and is highly skilled using the blades on her wrists and the toes of her boots. She indicates that she enjoys inflicting pain. If instructed not to kill, she will seriously injure an opponent, to the chagrin of her teammates. She has been observed licking her bloody blade after slicing through an enemy in ''Heroes For Hire'' vol. 2, #1. Maria has also been shown to be highly intelligent with knowledge of [[biology]] and [[engineering]] (issue #2 of the same series). In issue #4 she stated that she decided to become a hero to avenge her sister, who had been killed in the [[Civil War (comics)|Stamford Incident]]. This was against the wishes of her father, who would have preferred that she found a safer profession (such as a doctor or lawyer) where she could put her intelligence to good use. Shortly after this revelation, her father was killed by [[ninjas]], though she had been the one marked for death by [[Ricadonna]] (along with the rest of the Heroes For Hire). After they murdered her father, Tarantula killed the entire team of ninjas herself. She shares a passionate kiss with fellow teammate, the aloof [[Shang-Chi]], but she never manages to find the truest implication of such outburst of passion, as she's offered along with [[Colleen Wing]] to the [[Brood (comics)|Brood Queen]] by [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]. When Shang-Chi and the other heroes come to save them, she has gone unconscious, the utter shock leaving her [[catatonic]] and crying. Shang-Chi avenges her, than takes her unconscious body away.

==Ultimate Tarantula==
[[Image:Ultspidey 103.PNG|180px|right|thumb|Ultimate Tarantula (upper left) along with the other clones of Spider-Man]]
Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] stated in ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' that an [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Tarantula was set to appear in the "[[Clone Saga]]" arc of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.[http://www.ultimatecentral.com/forum/showthread.php?t=6559] Although the story arc introduces several new spider-powered characters, none are called Tarantula within the story. However, ''Ultimate Secrets'' identifies a black-costumed, six-armed Spider-Man clone with spider-like eyes and fur (reportedly dead as of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103) as having been Tarantula.
