'''Tarantula''' is the [[alias]] of a number of [[fictional character]]s appearing in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Clay Riley==
'''The Tarantula''' is a Zorro-like western era villain equipped with a [[scourge]] and has a mysterious Mexican accent. He first appears in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' #2 (April, 1967).

==Anton Miguel Rodriguez==
'''Anton Miguel Rodriguez''', known as the Tarantula, is a supervillain who wears a red stretch costume with a black tarantula on its chest. He's equipped with poisonous stingers attached to his soles. He was first introduced in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #134 (July 1974).

===Fictional character biography===
As a revolutionary terrorist and government operative in South America, '''Anton Miguel Rodriguez''' was expelled from his small organization after murdering a guard without reason during a robbery. Anton then went on to the other repressive side of the fascistic dictatorship government where they created the identity of the Tarantula for him to serve as his country's counterpart to [[Captain America]]. He clashed with Captain America, [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Punisher]].

After alienating his masters, the Tarantula embarked on a criminal career in the United States.  Tarantula was hired by the [[Brand Corporation]] to kill Spider-Man.  In an attempt to bestow him with spider powers, he was injected with a mutagenic serum and placed in an electrolyte bath.  Unfortunately for Rodriguez, [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]] disrupted the mutagenic process, causing Tarantula to start transforming into a gigantic, monstrous spider-like being. 

Rodriguez remained relatively humanoid at first (at least, he functioned on a bipedal level). However, after several more skirmishes with both the Wisp and Spider-Man, he rapidly continued to mutate into a fully arachnid appearance. Horrified and disgusted with what he had become, he leapt off of a tall building, begging for the police officers gathered below to kill him. In a hail of gunfire, Rodriquez struck the street below and died.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #234</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
In addition to being a great athlete with incredible agility and leaping skills and being excellent in hand to hand combat, Anton wore gloves with retractable razor blades and boots with retractable razor sharp points loaded with drugs that would render his victim unconscious. When he was mutated into a giant Tarantula like creature he gained superhuman strength and the ability to adhere to surfaces. Also just before his death he gained the ability to shoot organic webbing from his backside.

==Luis Alvarez==
The next Tarantula (real name '''Luis Alvarez''') wears a costume identical to that of Rodriguez and is also a government operative but not given to terrorist activities. He acts more as a death squad/government enforcer. He was sent to kill Spider-Man for what happened to the first Tarantula. He teamed up with the [[Punisher]] during the EuroHit story, more specifically in ''Punisher'' vol. 2, #64-67. Eventually he was caught by the [[The Jury (comics)|Jury]] and had his neck broken by [[Wysper]].[http://www.samruby.com/Villains/Tarantula/tarantula2.htm]

==Maria Vasquez==
[[Image:TarantulaH4H.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The female Tarantula]]
The new Tarantula, '''Maria Vasquez''', debuted in the new ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series. Even [[Misty Knight]], her team leader knows nothing about her history. Tarantula has a bad attitude and is highly skilled using the blades on her wrists and the toes of her boots. She indicates that she enjoys inflicting pain. If instructed not to kill, she will seriously injure an opponent, to the chagrin of her teammates. She has been observed licking her bloody blade after slicing through an enemy in ''Heroes For Hire'' vol. 2, #1. Maria has also been shown to be highly intelligent with knowledge of [[biology]] and [[engineering]] (issue #2 of the same series). In issue #4 she stated that she decided to become a hero to avenge her sister, who had been killed in the [[Civil War (comics)|Stamford Incident]]. This was against the wishes of her father, who would have preferred that she found a safer profession (such as a doctor or lawyer) where she could put her intelligence to good use. Shortly after this revelation, her father was killed by [[ninjas]], though she had been the one marked for death by [[Ricadonna]] (along with the rest of the Heroes For Hire). After they murdered her father, Tarantula killed the entire team of ninjas herself. She shares a passionate kiss with fellow teammate, the aloof [[Shang-Chi]], but she never manages to find the truest implication of such outburst of passion, as she's offered, along with [[Colleen Wing]] to the [[Brood (comics)|Brood Queen]] from the [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]. When Shang-Chi and the other heroes come to the save, she has gone unconscious, the utter shock leaving her [[catatonic]] and crying. Shang-Chi avenges her, than takes her unconscious body away.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Maria has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

==Ultimate Tarantula== <!-- Without a verifiable, non-fan spec, citation to which character is/was the Ultimate Tarantula, please do not change this. -->
Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] stated in [[Wizard Magazine]] that an [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Tarantula was set to appear in the "[[Clone Saga]]" arc of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.[http://www.ultimatecentral.com/forum/showthread.php?t=6559] Although the story arc introduces several new spider-powered characters, none are identified as the Tarantula. The black costume worn by a six-armed Spider-Man clone (reportedly dead as of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103) bears a spider-logo similar to Alvarez's.
