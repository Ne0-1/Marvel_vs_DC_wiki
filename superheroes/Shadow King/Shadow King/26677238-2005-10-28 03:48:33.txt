The '''Shadow King''' (Amahl Farouk) is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a powerful [[telepathy|telepath]].  He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #117 under the guise of '''Amahl Farouk''', written by [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by [[John Byrne]].

His mental powers primarily revolve around the [[astral plane]], where he can take [[possession]] of the minds of others and also take part in battle with others that are in their astral form.
One of Shadow King's major influences in the Marvel Universe began with his psychic battle with Charles Xavier ([[Professor X]]), a battle that left Farouk physically dead and unrestricted upon the astral plane.  After the battle, Xavier began to construct his vision of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, ultimately resulting in the formation of the [[X-Men]].

Years later, Farouk would resurface, first battling the fledgling [[New Mutants]].  Later, he would hunt down [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], who had been regressed to a childlike body by the mutant-hunter called [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]].  From there he went on to take over the minds of the numerous mutants living on Muir Island, home of [[Moira MacTaggert]].  This battle with the Shadow King left the X-Men's ranks depleted; Professor X brought [[X-Factor]] in to assist.  The Shadow King was defeated and thought killed, but the battle left Xavier once again wheelchair-bound and his son [[Legion (Marvel Comics character)|David]] comatose.  After the battle, the X-Men and X-Factor were reorganized, with the original X-Men rejoining the team they had founded.

Some time later, the Shadow King reappeared, having taken over the [[Africa]]n tribe that had once worshipped Storm as a goddess.  He managed to mentally trap the X-Men, and a battle between him and [[Psylocke]] ensued. The battle resulted in a psychic backlash that affected almost all living beings to a varying degree (from nose bleeds to [[deja vu]] to headaches). Beings with powers of a  psychic nature found their abilities significantly affected. Telepaths were particularly affected in that they (temporarily) lost use of their powers. The Shadow King, unaffected by the backlash, was finally defeated by Psylocke. In the process, she sacrificed her telepathic abilities to keep him contained in the astral plane.
