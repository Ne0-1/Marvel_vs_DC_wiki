'''Amahl Farouk''', better known as the '''Shadow King''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a powerful [[telepathy|telepath]].  He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' volume 1 #113, by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]].

His mental powers primarily revolve around the [[astral plane]], where he can take [[possession]] of the minds of others and also take part in battle with others that are in their astral form.
One of Shadow King's major influences in the Marvel Universe began with his psychic battle with Charles Xavier ([[Professor X]]), a battle that left Farouk physically dead and unrestricted upon the astral plane.  After the battle, Xavier began to construct his vision of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, ultimately resulting in the formation of the [[X-Men]].

Years later, Farouk would resurface, first battling the fledgling [[New Mutants]].  Later, he would hunt down [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], who had been regressed to a childlike body by the mutant-hunter called [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]].  From there he went on to take over the minds of the numerous mutants living on Muir Island, home of [[Moira MacTaggert]].  This battle with the Shadow King left the X-Men's ranks depleted; Professor X brought [[X-Factor]] in to assist.  The Shadow King was defeated and thought killed, but the battle left Xavier once again whelchair bound and his son [[Legion (comics)|David]] comatose.  After the battle, the X-Men and X-Factor were reorganized, with the original X-Men rejoining the team they had founded.

Some time later, the Shadow King reappeared, having taken over the [[Africa]]n tribe that had once worshipped Storm as a goddess.  The X-Men defeated him, although [[Psylocke]] temporarily lost her telepathic powers as a result of this battle.
