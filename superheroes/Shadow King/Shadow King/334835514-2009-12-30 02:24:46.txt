The '''Shadow King''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrator/co-writer [[John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #117 (January 1979) as a telepathic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named '''Amahl Farouk'''. 

Amahl Farouk returns years later in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #34 (December 1985), revealed to be possessing [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] since issue #6. Later appearing throughout ''Uncanny X-Men'', the character does not first refer to himself by the name of '''Shadow King''' until issue #266 (August 1990).

''X-Treme X-Men'' and ''X-Men: True Friends'' developed/[[retroactive continuity|retconned]] the Shadow King into actually being an entity of the astral plane that has existed since the dawn of humanity, an ethereal demon preferring to enslave the bodies of powerful telepaths and psi-sentives and utilize their capabilities to enslave others to its whims.  As a side effect of its greed, hedonism, and utter lack of self control, the Shadow King's longterm telepathic hosts are often left morbidly obese.

==Fictional character biography==
The Shadow King exists as an entity of pure psychic energy that feeds on the hatred of humanity. It manifests itself on the physical plane by possessing the bodies of human beings. In 1936, Shadow King works with [[Baron Strucker]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in a scheme to mystically replace the [[King of England]] with a Nazi sympathizer.

Years later, Shadow King assumes the guise of crime lord Amahl Farouk, and leads a [[gang|street gang]] that includes a young [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. He encounters another telepath, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], and the two engage in a psychic battle on the [[astral plane]], that kills Farouk's physical body. However, Shadow King shifts his astral form to another plane. The encounter with an evil mutant encourages Xavier to later form the [[X-Men]], a team dedicated to combating criminal mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #117</ref>

Shadow King eventually possesses the psionic mutant [[Karma (comics)|Karma]]. Storm and the [[New Mutants]] are able to reach Karma's true mind, who is able to purge the Shadow King from her body, confining him once more to the astral plane.<ref>''New Mutants'' #6-34</ref> Shadow King then possesses the body of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] agent '''Jacob Reisz''', hunting down [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and taking over the minds of the numerous mutants living on [[Muir Island]]; this leads to the [[Muir Island Saga]]. The Shadow King battles Charles Xavier once more and is defeated and thought killed, though the battle left Xavier once again required to use a wheelchair and his son [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]] in a coma.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #253-280</ref>

The Shadow King (posing as Ananasi) reappears later and takes over the [[Africa]]n tribe that had worshiped Storm as a goddess, and in the end, is defeated by [[Psylocke]], who sacrifices the use of her telepathy to keep him imprisoned in the astral plane. After Psylocke's death, the Shadow King is released from his prison and attempts to turn [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] into his new Shadow Queen,<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]] [[Annual publication|Annual]] 2001''</ref> hoping to gain her current ability to enter dreamtime. However, Rogue recalls the psionic abilities she had gained from Psylocke and uses them to defeat the Shadow King.

When [[Jamie Braddock]] brings Psylocke back from the dead, the Shadow King escapes, but due to the cosmic whim created by the [[Scarlet Witch]] during the [[House of M]], the Shadow King found himself in another universe where he takes control over Professor Xavier and his team of X-Men, dubbing them the "[[Shadow-X|Dark X-Men]]". Later after the world is shifted back to normal, the Shadow King and his mind-controlled X-Men team travels back to [[Earth-616]]. The Shadow King attempts to kill [[Captain Britain]] with the controlled [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005–2007)|New Excalibur]] but is defeated once again by Psylocke. The Dark X-Men try to free their Xavier from his prison and are assisted by [[Lionheart (comics)|Lionheart]], whom the Shadow King attempts to control.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #19</ref>  However, Lionheart has a device that prevents this and places a collar on the Dark Xavier that seals the Shadow King in that body, and then stabs Dark Xavier in the chest, killing him.

This death proved to be temporary however, as the Shadow King appears once again, this time in [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], where he killed a Wakandan priest and framed the former New X-Men member [[Gentle (comics)|Gentle]] for the murder. He then takes control of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] in order to confront his longtime enemy and T'Challa's wife, Storm. In the conclusion of this battle, Storm was possessed by the Shadow King, but was ultimately defeated when it was revealed that she had allowed Bast, the Panther God of Wakanda to hide within her mind in order to take vengeance on the Shadow King for violating T'Challa's mind and was subsequently devoured by her.<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart'' #1-4</ref>
