The '''Shadow King''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrator/co-writer [[John Byrne]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #117 ([[1979#January|January 1979]]).

An unnamed [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], the Shadow King possesses vast [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers. He became a crime lord under the name Amahl Farouk in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], leading a [[gang|street gang]] that included a young [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. Future X-Men founder [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] encountered Farouk and the two engaged in a psychic battle that trapped Farouk out of his body. 

The Shadow King is a disembodied persona on the [[astral plane]], where he can take [[List of comic book superpowers#astral projection|possession]] of the bodies of others and battle other telepaths in astral form. 

==Fictional character biography==
One of the Shadow King's defining moments in the Marvel Universe began with his psychic battle with Charles Xavier ([[Professor X]]), a battle that left Farouk physically dead and released his psychic essence upon the astral plane. After the battle, Xavier became aware of the threat of evil mutants, and began to construct his vision of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, ultimately resulting in the formation of the [[X-Men]].

Years later, Farouk would resurface, first battling the fledgling [[New Mutants]] and kidnapping [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], whose body he inhabited for some time. He ate in a gluttonous fashion and became morbidly obese before finally being forced to flee and release control of Karma's body to herself. Later, he would hunt down [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], who had been regressed to a childlike body by the mutant-hunter called [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]]. From there he went on to take over the minds of the numerous mutants living on Muir Island, home of [[Moira MacTaggert]]. His influence was felt on the inhabitants for some time. Though the inhabitants were very angry and prone to violence, the Shadow King allowed them some self-reliance when it came to battling the returning threat of Proteus. They were allowed to team up with the [[New Warriors]] and [[X-Force]]. The groups knew something was wrong but did not suspect the Shadow King's involvement. During the [[Muir Island Saga]], the Shadow King was defeated and thought killed, but the battle left Xavier once again wheelchair-bound and his son [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]] comatose. After the battle, the X-Men and X-Factor were reorganized, with the original X-Men rejoining the team they had founded.

===Psi-War===
Some time later, the Shadow King reappeared, having taken over the [[Africa]]n tribe that had once worshipped Storm as a goddess.  He managed to mentally trap the X-Men, and a battle between him and [[Psylocke]] ensued. The battle resulted in a psychic backlash that affected almost all living beings to a varying degree (from nose bleeds to [[déjà vu]] to headaches). Beings with powers of a psychic nature found their abilities significantly affected. Telepaths were particularly affected in that they (temporarily) lost use of their powers. The Shadow King, unaffected by the backlash, was finally defeated by Psylocke. In the process, she sacrificed her telepathic abilities to keep him contained in the astral plane.

After Psylocke’s death, the Shadow King was released from his prison.  He returned with a plan to turn [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] into his new Shadow Queen<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]] [[Annual publication|Annual]] 2001''</ref>. He hoped to gain her ability to enter dreamtime (which she absorbed from [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]]) so that he might take control over the world.  However, she recalled the psionic abilities she had gained from Psylocke and used them to defeat the Shadow King.

===Revenge on Psylocke===
However, though he was defeated, he was still free. He vanished to an alternate reality, where he met and managed to take control over Professor Xavier and his original team of X-Men, dubbing them the "[[Shadow-X|Dark X-Men]]". When the world was shifted back to normal after the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the [[House of M]] were defeated, the Shadow King and his mindcontrolled X-Men team managed to slip back into the [[Earth-616]] world. He later re-emerged in London using the body of an evil alternate version of Professor X, lured (the newly resurrected) Psylocke and New Excalibur to him. After that, the Shadow King had the controlled [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005-2007)|New Excalibur]], minus [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], kill [[Captain Britain]]. Psylocke created a telekinetic bubble to give the Shadow King's host body a stroke. This freed the others from his control, but when Psylocke delivered the killing blow, she vanished in a flash of light.

===Attempted Return===
When the Dark X-Men try to free their Xavier from the prison he is being held at. They are assisted by [[Lionheart (comics)|Lionheart]], and the Shadow King tries to take control of her mind to add to his team<ref>New Excalibur #19</ref>. However, [[Albion (Marvel Comics)#Alternate Brian Braddock|Albion]] had given Lionheart a device that prevents him from doing this. She then places a collar on the Dark Xavier that is supposed to seal the Shadow King in that body, and kill him when that body dies. Lionheart then stabs Dark Xavier in the chest and kills him. However, the Shadow King has returned from supposed death before and it remains to be seen whether or not this is truly the last of him.

==Powers and abilities==
The Shadow King is a powerful telepath that rivals Professor Xavier. He is able to produce a number of mental feats. Notably, he can control the astral plane (which only the most powerful telepaths are able to), as well as possess minds while on the [[astral plane]].  He has demonstrated the ability to live beyond the death of his physical body.  Subsequent [[retroactive continuity|retcons]] have implied that the Shadow King is in fact much older than he seems, and the series ''X-Treme X-Men'' and ''X-Men: True Friends'' suggest that he is in fact a creature of the ethereal plane that has existed since the dawn of humanity.  In the 1940s, he was found to be working with [[Baron Strucker]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in a scheme to mystically replace the King of England with a Nazi sympathizer, greatly increasing Germany's chances for victory, until he was thwarted by a group of time traveling X-Men.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] alternate timeline, the Shadow King (sometimes instead called the Shadow Thief) is an agent of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. He is bodiless like his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, but is usually seen manifested as a cloudy face inside of a bottle in Apocalypse's sanctum. He was the first to detect the presence of [[Nate Grey#Age of Apocalypse|Nate Grey]], prompting Apocalypse to send his assassins to attempt to kill the youth. When [[Warren Worthington III#Age of Apocalypse|Angel]]'s assistant [[Karma (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Karma]] was captured by Apocalypse's servants, the Shadow King psychically tortured her into revealing Angel's alliance with [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]]'s X-Men. He later attempted to read the mind of [[Bishop (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Bishop]], but Bishop's memory of the original reality ([[Earth-616]]) was enough to expel the Shadow King from his mind.

Finally, the Shadow King followed [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Nightcrawler]] to the sanctuary of Avalon (originally the [[Savage Land#Age of Apocalypse|Savage Land]]) by hiding inside the mind of Apocalypse's minion [[Deadpool (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Dead Man Wade]]. There, he took control of the minds of many of Avalon's mutant and human refugees, causing great carnage. Nightcrawler, with the assistance of the psychic Damask and the time-stopping Switchback, was able to physically teleport into the [[astral plane]] and destroy the Shadow King's mind. The great number of casualties caused by the Shadow King's attack were enough to convince [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#Other versions|Destiny]] to accompany Nightcrawler and the X-Men on a mission to Apocalypse's stronghold; her presence was pivotal to the heroes' success in restoring Earth-616 and repairing the timestream.

===Excalibur===
In the first ''Excalibur'' series (issues 21 and 22), an alternate version of the Shadow King has conquered the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], and is using the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] and [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]] to help turn [[Jean Grey]] into his Shadow Queen.  However, [[Rachel Summers]]' interference forces the Shadow King to enlist the aid of [[Iron Man]]. Iron Man wants American independence from a world dominated by Britain but is willing to use mass slaughter to accomplish this. The hero known as [[Crusader X]] helps Excalibur.

===Mutant X===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] alternate timeline, the Shadow King ends up merged with [[Alternate versions of Professor X#Mutant X|Professor X]] to form a gestalt being resembling [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

===Ultimate Universe===
''The Shadow King'' is the name of a play that is being written by Storm and is first mentioned by name in Ultimate X-Men #79, though Ororo mentioned it a few issues before to an injured Kitty she was working on it in secret; she only told her and Professor Xavier about it.  In issue #81, he speaks to Ororo in one of her dreams; she then wakes up and prepares to add the dream to the play. In issue 85, he contacts her while she's awake and warns that he is "Coming for her". In issue 89, he attacks her in her dreams, and it is revealed that the Shadow King was a past lover of Ororo, as well as being the leader of the group of thieves that she and [[Lady Deathstrike]] once belonged. Eventually, she sent him into a comma after unintentionally electrocuting him when she used her powers to summon lightning for the first time. During this time, his mind was sent to another dimmension where he encountered the [[Brood]], and became the Shadow King. He attempts to kill Ororo, but is forced out of her mind when she (apparently) fatally  electrocutes him. Upon waking, she is comforted by her teammates, and at the end of the issue, she is shown deleting the play from her personal computer and stating that that part of her life is over now.

==In other media==
===Television===
The Shadow King appeared in two episodes of the 1990s [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]]. Amahl Farouk was portrayed as an athletic, bearded Egyptian who mindcontrolled a number of children to serve him as thieves, including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], until he was defeated by Xavier and his psychic essence trapped in the Astral Plane. He escaped briefly and possessed Storm's godson Mjnari, though the Shadow King intended to use Mjnari in order to possess Storm. The Shadow King was defeated and trapped once again, only to be released after Professor X suffered an accident which left his mind vulnerable to the Shadow King's attempts to take possession of Xavier and leave his mind trapped in the Astral Plane.

===Video games===
Shadow King was one of the three primary villains in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]. Shadow King kidnapped [[Professor X]] on the astral plane about halfway through the game, thus crippling the [[X-Men]]. He was eventually defeated by Xavier after the X-Men released him. When he first appeared, he dropped hints about a mysterious benefactor who told him how to get his revenge on Xavier. Though he never actually named his ally, it is assumed, given the cutscene at the end of the game and the resulting sequel, that the mysterious figure was [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

===HeroClix===
Shadow King is a figure in the [[HeroClix|Mutant Mayhem]] set from Marvel [[HeroClix]].
