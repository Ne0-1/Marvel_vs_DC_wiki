'''Indigo''' was a superhero in [[DC Comics]]. The character's first appearance was in ''Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day #1.'' 


==History==
Indigo was an [[android]] and a member of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Born in a distant future era, she came to the 21st century badly damaged, and desperately looking for a cybernetic or mechanical organism capable of repairing her. In the process, she tried to install her self-repairing routines into the [[Metal Men]], but they were incapable of assisting her in maintenance. Then she turned to [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], but in the process she damaged him.  

Attacked by the combined forces of [[Young Justice]], Teen Titans and Outsiders, she retreated, switching into an offensive mode. Although the combined forces of the young superheroes bested her, adding further damage to her, she was able activate a dormant Superman Android before shutting down for repairs. But when that android came after the young heroes, managing to kill [[Donna Troy|Troia]], [[Speedy (comics)|Arsenal]] briefly reactivated the young female droid and sent her to stop the Superman Android before shutting down another time.

When Arsenal reformed the Outsiders, he claimed the female droid, now called Indigo, as a teammate.

Her memory supposedly damaged in the aftermath of her dramatic appeareance, any remainder was wiped out by [[STAR Labs]]. Indigo displayed a very naive personality, guilelessly taking pleasure in the simple things in life, like doing laundry for friends, bowling, and having sex with her lover, [[Metamorpho|Shift]] (which created embarassing situations due to her lack of a sense of propriety). She often struggled to learn how to behave in society, and took her cues from those she lived with. As she grew more integrated in her quest to earn the acceptance and forgiveness of [[Nightwing|Dick Grayson]] and her teammates, she even managed to find love with Shift.

It was revealed in ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' #24 that Indigo was actually [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac 8]], every bit the ruthless, inhuman villain that previous Braniacs were. Indigo as the Outsider's knew her was essentially a subprogram, designed by 8's "grandfather" Brainiac 6 to endear her to the superhero community.

Brainiac 8 had been sent back in time to kill Donna Troy, because a living Donna would negate Coluan domination over the "organics" after a crisis. After a beating by the combined forces of Teen Titans and Outsiders, in ''Outsiders'' #25, the Indigo persona wrested control from Brainac 8, and revealed herself to be a genuine personality. Weeping, she begged Shift to kill her before the Brainac 8 persona could harm the people she now loved. Shift, in tears, transformed her molecular structure into flesh, killing her in the process.

==Powers & Abilities==
A unique inorganic being, Indigo possessed an analytical computer mind, could fly, and could project force fields and energy blasts from her eyes and hands,

==Other characters==

Indigo was also the name of a character in ''[[DP7 (comics)|DP7]]'', one of the titles of [[Marvel Comics]]' short-lived [[New Universe]] imprint.
