'''Indigo''' (also called '''Brainiac 8''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the {{DC Universe}}, who is later revealed to be a [[supervillain]]. The character's first appearance was in ''[[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day]]'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Indigo is an [[Android (robot)|android]] and a member of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Born in a distant future era, she comes to the 21st century badly damaged, and desperately looking for a cybernetic or mechanical organism capable of repairing her. In the process, she tries to install her self-repairing routines into the [[Metal Men]], but they are incapable of assisting her in maintenance. Then she turns to [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], but in the process, she damages him.

Attacked by the combined forces of [[Young Justice]] and the [[Teen Titans#Titans (1999–2002)|Titans]], she retreats, switching into an offensive mode. Although the combined forces of the young superheroes best her, adding further damage, she is able to activate a dormant [[Superman robots|Superman robot]] before shutting down for repairs. Yet when the android comes after the young heroes (killing [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]] and [[Donna Troy|Troia]]), [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] briefly reactivates the young female droid and sends her to stop the Superman Android before shutting down again.

When Arsenal reforms the Outsiders, he claims the female droid, now called Indigo, as a teammate.

Her memory was supposedly damaged in the aftermath of her dramatic appearance; any remainder was wiped out by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. Indigo displays a very naive personality, guilelessly taking pleasure in the simple things in life, like doing laundry for friends, bowling, and silent movies. She often struggles to learn how to behave in society, and takes her cues from those she lives with. As she grows more integrated in her quest to earn the acceptance and forgiveness of [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and her teammates, she even manages to find love with [[Metamorpho|Shift]].

It was revealed in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' (vol. 3) #24 that Indigo is actually [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac 8]], and every bit the ruthless, inhuman villain that previous Brainiacs were. Indigo as the Outsiders knew her is essentially a subprogram, designed by Brainiac 8's "grandfather", Brainiac 6, to endear her to the superhero community.

Brainiac 8 had been sent back in time to kill [[Donna Troy]], because a living Donna would negate Coluan domination over the "organics" after the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' events. After a beating by the combined forces of Teen Titans and Outsiders, in ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #25, the Indigo persona wrests control from Brainiac 8, and reveals herself to be a genuine personality. Weeping, she begs Shift to kill her before the Brainac 8 persona could harm the people she loves. Shift, in tears, transforms her molecular structure into flesh, killing her in the process.

The ''Origins and Omens'' back-up story in ''Titans'' #10 indicated that Indigo might soon return, but writer Judd Winick left the book before this plot thread could be followed up on.

Indigo eventually returns in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #98 as part of [[Superboy-Prime]]'s [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]]. She now sports a cybernetic arm and eye, the origins of which are unexplained. During ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #100, Indigo is once again destroyed after [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] decapitate her.

==Powers and abilities==
A unique inorganic being, Indigo possesses an analytical computer mind, can fly, and can project force fields and energy blasts from her eyes and hands. She is also able to interact with and control machines and robots.
