===Character history===
'''Hollis J. Mason (1916-1985)'''<BR>
At the age of 12 his father left the family farm and moved to New York, working at Moe Vernon's Auto Repairs. Starting out as a [[New York City]] policeman in 1938, he was inspired by [[Action Comics]]' [[Superman]] and the real life exploits of [[Hooded Justice]] to take up the life of a vigilante. He was nicknamed ''Nite-Owl'' for spending his evenings working out in the Police Gymnasiums as much as possible and going to bed at 9:00pm to rise for a 5:00am work out before donning his badge and uniform. He became a member of the Minutemen, a "''masked adventurer''" league in mid-1939. Mason was an "old school" crimefighter, stopping colorful criminals and going on to fight Axis operatives during World War II. He retired in May, [[1962]] to open an auto business and write his memoir, ''Under the Hood'', through which [[Silk Spectre]] II later learned of [[Comedian (comics)|The Comedian]]'s attempted rape of her mother [[Silk Spectre]] I.

===Events of Watchmen===
Mason was killed by Derf, a Knot-top gang member, in a frenzied break-in after Nite Owl II and [[Silk Spectre]] II broke [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] out of prison.

===Character history===
Dan Dreiberg relied more upon technical wizardry than toughness, which set him apart from his fellow costumed adventurers. All of his gadgets and costumes are based on an [[owl]] theme.  He uses an owl-shaped flying vehicle nicknamed "Archie" ([[Archimedes]], after the owl in [[Walt Disney]]'s [[The Sword in the Stone]]), equipped with a variety of [[offensive]] and [[defensive]] gear.

Dreiberg's father was a banker who left him a large inheritance, which he used to design and build his crime-fighting gear. Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, was his hero and he retired when Dan started out in the 1960's. Dan wrote and asked if he could carry the name. 

In 1965, Nite Owl II successfully teamed up with fellow costumed adventurer [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] to take on organized crime. Dreiberg retired after the passing of the Keene Act on August 3rd, 1977. Rorschach would later say regarding his retirement, "No staying power." Dreiberg mastered in [[aeronautics]] and [[zoology]] at [[Harvard University]], contributing scholarly articles to ornithological journals after his retirement in 1977.

===Events of Watchmen===
He becomes romantically entangled with the second [[Silk Spectre]], Laurie Juspeczyk, after she left [[Doctor Manhattan]]. He returned to [[vigilantism]] along with her, breaking Rorschach out of prison in an attempt to stop [[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]]' scheme to "save the world from itself." After this incident, he and Silk Spectre took up the identities of Sam and Sandra Hollis, continuing their vigilante activities anew as undisclosed costumed heroes.
