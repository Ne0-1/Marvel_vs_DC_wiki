==Fictional character biography==
'''Victor Stone''' is the son of Silas and Elinore Stone, a pair of scientists who decide to use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects.  However, while these treatments work and Victor's [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] grows to genius-levels, he begins to resent this treatment and strikes up a friendship with Ron Evers, a young miscreant who leads him into trouble with the law.  This is the beginning of a struggle where Victor strives for his own life engaging in pursuits of which his parents disapprove, such as [[sport|athletics]].  In addition, Victor still keeps bad company that leads him into incidents such as when he is talked into participating in a street gang fight in which he is wounded.  For the most part, however, Victor still has a largely normal life under the circumstances where he also refuses to follow Evers' grandiose plans of racially motivated [[terrorism]].

[[Image:Victorgin.png‎|Cyborg|250px|left|thumb|Victor's horrified reaction to his prosthetics.]]
When he visits his parents at work at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], an experiment in dimensional travel goes horribly awry when a massive gelatinous monster crosses over an experimental portal and kills Elinore.  The creature then turns on Victor and severely mutilates him before Silas manages to force the creature back through the portal.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

To save his son, Silas outfits him with experimental prosthetics of his own design.  However, the equipment can not be worn inconspicuously, and thus Victor is horrified to see much of his body, including part of his face, replaced with sheer metallic limbs and implants.  Although Victor wants to die at this shock, he eventually adjusts enough through his resulting physical therapy to control his implants with suitable skill.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

However, upon release from medical care, he finds his life is seriously inconvenienced with the fearful reactions of the public at his implants; even his girlfriend Marcy Reynolds rejects him.  In addition, he is also disallowed participation in athletics not only for his implants, but also for his poor grades, which are the result of inattention prior to his accident (rather than a lack of sufficient knowledge) and further exacerbated by his long convalescence. However, when his old friend Ron Evers attempts to use Victor's troubles to manipulate him into participating in a terrorist attack on the [[United Nations]], Victor finds a new purpose as he equips his weapons attachments and stops his friend in a pitched battle on top of [[United Nations Headquarters]].

===Teen Titans===
Victor joins the [[Teen Titans]], initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and outsiders, and has remained with that group ever since.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  In addition, Victor finds new friends who see past his disfigurements to his own nobility, such as a group of children who are adjusting to their own prosthetics and idolize Victor with his fancy parts and exciting adventures as well as their beautiful teacher, [[Sarah Simms]], who has often assisted him.  Cyborg and Sarah have a deep relationship that is considered by some fans to be Cyborg's one [[romance (love)|true love]], although writer [[Marv Wolfman]] insists it is a deep, caring friendship.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Another person who see past the cybernetic shell is Dr. Sarah Charles, a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] scientist who helps him to recuperate after having his cybernetic parts replaced.  Cyborg and Dr. Charles date for some time, and, along with [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], she keeps trying to reach him when he is seemingly mindless following the severe injuries he incurs during the ''Titans Hunt'' storyline.

===Deaths and rebirths===
[[Image:‎Cyberion2.png|right|thumb|Victor Stone - as '''Cyberion''' - is reunited with Sarah Charles.]]
Although Cyborg's body was repaired by a team of Russian scientists after the missile crash he had been in, albeit with more mechanical parts than previously, his mind was not.  Eventually, his mind was restored by an alien race of computer intelligences called the [[List of alien races in DC Comics#T|Technis]].  Cyborg, however, had to remain with the Technis both to maintain his mind and because, in return for restoring him, he had to teach them about humanity.  He took the name '''Cyberion''', and gradually started becoming less human in outlook, connecting entirely to the Technis planet.

Eventually, Cyberion returned to Earth.  With Vic's consciousness dormant, but his desire for companionship controlling the actions of the Technis' planet, it began kidnapping former Titans members and plugging them into virtual reality scenarios, representing what he believed to be their "perfect worlds"; for example, Beast Boy was back with the [[Doom Patrol]], [[Damage (comics)|Damage]] was spending time being congratulated by the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]], and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] was confronted by a [[Batman]] who actually smiled.  Although the Titans were freed, there was a strong disagreement between them and the [[Justice League]] over what action to take; the League believed that there was nothing left of Victor to save, whereas the Titans were willing to try, culminating in a brief battle, where the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and [[Catwoman]] (who had followed the Justice League to investigate) sided with the League while the [[Wally West|Flash]] fought with the Titans.  While Vic was distracted trying to aid his friends, a Titans team consisting of Changeling and the original five Titans were sent by Raven to try making contact with Vic's human side, while [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Power Girl]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Mary Marvel]] moved the moon back to its proper place.  Eventually, thanks primarily to Changeling's encouragement, and [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] holding Vic together long enough to come up with a plan, Vic's consciousness was restored, and "downloaded" into the Omegadrome, a morphing war-suit belonging to former Titan [[Minion (comics)|Minion]].  In the wake of this event, the Titans reformed and Vic was part of the new group.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  However, he felt less human than ever before.

Shortly after this, [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] revealed he had cloned Vic's body, and by flowing the Omegadrome through the clone, Vic regained his human form, but still had the abilities of the Omegadrome.  He often used the Omegadrome to recreate his original look in battle.  With his newfound humanity, Vic took a leave of absence, moving first to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] with [[Beast Boy]] and then to [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]].  While in Central City, Vic was involved in one of the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s schemes.

===Mentor===
Vic mentored the new incarnation of the Teen Titans, consisting mainly of sidekicks, most of whom have taken over the identities of former members (i.e. [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the third [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], instead of [[Dick Grayson]], the original Robin and Titans leader), as well as stalwarts such as [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], and [[Beast Boy]], where they have fought enemies such as [[Deathstroke]], [[Brother Blood]], [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], The [[Titans Tomorrow]], and a brainwashed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] during a team up with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] in the ''Insiders'' storyline.  In the end, Cyborg was the only one capable of standing up to Dr. Light, thanks to his solar shields.

===''Infinite Crisis'' and beyond===
During [[Infinite Crisis]], Cyborg joined [[Donna Troy|Donna's]] New Cronus Team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''.  He left [[Beast Boy]] in charge of the [[Teen Titans|Titans]] while he was gone.  They arrived at the reset center of the universe and with the help of assorted heroes aided in the defeat of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]], who was attempting to recreate the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] and build a perfect Earth from it.

According to ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 5, Cyborg was fused together with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] after returning to Earth.  This was caused by the energy ripples caused by Alexander Luthor Jr. which altered the Zeta Ray Beams the heroes were going to use to return home.

After being severely damaged during the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Cyborg was rebuilt over time in thanks to Tower caretakers [[Wendy and Marvin]]. He awoke [[One Year Later|a year later]] to find a wholly different [[Teen Titans#One Year Later: The new Teen Titans|Teen Titans]] being led by Robin, the only member from the team he formed prior to going into space.  He is still a member of the team, but feels that [[Kid Devil]] and [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]] are hardly worthy Titans, and thus is attempting to find a way to reform "the real Titans".

After the team along with the Doom Patrol defeated the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], Cyborg asked Beast Boy to rejoin the Titans, but Gar refused, saying that his skills were needed with the Doom Patrol.  After returning to Titans Tower, Cyborg began reviewing the security tapes during the last year, in which it appears that he was looked to by all the Titans of the past year for a shoulder to lean on, despite being in a coma-like state. 

It appears that although Cyborg has returned to the team, the role of leader is now in the hands of Robin.  He does however retain the position of statesman amongst the team and occasionally plays second-in-command.

In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #3, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman agree that Cyborg should be offered membership in the new Justice League.  However, following a battle against [[Amazo]], Green Lantern and [[Black Canary]] take over the formation of the JLA, and Cyborg is not amongst the roster.

In the ''[[Titans East|Teen Titans East]]'' one-shot, Cyborg gathered together a new team of Titans.  During a training exercise, the group was attacked by [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], and Cyborg was blasted by a giant energy beam.  He was last seen in a crater, with only his head and torso remaining.

===Titans===
Cyborg is set to be a main character in the upcoming comic book Titans which focuses on a new team of Titans coming from the old veterans: Titans Cyborg, Nightwing, Troia, Flash (Wally West), Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy, and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]].  The story takes place immediately after the events of the ''Titans East'' one shot.  In the aftermath of Trigon's assault, Cyborg has been placed into a special hoverchair while he recuperates.  Cyborg's body is completely repaired in ''Titans'' #5. Soon after, the resurrected and unbalanced [[Jericho_(comics)|Jericho]] enters Cyborg's body, using him to manipulate the defenses at Titans Tower to kill the Teen Titans. Jericho's plans are foiled when [[Static (comics)|Static]], the newest Teen Titan, uses his electrical powers to overload the Tower's systems, causing feedback that knocks Jericho out of Cyborg.<ref>''Teen Titans Annual'' #1</ref> After recovering, Cyborg pretends to still have Jericho inside of him, in order to draw out [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]], who was currently targeting Jericho. The ploy works too well when Vigilante appears and shot Cyborg in the head.<ref>''Titans'' #12</ref> The story is ongoing.

===2008 miniseries===
In an unspecified time during the ''Teen Titans'' comics, a man with enhancements similar to Cyborg's attacks Dr. Sarah Charles on the day of her wedding to Deshaun, a young scientist.  Cyborg rushes in for the save, discovering how Deshaun, connected to [[Creature Commandos|Project M]], has sold the technology used to turn Stone into Cyborg to the military.  He also finds that the enhanced man was Ron Evers, once Vic's best friend now turned [[terrorism|terrorist]], who was seeking vengeance for the soldiers used as [[human subject research|test subjects]].  After Cyborg manages to calm down his friend and discovers the truth: Mr. Orr, revealed as the mastermind behind Project M's cyborg research, brings his Stone-derived best subjects: the current [[Equus (comics)|Equus]], an armored form of the [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest]], and a cyberized man sporting enhancements even more powerful than Stone's current ones called '''[[Titans East#Titans Tomorrow|Cyborg 2.0]]'''.  

Cyborg 2.0 turns out to be the [[Titans Tomorrow]] Cyborg 2.0, snatched from his proper timeline and cajoled by Orr into fighting his younger self for the possession of their shared technology and Orr's permission to use it in the battlefield.  Cyborg is soon forced to fight simultaneously against the '''Phantom Limbs''', an elite force of soldiers crippled in the [[Middle East]] and restored by his tech, and the '''Cyborg Revenge Squad''', a broader formation composed of the [[Fearsome Five]], [[Magenta (comics)|Magenta]], [[Girder (comics)|Girder]], the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], and [[Cyborgirl]]. Although the ''Cyborg Revenge Squad'' soon gains the upper hand, with the help of his fellow Titans Cyborg is able to hold his own in combat, [[reverse engineer]] on the fly some of the future technology used by Cyborg 2.0, and enhance his own body enough to win against Mr. Orr. He later decides to get a new lease in life, forgiving Deshaun and Sarah Charles on their wedding day for abusing his technology, resuming dating [[Sarah Simms]] and having the Phantom Limbs fitted with new, non-military, prosthetics. It is however implied the Phantom Limbs, unwilling to see Stone's offer as a sign of good will, are trying to get back their weaponized prosthetics and wait for a rematch.

Cyborg will join the [[Justice League of America]]. <ref>http://blog.newsarama.com/2009/09/17/hey-its-time-to-dissect-the-justice-league-roster-again/</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Cyborg possesses cybernetic enhancements that provide superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and durability. Cyborg can also interface with computers. Built into his body-armor were an infrared eye, computer generator, sound amplifier, and special programming adapters that allowed him to interface with other body extensions.  Additionally, he possesses an "exceptionally gifted" level of intelligence; his [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] has been measured at 170.<ref>''Tales of the New Teen Titans'' #1 (June 1982); ''DC Special: Cyborg'' #1 (July 2008).</ref>

Cyborg in time has tinkered with his cybernetic parts, enhancing his function at levels beyond the abilities set by his father. A feature that sets him apart from the "mass production" version built by Project M is a self-repair system, able to flawlessly repair the mechanical part of his body, no matter how worn out they are, and even improve the health of the still biological ones to an unknown degree.

==In other media==
===Television===
====''Super Friends''====
Cyborg appeared in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (the final incarnation of ''[[Super Friends]]'') from 1985 to 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm|title = Hanna-Barbara Superfiends Chronology|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref> He was voiced by [[Ernie Hudson]]. Cyborg's origin was told via a medical journal read by Dr. Martin Stein saying Cyborg was a promising decathlon athlete until an accident destroyed most of his body and his father replaced part of his body with machine parts. Also, he is not a [[Teen Titans|Titan]]. He becomes fast friends with fellow teammate [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. He is an affiliate of the [[Justice League of America]] under [[Superman]]. In the introductory episode to Cyborg, "The Seeds of Doom", Cyborg's abilities save Earth from Darkseid's seeds, but as Superman warns, make Darkseid a dangerous enemy to Cyborg, so Cyborg joins the League.

====''Justice League'' pilot promo====
When ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' was pitched to the [[Kids' WB]] network, the lineup originally included three young members as proteges for the League. The members would have been [[Robin in other media|Robin]], [[Bart Allen|Impulse]], and an original character described as a "teenage female version of Cyborg" ([[Cyborgirl#Other media|Cyborgirl]]). The promo is viewable on the fourth disc of the ''Justice League'' Season 1 boxset. 
<br style="clear: left;">

====''Teen Titans'' (animated series)====
[[Image:CyborgTTgo!.png|250px|right|thumb|Cyborg using his Sonic Cannon in the episode "Nevermore" on the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.]]
Cyborg appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Khary Payton]]. This version of Cyborg is very similar to his comic book counterpart. His nickname is "Cy", and like his teammates, in the animated series Cyborg is never referred to by his given name; however, he does take the alias "Stone" (based on his real last name) in the Season 3 episode "Deception." The two main differences are his design and that he is more easygoing than his comics counterpart. His head is considerably more rounded and bald (based on his ''Titans Hunt'' counterpart), and his mechanical parts are bulkier. His primary weapon is a sonic cannon housed in his forearm; initially he uses only his right arm to fire, but later episodes reveal that his left arm has an identical cannon built into it as well. Other onboard weapons and tools, such as an [[acetylene]] torch, a remote-operated [[video camera]], and several [[missile launchers]], can be deployed as needed, and his arms and legs are detachable.

Cyborg is the Titans' chief technician and gadgeteer. He is responsible for the construction of the Titan Tower's electronic and security systems and the team's main vehicles, the T-Car and the T-Ship. His most dominant personality faults featured in the series are his enormous appetite and a tendency to be overly vain about his work ("Deep Six," "Car Trouble," "Wavelength"); as a result, he fosters a special dislike for those who abuse his devices irresponsibly, especially [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] and [[Brother Blood]]. On occasion, Cyborg acts as the team's second-in-command, but he tends to [[wikt:butt heads|butt heads]] with Robin on rather trivial matters. In "Cyborg the Barbarian" he was sent back to 3,000 B.C. There, he met a woman named Sarasim (a homage to Victor Stone's lover [[Sarah Simms]]) and fell in love with her. The relationship ended when Cyborg was brought back to his own time.

Cyborg's age is never specified, but he mentions in "Deception" that he never had a chance to finish high school due to circumstances that made him what he is. The only time Cyborg's personal history has been discussed is in "Deception", in which he discusses his involuntary cyborg status with Starfire, and in the 4th season episode "The End: Part 2." In this episode, Trigon creates duplicates of Cyborg, Starfire, and Beast Boy. These duplicates reflect the dark side of each character. During the fight between Cyborg and his duplicate, the dark duplicate says "Go ahead! Run cryin' home to Mommy! Oh that's right. You don't HAVE a Mommy." In the episode "Go!", in which it is revealed how the Teen Titans met, and the spin-off comic book series ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' it is revealed that his mother died, and he himself was injured to the extent he required his cybernetic implants, in a car accident. 

In the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' storyline a future version of Victor Stone is shown having similar plating as the animated Cyborg.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Teen Titans|Volume = 3|Issue = 17-19|Date = (Dec 2004 through Feb 2005)|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

====''Smallville''====
[[Image:Victor Stone-Cyborg.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lee Thompson Young]] as Victor Stone in ''[[Smallville]]''.]]Cyborg appeared in the 15th episode of ''[[Smallville]]'''s [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]], which was also titled "Cyborg", and premiered on February 16, 2006. In this version, Victor ([[Lee Thompson Young]]), is a former Metropolis High School football star. He is involved in a car accident that kills him, supposedly, and the rest of his family. However, he is secretly rebuilt by Cyntechnics scientists including Dr. Alistair Krieg ([[Mackenzie Gray]]), who experimented on a group of test subjects. Victor was the only test subject to survive the experiments. Cyntechnics was bought up by [[wikiasite:smallville:LuthorCorp|LuthorCorp]] shortly before Victor's escape. [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]] denies any knowledge of Cyntechnics' secretive activities. "Alistair Krieg" is very likely a reference to [[Alice Krige]], who played the [[Borg Queen]] (the name 'Borg' itself is derived from the word, 'cyborg') in [[Star Trek: First Contact]]. In that movie, her character attempted to create a sort of reverse-process cyborg by grafting organic tissue onto the android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]]. 

Although Victor's cybernetic enhancements are entirely [[endoskeleton|endoskeletal]] instead of [[exoskeleton|exoskeletal]] as they are in the comics and other media, a shot of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s [[X-ray vision]] reveals that Victor's cranial armor covers the same-shaped area as it does in the comics. He also bleeds a dark fluid as he does in the comics. ''Smallville'' never uses the name "Cyborg" in his first appearance. Instead, Victor refers to his enhancements as "[[bionics|bionic]]", and the episode explicitly references the 1970s [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' which also featured a cybernetically-enhanced "bionic" man.

Lee Thompson Young reprised his role in "Justice", a [[Smallville (season 6)|Season 6]] episode about [[Green Arrow]] gathering together a group of individuals to combat Lex Luthor and his [[wikiasite:Smallville:Level Three|experiments]]. The episode premiered on January 18, 2007. In this episode, Victor has finally taken the name "Cyborg", as Green Arrow's team uses [[code name]]s. Also on the team are [[Aquaman]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]. While Victor was last seen with a girlfriend named Katherine, he explains that his mechanical parts put a strain on the relationship. After their eventual break up, Victor states that it was Green Arrow who kept him from committing [[suicide]]. The episode also shows Cyborg wearing something of a costume (a stylized silver vest), and utilizing further enhancements Green Arrow gave him. One of his new functions allows him to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into and disable security systems. While connecting to machines, Cyborg's left eye glows red, another nod to his comic book incarnation. 

Cyborg is a main character in the online animated ''Smallville'' spin-off ''Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom'' along with the other Justice Leaguers. In episode three, he displays additional abilities such as offensive sound wave projection.

Smallville's Cyborg received mixed reviews. While some liked the changes made from comics to show, others felt that he was so little like his comic book counterpart that they may as well have given him a different name.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

===Video games===
====''DC Universe Online''====
Cyborg is set to appear in the upcoming [[MMORPG]] ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

===Toys===
A Cyborg figure, in [[DCAU]] style, has been released in the [[DC Universe: Justice League Unlimited Fan Collection|Justice League Unlimited toyline]] in late 2009{{Fact|date=March 2009}}. A Cyborg figure was released by DC Direct in 2001 as part of its Teen Titans series, and he was also included in the 2003 Classic Teen Titans Box Set, presented in gold bionics as opposed to his standard silver.  Two versions of the character were released in Mattel's [[DC Universe Classics]] action figure line, a standard version, and a KB Toys exclusive version that featured Cyborg with a "sonic arm". In the 1980s, a very hard-to-find version was made for the Kenner Super Powers range.
