[[DC Comics]] has published two characters who have used the name "Cyborg."

==Vic Stone==

'''Victor "Vic" Stone''' is the most well-known Cyborg, having appeared on the animated [[Superfriends]] and [[Teen Titans]].

Vic Stone was severely injured in an alien attack, and received a large amount of cybernetic [[prosthetic|prosthetics]]. He joined the Teen Titans (the group with which he is most strongly affiliated) and has remained with that group ever since, through being destroyed, reconstructed, assimilated by an alien race, and having his humanity restored.

==Hank Henshaw==

'''Henry "Hank" Henshaw''' appeared as the Cyborg during the ''Reign of the Supermen'' storyline following the death of [[Superman]].

Hank was a member of a doomed spaceflight on a LexCorp shuttle, his body turned into pure energy in a [[pastiche]] of the origin of the [[Fantastic Four]]. His wife, a fellow astronaut on the flight, was the only member of the expedition unaffected by alien radiation. He transferred himself into LexCorp's mainframe, and then into Superman's Kryptonian escape shuttle, which he used to explore the universe.

He returned as an incomplete Superman lookalike, with mechanical parts over most of his body, and blamed Superman for his exile. With Superman dead after his battle with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], the Cyborg claimed to be Superman reborn; DNA tests matched Superman's, and his technology was identifed as Kryptonian. Allied with the alien warlord Mongul, Cyborg was responsible for the destruction of Coast City (see [[Green Lantern]]). This Cyborg was last seen in the [[Phantom Zone]].
