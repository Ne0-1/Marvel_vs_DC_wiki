'''Cyborg''' ('''Victor Stone''') is a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] best known as a member of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George Pérez]], he first appeared in ''DC Comics Presents'' #26 ([[1980#October|October 1980]]).

The son of well-meaning but thoughtless scientists who tried to use him in their experiments to artificially enhance human intelligence, Victor was a troubled youth. When one of his parents’ experiments brought an extra-dimensional [[monster]] to Earth, Victor was horribly maimed. His father used advanced [[prosthesis|prosthetics]] to rebuild his son, but at a cost of being disfigured by them.

[[Cyborg|Half-man, half machine]], Cyborg used his mechanical enhancements as a superhero.  The Teen Titans acted as a surrogate family, helping him recover his [[self-esteem]] and retain his inner humanity.  He is a mentor of the current Titans.

Cyborg was also a main character on the [[2000s]]-era ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]].

==Fictional character biography==
{{comics-real}}

===Tragic origins===
Vic Stone was the son of a pair of scientists who decided to use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects. However, Victor grew to resent this treatment and fell in love with a young miscreant who led him into trouble with the law. This was the beginning of a struggle where Victor strove for his own life engaging in pursuits his parents disapproved of, such as [[sport|athletics]]. In addition, Victor still kept bad company that led him into incidents such as when he was talked into participating in a street gang fight in which he was shot and wounded. For the most part however, Victor still had a largely normal life under the circumstances where he also refused to follow his best friend's grandiose plans of racially motivated [[terrorism]].

[[Image:Victorgin.png‎|Cyborg|250px|left|thumb|Victor's horrifying reaction to his prosthetics.]]
All that changed one day when he visited his parents at work at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]].  Coincidentally, an experiment in dimensional travel went horribly awry when a massive gelatinous monster crossed over an experimental portal and killed Victor's mother. The creature then turned on Victor and severely mutilated him before his father managed to force the creature back through the portal.

To save his son, Victor's father outfitted him with experimental prosthetics of his own design.  However, the equipment could not be worn inconspicuously, and thus Victor was horrified to see much of his body, including part of his face, replaced with sheer metallic limbs and implants.

Although Victor wanted to die at this shock, he adjusted enough through his resulting physical therapy to control his implants with suitable skill.

However upon release from medical care, he found his life was seriously inconvenienced with the fearful reactions of the public at his implants; even his girlfriend rejected him. In addition, he was also disallowed participation in athletics not only for his implants but for his poor grades which were further exacerbated by his long convalescence. However, when his old friend attempted to use Victor's troubles to manipulate him into attempting a terrorist attack on the [[United Nations]], Victor found a new purpose as he equipped his weapons attachments and stopped his friend in a pitched battle on top of [[United Nations Headquarters]].

===Teen Titans===
He joined the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and outsiders and has remained with that group ever since. In addition, Victor found new friends who saw past his disfigurements to his own nobility, such as a group of children who were adjusting to their own prosthetics and idolized Victor with his fancy parts and exciting adventures as well as their beautiful teacher, [[Sarah Simms]], who has often assisted him. Cyborg and Sarah have a deep relationship that is considered by some fans to be Cyborg's one [[romantic love|true love]], although writer [[Marv Wolfman]] insists it is a deep, caring friendship.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Another person who saw past the cybernetic shell was Dr. Sarah Charles, a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] scientist who helped him to recuperate after having his cybernetic parts replaced. Cyborg and Dr. Charles dated for some time, and, along with Changeling, she kept trying to reach him when he was seemingly mindless following a plane crash.

===Deaths and rebirths===
[[Image:‎Cyberion2.png|right|thumb|Victor Stone - as '''Cyberion''' - is reunited with Sarah Charles.]]
Although Cyborg's body was repaired after the plane crash, albeit with more mechanical parts than previously, his mind was not. Eventually, his mind was restored by an alien race of computer intelligences called the Technis. Cyborg, however, had to remain with the Technis both to maintain his mind and because, in return for restoring him, he had to teach them about humanity. He took the name '''Cyberion''', and gradually started becoming less human in outlook, connecting entirely to the Technis planet.

Eventually, Cyberion returned to Earth.  With Vic's consciousness dormant, but his desire for companionship controlling the Technis planet's actions, it began kidnapping former Titans members and plugging them into virtual reality scenarios, representing what he believed to be their "perfect worlds"; for example, Beast Boy was back with the [[Doom Patrol]], [[Damage (comics)|Damage]] was spending time being congratulated by the [[Justice Society]], and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] was confronted by a [[Batman]] who actually ''smiled''. Although the Titans were freed, there was a strong disagreement between them and the [[Justice League]] over what action to take; the League believed that there was nothing left of Victor to save, whereas the Titans were willing to try, culminating in a brief battle, where the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and [[Catwoman]] (Who had followed the JLA to investigate) sided with the League while the [[Wally West|Flash]] fought with the Titans. While Vic was distracted trying to aid his friends, a Titans team consisting of Changeling and the original five Titans were sent by Raven to try making contact with Vic's human side, while [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Power Girl]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Mary Marvel]] moved the moon back to its proper place. Eventually, thanks primarily to Changeling's encouragement, and [[Omen (comics)|Omen]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] holding Vic together long enough to come up with a plan, Vic's consciousness was restored, and "downloaded" into the Omegadrome, a morphing war-suit belonging to former Titan [[Minion (comics)|Minion]]. In the wake of this event the Titans reformed and Vic was part of the new group. However, he felt less human than ever before.

Shortly after this, [[Nightwing]] revealed he had cloned Vic's body, and by flowing the Omegadrome through the clone, Vic regained his human form, but still had the drone's abilities. He often used the drone to recreate his "classic" look in battle. With his newfound humanity, Vic took a leave of absence, moving first to [[Los Angeles, California|L.A.]] with [[Beast Boy]] and then to Central City. While in Central, he got involved in a plot by the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], which froze the Omegadrome's morphing powers and left him in his original cyborg form.

At the same time, a female version of Cyborg calling herself '''[[Cyborgirl]]''' appeared as a member of a group of [[Wonder Woman]] enemies called [[Villainy Inc.]] She is the niece of Dr. Charles, who required emergency surgery after a reaction to the "super-steroid" Tar. Her cybernetic implants give her all the same abilities as Vic, but she has none of his sense of responsibility.

===Mentor===
Vic currently mentors the new Teen Titans group, consisting mainly of sidekicks, most of whom have taken over the identities of former members (i.e. [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the third [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], instead of [[Dick Grayson]], the original Robin and Titans leader), as well as stalwarts such as [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], and [[Beast Boy]], where they have fought enemies such as [[Deathstroke]], [[Brother Blood]], [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], The [[Titans Tomorrow]], and a brainwashed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] during a team up with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] in the ''Insiders'' storyline.

===''Infinite Crisis'' and beyond===
During [[Infinite Crisis]], Cyborg joined [[Donna Troy|Donna's]] New Cronus Team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''. He left [[Beast Boy]] in charge of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Titans]] while he was gone. They arrived at the re-set center of the universe and with the help of an assorted heroes aided in the defeat of Alexander Luthor, who was attempting to re-create the multiverse and build a perfect Earth from it.

According to the fifth issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', Cyborg was fused together with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] after returning to Earth. This was caused by the energy ripples caused by Alexander Luthor Jr. which altered the Zeta Ray Beams the heroes were going to use to return home.

After being severely damaged during the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Cyborg was rebuilt over time in thanks to Tower caretakers [[Wendy and Marvin]]. He awoke [[One Year Later|one year later]] to find a wholly different [[Teen Titans (comics)#One Year Later: The New Teen Titans|Teen Titans]] being led by Robin, the only member from the team he formed prior to going into space. He is still a member of the team, but feels that [[Kid Devil]] and [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]] are hardly worthy Titans, and thus is attempting to find a way to re-form "the real Titans".

After the team along with the Doom Patrol defeated the Brotherhood of Evil, Cyborg asked Beast Boy to rejoin the Titans, but Gar refused saying that his skills were needed with the Patrol. After returning to Titans Tower, Cyborg began reviewing the security tapes during the last year, in which it appears that he was looked to by all the Titans of the past year for a shoulder to lean on, despite being in a coma-like state. 

It appears that although Cyborg has returned to the team, the role of leader is now in the hands of Robin.  He does however retain the position of statesman amongst the team and occasionally plays second-in-command.

In ''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #3, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman agree that Cyborg should be offered membership in the new Justice League.  However, following a battle against Amazo, Green Lantern and Black Canary take over the formation of the JLA, and Cyborg is unfortunately not amongst the roster.

In the ''Teen [[Titans East]]'' one-shot, Cyborg gathered together a new team of Titans. During a training exercise, the group was attacked by an unknown assailant, and Cyborg was blasted by a giant energy beam. He was last seen in a crater, with only his head and torso remaining.

==Appearances in television series==
===''Super Friends''===
Cyborg appeared in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (the final incarnation of ''[[Super Friends]]'') from 1985 to 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm|title = Hanna-Barbara Superfiends Chronology|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref> He was voiced by [[Ernie Hudson]]. Cyborg's origin was changed to the more simplified story of him being injured in an automobile accident as opposed to being attacked by an extraterrestrial creature. 

===''Justice League'' pilot promo===
When ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' was pitched to KidsWB, the lineup originally included three young members as proteges for the League. The members would have been [[Robin in other media|Robin]], [[Bart Allen|Impulse]], and an original character described as a "teenage female version of Cyborg". The promo is viewable on the fourth disc of the ''Justice League'' Season 1 boxset. This character is similar to [[Natasha Irons]] in appearance and alliances, but more like [[Cyborgirl]] in general concept.

===''Teen Titans (animated series)''===
[[Image:CyborgTTgo!.png|right|thumb|Cyborg in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans Animated Series]]''.]]
====Similarities====
The cartoon version of Cyborg is very similar to his comic book counterpart. The two main differences are his design and that he is more easygoing than his comics counterpart. His head is considerably more rounded (and bald), and his mechanical parts are bulkier. In the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' storyline a future version of Victor Stone is shown having similar plating as the animated Cyborg.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Teen Titans|Volume = 3|Issue = 17-19|Date = (Dec 2004 through Feb 2005)|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

====Stone====
In the animated series, Cyborg is never referred to by his given name. However, he does take the alias "Stone" (based on his real last name) in the Season 3 episode "Deception". As the Stone character, it seems that he can turn his body into stone with the help of wrists devices. He is known to have a love of [[video game]]s, and is often seen battling Robin or Beast Boy in either a fighting or racing game. Cyborg dated [[H.I.V.E.]]'s [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], but their relationship dispatched after the H.I.V.E students found out he was a Titan and was using them to learn about H.I.V.E's headquarters, and later has a brief partnership with [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Sarasim|Sarasim]], a warrior from the distant past but their important parts in their time periods ensured that a relationship could never be. A former athlete (as in the comics), his victories are often accompanied by a resounding "Booyah!" [[Brother Blood]] was a recurring nemesis of his in Season 3. He also maintains a rivalry with [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] and [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Atlas|Atlas]].

====Powers====
His abilities and offensive attacks include a Sonic Cannon, which he can project from his right arm at will, a smaller sonic blaster located in his left foot, two sets of missile launchers (one in each shoulder), super-strength, high-end sensor and communication technology, and can also produce several different tools (a saw, a welding torch, a buffer, etc.) from his arms. When Cyborg fought his darker self, he produced a second sonic cannon in his left arm. At one point, he installed a super-processor chip called the Maximum-7 to further increase his abilities, but an overload forced [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] to remove it. It is hard for fans to tell which parts of his body are organic human parts. Many think his torso and head are authentic, yet it is often hard to tell. In several episodes he is shown eating (and vomiting in one) food, which could indicate he at least has a stomach. In the episode "Crash", Beast Boy and [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] enter his body in microscopic form, and only synthetic parts are seen. In the episode "Only Human" he fires his entire right arm as a projectile, which would indicate it has no organic connection to his body.

Cyborg's greatest weakness in the series is his dependency on power sources to maintain not only his strength, but his very life.

It was revealed in a later episode, "The End Part 1", that Cyborg can interface with Titans Tower and its security system, drawing power from it and using it to power two super powered Sonic Cannons that project from both arms. The power from these cannons appears to be much greater than his normal blasts. He uses these cannons to attack the then-immortal Slade and [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]]'s immortal army, but because of the immortality of his targets, the attack fails.

====Origin====
''[[Teen Titans Go]] #45'' delves further into Cyborg's background.  He loved being faster than anyone else, which is why he was part of the track team and he enjoys driving around constantly.  Cyborg's accident is a result of reckless driving on his part.  His parents save him by attaching cybernetic part to his body.  Resentful of what his parents have done for him, he chooses to leave home to hide from his parent and the rest of the world (which leads into the events from the Teen Titans episode ''Go'').

Cyborg's father is an expert in biomechanics and advanced robotics, his mother a leader in nanotechnology and the cybernetic field.

====Other====
Cyborg is the only regular [[Teen Titans (comics)|Titan]] that is in the episode "For Real", which stars the [[Titans East]].

He is voiced by actor [[Khary Payton]].

Cyborg is a playable character in the [[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]] video game for the [[Game Boy Advance]].

Cyborg is a playable character in both "Story" and "Master of Games" modes in the console [[Teen Titans (console game)|Teen Titans]] game.

He currently appears in the [[Teen Titans Go!]] series and appears in every issue.

In "Titans East", Cyborg creates a theme song for himself that is set to the show's theme. He sings, "''When there's trouble, you know what to do. Call Cyborg! He can shoot a rocket from his shoe! Cause he's Cyborg! Nanananana something like that (aw yeah). Nanananana big fluffy cat (that's right!).''"

When Cyborg fights his "dark side", it says "''You gonna go crying home to mommy? Oh, that's right, you don't have one''!"

===''Smallville''===
[[Image:Victor Stone-Cyborg.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lee Thompson Young]] as Victor Stone in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.]]Cyborg appeared in the 15th episode of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'''s fifth season, which was also titled "Cyborg", and premiered on [[February 16]], [[2006 in television|2006]]. In this version, Victor ([[Lee Thompson Young]]), is a former Metropolis High School football star. He is involved in a car accident that kills him, supposedly, and the rest of his family. However, he is secretly rebuilt by Cyntechnics scientists including Dr. Alistair Krieg ([[Mackenzie Gray]]), who experimented on a group of test subjects. Victor was the only test subject to survive the experiments. Cyntechnics was bought up by Luthorcorp shortly before Victor's escape. Lex denies any knowledge of Cyntechnics' secretive activities.

Although Victor's cybernetic enhancements are entirely [[endoskeleton|endoskeletal]] instead of [[exoskeleton|exoskeletal]] as they are in the comics and other media, a shot of Clark Kent's X-Ray vision reveals that Victor's cranial armor covers the same-shaped area as it does in the comics. He also bleeds a dark fluid as he does in the comics. ''Smallville'' never uses the name "Cyborg" in his first appearance. Instead, Victor refers to his enhancements as "[[bionics|bionic]]", and the episode explicitly references the 1970s [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' which also featured a cybernetically-enhanced "bionic" man.

Lee Thompson Young reprised his role in "Justice", a Season 6 episode about [[Green Arrow]] gathering together a group of individuals to combat [[Lex Luthor]]. The episode premiered on [[January 18]], [[2007 in television|2007]]. In this episode, Victor has finally taken the name "Cyborg", as Green Arrow's team uses [[code name]]s. Also on the team are [[Aquaman]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]. While Victor was last seen with a girlfriend named Katherine, he explains that his mechanical parts put a strain on the relationship. After their eventual break up, Victor states that it was Green Arrow who kept him from committing [[suicide]]. The episode also shows Cyborg wearing something of a costume, and utilizing further enhancements Green Arrow gave him. One of his new functions allows him to hack into and disable security systems. While connecting to machines, Cyborg's left eye glows red, another nod to his comic book incarnation.

Cyborg is a main character in the online animated ''Smallville'' spin-off ''Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom'' along with the other Justice Leaguers. In episode three, he displays more additional abilities such as offensive sound wave projection.
