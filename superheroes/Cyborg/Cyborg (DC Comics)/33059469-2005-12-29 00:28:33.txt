'''Victor "Vic" Stone''' otherwise known as '''Cyborg''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], and is also a regular on the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animated series]].

==Comics==
Vic Stone was the son of a pair of scientists who decided to use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects.  However, Victor grew to resent this treatment and fell in with a young miscreant who led him into trouble with the law.  This was the beginning of a struggle where Victor strove for his own life engaging in pursuits his parents disapproved of such as [[athletics]].  In addition, Victor still kept bad company that led him into incidents such as when he was talked into participating in a street gang fight in which he was wounded.  For the most part however, Victor still had a largely normal life under the circumstances where he also refused to follow his best friend's grandiose plans of racially motivated [[terrorism]].

All that changed one day when he visited his parents at work at [[STAR Labs]].  Coincidentally, an experiment in dimensional travel went horribly awry when a massive gelatinous monster crossed over an experimental portal and killed Victor's mother. The creature then turned on Victor and severely mutilated him before his father managed to force the creature back through the portal.  To save his son, Victor's father outfitted him with experimental prosthetics of his own design.  However, the equipment could not be worn inconspicously, and thus Victor was horrified to see much of his body, including part of his face, replaced with sheer metallic limbs and implants.  Although Victor wanted to die at this shock, he adjusted enough through his resulting physical therapy to control his implants with suitable skill.

However upon release from medical care, he found his life was seriously inconvenienced with the fearful reactions of the public at his implants, even his girlfriend rejected him.  In addition, he was also disallowed his participation in athletics not only for his implants but for his poor grades which were further exacerbated by his long convalescence.  However, when his old friend attempted to use Victor's troubles to manipulate him into attempting a terrorist attack on the [[United Nations]], Victor found a new purpose as he equipped his weapons attachments and stopped his friend in a pitched battle on the [[UN building]].

He joined the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and freaks and has remained with that group ever since. In addition, Victor found new friends who saw past his disfigurements to his own nobility such as a group of children who were adjusting to their own prosthetics and idolized Victor with his fancy parts and exciting adventures as well as  their beautiful therapist who took a shine to him herself.

Throughout his association with the Titans, Victor has been destroyed, reconstructed, assimilated by an alien race, and had his humanity restored.  He currently mentors the new Teen Titans group, consisting mainly of sidekicks, most of whom have taken over the secret identities of former members (i.e. [[Tim Drake]], the third [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], instead of [[Dick Grayson]], the original Robin and Titans leader), as well as stalwarts such as [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], and [[Beast Boy]], 
where they have fought enemies such as [[Deathstroke]], [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Doctor Light]], The Titans of Tomorrow and [[Kon-El|Superboy]] and [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] during the Insiders storyline with a team up with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].

==''[[Infinite Crisis]]''==
Cyborg has joined [[Wonder Girl|Donna's]] New Cronus Team that is going to a hole in the universe that was found in ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''.

==Appearances in Television Series==
===Superfriends===
:{{main|Super Friends}}
Cyborg appeared in ''[[Super Friends]]: The Legendary Super Powers Show'' from 1984 to 1985 and in ''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'' from 1985 to 1986.[http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm]

He is voiced by actor [[Ernie Hudson]].

===Teen Titans===
:{{main|Teen Titans (animated series)}}

The cartoon version of Cyborg is very similar to his comic book counterpart. The two main differences are his appearance and that he's less serious as the show normally has a much lighter tone than the comics.  His head is considerably more rounded, and his mechanical parts are hulkier, but not overwhelming.

Of course, in the animated series, he's never referred to by his name. However, he does take the alias "Stone" in the Season Three episode "Deception". He is known to have a love of [[video game]]s, and is often seen battling Robin or Beast Boy in either a fighting or racing game. Cyborg also had a big crush on the [[H.I.V.E.]]'s [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]], and later has a brief relationship with [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Sarasim|Sarasim]], a warrior from the distant past. A former athlete (just like in the comics), his victories are often accompanied by a resounding "'''BOOYAH'''!" [[Brother Blood]] acted as his nemesis in Season Three.

His abilities/offensive attacks include two Sonic Cannons (one in each arm), a smaller sonic blaster located in his left foot, two sets of missile launchers (one in each shoulder), super-strength, high-end sensor and communication technology, and can also produce several different tools (a saw, a welding torch, a buffer, etc.) from his arms. At one point, he installed a super-processor chip called the Maximum-7 to further increase his abilities, but an overload forced [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] to remove it.

He is voiced by actor [[Khary Payton]].

===Smallville===
Cyborg will be appearing in the 15th episode of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'''s 5th season played by [[Lee Thompson Young]].
