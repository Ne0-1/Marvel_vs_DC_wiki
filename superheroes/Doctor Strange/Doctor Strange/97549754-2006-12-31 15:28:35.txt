'''Doctor Strange''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[magician|sorcerer]] and [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963). Additionally, the name had been used for [[Doctor Strange#Previous Doctor Strange|a different Marvel character]] two months earlier.

Dr. Stephen Strange is the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of the Marvel [[Universe]], responsible for defending it from mystic threats. He is a master of the [[magic (paranormal)|mystic arts]], using his abilities to battle evil magicians and other supernatural [[villain]]s. He is also often consulted by other superheroes on supernatural matters.

==Publication history==
After debuting in ''Strange Tales'' #110 and returning in the next issue, the nine- to 10-page feature "Dr. Strange" skipped two issues and then returned permanently with #114 (Nov. 1963). Steve Ditko's [[surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly head-trippy visuals helped make the feature a favorite of 1960s college students, according to contemporaneous accounts. Ditko, as co-plotter and later sole plotter, in the "[[Marvel Method]]", would eventually take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms that nonetheless remained well-grounded thanks to Stan Lee's reliably humanistic, adventure/[[soap opera]] dialog. Doctor Strange shared the "split book" ''Strange Tales'' with solo adventures of [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Johnny Storm|Human Torch]] (whose feature had begun in issue #101), and, beginning with #135, with its replacement feature, ''[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.

While Lee and Ditko themselves interacted less and less as each went their different creative ways, Doctor Strange's storyline culminates with what historians consider one of modern comics' great moments: the  introduction, in issue #146 (July 1966), of Ditko's grand and enduring conception of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the personification of the universe, depicted as a majestic silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos. It was a groundbreaking creation at a time long before such cosmic conceits were commonplace, and Ditko's final bow on the feature.

"Doctor Strange" continued to the end of the book's run, when the "Fury" feature was spun off into its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange'' with issue #169 (June 1968). '''Note:''' This is the title as given in the book's postal [[indicia]]; Dr. Strange's various series, confusingly, have changed their cover-logo titles much more so than most series. See the [[Doctor Strange#Bibliography|Bibliography]] for details.

Doctor Strange's first namesake comic book, written by [[Roy Thomas]] with art by [[penciler]] [[Gene Colan]], lasted only until issue #183, by which point Strange was given a new civilian identity as "Dr. Stephen Saunders" as well as a full-face cowl in an effort to more resemble a Marvel [[superhero]] and help low sales. The look was short-lived and subsequently abandoned.

Strange's next series began in the 1970s showcase title ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'', continuing into a solo book generally titled as ''Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts'' (the original 1968 comic had also used that subtitle for a time, though not in the indicia). An acclaimed early arc by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and penciller/co-plotter [[Frank Brunner]], featured the death of Strange's mentor, the [[Ancient One]], followed by a storyline in which Strange witnessed the [[Creation (theology)|Creation]], or re-creation, of the universe. Reflecting that era's trend toward "cosmic" characters and stories &mdash; a trend ironically begun in the Lee-Ditko '60s stories &mdash; this turn away from more traditionally occult, supernatural stories helped propel the soon-to-be-spun-off series through 81 issues, under various teams.

Through 1987-88, the character returned in ''Strange Tales'' Vol. 2, #1-19, appearing in 11-page stories in this "split book" shared with the feature ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]''. This was followed by Strange's third solo title, generally listed as ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'', which lasted 90 issues from 1988-96. Doctor Strange also appeared in various [[miniseries]] and two [[graphic novels]], and had major recurring roles both in the 1970s feature and later comic book ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' and the 1990s comic book ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Stephen Strange was born on [[November 18]], [[1930]]<ref>Biograhical dates are taken from ''Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Marvel Knights'', except for Strange's birth month, November, taken from the cover of ''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 1, #176 (Jan. 1969).</ref> in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. A few months later the Stranges move to a farm in [[Nebraska]]. There Stephen is brought up alongside his brother Victor and sister Donna. 

Stephen became an accomplished but arrogant surgeon until he suffered subtle, though profound, neurological damage in an automobile accident in 1963. His hands in particular were no longer able to make the precise, fine movements necessary for surgery, although their overall mobility remained. Unable to continue his profession and too prideful to accept subordinate medical assignments, he became unemployed and destitute. Learning of a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] who might possibly cure him, the desperate Strange ventures to the man's isolated [[Himalayan]] abode and asks him for aid. The Ancient One instead offers to take on Strange as an apprentice in the mystic arts. Strange refuses, but cannot leave immediately due to a sudden blizzard.

While staying for the duration of the storm, Strange witnesses the Ancient One's apprentice, [[Baron Mordo]], secretly attack the teacher with mystically summoned skeletons, which the old man easily dispells. Strange, his skepticism eroding, confronts Mordo about the treachery. Mordo responds with restraining spells that keep Strange both from warning the Ancient One or attacking Mordo physically.  Amazed by these displays of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], alarmed by Mordo, but frustrated by the mystic restraints, Strange undergoes a change of heart. Deciding the only way to stop Mordo is to learn magic himself in order to challenge Mordo on his terms, Strange accepts the Ancient One's offer. Pleased by Strange's acceptance for unselfish reasons, the Ancient One removes the mystic restraints, explaining he was well aware of Mordo's treachery, but prefers to keep Mordo close by in order to control and possibly change him. Strange studies magic under the Ancient One for seven years and returns to the [[United States]] in the 1970s.

===Silver Age Strange===
Based in his "[[sanctum sanctorum]]" mansion in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood, Strange uses his new abilities to fight such mystic enemies as recurring nemesis Mordo; the flame-headed otherdimensional ruler [[Dormammu]], with whom he clashes often; and Strange's first recorded foe upon returning to America, [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]. He encounters such cosmic beings as the [[Living Tribunal]], and the personification of the universe itself, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], as well as numerous superheroes and even, at one [[Times Square]] [[New Year's]] celebration, longtime family friend and author [[Tom Wolfe]] (who allowed his likeness to be used in ''Doctor Strange'' Vol. #180, May 1969). On one journey to Dormammu's realm, Strange meets and eventually falls in love with [[Clea]], the tyrant's human-appearing niece.

When the demon Asmodeus briefly impersonates him, Strange dons a superheroic-looking full-face cowl and a "secret identity" as Dr. Stephen Saunders from Vol. 1, #177 through the final issue, #183 (Feb.-Nov. 1969).

===Death of the Ancient One===
When the demonic entity [[Shuma-Gorath]] (first mentioned in ''Marvel Premiere'' #5, Nov. 1972) tries to cross into the Earth's dimension from within the mind of the Ancient One (#9, July 1973), Strange is forced to sacrifice his mentor in order to save humanity's collective soul (#10, Sept. 1973). After his mentor's death — in which the Ancient One becomes "one with the universe" and a lingering presence — Strange inherits the mantle and power of Sorcerer Supreme of [[Earth]]'s plane. 

After taking his lover Clea as his disciple (''Marvel Premiere'' #12, Nov. 1973), one of his first tasks as Sorcerer Supreme is to confront Death.  After proving himself worthy, Strange is granted the immortality befitting his new role. As Sorcerer Supreme, Dr. Strange is near ageless and immune to dying from natural causes. His predecessor, the Ancient One, had lived for over five centuries.

The Ancient One, much later, fought Dr. Strange in the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'' (March-July 2006). He was depicted as having been condemned to [[Hell]], without a Marvel Universe-continuity explanation.

===Defenders and Nightstalkers===
Also during this time Doctor Strange gathers the [[anti-heroes]] the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] to form the sporadically summoned superhero "non-team", the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. 

In a 1982-83 arc (''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2, #56-62), Strange successfully invokes the "Montesi Formula" that eliminates all [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]] in the Marvel Universe. Though this is considered permanent at the time, in the early 1990s Strange finds it necessary to organize, in Defenders fashion, a group of [[vampire hunter]]s dubbed the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] — [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and vampiric private detective [[Hannibal King]]. The three are told they have been brought together to fend off [[supernatural]] threats, and only later learn it is in fact to prepare for the weakening of the Montesi Formula and the expected return of [[Dracula]]. By the time vampires indeed come back, throughout various Marvel occult comics in the mid-1990s, Strange has been temporarily usurped as Sorcerer Supreme by the demonic Salome.

His position restored shortly afterward, Strange, by the mid-2000s, serves chiefly as a  supporting character to whom Marvel superheroes might turn for matters concerning magic and the supernatural.  Other times, he directly intervenes in crises.  In one instance, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] psionic personnel are hunting the [[Dire Wraith]]s with help of [[Rom the Spaceknight]], but are being easily killed by the enemy's wizards.  Strange appears of his own accord to give the psionic personnel improved resistance to the attacks.

=== Civil War ===
The [[one-shot]] comic ''[[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' #1 (June 2006),  reveals that Doctor Strange has been a member of the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]], a secret alliance of several prominent superheroes, since just after the [[Kree-Skrull War]]. In the final known meeting of the group, Strange vehemently opposes the proposed [[Superhuman Registration Act]], and informs [[Iron Man]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] that they are never to call on him again. In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #3 (Sept. 2006), Wong tells [[Hank Pym]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] that Strange has no intention of supporting the Act and is in seclusion in the Arctic. The government declares Dr. Strange exempt from registration.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:DeodatoDrStrange.jpg|thumb|190px|Dr. Strange performing an incantation. Art by [[Mike Deodato]].]]Dr. Strange is the Sorcerer Supreme of [[Earth in fiction|Earth]].<!--The universe is an awfully big place; is there confirmation there's no other equally powerful mystical being in it?--> He has unparalleled mastery of the mystic arts, which he uses to defend this reality from otherworldly threats. His primary magical patrons are a group of entities known as "the [[Vishanti]]."  The Vishanti are a trinity of godly beings comprised of [[Agamotto]], Hoggoth, and Oshtur. Although he has, on rare occasions, called upon the power of the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] [[Dormammu]], he no longer does so.  Stephen Strange also holds an M.D. in neurosurgery, although his ability to perform such delicate tasks has been compromised due to his accident.  He is also an accomplished [[Martial arts|martial artist]].

Dr. Strange's powers are all mystical but take several forms. Main manifestations include:
* Personal abilities — As a result of his mystic training, Doctor Strange is capable of a great many abilities such as [[astral projection]], [[telepathy]], [[Hypnosis|hypnotism]], [[teleportation]], and several others.  These are put in a separate category because he seems to perform these functions as a telepath would, not needing to manipulate [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to do it.  These abilities can be amplified by mystic energy (as against [[Moondragon]]) or the [[Eye of Agamotto]] (done countless times) to afford Strange powerful psychic abilities.

* Universal sources — By manipulating the ambient mystical energy of this universe, Dr. Strange can perform a great many functions.  Commonly this is seen as energy bolts that range from low power to planet destroying, [[transmutation]], [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]], [[Force field (science fiction)|protective shields]], etc.  He can also use this mystical energy to cast spells of a near infinite variety.  These spells seem to be quicker to perform but lesser in power than spells using [[Divinity|divine]] energy.

* Divine sources — Dr. Strange can channel energy from countless nigh-omnipotent mystical and non-mystical beings in countless dimensions to empower his spells. This can take the form of standard spells ("Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak]]") or just stating what he wants to occur and channeling some being to make it happen.  It is unknown at this time what debt, if any, he incurs by invoking the powers that be. There is no ''[[quid pro quo]]'', though some entities will feel he is obliged to heed their call when they need help in their conflicts as did the Vishanti.

* By sheer force of will, Dr. Strange can "take" the power of another entity. This does not require the use of a spell. He used this ability against [[Captain Universe]] in the Guardians of the Galaxy run as well as against Arioch and [[Shuma-Gorath]] during the Strange Tales Volume 2 run.  Dr. Strange's ability to do this is a testament to his incredible willpower and strength of mind. This is considered black magic and as such he rarely employs this. Also when taking the powers of celestial entities he absorbs the mind and assumes their duties and roles in the dimension in which they exist.  If his will falters, he can lose all sense of self. 

The Marvel Universe canon suggests that virtually every human is capable of learning and harnessing magic — considered simply another form of energy within continuity — through training; however, each person has a different potential.  <!--"The Ancient One saw in Stephen an incredible potential, quite likely the greatest on Earth."  This has been confirmed by various events such as in "Unthinkable" where Doctor Doom had dedicated himself to magic, but was still only a mid-level mage compared to Stephen) QUESTION: When and in what comics was "Unthinkable"? Was it a single story or a story arc? What happened that confirmed whatever -- did Doom admit it, or did someone else say it, or what?--> 

Strange's own power is often amplified by the numerous magical artifacts that are in his possession or by artifacts that he uses in the course of his adventures. The two artifacts he carries with him at all times are the [[Eye of Agamotto]] and the [[Cloak of Levitation]]: 
*The [[Eye of Agamotto]] (which resides within the Amulet of Agamotto worn at Dr. Strange's throat) is a powerful and valued artifact that has many functions. Using the Eye, Strange can see through any [[lie]], deception or [[illusion]], and free others that are trapped in their own illusions.  It is often used to amplify his [[mind's eye]], giving [[psychic]] abilities that rival the most powerful of telepaths. It is also often used to play back an area's past events and open dimensional portals.  When used offensively, most beings can hardly withstand its light; due to its lethal effect, it is often used as a weapon of last resort.

*The [[Cloak of Levitation]] allows him to fly, and responds to his thoughts.  Strange has used it many times as a "third set of hands" to attack a foe when his own body has been incapacitated. The cloak is nearly indestructible, often escaping damage during even the most violent confrontations. 

Other artifacts include the [[Orb of Agamotto]], which he uses daily to monitor the surrounding dimensions for trouble; the [[Wand of Watoomb]], which amplifies his power; and the [[Book of the Vishanti]], which contains some of the multiverse's most powerful and secret spells and counter-spells. He owns countless other artifacts he can bring out in times of need.

For a brief period, research from the Vishanti library led Strange to tap into "catastrophe magic" by invoking a [[syzygy]] of all the planets, but this source of magic was limited and he ceased using it specifically as a source of his power.  

The mansion where Dr. Strange lives, his Sanctum Sanctorum, is located at 177A Bleecker Street, [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], [[New York]], which was at or near the actual address of the apartment building in which then series-writer [[Roy Thomas]] lived.{{fact}} Strange has imbued the mansion with several spells (mostly protective, some pro-active).

===Sorcerous phrases===
Co-creator and longtime original scripter Stan Lee wrote many [[Alliteration|alliterative]] exclamations and incantations that Dr. Strange would utter. Lee and later writers often created characters and storylines based on these casually thought up phrases:
* "By the Flames of the Faltine!"
* "By the Sons of [[Satannish]]!"
* "By the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth!"
* "By the Ruby Rings of [[Raggadorr]]!"
* "By the Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak]]!"
* "By the Deathless [[Vishanti]]!"
* "By the Vapors of the [[Vishanti]]!"
* "By the Eye of [[Agamotto]]!"
* "By the Vapors of [[Valtorr]]!"
* "By the Images of [[Ikonn]]!"
* "By the Demons of Denak!"
* "By the Fangs of [[Farallah]]!"
* "By the Mystic Moons of Munnopor!"
* "By the Shades of the [[Seraphim]]!"
* "By the Omnipotent Oshtur!"
* "By the fires of [[Ikthalon]]!"
* "By the Wondrous Winds of Watoomb!" [and] "By the Wondrous Wand of Watoomb!"
* "By the Hoary #%*-ing Hosts!" <ref>Doctor Strange: The Oath #2 (2006)</ref>
<!--* "By the Might of Puissant Oshtur!"--"puissant"? Could someone please source this suppose quote-->

==Character as [[deus ex machina]]==
There have been many arguments that Dr. Strange is simply a plot-device.{{citation needed}} Marvel editor [[Joe Quesada]] said:
{{cquote|...you can place Dr. Strange in peril but it never really seems like much because at any moment he can cast a spell of crimson bands of what have you and he's out. There are no rules to his universe and from a storytelling perspective that's problematic. When you look at imaginary situations, worlds like the world of ''Toy Story'' or even Roger Rabbit have rules of their universe clearly defined. Heck in Roger Rabbit it's very clear how to kill a 'toon, so the viewer gets the feeling that the characters can be placed in peril and have their backs placed against the wall. This is exactly what I'm looking for in regards to our magic characters. Rules that govern them. How do you kill Doctor Strange? How do you hurt him?<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/Joechristmas06.htm ''Newsarama'': "Joe Christmas, A Special Holiday Q&A With Joe Quesada" (column), 2006 (n.d.)]</ref>}}

In the Marvel canon, there are no clearly defined limits of what Dr. Strange can or cannot do. The stories themselves contradict one another: Dr. Strange is shown easily altering memories, or having complete mastery over time by either stopping it all together and rewinding it or traveling into the past in one story, then stating that his magic cannot do so in another instance. In some appearances he can stand against something as powerful as the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], and in others he appears defenseless against simple physical attack by another person.
<!--There are two major groups of thought.  Some feel that writers need to abandon attempting to treat Stephen as a "conventional hero" and embrace that as Sorcerer Supreme it is only logical that he is a god-like being as he must protect Earth's dimension from countless quasi-omnipotent entities who still dwarf him in power.  Others feel that writers should return to the power level of a more Ditko-era Stephen and move away from the cosmic character that Englehart created.

Another source of disgruntlement among fans{{fact}} is that some writers have ignored canonical evidence that Dr. Strange has enchantments that shield his body, and that he virtually does not age, with his predecessor as Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, having lived several centuries.-->

==Major villains==
[[Image:DitkoEternity.jpg|thumb|250px|Dormammu attacks Eternity in a ''Strange Tales'' panel drawn by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
* [[Baron Mordo]] — A dark sorcerer and frequent threat.
* [[Dormammu]] — A fallen Faltinian being. When outcast, he chose to take a form of pure mystical energy to maintain most of his Faltine essence.  He took over the Dark Dimension from the Mindless Ones and consistently tries to expand into other dimensions through conquest. Dormammu is a being of immense power and one of Strange's most frequent foes. 
*[[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] — A fallen Faltine. Sister of Dormammu, she choose to take a lesser and more conventionally human physical form in order to experiment with physical pleasures.  She is the mother of Clea.
* [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] — Ruler of the dream dimension, father of [[Dreamqueen]] and inspiration for Gaiman's [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]].{{citation needed}}  Though he is a threat to Strange and to humanity, his existence is necessary, since without Nightmare humanity would go insane. Appeared in Doctor Strange's debut story in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963). 
*[[Shuma-Gorath]] — A vastly powerful extradimensional being of chaos magic, and the ruler of thousands of realms.  It ruled the Earth ages ago. Unable to be destroyed, its essence is taken on by its supplanter. Shuma-Gorath crossing over into our dimension would be disastrous, and Doctor Strange has been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to stop it.
*[[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] — Personification of Death in Earth's dimension.  It was in Doctor Strange's fight against Death that he proved himself worthy to be Sorcerer Supreme. <!--There is antipathy between Death and Strange since as Sorcerer Supreme Death is not allowed to take him. THIS NEEDS EXPLANATION; Ancient One died, and this article says Strange can be killed--> Death has claimed that when Stephen finally fails in his duty she will take him; however, it is more likely he will become one with Eternity, as have the Sorcerers Supreme before him.
* [[Satannish]] —  One of the demon rulers of the dead. Strange's duties have occasionally led to confict with this being.
* [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] — One of the demon rulers of the dead, originally introduced as a [[Silver Surfer]] foe, but who has since become a major entity in story arcs here and in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' and other Marvel series. Strange's duties have occasionally led to confict with this being.

==Doctor Strange as supporting character==
Dr. Strange is often used as the all-in-one solution to the many world-altering events that occur in other characters' comic books. Prominent examples include:

*In ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #190-191 (Feb.-March 1985), the wizard [[Kulan Gath]] magically transformed New York City into an approximation of his own ancient time. Everyone save for Strange and a handful of others forgot who they were and assumed roles appropriate to such a reality. Strange was held prisoner by Kulan Gath, his flesh warped to prevent him speaking aloud or making mystical gestures. The spell was eventually broken and reality was restored by Dr. Strange and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].
*In ''[[Micronauts]]'' #35 (Nov. 1981){{fact}}<!--Just need to confirm, since Dr. Strange isn't listed in this issue per GCD and he isn't on the cover. See: [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=35817]-->, Dr. Strange was instrumental in helping the Micronauts defeat ancient demons from Earth's past. As he kept the demons at bay, Commander Arcturus Rann rushed the Keys to the Enigma Force to the tomb of Prince Wayfinder, the creator of the Microverse. After opening the Tomb, Strange and Rann encountered the Sword in the Star, who merged them into a single entity, [[Captain Universe]], in order to save the rapidly deteriorating Space Wall between Earth and the Microverse.
*In ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' {{issue}}, Dr. Strange recruited the heroes to stop [[Thanos]], was one of the few heroes to survive Thanos' decimation of his opposition, and was responsible for rescuing the few survivors in the final battle against Thanos and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. Strange was one of the few people to remember that these events had occurred.
*In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' {{issue}}, Dr. Strange brought Vance Astro back to the 20th Century where Charlie-27 was about to be murdered by a Badoon Captain named L'Matto. The long-standing battle, which was appearing to be in L'Matto's favor, suddenly went in Vance and Charlie's favour when [[Aleta Ogord]] became the new Starhawk. With Dr. Strange's help, she defeated the Captain Universe-empowered L'Matto and then exorcised the Uni-Power from L'Matto's body and returned with it to the 20th Century; there, they parted ways with Strange, who returned to his studies, while the Uni-Power headed off to find a new host.
*In ''[[House of M]]'' #7-8 (Nov.-Dec. 2005), Dr. Strange and [[Emma Frost]] prevented the [[Scarlet Witch]] from imposing her will on the entire world. Driven insane by her powers, the Witch reverted the alternate reality she had created, but stripped the majority of the world's mutants of their powers. Only a few who were shielded by Dr. Strange's spell and Frost's psychic powers retained their memories of the House of M reality and of what had transpired.
*In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' {{issue}}, Dr. Strange appeared during an invasion by Dormammu and the mindless ones on New York City.  Reed Richards of [[The Fantastic Four]] inadvertently released Dormammu from his "prison" by making a gun to send the mindless ones back to their dimension.  Doctor Strange appeared in time to fight Dormammu and, with the help of [[Spider-Man]], Dormammu and the mindless ones were sent back to their dimension.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Doctor Strange===
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Dr. Strange is Doctor Stephen Strange, Jr.. His father is Doctor Stephen Strange, Sr. According to Clea, Strange Sr.'s former student and ex-wife, the elder Strange mysteriously vanished (he suddenly "wasn't there anymore") twenty years ago. Clea tried to raise her son away from magic (and still refuses to discuss it with her son), but ultimately Stephen, Jr., discovered his father's secrets. He currently studies with the Ultimate version of Wong and supports himself as a new age guru who helps the elite and powerful find their own personal salvation. He has had several run-ins with [[Ultimate Spider-Man]]. In each case, Ultimate Dr. Strange has bemoaned his lack of knowledge in things mystical and usually only barely saves the day with a last desperate, untried spell.

===Doctor Strange in other continuities===
*In the [[Marvel 1602]] miniseries, Sir Stephen Strange, the court magician of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], senses that there are unnatural forces at work.  He is the replacement in the 1602 universe for [[John Dee]], and is married to a version of Clea.  Here, he cannot use his 'Astral Projection' (which he refers to as a magic mirror) as well as the modern one could, lacking modern materials, and is often physically drained after it is finished, and lacks memory of what he saw in astral form.  Eventually, when Elizabeth is dead, he allows himself to be executed for witchcraft and treason, having gone under a vow of silence while he lived that can be bypassed when he is resurrected.
*In [[Marvel 2099]], the Sorceress Supreme of Earth is a young woman who calls herself "Strange".  She secretly shares her body with a monstrous demon.
*In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe Dr Strange was combined with [[Charles Xavier]] and [[Doctor Fate]] into ''[[Dr. Strangefate]]''.  As the only character aware of the nature of the Amalgam Universe, he was the chief opponent of [[Access (comics)|Access]], who was attempting to separate the [[DC Universe|DC]] and [[Marvel Universe]]s.
*An alternate Dr. Strange helped the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] briefly.  This character was not a mystic, but instead was still a practicing physician who specialized in superhumans.  This version of Doctor Strange was killed by an alternate version of [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]].
*In the [[MC2]] alternate future, Doctor Strange is retired and the title of [[Sorcerer Supreme]] has been passed to the younger Doc Magus.
*In the alternate future of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], Dr. Strange assumed the title of the Ancient One (previously held by his mentor) and took on a disciple of his own, a Lem named [[Krugarr]].  Strange/the Ancient One was eventually killed by [[Dormammu]], who was defeated by the combined efforts of Krugarr, his disciple [[Talon]] and the Guardians.

==In other media==
[[Image:Drstrangemovie.jpg||thumb|left|VHS release of the telefilm ''Doctor Strange'' (1978), starring Peter Hooten (at left, above)]]
===Film===
*''Doctor Mordrid'' (1992), a film starring [[Jeffrey Combs]] as the titular hero, was originally developed as a feature film by [[Full Moon Entertainment]] about Dr. Strange. However, rights to the character and name were lost, and the movie was reworked.<ref>[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104115/  IMDb: ''Doctor Mordrid'']</ref>

===Television===
*A made-for-TV movie version of Dr. Strange ran on CBS in 1978. It was directed by Phil DeGuere and starred Peter Hooten as Dr. Strange. In many ways more faithful to the original character than the other Marvel Comics adapations of the period, the movie nonetheless changed some of the supporting characters.

[[Image:TalesOfSuspense41.jpg|thumb|Marvel's first Dr. Strange: ''Tales of Suspense'' #41 (May 1963), cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] (pencils) & [[Sol Brodsky]] (inks)]]
Only two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R. Berns") and [[Don Heck]] (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and [[Ph.D.]] with the same [[surname]]. This Dr. Strange was one of [[Iron Man]]'s earliest [[antagonists]] in the story "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #41 (May 1963). After gaining mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike, this Dr. Strange established a [[force field (science fiction)|force field]]-protected island base staffed with corrupt scientists and [[mercenaries]]. He attempted world domination, but was thwarted by Iron Man and by Strange's own estranged daughter, Carla. 

This [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] story was reprinted in ''Marvel Collectors' Item Classics'' #4 (Aug. 1966), the hardcover collection ''Marvel Masterworks: Iron Man from Tales of Suspense Nos. 39-50'', and ''Essential Iron Man Volume 1''.

As well, the publisher [[Nedor Comics]] featured a character known as [[Doc Strange]] in the 1940s.

==Trivia==
*In the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon ''[[The Venture Brothers]]'', the character [[Doctor Byron Orpheus]] closely resembles Dr. Strange.
*In the movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', a ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' employee suggests "Dr. Strange" as a potential nickname for the main villain, later dubbed [[Dr. Octopus]]. Editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]] momentarily considers the name before remembering, "It's taken."
