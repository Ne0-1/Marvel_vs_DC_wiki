'''Doctor Strange''', a [[fictional character]], is a [[sorcerer]] and [[superhero]] featured in [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963).

Dr. Stephen Strange is the '''[[Sorcerer Supreme]]''' of [[Earth]], the chief sorcerer of his dimension and responsible for defending it from other mystic threats. He is a master of the [[magic (paranormal)|mystic arts]], using his abilities to battle evil magicians and other supernatural [[villain]]s. He is also often consulted by other superheroes on supernatural matters.

Dr. Strange experienced a brief stint of popularity during the psychedelic era of the late 1960s. Since then, Marvel has published several, minorly popular series featuring the character and he makes frequent guest appearances in various Marvel [[comic books]].

==Character biography==
Dr. Stephen Strange(1930-) was originally an accomplished but arrogant [[surgery|surgeon]] who suffered subtle, though profound, neurological damage in an automobile accident in the early 1960s.  Unable to continue his profession and too proud to accept another medical assignment, he quickly became unemployed and destitute.  He learned of an old hermit called the [[Ancient One]] who could possibly cure him.  When Strange sought him out and asked for his aid, the old man refused, but offered to take him on as an apprentice.  Strange refused, but could not leave immediately due to a sudden blizzard.  

While staying for the duration, he saw the Ancient One's current apprentice, [[Baron Mordo]], secretly attack his teacher with some mystically summoned entities.  Although Strange saw the old man easily fight them off, he still confronted Mordo about his treachery and promised to inform his master.  Mordo retaliated by casting restraining spells which kept Strange from both warning the wizard or attacking Mordo physically.  Amazed by these displays of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], alarmed by Mordo's evil and the peril the Ancient One was in, but frustrated by the mystic restraints, Stephen Strange underwent a profound change of heart.  Deciding that the only way to stop Mordo was to learn magic himself so he could challenge Mordo on his terms, he accepted the Ancient One's offer of apprenticeship.  Pleased by Strange's acceptance and the unselfish reason for it, the Ancient One accepted him and immediately removed the mystic restraints.  The wizard explained that he was well aware of Mordo's treachery, but preferred to keep the villain so he could control him.

Strange studied magic(and martial arts) under the Ancient One for seven years.  He returned to America as mage in the 1970s.  Under the pen of Ditko, Stephen used his new abilities to fight many mystic enemies and underwent many adventures which are all recounted in the Essential Doctor Strange Volumes.  Englehart took over the character and transformed him into the powerful force he is today.  When Shuma-Gorath tried to cross over into the Earth's dimension,  Stephen was forced to sacrifice the Ancient One to save Earth's dimension.  After his mentor's death, Strange inherited the mantle and power of Ancient One's place as Sorcerer Supreme of [[Earth]], the chief wizard of his Universe, responsible for defending it from any mystic threats.  One of his first tasks as Sorcerer Supreme was to confront Death.  After proving himself worthy, Stephen was granted the "immortality" that befit his new role.  As Sorcerer Supreme, he is near ageless and is immune to dying from natural causes (The Ancient One himself lived over five centuries).

The comic distinguished itself with the unique visuals of artist Steve Ditko, in particular, his depictions of the bizarre other realities that the wizard often ventured into.  Since Ditko's departure, the character has had a spotty publishing history, both with his own series and the leader of his own superhero team, [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]].  He also organized the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] — the trio of the [[vampire hunter]]s [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]] and [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and the vampiric private detective [[Hannibal King]] — ostensibly to fend off supernatural threats but in fact to prepare for the weakening of the anti-[[vampire]] Montesi Formula and the expected return of [[Dracula]]. He is now chiefly used as a supporting character, who other Marvel superheroes turn to for matters concerning magic and the [[supernatural]].  Other times, he directly intervenes in certain crisises.  For instance, at one time [[SHIELD]] was hunting the [[Dire Wraith]]s with help of [[Rom the Spaceknight]] with psionic personnel who were being killed by mystic attacks by the enemy's wizards trying to stop them.  To address this problem, Dr. Strange appeared on his own accord to cast a spell to give the personnel improved resistance to the attacks.

Doctor Strange's stories have frequently involved cosmic beings, with the [[Living Tribunal]] and [[Eternity (comics)| Eternity]] each making their debut in Doctor Strange comics.

===Doctor Strange in other continuities===
*In the [[1602 (comics)|1602]] miniseries, Sir Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work.
*In [[Marvel 2099]], the Sorcerer Supreme of earth is a young woman who calls herself "Strange".  She secretly shares her body with a monstrous demon.
*In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Dr. Strange is ''Doctor Stephen Strange, Jr.'', whose father is Doctor Stephen Strange, Sr.  Clea Strange, former student and ex-wife tells that twenty years ago, he suddenly wasn't there anymore -- but the name Doctor Strange returned when Stephen, Jr. discovered the secrets of the father he never knew.  He became the "go-to" man for the elite looking for their own personal salvation.

==Powers and abilities==
Dr. Strange is the Sorcerer Supreme of [[Earth]]; he has unparalleled mastery of the mystic arts, which he uses to defend his reality from otherworldly threats; his primary magical patrons are a group of entities known as "the Vishanti."  The Vishanti are a trinity of godly beings comprised of [[Agamotto]], Hoggoth, and Oshtur. Although he has, on rare occasions, called upon the power of the [[demon]]ic [[Dormammu]], he no longer does so.  He holds an M.D. in neurosurgery, although his ability to perform such delicate tasks has been compromised due to his accident.  Stephen is also an accomplished martial artist.

Dr. Strange's powers are all magical and take several forms. Several main manifestations include:
* Personal abilities.  As a result of his mystic training, Stephen is capable of a great many abilities such as astral projection, telepathy, hypnotism etc.  These are put in a separate category because he seems to perform these functions as a telepath would, not needing to manipulate magic to do it.  These abilities can be amplified by mystic energy(as against [[Moondragon]]) and/or the Eye of Agamotto(done countless times) to afford Stephen incredibly powerful psychic abilities.

* Universal sources.  By manipulating the ambient mystical energy of the universe, Dr. Strange can perform a great many functions.  Commonly this is seen as mystic bolts, transmutation, telekinesis,  standard shields, etc.  He can also use this mystical energy to cast spells of a near infinite variety.  These spells seem to be quicker to perform but lesser in power than spells using divine energy.
(Every human is capable of doing this through training, however each person has a different potential.  The Ancient One saw in Stephen an incredible potential, quite likely the greatest one on Earth.  This has been confirmed by various events such as in "Unthinkable" where [[Doctor Doom]] had dedicated himself to magic, but was still only a midlevel mage compared to Stephen)

* Divine sources.  Dr. Strange can channel energy from countless mystical beings in countless dimensions to empower his spells. This can take the form of standard spells ("Crimson Bands of Cytorrak") or just stating what he wants to occur and channeling some being to make it happen.  It is unknown at this time what debt, if any, he incurs by invoking the powers that be. There is no ''quid pro quo'', though some entities will feel he is obliged to heed their call when they need help in their conflicts as did the Vishanti.

* By sheer force of will "take" the power of another entity. This does not require the use of a spell. He used this ability against Arioch and Shuma-Gorath during the Strange Tales Volume 2 run.  The fact that Stephen can do this is a testament to his incredible will-power and strength of mind. This is considered black magic and as such he rarely employs this. Also when taking the powers of celestial entities he absorbs the mind and assumes their duties and roles in the dimension in which they exist.  If his will falters, he can lose all sense of self. 

Strange's own power is often amplified by the numerous magical artifacts that are in his possession or by artifacts that he uses in the course of his adventures. The two artifacts he carries with him at all times are the Eye of Agamotto and the Cloak of Levitation. 

*The Eye of Agamotto is a powerful and valued artifact that has many functions. Using the Eye, Strange can see through any lie, deception or illusion and free others from their own illusions.  It is often used to amplify his mind's eye giving psychic abilities that rival the most powerful of telepaths. It is also often used to play back an area's past events and open dimensional portals.  Evil can hardly withstand its light and it is often used as a weapon of last resort.

*The Cloak of Levitation allows him to fly without using any magic. It responds to his thoughts as if it were part of him. Dr. Strange has used it many times as a "third set of hands" to attack a foe when his own body has been incapacitated. The cloak is nearly indestructable. It often escapes damage even during the most violent confrontations. 

Other artifacts include the Amulet of Agamotto which functions much like the Eye, the Orb of Agamotto, which he uses daily to monitor the surrounding dimensions for trouble, the Wind of Watoomb, which amplifies his power, and the Book of Vishanti, which contains some of the multiverse's most powerful and secret spells and counter spells.  There are countless other artifacts that he owns that can be brought out in times of need.

Note that some other (non-human) sorcerers, such as Dr. Strange's former apprentice/wife [[Clea]], have an additional source of power.  Clea naturally generates mystical energy, which she can then use (or, it is assumed, 'lend' to supplicants calling on her).  When the Vishanti asked him to fight as a soldier in the War of the Seven Spheres, and refused to allow him to call upon them when he declined, Dr. Strange briefly tapped into this type of energy by immersing himself within the Earth's mystical Gaian aura.  However, this energy source was exhausted in his service to the Vishanti during his service in their five thousand year war. His refusal prior to the deal resulted in the Vishanti abandoning him in his role as the Sorcerer Supreme. After doing without the Vishanti's help in protecting Earth, he finally acceded to their demands that he fight for them, but only if they promised to return him to the place in time when he entered their service, and not 5000 years hense at the conclusion of the battle. 

For a brief period, research from the Vishanti library led Dr. Strange to tap into catastrophe magic by invoking a [[syzygy]] of all the planets, but this source of magic was limited and he ceased using it specifically as a source of his power.  

The mansion where Dr. Strange lives, his Sanctum Sanctorum, is located at 177A Bleecker Street, [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], [[New York]], which was the actual address of the apartment building in which the writer of the series lived at the time the story was published. The mansion is almost a magical entity unto itself now that Dr. Strange has embued it with all sorts of spells mostly protective, but some can be pro-active. It has been used as a way to attack Dr. Strange several times, by Umar most notably. 

Doctor Strange's magic has shown the ability to effect even the most powerful of entities, leading many to believe Dr. Strange is Marvel's most powerful Earth-based superhero.

==Doctor Strange as major supporting character==
Dr. Strange is often used as the all-in-one solution to the many world-altering events that occur in other character's comic books. Prominent examples include:

* In ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #188-191, the ancient wizard [[Kulan Gath]] magically transformed NYC into an approximation of his own ancient time. Everyone in the city, save for Strange and a handful of others, forgot who they were and assumed roles appropriate to such a reality. The spell was broken and proper reality was restored by Dr. Strange and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].
*In ''[[Micronauts]]'' #35 Dr. Strange was instumental in helping The Micronauts defeat Anceint Demons from Earth's past. As he kept the Demons at bay Commander Arcturus Rann rushed the Keys to the Enigma Force to the tomb of Prince Wayfinder...the creator of the Microverse. After opening the Tomb, Strange and Rann encountered the Sword in the Star who merged them into a single entity, [[Captain Universe]] in order to save the rapidly deteriorating Space Wall between Earth and The Microverse.
* In ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'', Dr. Strange recruited the heroes to stop [[Thanos]], was one of the few heroes to survive Thanos' decimation of his opposition, and was responsible for rescuing the few survivors in the final battle against Thanos and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. Strange was one of the few people to remember that these events had occurred.
* In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]] #30-33 Dr. Strange brought Vance Astro back to the 26th Century where Charlie-27 was about to be murdered by a Badoon Captain Universe named L'Matto. After a long standing battle which was appearing to be in L'Matto's favor suddenly took a 180 degree turn when Aleta became the New Starhawk and with Dr. Strange's help, defeated The Captain Universe empowered L'Matto and then exercised The Uni-Power from L'Matto's body and returned to the 20th Century with it where they parted ways with Strange going back to it's studies and The Uni-Power heading off to find a new host. 
* In ''[[House of M]]'', Dr. Strange and [[Emma Frost]] prevented the [[Scarlet Witch]] from imposing her will on the entire mutant world. Driven insane by her powers, the Witch turned almost all mutants into ordinary humans. Only a few who were protected by Dr. Strange's spell and Frost's psychic powers were protected and retained their abilities.
