'''Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by artist [[Steve Ditko]] and writer [[Stan Lee]],<ref name="Vulture">{{cite web|url= http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/steve-ditko-doctor-strange-c-v-r.html|title= The Creator of Doctor Strange Will Not See You Now|first=Abraham |last=Reisman|date= November 16, 2016|work= [[New York (magazine)|New York]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6m63dzr1q |archivedate=November 17, 2016 |deadurl= no|quote="Creeping conflict became apparent a few months after Spider-Man’s debut, when Lee first announced the impending debut of their next co-creation, a magician named Doctor Strange."}}</ref> the character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 ([[cover-date]]d July 1963). A former neurosurgeon, Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] of comics, the character has been featured in several comic book series and adapted in a variety of media including video games, an animated television show, and films. Inspired by storytellings of [[black magic]] and ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', Strange was created to bring a different kind of character and themes of [[mysticism]] to Marvel Comics.

Doctor Strange was a brilliant but egotistical surgeon. After a car accident destroys the nerves in his hands and hinders his ability to perform surgery, he searches the globe for a way to repair them and encounters the [[Ancient One]]. After becoming one of the old Sorcerer Supreme's students, he becomes a practitioner of both the mystical arts as well as [[martial arts]]. Along with knowing many powerful spells, he has a costume with two mystical objects—the [[Cloak of Levitation]] and [[Eye of Agamotto]]—which give him added powers. Strange is aided along the way by his friend and valet, [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], and a large assortment of mystical objects. He takes up residence in a mansion called the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], located in New York City. Later, Strange takes the title of Sorcerer Supreme.

In 2008, Doctor Strange was ranked 83rd in ''[[Wizard Magazine|Wizard]]''{{'}}s "200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time" list,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.razorfine.com/index.php/comments/wizards_200_greatest_comic_characters_of_all_time/ |title=''Wizard's'' 200 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time |publisher=Razorfine.com |accessdate=May 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530220714/http://www.razorfine.com/index.php/comments/wizards_200_greatest_comic_characters_of_all_time/ |archivedate=May 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> and in 2012 was ranked 33rd in [[IGN]]'s list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/33 |publisher=[[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150317063439/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/33|archivedate= March 17, 2015|deadurl= no |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> He was also ranked 34th on IGN's list of "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes".{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The character was first portrayed in live-action by [[Peter Hooten]] in the 1978 television film ''[[Dr. Strange (film)|Dr. Strange]]''.

==Publication history==
<!-- in-universe plot information needs moving into the Fictography section -->

===Creation===
Artist [[Steve Ditko]] and writer [[Stan Lee]] have described the character as having been originally the idea of Ditko, who wrote in 2008, "On my own, I brought in to Lee a five-page, penciled story with a page/panel script of my idea of a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics. My character wound up being named Dr. Strange because he would appear in ''[[Strange Tales]]''."<ref>{{cite comic| story = "Toyland": "Martin Goodman/Stan Lee"| title= The Avenging Mind| publisher= Robin Snyder and Steve Ditko| date=April 2008| writer= Ditko, Steve|authorlink=Steve Ditko}}</ref> In a 1963 letter to [[Jerry Bails]], Lee called the character Ditko's idea, saying,

{{quote|Well, we have a new character in the works for Strange Tales (just a 5-page filler named Dr. Strange) Steve Ditko is gonna draw him. It has sort of a black magic theme. The first story is nothing great, but perhaps we can make something of him-- 'twas Steve's idea and I figured we'd give it a chance, although again, we had to rush the first one too much. Little sidelight: Originally decided to call him Mr. Strange, but thought the "Mr." bit too similar to [[Mr. Fantastic]] -- now, however, I remember we had a villain called Dr. Strange just recently in one of our mags, hope it won't be too confusing!<ref>Stan Lee letter to Jerry Bails, January 9, 1963 (first paragraph of P.S.), published in ''[[The Comic Reader]]'' (16) February 23, 1963.

===Early years===
''Doctor Strange'' debuted in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963),<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Tom |editor1-last=Brevoort |editor2-first=Tom |editor2-last=DeFalco |editor3-first=Matthew |editor3-last=Manning|title=Marvel Chronicle: A Year by Year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUlGLQAACAAJ|year=2008|location= London, United Kingdom|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=978-0-7566-4123-8 |ref=harv}} DeFalco in "1960s" {{harvnb|Brevoort|DeFalco|Manning|2008|p=93}}{{quote|"When Dr. Strange first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #110, it was only clear that he dabbled in black magic and had the ability to project his consciousness into an astral form that could leave his physical body."}}</ref> a split book shared with the feature "[[Human Torch (comics)|The Human Torch]]". Doctor Strange appeared in issues #110–111 and #114 before the character's eight-page [[origin story]] in #115 (Dec. 1963). Scripter Lee's take on the character was inspired by the ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'' radio program that aired on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Comics historian Mike Benton wrote,

{{quote|The ''Dr. Strange'' stories of the 1960s constructed a cohesive [[cosmology]] that would have thrilled any self-respecting [[theosophy|theosophist]]. College students, minds freshly opened by [[psychedelic experience]]s and [[Eastern mysticism]], read Ditko and Lee's ''Dr. Strange'' stories with the belief of a recent [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] convert. Meaning was everywhere, and readers analyzed the ''Dr. Strange'' stories for their relationship to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] myths, [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian gods]], and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Benton|title=Superhero Comics of the Silver Age: The Illustrated History |publisher=[[Taylor Publishing Company]]|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=978-0-87833-746-0|year=1991|page =63}}</ref>}}

"People who read ''Doctor Strange'' thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e., drug users]," recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer [[Roy Thomas]] in 1971, "because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do."<ref>{{Cite magazine|authorlink=Robin Green (producer)|last=Green |first= Robin| url=http://www.reocities.com/area51/Chamber/8346/rs91.facefront.1.html |title=Face Front!

Wright: "Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth counterculture's fascination with Eastern mysticism and psychedelia."<ref name="Wright213">{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Bradford|title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America|date=September 18, 2003|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=978-0801874505|page=213}}<!--|accessdate=9 April 2015--></ref>

As co-plotter and later sole plotter in the ''[[Marvel Method]]'', Ditko took Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In a 17-issue story arc in ''Strange Tales'' #130-146 (March 1965-July 1966), Ditko introduced the cosmic character [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette filled with the cosmos.<ref name=st134>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/|title=''Strange Tales'' #134|publisher= [[Grand Comics Database]]}} "Indexer notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (Nov. 1965)."</ref> As historian Bradford W. Wright described,

{{quote|Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. ''Dr. Strange'''s adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled [[Salvador Dalí]] paintings. Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lee's childhood as well as by contemporary [[Beat Generation|Beat]] culture, ''Dr. Strange'' remarkably predicted the youth counterculture's fascination with Eastern mysticism and [[psychedelia]]. Never among Marvel's more popular or accessible characters, ''Dr. Strange'' still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare.<ref name="Wright213" />}}

[[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] artist/writer [[Bill Everett]] succeeded Ditko as artist with issues #147-152, followed by [[Marie Severin]] through #160 and [[Dan Adkins]] through #168, the final issue before the ''Nick Fury'' feature moved to its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name="DeFalco128">DeFalco in {{harvnb|Brevoort|DeFalco|Manning|2008|p= 128}} {{quote|"Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles…''Strange Tales'' #168 [was followed] by ''Dr. Strange'' #169."}}</ref> Expanded to 20 pages per issue, the ''Doctor Strange'' solo series ran 15 issues, #169-183 (June 1968-Nov. 1969), continuing the numbering of ''Strange Tales''.<ref name="DeFalco128" /><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 1863|title= Doctor Strange}}</ref> Thomas wrote the run of new stories, joined after the first three issues by the art team of [[penciler]] [[Gene Colan]] and [[inker]] [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] through the end. Colan drastically altered the look of the series, as Thomas recounted: "…he had his own view of what these other worlds should look like. Everyone else sort of copied Ditko's versions of those extra dimensions, which were great and wonderful. When Gene came on, he didn't feel a real rapport with that, I guess, so his extra dimensions tended to be just blackness and smoke and things of that sort… Sometimes it was a little strange for a dimension Doc Strange had been to before to look different when drawn by Gene, but nobody complained."<ref>{{cite book |last=Field|first=Tom|title= Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan|year=2005|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|isbn= 978-1893905450|pages= 79–80}}</ref> Thomas recalled in 2000 that he returned to work a day late from a weekend [[comic book convention]] to find that Marvel production manager [[Sol Brodsky]] had assigned ''Doctor Strange'' to writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], newly ensconced at Marvel and writing ''[[Iron Man]]''. Thomas convinced Brodsky to allow him to continue writing the title. "I got very possessive about ''Doctor Strange''," Thomas recalled. "It wasn't a huge seller, but [by the time it was canceled] we were selling the low 40 percent range of more than 400,000 print run, so it was actually selling a couple hundred thousand copies [but] at the time you needed to sell even more."<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Thomas (interviewer)|title=So You Want a Job, Eh?

[[Stan Lee]], seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but ''a'' god, to avoid offending religious readers. The writer and artist concocted a fake [[comic book letter column|letter]] from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to Marvel from Texas.

===1980s===
Strange met his allies [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] in #75 (Feb. 1986) and [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]] in #80 (Dec. 1986). The series ended with a cliffhanger as his home, the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses was Doctor Strange's entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker and several spells designed to protect humanity from [[vampire]]s and the evil serpent god Set expired.

The title was discontinued so that the character's adventures could be transferred to another split book format series. ''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1-19 (April 1987-October 1988) was shared with street heroes [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. This new Doctor Strange series resolved Strange's quest to reclaim his power and missing artifacts, as well as resurrecting the Defenders, who had died in the last issue of that team's title.

===1990s===
Strange was returned to his own series, this time titled ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'', which ran 90 issues (November 1988-June 1996).<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3645|title= Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme}}</ref> The initial creative team was writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] and [[Randy Emberlin]], with storylines often spanning multiple issues. Strange lost the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" in issues #48-49 (December 1992-January 1993) when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the [[Vishanti]], the mystical entities that empower his spells.

Strange regained his title in ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80 (Aug. 1995).

Strange appeared with the Human Torch and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''Strange Tales'' vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1994).<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 12125|title= Strange Tales ''one-shot'}}</ref>

The character was featured in several [[limited series]]. The first was ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones'' #1-#4 (February–May 1999), with a series of [[spontaneous combustion]]s by criminals instigated by old foe Dormammu. Strange was the [[catalyst]] for the creation of a trio of sorceresses in ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' #1-#4 (August–November 2004). The ''Strange'' limited series (November 2004-July 2005) by writers [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]] updated the character's origin.<ref>Manning "2000s" {{harvnb|Brevoort|DeFalco|Manning|2008|p=323}} {{quote|"Scribes J.

Doctor Strange appeared in four [[graphic novels]] over the years: ''Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa'' (1986); ''Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989); ''Spider-Man/Dr. Strange: The Way to Dusty Death'' (1992); and ''Dr. Strange: What Is It That Disturbs You, Stephen?''

===2000s===
Strange appeared as a supporting character for the bulk of the 2000s. He appeared regularly in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' under [[J. Michael Straczynski]], before being cast into a time loop by [[Baron Mordo]]. He later appeared on and off in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'', where he was stated as being part of the secret group known as the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] to deal with future threats to Earth. Ultimately Strange joined the team and allowed them to use his home as a base after the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', which he sat out. Doctor Strange was critical of the federal [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and aided the anti-registration Avengers team led by Luke Cage.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Leinil Francis Yu|Yu, Leinil Francis]]|inker= Yu, Leinil Francis|story= Revolution Part One|title= [[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]|issue= 27|date= April 2007}}</ref>

During the Bendis run, Doctor Doom attacked the Avengers and manipulated the Scarlet Witch into decimating the mutant population; Doctor Strange's failure to stop the latter and his failure to realize Doom's hand in the former caused him to start to doubt his abilities.{{issue|date=June 2015}} After he was forced to use dark magic to confront an enraged Hulk,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Greg Pak|Pak, Greg]]|penciller= [[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]]|inker= [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]]|title= [[World War Hulk]]|issue= 3|date= October 2007}}</ref> followed by further use of dark spells to save the New Avengers from the Hood's supervillain army,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker= [[Jeff Huet|Huet, Jeff]]|title= [[New Avengers Annual]]|issue= 2|date= 2008}}</ref> Strange renounced his status as Sorcerer Supreme, as he felt that he was no longer worthy of it.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Incomplete|section|date=June 2015}}
Dr. Stephen Strange is an egotistical doctor who only cares about wealth from his career. After a car accident shatters the bones in his hands, the damage prevents him from being able to conduct surgery when his hands begin to tremble uncontrollably. Too proud to take on a teaching job, Strange desperately searches for a way to restore his hands.

After he exhausts his funds, he becomes a derelict. Depressed and still searching, Strange, while walking near the docks, overhears two sailors talking about a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] (who is actually the Earth's Sorcerer Supreme) in the [[Himalayas]], who can cure any ailment. Strange uses the last of his funds to travel to the Himalayas to seek out the aged mystic. The Ancient One refuses to help Strange because of his selfishness, but senses a good side that he attempts to bring to the surface. He fails, but Strange's goodness appears when he discovers the Ancient One's disciple, [[Baron Mordo]], attempting to kill the old man. After a confrontation with Mordo leads to his being shackled with restraining spells preventing him from either attacking Mordo or warning the Ancient One, Strange desperately and selflessly accepts the Ancient One's offer to become his apprentice to have some hope of helping the old man. The Ancient One, pleased at Strange's profound change of heart, accepts the westerner and promptly frees him from the restraining spells while explaining he was aware of Mordo's treachery all along. Strange soon becomes Mordo's most enduring [[antagonist|enemy]],<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in {{harvnb|Brevoort|DeFalco|Manning|2008|p=93}} {{quote|"Dr. Strange's archenemy, Baron Mordo, was introduced in ''Strange Tales'' #111.}}</ref> as the Ancient One teaches the doctor the mystic arts.<ref name="ST115">{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= The Origin of Dr. Strange|title= [[Strange Tales]]|issue= 115|date= December 1963}}</ref> After completing his training, Strange returns to New York and takes up residence within the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], a townhouse located in Greenwich Village, and is soon assisted by his personal servant [[Wong (comics)|Wong]].<ref name="tales110" />

===''Book of the Vishanti''===
{{Multiple issues|section=y|
{{Overly detailed|section=y|date=November 2016}}
{{In-universe|section|date=November 2016}}
}}
The ''Book of the Vishanti'' is written by unknown authors and is closely associated with Doctor Strange. It is the greatest known source of [[Good and evil|white]] [[Magic in fiction|magical]] knowledge on Earth.
The ''Book of the Vishanti'' contains spells of defensive magic and is indestructible. Its counterpart, the [[Darkhold]], contains all the knowledge of [[black magic]] in the Marvel Universe, and is likewise indestructible. It is possible to destroy single pages of either book, but the balancing spell in the other book is destroyed as well to maintain a mystical balance. A collective of the three powerful magical beings Agamotto, Oshtur and Hoggoth, known as the Vishanti, must allow the spell to be destroyed.

Even though the book is a tome of benevolent magic, the spells within can still be dangerous when used improperly. This is proven when a young, inexperienced Strange tried to use the Book to resurrect his dead brother Victor, but the spell, known as the Vampiric Verses, caused Victor to become the [[vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] [[Baron Blood (comics)#Baron Blood II|Baron Blood]] years later.

Apart from spells and mystical knowledge, the book also contains information about persons and events. It is unknown how the Book is able to contain up to date and recent information even though it was written thousands of years ago.

The first known owner of the book was the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] sorcerer [[Varnae]] from around 18,500 BC. The next known owner was the Babylonian god [[Marduk Kurios]]. Marduk set a [[griffin]] to guard the Book. The sorcerer known as the [[Ancient One]] traveled back in time to c. 4000 BC and defeated the griffin and returned to the 20th century. The Ancient One would remain the book's owner, despite a brief loss when the dark wizard [[Kaluu]] returned the Book to the Griffin, until he deemed his student, Doctor Strange, worthy of taking it.

Doctor Strange keeps the book in his town house library in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. He briefly lost the book when he destroyed his home to prevent the alien wizard [[Urthona (comics)|Urthona]] from taking his magical artifacts, but the book was saved by Agamotto, who transported it to his realm and returned it to Strange some time later.

===Orb of Agamotto===
{{Multiple issues|section=y|
{{In-universe|section|date=July 2016}}
{{Overly detailed|section=y|date=October 2016}}
}}
The Orb of Agamotto is a fictional magical item in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. It is a powerful [[scrying]] crystal ball owned and used by Doctor Strange. It can also be used to detect magic in use anywhere in the world and provide Strange with a location and visual. The orb rests in Doctor Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] in a room called the Chamber of Shadows. It usually is inside a display case with three curved legs. When summoned, the glass covering rises and the ball levitates. While powerful, the Orb has been blocked by exceptionally powerful mystic forces (such as [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]]) who do not want their exact location known. On at least one occasion, it has been used to open a dimensional portal to the realm of [[Agamotto]].

==Other versions==
{{Main article|Alternative versions of Doctor Strange}}
The character has starred in several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] titles. In the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' #1-#8 (November 2003-June 2004), Sir Stephen Strange is both the court [[physician]] and [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The title ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' introduced a female version of Strange who shares her body with a [[demon]] in issue #33 (1995). The miniseries ''[[Strange (comic book)|Strange]]'' #1-#6 (November 2004-April 2005), written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]], with artwork by [[Brandon Peterson]], reimagined the character's origin, allies and enemies in a contemporary setting.

In the miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' #1-#5 (February–June 2006), Strange is infected with a [[zombie]] virus along with many other heroes. He reappears in the second sequel, ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #1-#4 (December 2008-March 2009)

In the alternate future universe of the Marvel [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Doctor Strange is no longer the Sorcerer Supreme, the title there held by Doc Magnus. Doctor Strange uses his remaining power to reform the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in ''A-Next'' #3 (1998) and to fight the Norse god of mischief, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], ''Last Hero Standing'' #4 (February 2005).

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] title ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' introduced a version of the character called "Stephen Strange, Jr.", the son of the original Doctor Strange, in ''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #12 (July 2002). The character was killed in battle by the Ultimate Marvel version of Dormammu in the miniseries ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' #1-#5 (January–September 2009).

Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R. Berns"), and [[Jack Kirby]] (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] with the same [[surname]] (called "Carl Strange"). Making his sole appearance in the [[Iron Man]] story "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #41 (1963), the character gained mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drstrng2.htm |title=Doctor Strange |first=Jeff |last=Christiansen |date=May 11, 2002 |publisher=The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EpuPbmOL?url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drstrng2.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 3, 2013 |df= }}</ref>
