'''Doctor Strange''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in publications published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was co-created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] and first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963). 

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character has featured in several self-titled series and Marvel-endorsed products including arcade and [[video game]]s; [[animated]] [[television series]]; a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film; and merchandise such as [[trading cards]]. 

==Publication history==<!--in-universe info from here needs moving into the Fictional biography section-->

===1960s===
The character debuted in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963), a "split book" shared with fellow Marvel character the [[Human Torch (comics)|Human Torch]] until issue #134 (July 1965), and then super spy [[Nick Fury]] until issue #168 (May 1968). Strange appeared in #111 and #114 before the character's eight page [[origin story]] appeared in #115 (Dec. 1963). 

Ditko drew the feature through ''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966), and during this period he and Lee introduced many of Strange's  allies, such as his eventual lover [[Clea]], who debuted, (although was not initially named) in ''Strange Tales'' #126 (Nov. 1964) and enemies such as [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], in #110, and the flame-headed [[Dormammu]], in #126 (Nov. 1964). "Doctor Strange" stories showcased [[surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly head-trippy visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. "People who read 'Doctor Strange' thought people at Marvel must be heads [e.g. drug users]", recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer [[Roy Thomas]] in 1971, "because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But ... I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do."<ref>[[Robin Green|Green, Robin]]. "Face Front! Clap Your Hands, You're on the Winning Team!", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' #91, September 16, 1971, p. 31</ref>

Eventually, as co-plotter and later sole plotter, in the "[[Marvel Method]]", Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in ''Strange Tales'' #130 - 146 (July 1965 - July 1966), Ditko introduced the cosmic character [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos.<ref name=st134>[http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/ ''Strange Tales'' #134] at the Grand Comics Database: "Indexer Notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (November 1965)".</ref> As historian Bradford W. Wright describes,
{{bquote|Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. Dr. Strange's adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled [[Salvador Dali]] paintings.  ... Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lee's childhood as well as by contemporary [[Beat Generation|Beat]] culture. Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth counterculture's fascination with Eastern mysticism and [[psychedelia]]. Never among Marvel's more popular or accessible characters, Dr. Strange still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare.<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation: Transformation of a Youth Culture'', Johns Hopkins, 2001. ISBN 0-8018-7450-5. p. 213</ref>}}

From the beginning, stories revealed that Dr. Strange used magical artifacts to augment his power, such as the [[Cloak of Levitation]],<ref>The blue "novice" version first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963) with the red "master" version first appearing in ''Strange Tales'' #127 (Dec. 1964)</ref> the [[Eye of Agamotto]],<ref name="tales115">''Strange Tales'' #115 (Dec. 1963)</ref> the [[Book of the Vishanti]],<ref>''Strange Tales'' #116 (Jan. 1964)</ref> and the [[Orb of Agamotto]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #118 (March 1964)</ref> From the first story, Strange's residence, the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], was a part of the character's mythos. The trademark circular window divided by three sweeping lines on the front of the residence (actually the protective Seal of the Vishanti){{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} appeared in many Doctor Strange stories. Strange's personal servant, [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], guarded the residence in his absence.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #147 (Aug. 1966)</ref>

In keeping with Lee's emphasis on continuity, Strange was also quickly established as part of the Marvel Universe, and guest starred in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #27 (June 1964), encountered the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], foster brother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], in ''Strange Tales'' #123 (Aug. 1964), and guest-starred with Ditko's other major Marvel co-creation in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man Annual]]'' #2 (1965).

The series continued with Lee dialoging Ditko's plots through ''Strange Tales'' #142, followed by  [[Roy Thomas]] (two issues) and [[Denny O'Neil]] (two issues). Ditko's last issue was ''Strange Tales'' #146, with [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] artist/writer [[Bill Everett]] succeeding Ditko as artist until #152, followed by [[Marie Severin]] through #160 and [[Dan Adkins]] through #168,<ref>With layouts by [[George Tuska]] on #166 (March 1968)</ref> the final issue before the "Nick Fury" feature moved to its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange''. 

Lee returned to write the character in ''Strange Tales'' #151 - 157; followed by Thomas (#158 - 159), and two writers who did virtually no other Marvel work, [[Raymond Marais]] (#160 - 161) and [[Jim Lawrence (comics)|Jim Lawrence]] (#162 - 166). The post-Ditko ''Strange Tales'' stories introduced another cosmic entity, the [[Living Tribunal]], in #157 (June 1967) and the evil [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], sister of Dormammu, in #150 (Nov. 1966) The title, however, was flagging, with Strange encountering such one-off foes such as Nebulos and Voltorg in ''Strange Tales'' #162 and #166, respectively.<!--writer and artist info for issues 167 and 168 need including-->

The now 20-page ''Doctor Strange'' solo series ran 15 issues, #169 - 183 (June 1968 -  Nov. 1969), continuing the numbering of ''Strange Tales''. Thomas wrote the run of new stories (''Strange Tales'' #179 being a reprint), joined after the first three issues by the art team of [[penciler]] [[Gene Colan]] and [[inker]] [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] through the end. Thomas and Colan attempted to boost sales by revamping Strange and making the character closer to being a superhero. Given a form-fitting blue costume, a full-head mask and a [[secret identity]] as '''Dr. Stephen Sanders''', the character teamed with the superheroes the [[Black Knight (Marvel Comics)|Black Knight]]<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #178 (March 1969)</ref> and [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #179 (April 1969)</ref> and battled the [[X-Men]] foe the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #182 (Sept. 1969)</ref> The changes were unsuccessful and the title was canceled with issue #183 (Nov. 1969). The cancellation was abrupt (there was a "Next Issue" blurb in the last issue), and outstanding storylines were resolved in ''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' #22 (Feb. 1970) and ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #126 (April 1970).

Thomas recalled in 2000 that he eloped in July 1968 to marry his first wife, Jean, and returned to work a day late from a weekend [[fan convention|comic book convention]] to find that Marvel production manager [[Sol Brodsky]] had assigned ''Doctor Strange'' to writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], newly ensconced at Marvel and writing ''[[Iron Man]]''. Thomas convinced Brodsky to allow him to continue writing the title. "I got very possessive about ''Doctor Strange''," Thomas recalled. "It wasn't a huge seller, but [by the time it was canceled] we were selling the low 40 percent range of more than 400,000 print run, so it was actually selling a couple hundred thousand copies [but] at the time you needed to sell even more."<ref>Thomas (interviewer) in "So You Want a Job, Eh? The Gene Colan Interview", ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' vol. 3, #6 (Autumn 2000) pp. 13 - 14</ref>

===1970s===
Strange next appeared in the first three issues of the showcase title ''[[Marvel Feature]]'', appearing in both the main storyline detailing the formation of superhero "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and the related back-up story.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1971, March 1972, & June 1972)</ref> The character was showcased in the title ''Marvel Premiere'',<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #3 - 14 (July 1972 - March 1974)</ref> with one story-arc marking the debut of another of Strange's recurring foes, the entity [[Shuma-Gorath]]. To stop Shuma-Gorath entering reality, Strange was forced to shut down the Ancient One's mind, which caused his physical death. The Ancient One, however, assured Strange this was a necessary sacrifice and his soul merged with the cosmic entity Eternity. Strange then assumed the title of [[Sorcerer Supreme]].<ref name="MP">''Marvel Premiere'' #8 - 10 (May, July & Sept. 1973)</ref>

===1980s - 1990s===
The character's adventures continued in a second ongoing series, ''Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts'', which ran for 81 issues (June 1974 - Feb. 1987). During this period Strange also met allies [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]]<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #75-81 (Feb. 1986 - Feb. 1987; bi-monthly)</ref> and [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #80 (Dec. 1986)</ref> Following the title's cancellation, the character's adventures continued in a second volume of ''Strange Tales'', which was again published in the "split book" format, and shared with street heroes ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]''. The title ran for nineteen issues.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1-19 (April 1987 - Oct. 1988)</ref>

Strange then appeared in another self-titled series; ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme''. The initial creative team was writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] & [[Randy Emberlin]], with storylines often written as multi-issue arcs. Strange was written as being on the defensive from the first issue, battling a host of [[supernatural]] foes including Dormammu,<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #1-2 (Nov. 1988 & Jan. 1989)</ref> demons [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]],<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #5-8 (July-Oct. 1989)</ref> and encounters with the [[Werewolf By Night]],<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #26-27 (Feb.-March 1991)</ref> [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]],<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #28 (April 1991)</ref> [[Baron Blood]],<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #29 - 30 (May–June 1991)</ref> and [[Morbius the Living Vampire]].<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #52 (April 1993)</ref>

Strange temporarily lost the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the [[Vishanti]], the mystical entities that empower Strange's spells.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #48-49 (Dec. 1992 - Jan. 1993)</ref> Despite this and other setbacks, Strange was triumphant and eventually regained the title many issues later.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80 (Aug. 1995)</ref> The series ran for 90 issues (Nov. 1988 - June 1996). 

Strange appeared — together with original regulars the Human Torch and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] — in the one-shot publication called ''Strange Tales'' vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1994).</ref>

The character was also featured in several [[limited series]], the first being ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones'', with a series of [[spontaneous combustion]]s by criminals instigated by old foe Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange:  The Flight of the Bones'' #1-4 (Feb.-May 1999)</ref> Strange was the [[catalyst]] for the creation of a trio of witches in the self-titled ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' mini-series<ref>''Witches'' #1-4 (Aug. - Nov. 2004)</ref> and also appeared in the self-titled ''[[Strange (comic book)|Strange]]'' mini-series, written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]], with artwork by [[Brandon Peterson]]. The series reimagined the character's origin, allies and enemies in a contemporary setting.<ref>''Strange'' #1-6 (Nov. 2004 - April 2005)</ref> A third limited series, ''Doctor Strange: The Oath'', written by [[Brian K Vaughan]] and illustrated by [[Marcos Martin]], focused on Strange's duty as Sorcerer Supreme and the nature of his powers.<ref>''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' #1-5 (Dec. 2006 - April 2007)</ref>

Doctor Strange has also appeared in four [[graphic novels]] over the years.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa'' (1986); ''Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989); ''Spider-Man / Dr. Strange: The Way To Dusty Death'' (1992) and ''Dr. Strange: What is It that Disturbs You, Stephen?'' (Oct. 1997)</ref> 
 
The character has remained a constant in the Marvel Universe over the decades, appearing on a regular basis in three volumes of the title ''Defenders'',<ref>''Defenders'' #1-152 (Aug. 1972 - Feb. 1986); ''Defenders'' vol. 2, #1-12 (March 2001 - Feb. 2002), and  ''Defenders'' vol. 3, #1-5 (Sept. 2005 - Jan. 2006)</ref> ''[[Secret Defenders]]'',<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #1-25 (March 1993 - March 1995)</ref> and a limited series focused on the Defenders titled ''The Order''.<ref>''The Order'' #1-6 (April-Sept. 2002)</ref> Strange appeared in several stories of the superhero "team-up" titled aptly named ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #21 (May 1974); #35 (July 1975); #50 (Oct. 1976); #76 (Dec. 1978); #80-81 (April–May 1979); ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2, #8-9 (April–May 1998) & ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3, #3 (Feb. 2005) & #11-13 (Oct.-Nov. 2005)</ref> and other one-off stories in the titles ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'',<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #6 (Nov. 1974) & #49 (March 1979)</ref> ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'',<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #5-6 (Nov. 1982 &  Jan. 1983); #8 (May 1983); #21 (July 1985); #41 (Dec. 1988); #49 (Feb. 1990)</ref> and the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''.<ref>''What If?'' #18 (Dec. 1979) & #40 (Aug. 1983)</ref> He also appeared, either in person or behind the scenes, with the titular trio of vampire slayers in ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1-19 (Nov. 1992 - April 1994)</ref>

===2000s===
Strange appears as a supporting character in pivotal stories in 2000s. In ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #7 (July 2005), writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] [[retconned]] Marvel history and established that during the [[Kree-Skrull War]],<ref>''Avengers'' #88 - 97 (June 1971 - March 1972)</ref> several metahumans, including Strange, formed a secret council called the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] to deal with future threats to Earth.

Strange played a pivotal role at the conclusion of the ''[[House of M]]'' [[miniseries]], as courtesy of his magic several of the mutant [[X-Men]] were able to retain their powers when reality was rewritten.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 6 (Aug. 2005 - Jan. 2006)</ref> The "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline — involving the introduction of the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] and a split in the superhero community — found Strange opposed to mandatory registration. He leaves the Illuminati and goes into seclusion in the [[Arctic]] until the issue is resolved.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 – 7 (July 2006 – Jan. 2007)</ref>

The ''[[New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' [[miniseries]] revealed that Strange and the Illuminati took proactive steps to avoid global threats by finding and isolating the [[Infinity Gems]], with Strange taking possession of the [[Soul Gem]] (a condition being that the individuals hide the Gems and never reveal their location to other members).<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #1 - 5 (Feb. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref> When Strange returns from the Arctic he secretly shelters the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], formed after the events of the ''Civil War'', in his residence and assists on several missions.<ref>''New Avengers'' #27 (April 2007)</ref> Strange suffered a setback when his hands were broken during the events of the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, and he resorted to the use of [[Black magic|dark magic]] to try to stop the Hulk, although he is captured by him.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1 - 5 (Aug. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref>

Strange's use of dark magic became addictive, as he used it again to repel an attack on his residence by the crime syndicate of the villain [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] (who was in turn backed by Strange's foe Dormammu).<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (Jan. 2008)</ref> After some reflection, Strange sought out a successor Sorcerer Supreme, and considered several magic-users such as [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]], the [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], and [[Doctor Doom]], while Dormammu attacked Earth in a bid to seize Strange's power. The Avengers aided Strange against Dormammu's minions, while the Eye of Agamotto chose [[Brother Voodoo]] as Strange's successor.<ref>''New Avengers'' #51 - 54 (March - Aug. 2009)</ref>

===2010s===
When Doctor Strange and [[Daimon Hellstrom]] are possessed by an unspecified demonic entity, they attempt to claim the Eye from Doctor Voodoo, causing it to teleport to [[Avengers Mansion]]. [[Luke Cage]] touches the object and mutates in a monstrous version of himself,<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1</ref> the entity that has possessed him subsequently 'jumping' into [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], who then teleports away with the Eye, triggering a rift in the sky that Strange states means the end of everything.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #2</ref> As the Avengers battle the demons back on Earth, Iron Fist finds himself in a white void where he encounters the Ancient One, who claims that he is responsible for the current invasion due to his anger at Strange's recent 'failures'.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #3</ref> When Iron Fist returns to Earth- now dressed in a new costume-, he claims that the Ancient One has told him that Strange stole the Eye from the Ancient One rather than being given it by his master, challenging Strange to admit the truth.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #4</ref> Noting that such a claim contradicts everything the Ancient One taught him about the Eye, Strange realises that the entity they are facing is not his master, with a casual comment by [[Spider-Man]] prompting the sorcerors to realise that the enemy they face is Agamotto himself, trying to reclaim his Eye after the apparent 'death' of the Vishanti.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #5</ref> Although the group attempt to defeat Agamotto by empowering Wolverine to serve as their 'avatar', Doctor Voodoo is finally forced to sacrifice himself to contain their foe, apparently destroying himself and the Eye at the same time.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #6</ref>

In the aftermath of this, feeling guilty over his perceived failures, Strange decides to part company with the team, but they refuse to let him leave and unanimously vote that he should remain a New Avenger. To that end, Strange summons Wong to Avengers Mansion to act as their new housekeeper.<ref>''New Avengers'' #7</ref>

During the Chaos War, Strange contacts the Hulk and his allies to warn them that Hell is coming to Earth, Hell's 'champion' being the recently-deceased [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] as the strongest soul in Hell, searching for [[Marlo Chandler]] as her previous experience with the now-banished Death means that she still contains a small fragment of Death; if the Abomination finds her, that fragment can be used to kill everyone currently merely immobilised in the burning New York. However, before the Hulks can begin searching for Marlo, Strange is re-possessed by Zom.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #618</ref>

Depressed and scouring the world for a cure to his condition, Strange locates a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] in the [[Himalayas]].

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Strange is a master magician, and was the holder of the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" of the cosmos for many years.<ref name="MP"/> Eternity, the sentience of the [[Marvel Universe]], has described Strange as "more powerful by far than any of your fellow humanoids",<ref name="MF41">[http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/9599/drstrange042wm1.jpg ''Marvel Fanfare'' #41 (Feb. 1989)]</ref> narration has described him as "the mightiest magician in the cosmos",<ref name="img204.imageshack.us">http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/4320/mightsu2.jpg</ref> and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] considers him on a level with [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]].<ref>''Beyond!'' #6, (Dec. 2006)</ref>

Doctor Strange can use magic to achieve virtually any effect he desires, such as [[telepathy]],<ref name="tales110"/> [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Energy manipulation|energy blasts]],<ref name="tales126"/> [[teleportation]],<ref>''Strange Tales'' #162 (Dec. 1967)</ref> [[astral projection]];<ref name="tales110"/> the creation of materials (such as food<ref>''Defenders'' #18 (Dec. 1974)</ref> and water<ref>''Defenders'' #6 (June 1973)</ref>), creating planet-wide [[Force field|protective shields]],<ref>''Defenders'' #8 (Sep. 1973)</ref> restoring himself from bodily destruction,<ref>http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/5042/amazingspidermanv205813hk4.jpg</ref> or resurrecting the dead.<ref>http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/4939/witches0120nk8.jpg</ref> 

When casting a spell, the character is often written to be invoking the name of a mystical entity, such as one of the [[Vishanti]] ([[Hoggoth]], [[Oshtur]] and [[Agamotto]]) or the group the [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|Octessence]]. These entities usually lend their power to a particular effect, such as the Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak]], that Strange can use to entrap foes.<ref>''Defenders'' #15 (Sep. 1974)</ref>

Strange was also schooled in the use of dark magic by one-time foe [[Kaluu]], using it to temporarily destroy the entity [[Shuma-Gorath]]. The use of this magic, however, was both addictive and corruptive and Kaluu had to [[purge]] the magic from Strange before it could take full effect.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #8 - 14 (Nov. 1987 - May 1988)</ref>

Since passing the mantle of the Sorcerer Supreme and the Eye of Agamotto to Doctor Voodoo, Strange's magic is not as powerful as it once was. However, he is still a considerably formidable sorcerer regardless.

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternate versions of Doctor Strange}}
Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R.
