'''Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange''', best known under his alias '''Doctor Strange''', is a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A former [[neurosurgeon]], Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] of comics, the character has been featured in several eponymous comics series and licensed derivative media including [[video game]]s, an [[animated]] [[television show]], films, and merchandise such as [[trading cards]] and figurines. A [[Marvel Studios]] live-action film adaptation, starring [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] in the titular role, is set for a 2016 theatrical release.

==Publication history==
<!-- in-universe plot information needs moving into the Fictography section -->

===1960s===
Artist and plotter [[Steve Ditko]] and scriptwriter and editor [[Stan Lee]] have separately described the character, if not the name, as having been created by Ditko, who wrote in 2008, "On my own, I brought in to Lee a five-page, penciled story with a page/panel script of my idea of a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics. My character wound up being named Dr. Strange because he would appear in ''[[Strange Tales]]''."<ref>{{cite comic| story = "Toyland": "Martin Goodman/Stan Lee"| title= The Avenging Mind| publisher= Robin Snyder and Steve Ditko| date=April 2008| writer= Ditko, Steve|authorlink=Steve Ditko}}</ref>

In a 1963 letter to [[Jerry Bails]], Lee called the character Ditko's idea, saying,

{{cquote|Well, we have a new character in the works for Strange Tales (just a 5-page filler named Dr. Strange) Steve Ditko is gonna draw him. It has sort of a black magic theme. The first story is nothing great, but perhaps we can make something of him-- 'twas Steve's idea and I figgered we'd give it a chance, although again, we had to rush the first one too much. Little sidelight: Originally decided to call him Mr. Strange, but thought the "Mr." bit too similar to [[Mr. Fantastic]] -- now, however, I remember we had a villain called Dr. Strange just recently in one of our mags, hope it won't be too confusing!<ref>Stan Lee letter to Jerry Bails, January 9, 1963 (first paragraph of P.S.), published in ''[[The Comic Reader]]'' (16) February 23, 1963.

[[File:Steve Ditko HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|Steve Ditko, creator of ''Doctor Strange'', circa 1945]]
''Dr. Strange'' debuted in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963),<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Tom |editor1-last=Brevoort |editor2-first=Tom |editor2-last=DeFalco |editor3-first=Matthew |editor3-last=Manning|title=Marvel Chronicle: A Year by Year History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WUlGLQAACAAJ|year=2008|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=978-0-7566-4123-8 |ref=harv}} DeFalco in "1960s" {{harvnb|Brevoort|DeFalco|Manning|2008|p=93}}{{quote|"When Dr. Strange first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #110, it was only clear that he dabbled in black magic and had the ability to project his consciousness into an astral form that could leave his physical body."}}</ref> a split book shared with the feature [[Human Torch (comics)|The Human Torch]]. Doctor Strange appeared in issues #110–111 and #114 before the character's eight-page [[origin story]] appeared in #115 (Dec. 1963). Scripter Lee's take on the character was inspired by the ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'' radio program that aired on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]]|year = 1991|page = 114|isbn = 9780810938212|quote= Inspired by the Mutual Network radio show ''Chandu the Magician'', which [Stan] Lee had enjoyed during his childhood, Dr. Strange was in fact a more impressive character than Chandu.}}</ref>

With issue #135 (Aug. 1965), The Human Torch feature was replaced, and Dr. Strange began sharing ''Strange Tales'' with the espionage series ''[[Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. Ditko drew ''Dr. Strange'' through issue #146 (July 1966), and during this period he and Lee introduced many of Strange's allies, such as his eventual lover [[Clea]], who debuted, initially unnamed, in ''Strange Tales'' #126 (Nov. 1964); and enemies, such as the flame-headed [[Dormammu]] in that same issue, and [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in #110.

Ditko's stories showcased [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly vivid visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students at the time. Comics historian Mike Benton wrote,

{{cquote|The ''Dr. Strange'' stories of the 1960s constructed a cohesive [[cosmology]] that would have thrilled any self-respecting [[theosophy|theosophist]]. College students, minds freshly opened by [[psychedelic]] experiences and [[Eastern mysticism]], read Ditko and Lee's ''Dr. Strange'' stories with the belief of a recent [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] convert. Meaning was everywhere, and readers analyzed the ''Dr. Strange'' stories for their relationship to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] myths, [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian gods]], and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Benton|title=Superhero Comics of the Silver Age: The Illustrated History |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|location=Dallas|isbn=978-0-87833-746-0|year=1991|page =63}}</ref>}}

"People who read ''Doctor Strange'' thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e. drug users]," recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer [[Roy Thomas]] in 1971, "because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do."<ref>{{Cite journal|authorlink=Robin Green (producer)|last=Green |first= Robin| url=http://www.reocities.com/area51/Chamber/8346/rs91.facefront.1.html |title=Face Front!

As co-plotter and later sole plotter in the ''[[Marvel Method]]'', Ditko took Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in ''Strange Tales'' #130-146 (March 1965-July 1966), Ditko introduced the cosmic character [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos.<ref name=st134>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/|title=''Strange Tales'' #134|publisher= [[Grand Comics Database]]}} "Indexer notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (Nov. 1965)."</ref> As historian Bradford W. Wright described,

{{cquote|Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. ''Dr. Strange'''s adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled [[Salvador Dalí]] paintings. Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lee's childhood as well as by contemporary [[Beat Generation|Beat]] culture, ''Dr. Strange'' remarkably predicted the youth counterculture's fascination with Eastern mysticism and [[psychedelia]]. Never among Marvel's more popular or accessible characters, ''Dr. Strange'' still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wright|first=Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation: Transformation of a Youth Culture|publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year=2001|isbn=0-8018-7450-5|page=213}}</ref>}}

In keeping with Lee's emphasis on continuity, Strange guest-starred in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #27 (June 1964) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #2 (1965), and encountered the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], foster brother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], in ''Strange Tales'' #123 (Aug. 1964).

The series continued with Lee dialoging Ditko's plots through ''Strange Tales'' #142, followed by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] (two issues each). [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] artist/writer [[Bill Everett]] succeeded Ditko as artist with issues #147-152, followed by [[Marie Severin]] through #160 and [[Dan Adkins]] through #168, the final issue before the ''Nick Fury'' feature moved to its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name="DeFalco128">DeFalco in {{harvnb|Brevoort|DeFalco|Manning|2008|p= 128}} {{quote|"Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles…''Strange Tales'' #168 [was followed] by ''Dr. Strange'' #169."}}</ref>
[[Image:PanelStrangeTales-110.jpg|thumb|left|Splash page for the ''Doctor Strange'' story in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963). Art by [[Steve Ditko]]]]

Lee returned to write episodes in ''Strange Tales'' #151-157; followed by Thomas (#158-159); and two writers who did virtually no other Marvel work, Raymond Marais (#160-161) and Jim Lawrence (#162-#166). Another cosmic entity, the [[Living Tribunal]], was introduced in issue #157 (June 1967) and the evil [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], sister of Dormammu, in #150 (Nov. 1966).

Expanded to 20 pages per issue, the ''Doctor Strange'' solo series ran 15 issues, #169-183 (June 1968-Nov. 1969), continuing the numbering of ''Strange Tales''.<ref name="DeFalco128" /><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 1863|title= ''Doctor Strange''}}</ref> Thomas wrote the run of new stories, joined after the first three issues by the art team of [[penciler]] [[Gene Colan]] and [[inker]] [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] through the end. Colan drastically altered the look of the series, as Thomas recounted: "…he had his own view of what these other worlds should look like. Everyone else sort of copied Ditko's versions of those extra dimensions, which were great and wonderful. When Gene came on, he didn't feel a real rapport with that, I guess, so his extra dimensions tended to be just blackness and smoke and things of that sort… Sometimes it was a little strange for a dimension Doc Strange had been to before to look different when drawn by Gene, but nobody complained."<ref>{{cite book |last=Field|first=Tom|title= Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan|year=2005|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |location=Raleigh, North Carolina|isbn= 978-1893905450|pages= 79-80}}</ref> In #177, Thomas and Colan attempted to boost sales by revamping Strange's appearance to more closely resemble those of other superheroes, giving him a form-fitting blue costume, a full-head mask and a [[secret identity]] as Dr. Stephen Sanders. The cancellation with #183 was abrupt (there was a "Next issue" blurb in the last issue), and outstanding storylines were resolved in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #22 (Feb. 1970) and ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #126 (April 1970).

Thomas recalled in 2000 that he returned to work a day late from a weekend [[Fan convention|comic book convention]] to find that Marvel production manager [[Sol Brodsky]] had assigned ''Doctor Strange'' to writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], newly ensconced at Marvel and writing ''[[Iron Man]]''. Thomas convinced Brodsky to allow him to continue writing the title. "I got very possessive about ''Doctor Strange''," Thomas recalled. "It wasn't a huge seller, but [by the time it was canceled] we were selling the low 40 percent range of more than 400,000 print run, so it was actually selling a couple hundred thousand copies [but] at the time you needed to sell even more."<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas (interviewer)|title=So You Want a Job, Eh?

[[Stan Lee]], seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but ''a'' god, to avoid offending religious readers. The writer and artist concocted a fake [[comic book letter column|letter]] from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to Marvel from Texas.

Strange met his allies [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] in #75 (Feb. 1986) and [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]] in #80 (Dec. 1986). The series ended with a cliffhanger as his home, the Sanctum Sanctorum was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses was Doctor Strange's entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker and several spells designed to protect humanity from [[vampire]]s and the evil serpent god Set expired.

The title was discontinued so that the character's adventures could be transferred to another split book format series, ''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1-19 (April 1987-October 1988), which was shared with street heroes [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. This new Doctor Strange series resolved Strange's quest to reclaim his power and missing artifacts, as well as resurrect the Defenders, who had died in the last issue of that team's title.

Strange was returned to his own series, this time titled ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'', which ran 90 issues (November 1988-June 1996).<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3645|title= ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme''}}</ref> The initial creative team was writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] and [[Randy Emberlin]], with storylines often spanning multiple issues. Strange lost the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" in issues #48-49 (December 1992-January 1993) when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the [[Vishanti]], the mystical entities that empower his spells. During this time the series became part of the "[[Midnight Sons#Publication history|Midnight Sons]]" group of Marvel's supernatural comics,<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #60-68</ref> and Doctor Strange found new sources of magical strength in the form of [[chaos magic]],<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80-90</ref> as well as a magic construct he used as a proxy.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #60-75</ref> He would form the Secret Defenders with a rotating roster of heroes,<ref>Manning, Matthew K.

Strange regained his title in ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80 (Aug. 1995).

Strange appeared, together with the Human Torch and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''Strange Tales'' vol. 3, #1 (Nov.1994).

The character was featured in several [[limited series]]. The first was ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones'' #1-#4 (February-May 1999), with a series of [[spontaneous combustion]]s by criminals instigated by old foe Dormammu. Strange was the [[catalyst]] for the creation of a trio of sorceresses in ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' #1-#4 (August-November 2004). The ''Strange'' limited series (November 2004-July 2005) by writers [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]] updated the character's origin.<ref>Manning "2000s" {{harvnb|Brevoort|DeFalco|Manning|2008|p=323}} {{quote|"Scribes J. Michael Straczynski and Samm Barnes, with artist Brandon Peterson, retold Dr. Strange's mystical origin for a new generation of fans in this six-issue limited series.}}</ref> Another limited series, ''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' #1-5 (December 2006-April 2007), written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and illustrated by [[Marcos Martin]], focused on Strange's responsibilities as sorcerer and doctor.

Doctor Strange appeared in four [[graphic novels]] over the years: ''Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa'' (1986); ''Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989); ''Spider-Man/Dr. Strange: The Way to Dusty Death'' (1992); and ''Dr. Strange: What Is It That Disturbs You, Stephen?'' (1997).

===2000s===
Strange appeared as a supporting character for the bulk of the 2000s. He appeared regularly in Amazing Spider-Man under [[J. Michael Straczynski]], before being cast into a time loop by Baron Mordu. He later appeared on and off in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'', where he was stated as being part of the secret group known as [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] to deal with future threats to Earth. Ultimately Strange joined the team (and allowing them to use his home as a base) after the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', which he sat out. Doctor Strange was critical of the federal [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and aided the anti-registration Avengers team led by Luke Cage.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Leinil Francis Yu|Yu, Leinil Francis]]|inker= Yu, Leinil Francis|story= Revolution Part One|title= [[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]|issue= 27|date= April 2007}}</ref>

During the Bendis run, Doctor Doom attacked the Avengers and manipulated Scarlet Witch into decimating the mutant population; Doctor Strange's failure to stop the latter and his failure to realize Doom's hand in the former led to Strange renouncing his status as Sorcerer Supreme, with the Eye of Agomotto passing the mantle to [[Brother Voodoo]].<ref name="NA54">{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Billy Tan|Tan, Billy]]|inker= [[Matt Banning|Banning, Matt]]|story= You shouldn't be here, Jericho|title= The New Avengers|issue= 54|date= August 2009}}</ref>

He was also featured in ''The Order'', which spun out of the 2000 ''Defenders'' revival, and the ''Indefensible Defenders'' mini-series.

===2010s===
Doctor Strange appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through the final issue #34 (Jan. 2013).<ref>{{cite web|title=NEW AVENGERS (2013 - PRESENT)|url=http://marvel.com/comics/series/16451/new_avengers_2013_-_present|website=Marvel}}</ref> Renamed Doctor Voodoo, the newly appointed Sorcerer Supreme sacrifices himself in order to stop the powerful mystical entity [[Agamotto]] from reclaiming the Eye.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Stuart Immonen|Immonen, Stuart]]|inker= [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]]|story= Um… Sshh!

He continues to appear in the pages of the 2013 incarnation of ''New Avengers'', which focuses on the Illuminati as they deal with "Incursions", cases where two parallel Earths collide and cause the destruction of both universes. As such, the group have engaged in considerable acts of moral ambiguity in dealing with each impending incursion.{{Issue|date=December 2014}} In addition, Doctor Strange has become the  host to a dangerous demon after helping a wealthy couple whose son had become possessed; Strange ultimately offered to become the demon's host in exchange for sparing the child only for the child to die anyway. The demon ultimately possessed Strange when fighting a group of heroes from a world threatened by an incursion and kills most of those heroes, resulting in the Illuminati having to stop him.{{Issue|date=December 2014}}

==Fictional character biography==
Doctor Stephen Strange is a brilliant but egotistical [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] who only cares about wealth from his career. However, a car accident damages his hands, shattering the bones. The damage effectively ends his ability to conduct surgery, since his hands now tremble uncontrollably. Too proud to take on a teaching job, Strange desperately begins to search for a way to restore his hands, consulting various doctors, homeopathic treatments and traveling around the world to remote regions for exotic cures, all to no avail.

He exhausts his funds and is reduced to homelessness and is forced to perform "back alley" medical procedures for cash. Depressed and still searching, Strange locates a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] (who is actually the Earth's Sorcerer Supreme) in the [[Himalayas]].

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Doctor Strange}}
The character has starred in several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] titles. In the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' #1-#8 (November 2003-June 2004), Sir Stephen Strange is both the court [[physician]] and [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The title ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' introduced a female version of Strange who shares her body with a [[demon]] in issue #33 (1995). The miniseries ''[[Strange (comic book)|Strange]]'' #1-#6 (November 2004-April 2005), written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]], with artwork by [[Brandon Peterson]], reimagined the character's origin, allies and enemies in a contemporary setting.

In the miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' #1-#5 (February-June 2006), Strange is infected with a [[zombie]] virus along with many other heroes. He reappears in the second sequel, ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #1-#4 (December 2008-March 2009)

In the alternate future universe of the Marvel [[imprint]] [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Doctor Strange is no longer the Sorcerer Supreme, the title there held by Doc Magnus. Doctor Strange uses his remaining power to reform the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in ''A-Next'' #3 (1998) and to fight the Norse god of mischief, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], ''Last Hero Standing'' #4 (February 2005).

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] title ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' introduced a version of the character called "Stephen Strange, Jr.," the son of the original Doctor Strange, in ''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #12 (July 2002). The character was killed in battle by the Ultimate Marvel version of Dormammu in the miniseries ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' #1-#5 (January-September 2009).

Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R. Berns"), and [[Jack Kirby]] (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] with the same [[surname]] (called "Carl Strange"). Making his sole appearance in the [[Iron Man]] story "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #41 (1963), the character gained mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drstrng2.htm|title= Doctor Strange|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= May 11, 2002|publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EpuPbmOL|archivedate= March 3, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 3, 2013}}</ref>
