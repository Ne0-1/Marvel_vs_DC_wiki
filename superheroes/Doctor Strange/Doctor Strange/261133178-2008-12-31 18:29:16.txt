'''Doctor Strange''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], he [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963). Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange is a master of the [[Magic (paranormal)|mystic arts]] and is the current [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of the Earth dimension, responsible for defending it from mystic threats. He is also often consulted by other superheroes on supernatural matters.

The name had been used for [[Doctor Strange#Previous Doctor Strange|a different Marvel character]] two months before his debut.

==Publication history==
After debuting in ''Strange Tales'' #110 and returning in the next issue, the nine to 10-page feature "Dr. Strange" skipped two issues and then returned permanently with #114 (Nov. 1963). Steve Ditko's [[surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly head-trippy visuals helped make the feature a favorite of 1960s college students, according to accounts.<ref>BBC Documentary "In Search of Steve Ditko" - 2007</ref> Ditko, as co-plotter and later sole plotter, in the "[[Marvel Method]]", would eventually take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms that nonetheless remained well-grounded thanks to Stan Lee's reliably humanistic, adventure/[[soap opera]] dialog. Doctor Strange shared the "split book" ''Strange Tales'' with solo adventures of [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Human Torch]] (whose feature had begun in issue #101), and, beginning with #135, with its replacement feature, ''[[S.H.I.E.L.D.|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.

During Ditko's run on the feature, many enduring elements were introduced.  His mentor the [[Ancient One]] and enemy [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] both debuted along with Strange in issue #110, and his nemesis [[Baron Mordo]] debuted in #111.  An even more powerful adversary, the Dread [[Dormammu]], was introduced in #126.  In issue #138, with what historians consider one of modern comics' great moments, Doctor Strange first encountered Ditko's grand and enduring conception of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the personification of the universe, depicted as a majestic silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos. It was a groundbreaking creation at a time before such cosmic conceits were commonplace.

While Lee and Ditko themselves interacted less and less as each went their different creative ways, Ditko took his final bow on the feature in issue #146 (July 1966) with the culmination of Strange's long-running conflict with Dormammu, in which Dormammu takes on Eternity single-handed.

"Doctor Strange" continued to the end of the book's run, when the "S.H.I.E.L.D." feature was spun off into its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange'' with issue #169 (June 1968). '''Note:''' This is the title as given in the book's postal [[indicia]]; Dr. Strange's various series, confusingly, have changed their cover-logo titles much more so than most series. See the [[Doctor Strange#Bibliography|Bibliography]] for details.

Doctor Strange's first namesake comic book, written by [[Roy Thomas]] with art by penciller [[Gene Colan]], lasted only until issue #183 (Nov. 1969), by which point Strange had been given, separately, both a form-fitting, body-suit style costume with full-head mask, and then a secret/civilian identity as "Dr. Stephen Sanders" in an effort to more resemble a Marvel [[superhero]] and help low sales. These changes were unsuccessful and the series was subsequently discontinued. The cancellation was abrupt (there was a "Next Issue" blurb in the last edition), and loose ends were tied up in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #22 (Feb. 1970) and ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #126 (April 1970).

Strange's next appearance was a backup solo tale in the showcase title ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (Dec. 1971) This story not only tied into the issue's lead feature, the creation of the loosely affiliated antihero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], but also led into a new ongoing feature for the sorcerer in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #3-14 (July 1972 - March 1974). This series continued into a solo book generally titled as ''Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts'', which ran 81 issues (June 1974 - Feb. 1987). An acclaimed{{Fact|date=August 2007}} early arc by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and penciller/co-plotter [[Frank Brunner]], featured the death of Strange's mentor, the [[Ancient One]], followed by a storyline in which Strange witnessed the [[Creation myth|creation]], or re-creation, of the universe. Reflecting that era's trend toward "cosmic" characters and stories — a trend ironically begun in the Lee-Ditko '60s stories — this turn away from more traditionally occult, supernatural stories helped propel for 15 years under various teams.

Following this solo title's cancellation, the character continued uninterrupted in ''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1-19 (April 1987 - Oct. 1988), appearing in 11-page stories in this "split book" he shared predominantly with the feature "[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]". (The final issue's co-feature was "[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] and [[Mayhem (comics)|Mayhem]]", although the other pair's logo still appeared on the cover.) This in turn was followed directly by Strange's third solo title, generally listed as ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'', which lasted 90 issues (Nov. 1988 - June 1996) Writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] & [[Randy Emberlin]] were the creative team for the last few issues of the second self-titled comic, the entire ''Strange Tales'' run, and the first few issues of this new solo comic). Doctor Strange also appeared in various [[miniseries]] and two [[graphic novels]], and had major recurring roles both in the 1970s feature and later comic book ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' and the 1990s comic book ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Stephen Vincent Strange was born on [[November 18]], [[1930]]<ref>Biographical dates are taken from ''Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Marvel Knights'', except for Strange's birth month, November, taken from the cover of ''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 1, #176 (Jan. 1969).</ref> in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] to Eugene and Beverly Strange. A few months later, the Stranges move to a farm in [[Nebraska]] where Stephen is brought up alongside his brother Victor (who later became the second [[Baron Blood (comics)#Baron Blood II|Baron Blood]]) and sister April.  

In adulthood, Stephen becomes an accomplished, but arrogant, surgeon until he suffers subtle, though profound, neurological damage in an automobile accident in 1963. His hands in particular are no longer able to make the precise, fine movements necessary for surgery, although their overall mobility remains. Unable to continue his profession and too proud to accept subordinate medical assignments, he becomes unemployed and destitute.  He is reduced to being a derelict, performing shady medical procedures for little money.  Learning of a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] who might possibly cure him, the desperate Strange ventures to the man's isolated [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] abode and asks him for aid. The Ancient One instead offers to take Strange on as an apprentice in the mystic arts.  Strange refuses, but cannot leave immediately due to a sudden blizzard.<ref name=st115>''Strange Tales'' #115 (Dec. 1963)</ref>

While staying for the duration of the storm, Strange witnesses the Ancient One's apprentice, [[Baron Mordo]], secretly attack the teacher with mystically summoned skeletons, which the old man easily dispels. Strange, his skepticism eroding, confronts Mordo about the treachery but Mordo responds with restraining spells that keep Strange from warning the Ancient One or attacking Mordo physically. Amazed by these displays of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], alarmed by Mordo, but frustrated by the mystic restraints, Strange undergoes a change of heart. Deciding that the only way to stop Mordo is to learn magic himself in order to challenge Mordo on his terms, Strange accepts the Ancient One's offer. Pleased by Strange's acceptance for unselfish reasons, the Ancient One removes the mystic restraints, explaining that he is well aware of Mordo's treachery but prefers to keep Mordo close by in order to control and possibly change him.<ref name=st115 /> Strange studies magic under the Ancient One for seven years and returns to the [[United States]] in the 1970s.

===Silver Age Strange===
[[Image:ST146.jpg|thumb|left|''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966): Artist Steve Ditko's only Dr. Strange cover<!--confirmed Ditko did both pencils & inks per GCD-->]]
Based in his [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] mansion in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood, Strange uses his new abilities to fight such mystic enemies as recurring nemesis Mordo; the flame-headed other-dimensional ruler [[Dormammu]] (and his sister [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]]), with whom he clashes often; and Strange's first recorded foe upon returning to America, [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]. He also gains a valuable ally in [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], a loyal servant who is part of a line trained to serve the current Sorcerer Supreme.

Doctor Strange encounters such cosmic beings as the [[Living Tribunal]], and the personification of the universe itself, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], as well as numerous superheroes and even, at one [[Times Square]] [[New Year's]] celebration, longtime family friend and author [[Tom Wolfe]] (who allowed his likeness to be used in ''Doctor Strange'' #180, May 1969). On one journey to Dormammu's realm, Strange meets and eventually falls in love with [[Clea]], the tyrant's human-appearing niece.

When the demon Asmodeus briefly impersonates him, Strange dons a superheroic-looking full-face cowl and a "secret identity" as '''Dr. Stephen Sanders''' from #177 through the final issue, #183 (Feb.-Nov. 1969).

===Death of the Ancient One===
When the demonic entity [[Shuma-Gorath]] (first mentioned in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #5, Nov. 1972) tries to cross into the Earth's dimension from within the mind of the Ancient One (#9, July 1973), Strange is forced to sacrifice his mentor in order to save humanity's collective soul (#10, Sept. 1973). After his mentor's death — in which the Ancient One becomes "one with the universe" and a lingering presence — Strange inherits the mantle and power of Sorcerer Supreme of [[Earth]]'s plane. 

After taking his lover Clea as his disciple (''Marvel Premiere'' #12, Nov. 1973), one of his first tasks as Sorcerer Supreme is to confront the personification of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].  After proving himself worthy, Strange is granted the extended lifespan befitting his new role. His elderly predecessor, the Ancient One, had lived for over five centuries.

The Ancient One, much later, fought Dr. Strange in the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'' (March-July 2006), which played many of its characters and concepts for laughs. He was depicted as having been condemned to [[Hell]], without a Marvel Universe-continuity explanation. In ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A - Z'', select entries, including that of the Ancient One himself, state that this was probably an impostor.

===Defenders and Nightstalkers===
When fighting the undying ones, Dr. Strange manipulates the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and Namor the Sub-Mariner to assist him in defeating them. When Baron Mordo returns the identity of Stephen Strange to Dr. Strange, Dr. Strange again recruits the [[anti-heroes]] the Hulk, Namor the Sub-Mariner, and the [[Silver Surfer]] to form the sporadically summoned superhero "non-team", the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. 

In a 1982-83 arc (''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2, #56-62), Strange successfully invokes the "Montesi Formula" that eliminates all [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]] in the Marvel Universe. Though this is considered permanent at the time, in the early 1990s Strange finds it necessary to organize, in Defenders fashion, a group of [[vampire hunter]]s dubbed the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] — [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and the vampiric private detective [[Hannibal King]]. The three are told they have been brought together to fend off [[supernatural]] threats, and only later learn it is in fact to prepare for the weakening of the Montesi Formula and the expected return of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. By the time vampires do return, throughout various Marvel occult comics in the mid-1990s, Strange has been temporarily usurped as Sorcerer Supreme by the demonic Salome and replaced by his own creation, [[Strangers (Marvel Comics)|Strange]]. His position restored shortly afterward, Strange, by the mid-2000s, serves chiefly as a supporting character to whom Marvel superheroes might turn for matters concerning magic and the supernatural.  Other times, he directly intervenes in crises. His actions have become questionable at time, as in his attempts to steal a powerful [[Book of Shadows]], the ''Tome of Zhered-na'',  from fellow magic user [[Jennifer Kale]], insisting that her family book of magic can only be properly used by himself.

===Civil War and aftermath===
It is revealed that Doctor Strange has been a member of the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]], a secret alliance of several prominent superheroes, since just after the [[Kree-Skrull War]].<ref>''[[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' #1 (June 2006)</ref> In the final known meeting of the group, Strange vehemently opposes the proposed [[Superhuman Registration Act]], and informs [[Iron Man]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] that they are never to call on him again. Some time later,<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #3 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Wong tells [[Hank Pym]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] that Strange has no intention of supporting the Act and is in seclusion in the Arctic.

==Powers and abilities==
{{Cleanup-section|date=December 2008}}
[[Image:DeodatoDrStrange.jpg|thumb|Dr. Strange performing an incantation.  Art by [[Mike Deodato]].]]
 
Dr. Strange is the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth's Universe, with the greatly extended lifespan befitting his station. He has unparalleled mastery of the mystic arts, which he uses to defend this reality from otherworldly threats. His primary magical patrons are a group of entities known as "the [[Vishanti]]", a trinity of godly beings composed of Agamotto, Hoggoth and Oshtur. He has, on rare occasions, called upon the power of the demon Dormammu, an arch-nemesis.

Strange holds an M.D. in neurosurgery, although his ability to perform such delicate tasks has been compromised due to his accident. He is also an accomplished martial artist, learning martial arts as part of his training to be a mystic, and possesses considerable strategic skills, which he has employed as leader of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

Dr. Strange's powers are all mystical but take several forms. Main manifestations include:

*Personal abilities — As a result of his mystic training, Dr. Strange is capable of a manipulating the forces of magic as well as reality for a great many abilities such as [[astral projection]], [[telepathy]], hypnotism or mesmerism, thought-casting, illusion-casting, and several others. These are put in a separate category because he seems to perform these functions as a telepath would, not needing to manipulate magic to do it. These abilities can be exhausted through over-use but can be amplified by mystic energy (as against [[Moondragon]]) or the [[Eye of Agamotto]] (done countless times) to afford Strange powerful psychic abilities.
*Universal sources — By manipulating the ambient mystical energy of this universe, Dr. Strange can perform a great many functions. Commonly this is seen as energy bolts that range from low power to planet destroying, transmutation, telekinesis, teleportation, protective shields, etc. He uses this mystical energy to cast spells of a near infinite variety. Dr. Strange has also been shown to amass as much wealth/gold as he desires using magic, as he has done to pay debts.
*Divine sources — Dr. Strange can channel the virtually unlimited extra-dimensional energy of nigh-omnipotent mystical and non-mystical beings in multiple dimensions (known as Principalities) to empower his spells, as many other sorcerers do. This can take the form of standard spells ("Crimson Bands of Cyttorak") or just stating what he wants to occur and channeling some being to make it happen. This ability to be a conduit to multiversal power sources has given rise to the phrase "Dr. Strange is as powerful as the god he invokes."
Doctor Strange's powers typically come from one of three divine sources: The Vishanti (a trinity formed of [[Hoggoth]], [[Oshtur]], and [[Agamotto]]), the [[Octessence]] (a group of 8 beings, especially including [[Cyttorak]] and [[Watoomb]]), and other beings who owe him a debt (this includes [[Satannish]] and even [[Dormammu]]).  
*In the miniseries "The Oath", it is said that he cannot use magic that can replicate anything discovered by human science.
*By force of will, Dr. Strange can "take" the power of another entity. This does not require the use of a spell. He uses this ability against [[Captain Universe]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}} as well as against Arioch and [[Shuma-Gorath]] in ''Strange Tales Volume 2''. This is considered [[black magic]] and as such, he rarely employs this. Also, when taking the powers of omnipotent entities, he can absorb their mind and assume their duties and roles in the dimension in which they exist. But, if his will falters, he can lose all sense of self.
*In the Black Magic saga in ''Strange Tales Volume 2'', Dr. Strange also became proficient in Black Magic under the tutelage of Kaluu, including using the necromantic energy released in death for various effects. After he purged [[Shuma-Gorath]] from himself, he has since stopped using black magic.
*At a certain period, Dr. Strange became a receptacle of Earth's Gaia magic through the use of a forge built with the support of all his magical artifacts.  This energy was exhausted in the War of Seven Spheres.
*For a brief period, research from the Vishanti library led Strange to tap into "catastrophe magic" by invoking a mystical alignment of all the planets, but this source of magic was limited and he ceased using it specifically as a source of his power.

In the Marvel canon, virtually any human is capable of learning and harnessing magic — considered simply another form of energy within continuity — through training; however, each person has a different potential.

Strange's own power is often amplified by the numerous magical artifacts that are in his possession or by artifacts that he uses in the course of his adventures. The two artifacts he carries with him at all times are the [[Eye of Agamotto]] and the [[Cloak of Levitation]]: 
 
*'''The Eye of Agamotto''' (which resides within the Amulet of Agamotto worn at Dr. Strange's throat) is a powerful and valued artifact that has many functions.  Using the Eye, Strange can see through any [[lie]], deception or [[illusion]], send the eye out at [[light speed]] to intercept and absorb massive amounts of any type of energy and free others who are trapped in their own illusions.  It is often used to amplify his [[mind's eye]], giving [[psychic]] abilities that rival the most powerful of telepaths.  It is also often used to play back an area's past events and open dimensional portals.  When used offensively, no being can withstand its light for long; due to its lethal effect, it is often used as a weapon of last resort. The amulet can only be used by a being with a pure heart and a clean soul.
 
*'''The Cloak of Levitation''' allows him to fly, and responds to his thoughts.  Strange has used it many times as a "third set of hands" to attack a foe when his own body has been incapacitated.  The Cloak is nearly indestructible, often escaping damage during even the most violent confrontations. The cloak has acted independently from Strange as though it has a will of its own. The cloak has been nearly destroyed on at least three occasions: 
:#''Strange Tales'' vol. 1, #157 — During a battle with Zom at [[Stonehenge]]. Strange was able to reconstruct it in a display of power to prove to The Living Tribunal that Strange was worthy to set right the cosmic events recently unleashed
:#''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #77 — During a battle with the demon Khat while Strange was in the slow decline of his white-magical powers. The cloak was repaired by Enitharmon the Weaver, the former master of Strange's second apprentice, Rintrah. While the damage to the Cloak on this occasion was not as severe as previously, Strange was unable to repair it himself
:#The third instance is convoluted. During his attempt to garner a new power-base for himself, after foregoing the powers and protections of the Vishanti, Strange went underground to create his new power forge, and when he was finished he was rejuvenated, younger-looking and wearing a new costume (including a mystical black body suit) and he had transformed the Cloak into something more resembling a Kimono or robe (''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3, #76), however, soon he was drafted into the War of the Seven Spheres by the Vishanti. After battling for five thousand years in another dimension, Strange was returned to Earth (at a time mere months from when he was spirited away) a tattered shambles (issue #80). His magical abilities depleted and his new Robe/Cloak shredded. He soon incorporated elements of the cloak into what would be called the "Overcoat of Levitation"; a red [[trench coat]] with the Cloak's gold trim along the collar. He soon returned, however, to his traditional Cloak.

Other artifacts include the Orb of Agamotto, which he uses daily to monitor the surrounding dimensions for trouble; the Wand of Watoomb, which amplifies his power; and the Book of the Vishanti, which contains some of the multiverse's most powerful and secret spells and counter-spells. He owns countless other artifacts he can bring out in times of need. As a result of being a member of the Illuminati, he has also come into possession of the "Soul" gem of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].

Dr. Strange is functionally immortal, having the immortallity conferred upon him by the Ancient One after Strange assumed the title of Sorcerer Supreme.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}  He does not age nor succumb to medical diseases, though he can be killed. His physical appearance is usually a man in his 40's even though he is chronologically in his 80's.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}  He also survived five thousand years in the War of Seven Spheres but his memory of this period has magically faded so it may not count towards his chronological age.

The mansion where Dr. Strange lives, his [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], is located at 177A [[Bleecker Street]], [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], [[New York]], which in this universe was the actual address of the apartment building in which the series writer at that time actually lived. Strange has imbued the mansion with several spells (mostly protective, some proactive). In the comic, "Steven Sanders" was shown reading a telegram addressed to him there.

==Spell manifestations==
Dr. Strange often conjures specific magical effects for specific purposes. Among them are:
*Bolts of Bedevilment (as an offensive weapon)
*A Conjurer's Cone (to transport an enemy away to another realm)
*The Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak]] (to bind someone)
*The Flames of the Faltine (as an offensive weapon)
*The Images of [[Ikonn]] (to create duplicate images of himself or others to confuse an enemy)
*The Seven Rings of [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|Raggadorr]] (Seven blue energy rings that surround him and deflect attacks)
*The Light of the All-Seeing Eye of Agamotto (to disperse an assailant's spell, to reveal the truth or to destroy an enemy's actual soul)
*The Shield of the Seraphim (as a protective barrier)
*The Vapors of [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|Valtorr]] (as an obscuring fog)
*The Winds of [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|Watoomb]] (as an offensive weapon or transportation)
*Chains of [[Demons in the Marvel Universe#The Octessence|Krakkan]] (constricts an enemy in strong chains)
*Seven Suns of Cinnibus (an energy blast that is as hot as seven suns)
*A Sorcerer's Sphere (a black-colored bubble that protects the Sorcerer inside, but absorbs all the mystical energy in the surrounding area. This absorbing-process normally takes one hour, but an adept sorcerer can make time go by faster so that it seems only minutes have elapsed.)

==As deus ex machina==
In the Marvel canon, there are no clearly defined limits of what Dr. Strange can or cannot do. The stories themselves contradict one another: Dr. Strange is shown easily altering memories, or having complete mastery over time by either stopping it all together and rewinding it or traveling into the past in one story, then stating that his magic cannot do so in another instance. In some appearances he can stand against something as powerful as the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], and in others he appears defenseless against simple physical attack by another person.

Some writers have ignored canonical evidence that Dr. Strange has enchantments that shield his body from physical harm, and that he virtually does not age and can not die unless under his own terms (having made a deal with the omnipotent being [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] which grants Stephen life as long as he wishes it so), with his predecessor as Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, having lived several centuries.

Dr. Strange is often used as a [[deus ex machina]] to stop, prevent or undo many world-altering events that occur in other characters' comic books. Examples include:

*In ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #190-191 (Feb.-March 1985), the wizard [[Kulan Gath]] magically transformed New York City into an approximation of his own ancient time. Everyone, save for Strange and a handful of others, forgot who they were and assumed roles appropriate to such a reality. Strange was held prisoner by Kulan Gath, his flesh warped to prevent him speaking aloud or making mystical gestures. Despite numerous characters dying, the spell was eventually broken and reality was restored by Dr. Strange and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].
*In ''[[Micronauts]]'' #35 (Nov. 1981){{Fact|date=February 2007}}<!--Just need to confirm, since Dr. Strange isn't listed in this issue per GCD and he isn't on the cover. See: [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=35817]-->, Dr. Strange was instrumental in helping the Micronauts defeat ancient demons from Earth's past. As he kept the demons at bay, Commander Arcturus Rann rushed the Keys to the Enigma Force to the tomb of Prince Wayfinder, the creator of the Microverse. After opening the Tomb, Strange and Rann encountered the Sword in the Star, who merged them into a single entity, Captain Universe, in order to save the rapidly deteriorating Space Wall between Earth and the Microverse.
*In the ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' six-issue limited series, Dr. Strange recruited the heroes to stop [[Thanos]].  He was one of the few heroes to survive Thanos' destruction of his opposition and was responsible for rescuing the few survivors in the final battle against Thanos and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. Strange was one of the few people to remember that these events had occurred, the others being the [[Infinity Watch]], the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Eric Masterson|Thor]], Strange and the latter two having witnessed Warlock's soul during the crisis and Warlock being unable to erase such knowledge.
*In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #31-33, Dr. Strange aided the titular, time-traveling team against an alien [[Badoon]] named L'Matto that had been granted the Uni-Power, transforming him into Captain Universe.  A duel between the Badoon and the Guardian [[Charlie-27]], which was appearing to be in L'Matto's favor, was turned in Charlie's favor with the intervention of Strange and fellow Guardians [[Vance Astro]] and [[Aleta Ogord]], the latter of whom had just become the new [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]]. With Dr. Strange's help, Aleta defeated the Captain Universe-empowered L'Matto and then exorcised the Uni-Power from L'Matto's body; the Badoon was left with his people to recover, while Strange returned to his studies, the Guardians returned to their home in the 31st century, and the Uni-Power headed off to find a new host.
*In ''[[House of M]]'' #7-8 (Nov.-Dec. 2005), Dr. Strange and [[Emma Frost]] prevented the [[Scarlet Witch]] from imposing her will on the entire world. Driven insane by her powers, the Witch reverted to the alternate reality she had created but stripped the majority of the world's mutants of their powers. Only a few who were shielded by Dr. Strange's spell and Frost's psychic powers retained their memories of the House of M reality and of what had transpired.
*In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #500, Dr. Strange appeared during an invasion by Dormammu and the Mindless Ones on New York City. Reed Richards of [[The Fantastic Four]] inadvertently released Dormammu from his "prison" by making a gun to send the Mindless Ones back to their dimension. Doctor Strange appeared in time to fight Dormammu and, with the help of [[Spider-Man]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and other heroes, Dormammu and the Mindless Ones were sent back to their dimension. As a result of the dimensional tampering, Baron Mordo was resurrected and after the battle he kidnapped Strange; what happened between this event and Strange's reappearance in the Marvel Universe is thus far unrevealed.
*In ''[[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #503 he defeats the [[Scarlet Witch]] whose powers had been causing widespread chaos throughout the Mavel Universe.

==Major supporting characters==
===Villains===
[[Image:DitkoDrStrange,Clea,Dormammu.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Dormammu]], [[Clea]] and Dr. Strange, in a ''[[Strange Tales]]'' panel by artist [[Steve Ditko]].]]
*[[Baron Mordo]] — A dark sorcerer and frequent threat.
*[[Dormammu]] — A fallen Faltinian being. When outcast, he chose to take a form of pure mystical energy to maintain most of his Faltine essence.  He took over the Dark Dimension from the [[Mindless Ones]] and consistently tries to expand into other dimensions through conquest. Dormammu is a being of immense power and one of Strange's most frequent foes, perhaps even rightfully called his [[archenemy]].
*[[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] — A fallen Faltine. Sister of Dormammu, she chose to take a lesser and more conventionally human physical form in order to experiment with physical pleasures.  She is the mother of Clea.
*[[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] — Ruler of the dream dimension, father of [[Dreamqueen]] and inspiration for Gaiman's [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Though he is a threat to Strange and to humanity, his existence is necessary, since without Nightmare, humanity would go insane. Appeared in Doctor Strange's debut story in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963). 
*[[Shuma-Gorath]] — A vastly powerful extra-dimensional being of chaos magic and the ruler of thousands of realms which ruled the Earth ages ago. Unable to be destroyed, its essence is taken on by its supplanter. Shuma-Gorath crossing over into our dimension would be disastrous, and Doctor Strange has been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to stop it.
*[[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] — The personification of Death in Earth's dimension. It was in Doctor Strange's fight against Death that he proved himself worthy to be Sorcerer Supreme. <!--There is antipathy between Death and Strange since as Sorcerer Supreme Death is not allowed to take him. THIS NEEDS EXPLANATION; Ancient One died, and this article says Strange can be killed--> Death has claimed that when Stephen finally fails in his duty she will take him; however, it is more likely that he will become one with Eternity, as have the Sorcerers Supreme before him.
*[[Satannish]] — One of the demon rulers of the dead. Strange's duties have occasionally led to conflict with this being.
*[[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] — One of the demon rulers of the dead, originally introduced as a [[Silver Surfer]] foe, but who has since become a major entity in story arcs here and in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' and other Marvel series. Strange's duties have occasionally led to conflict with this being.

[[Image:Drstrangemovie.jpg|thumb|VHS release of ''[[Dr. Strange (1978 film)|Dr. Strange]]'' (1978), starring [[Peter Hooten]].]]
{{main|Dr. Strange (1978 film)}}
*The [[television movie|TV-movie]] adaptation ''[[Dr. Strange (1978 film)|Dr. Strange]]'' premiered on [[CBS]] on Sept. 6, 1978. Written and directed by [[executive producer]] [[Philip DeGuere]], it starred [[Peter Hooten]] as Dr. Stephen Strange, [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as [[Wong (comics)#Television|Wong]], [[Jessica Walter]] as the villainous [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan LeFay]], Eddie Benton (later [[pseudonym]]ously [[Anne-Marie Martin]]) as [[Clea#Film|Clea Lake]]; [[Philip Sterling]] as Dr. Frank Taylor; [[John Mills|Sir John Mills]] as Strange's mentor, [[Sorcerer Supreme]] Thomas Lindmer; [[Michael Ansara]] as the voice of the [[Ancient One#Television|Ancient One]]; and [[Ted Cassidy]] as the voices of both the demon Balzaroth, as well as the comics' [[Dormammu]].

In an interview found in the January 1985 issue of ''[[Comics Feature]]'' magazine, Stan Lee recounted largely positive experiences working on Doctor Strange, especially compared with the other live-action Marvel Comics adaptations under the publisher's development deal with CBS and Universal in the late 1970s:

{{cquote|
''Just as with the Hulk, Lee had few problems with the tv movie adaptation done of Dr. Strange. "I probably had the most input into that one. I've become good friends with the writer/producer Phil DeGuere. I was pleased with Dr. Strange and [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The [Incredible] Hulk]]. I think that Dr. Strange would have done much better than it did in the ratings except that it aired opposite [[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]. Those are the only experiences I've had with live action television. Dr. Strange and the Hulk were fine. [[Captain America in other media#1970s live-action television movies|Captain America]] was a bit [of a] disappointment and [[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]] was a total nightmare."''<ref>''[[Comics Feature]]''. Issue 33A. January 1985. "A Talk With The Man, Stan Lee" pp. 40. </ref>}}

[[Image:TalesOfSuspense41.jpg|thumb|Marvel's first Dr. Strange: ''Tales of Suspense'' #41 (May 1963). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Sol Brodsky]].]]
Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R. Berns") and [[Jack Kirby]] (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and [[Ph.D.]] with the same [[surname]]. He was later identified with the full name Carl Strange.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} This Dr. Strange was one of [[Iron Man]]'s earliest [[antagonists]] in the story "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #41 (May 1963). After gaining mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike, this Dr. Strange established a [[force field (science fiction)|force field]]-protected island base staffed with corrupt scientists and [[mercenaries]].
