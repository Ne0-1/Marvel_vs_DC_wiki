'''Doctor Stephen Strange''' (commonly known as '''Doctor Strange''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was co-created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963).

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] of comics, the character has featured in several self-titled series and Marvel-endorsed products including arcade and [[video game]]s; [[animated]] [[television series]]; a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film; and merchandise such as [[trading cards]].

==Publication history==
===1960s===
The character,  co-created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], debuted in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963), a "split book" shared with fellow Marvel character the [[Human Torch (comics)|Human Torch]] until issue #134 (July 1965), and then super-spy [[Nick Fury]] until issue #168 (May 1968). Strange appeared in issues #110-111 and #114 before the character's eight-page [[origin story]] appeared in #115 (Dec. 1963).

Ditko drew the feature through ''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966), and during this period he and Lee introduced many of Strange's allies, such as his eventual lover [[Clea]], who debuted (although not initially named) in ''Strange Tales'' #126 (Nov. 1964); and enemies, such as [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in #110, and the flame-headed [[Dormammu]], in #126 (Nov. 1964). "Doctor Strange" stories showcased [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly head-trippy visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. Comics historian Mike Benton wrote,
{{quote|The Dr. Strange stories of the 1960s constructed a cohensive [[cosmology]] that would have thrilled any self-respecting [[theosophy|theosophist]]. College students, minds freshly opened by [[psychedelic]] experiences and [[Eastern mysticism]], read Ditko and Lee's Dr. Strange stories with the belief of a recent [[Hare Krishna]] convert. Meaning was everywhere, and readers analyzed the Dr. Strange stories for their relationship to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] myths, [[Sumerian religion|Sumarian gods]], and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Benton|title=Superhero Comics of the Silver Age: The Illustrated History |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|location=[[Dallas]], [[Texas]]|isbn=978-0878337460|year=1991|page =63}}</ref>}}

"People who read 'Doctor Strange' thought people at Marvel must be heads [e.g., drug users]," recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer [[Roy Thomas]] in 1971, "because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But ... I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do."<ref>{{cite magazine|authorlink=Robin Green (producer)|last=Green |first= Robin| url=http://www.reocities.com/area51/Chamber/8346/rs91.facefront.1.html |title=Face Front!

Eventually, as co-plotter and later sole plotter, in the "[[Marvel Method]]", Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in ''Strange Tales'' #130-146 (July 1965 - July 1966), Ditko introduced the cosmic character [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos.<ref name=st134>{{cite web | url=http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/ | title=''Strange Tales'' #134 | publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]]}} "Indexer notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (November 1965)."</ref> As historian Bradford W. Wright describes,

{{bquote|Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. Dr. Strange's adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled [[Salvador Dali]] paintings. ...Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lee's childhood as well as by contemporary [[Beat Generation|Beat]] culture. Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth counterculture's fascination with Eastern mysticism and [[psychedelia]]. Never among Marvel's more popular or accessible characters, Dr. Strange still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | title=Comic Book Nation: Transformation of a Youth Culture | publisher=Johns Hopkins | year=2001 | isbn=0-8018-7450-5 | page=213}}</ref>}}

From the beginning, stories revealed that Doctor Strange used magical artifacts to augment his power, such as the [[Cloak of Levitation]],<ref>The blue "novice" version first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963), with the red "master" version first appearing in ''Strange Tales'' #127 (Dec. 1964).</ref> the [[Eye of Agamotto]], in''Strange Tales'' #115 (Dec. 1963); the [[Book of the Vishanti]] in #116 (Jan. 1964); and the [[Orb of Agamotto]] in #118 (March 1964). From the first story, Strange's residence, the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], was a part of the character's mythos. The trademark circular window divided by three sweeping lines on the front of the residence (actually the protective Seal of the Vishanti){{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} appeared in many Doctor Strange stories. Strange's personal servant, [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], introduced in #147 (Aug. 1966), guarded the residence in his absence.

In keeping with Lee's emphasis on continuity, Strange was also quickly established as part of the Marvel Universe, and guest starred in ''The [[Fantastic Four]]'' #27 (June 1964), encountered the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], foster brother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], in ''Strange Tales'' #123 (August 1964), and guest-starred with Ditko's other major Marvel co-creation in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #2 (1965).

The series continued with Lee dialoging Ditko's plots through ''Strange Tales'' #142, followed by  [[Roy Thomas]] (two issues) and [[Denny O'Neil]] (two issues). Ditko's last issue was ''Strange Tales'' #146, with [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] artist/writer [[Bill Everett]] succeeding Ditko as artist until issue #152, followed by [[Marie Severin]] through #160 and [[Dan Adkins]] through #168,<ref>With layouts by [[George Tuska]] on #166 (March 1968).</ref> the final issue before the "Nick Fury" feature moved to its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange''.

Lee returned to write the character in ''Strange Tales'' #151-157; followed by Thomas (#158-159); and two writers who did virtually no other Marvel work, Raymond Marais (#160-161) and Jim Lawrence (#162-166). The post-Ditko ''Strange Tales'' stories introduced another cosmic entity, the [[Living Tribunal]], in issue #157 (June 1967) and the evil [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], sister of Dormammu, in #150 (Nov. 1966). The title, however, was flagging, with Strange encountering such one-off foes such as Nebulos and Voltorg in ''Strange Tales'' #162 (Nov. 1967) and #166 (March 1968), respectively.

The now 20-page ''Doctor Strange'' solo series ran 15 issues, #169-183 (June 1968 - Nov. 1969), continuing the numbering of ''Strange Tales''. Thomas wrote the run of new stories (''Strange Tales'' #179 being a reprint), joined after the first three issues by the art team of [[penciler]] [[Gene Colan]] and [[inker]] [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] through the end. Thomas and Colan attempted to boost sales by revamping Strange and making the character closer to being a superhero. Given a form-fitting blue costume, a full-head mask and a [[secret identity]] as '''Dr. Stephen Sanders''', the character teamed with the superheroes the [[Black Knight (Marvel Comics)|Black Knight]] in ''Doctor Strange'' #178 (March 1969) and [[Spider-Man]] in #179 (April 1969), and he battled the [[X-Men]] foe [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in #182 (Sept. 1969). The cancellation with #183 was abrupt (there was a "Next issue" blurb in the last issue), and outstanding storylines were resolved in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #22 (Feb. 1970) and ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #126 (April 1970).

Thomas recalled in 2000 that he eloped in July 1968 to marry his first wife, Jean, and returned to work a day late from a weekend [[Fan convention|comic book convention]] to find that Marvel production manager [[Sol Brodsky]] had assigned ''Doctor Strange'' to writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], newly ensconced at Marvel and writing ''[[Iron Man]]''. Thomas convinced Brodsky to allow him to continue writing the title. "I got very possessive about ''Doctor Strange''," Thomas recalled. "It wasn't a huge seller, but [by the time it was canceled] we were selling the low 40 percent range of more than 400,000 print run, so it was actually selling a couple hundred thousand copies [but] at the time you needed to sell even more."<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas (interviewer) | title=So You Want a Job, Eh? The Gene Colan Interview | journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | volume=3 | issue=6 | date=Autumn 2000 | pages=13–14}}</ref>

===1970s – 1990s===
Strange next appeared in the first three issues (Dec. 1971 - June 1972) of the quarterly showcase title ''[[Marvel Feature]]'', appearing in both the main story detailing the formation of superhero "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and the related back-up story. The character then starred in a revival solo series in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #3-14 (July 1972 – March 1974). This arc marked the debut of another recurring foe, the entity [[Shuma-Gorath]], created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Frank Brunner]]. In issues #8-10 (May-Sept. 1973), in order to stop Shuma-Gorath from entering our reality, Strange was forced to shut down the Ancient One's mind, causing his mentor's physical death. The Ancient One, however, assured Strange this was a necessary sacrifice and his soul merged with the cosmic entity Eternity. With the Ancient One's death, Strange then assumed the title of [[Sorcerer Supreme]].

The ''Marvel Premiere'' series segued to the character's second ongoing title, ''Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts'', also known as ''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, which ran 81 issues (June 1974 – Feb. 1987). During this period Strange met his allies [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] in #75 (Feb. 1986) and [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]] in #80 (Dec. 1986). The series ended with a cliffhanger as the Sanctum Sanctorum was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses was Doctor Strange's entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker and several spells designed to protect humanity from vampires and the evil serpent god Set would now expire.

Following the title's cancellation, the character's adventures continued in ''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1-19 (April 1987 – Oct. 1988), which was again published in the "split book" format, shared with street heroes [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. This new Doctor Strange series resolved Strange's quest to reclaim his power and missing artifacts, as well as resurrect the Defenders who had died in the last issue of that team's title.

Strange then appeared in another self-titled series, ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'', which ran 90 issues (Nov. 1988 - June 1996). The initial creative team was writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] and [[Randy Emberlin]], with storylines often written as multi-issue arcs. Strange lost the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" in issues #48-49 (Dec. 1992 – Jan. 1993) when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the [[Vishanti]], the mystical entities that empower his spells. During this time the series became part of the "[[Midnight Sons#Publication history|Midnight Sons]]" group of Marvel's supernatural comics,{{Issue|date=October 2011}} and Doctor Strange found new sources of magical strength in the form of chaos magic{{Issue|date=October 2011}} as well as a magic-fueled robot he used as a proxy.{{Issue|date=October 2011}} He would also form the Secret Defenders with a rotating roster of heroes, and reunite with the original Defenders. Strange regained his title in ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80 (Aug. 1995).

Strange appeared – together with original regulars the Human Torch and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] – in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''Strange Tales'' vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1994).

The character was also featured in several [[limited series]], the first being ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones''  #1-4 (Feb.–May 1999), with a series of [[spontaneous combustion]]s by criminals instigated by old foe Dormammu. Strange was the [[catalyst]] for the creation of a trio of sorceresses in ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' #1-4 (Aug.–Nov. 2004),  A third limited series, ''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' #1-5 (Dec. 2006 – April 2007), written by [[Brian K Vaughan]] and illustrated by [[Marcos Martin]], focused on Strange's duty as Sorcerer Supreme and the nature of his powers.

Doctor Strange has also appeared in four [[graphic novels]] over the years: ''Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa'' (1986); ''Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989); ''Spider-Man/Dr. Strange: The Way to Dusty Death'' (1992); and ''Dr. Strange: What is it that Disturbs You, Stephen?'' (Oct. 1997).

The character has remained a constant in the Marvel Universe over the decades, appearing on a regular basis in three volumes of the title ''Defenders'',<ref>''Defenders'' #1-152 (Aug. 1972 - Feb. 1986); ''Defenders'' vol. 2, #1-12 (March 2001 - Feb. 2002), and ''Defenders'' vol. 3, #1-5 (Sept. 2005 - Jan. 2006)</ref> ''[[Secret Defenders]]'',<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #1-25 (March 1993 - March 1995)</ref> and a limited series focused on the Defenders, ''The Order'' #1-6 (April–Sept. 2002). Strange appeared in several stories of the superhero team-up titled aptly named ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #21 (May 1974), #35 (July 1975), #50 (Oct. 1976), #76 (Dec. 1978), #80-81 (April–May 1979); ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2, #8-9 (April–May 1998); ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3, #3 (Feb. 2005), #11-13 (Oct.–Nov. 2005)</ref> and other one-off stories in  ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #6 (Nov. 1974) and #49 (March 1979), and several issues of ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'',<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #5-6 (Nov. 1982 - Jan. 1983), #8 (May 1983), #21 (July 1985), #41 (Dec. 1988), #49 (Feb. 1990)</ref> He starred in stories in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #18 (Dec. 1979) and #40 (Aug. 1983). He also appeared, either in person or behind the scenes, with the titular trio of vampire slayers in the 19-issue run of ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''. (Nov. 1992 – April 1994).

===2000s –===
Strange appeared as a supporting character the 2000s. In ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #7 (July 2005), writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] [[retconned]] Marvel history and established that in the past, several metahumans, including Strange, formed a secret council called the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] to deal with future threats to Earth. In present-day continuity, during the 2006-2007 company-wide ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline involving the introduction of a federal [[Superhuman Registration Act]], which splits the superhero community, Strange is opposed to mandatory registration. Beginning with ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #27 (April 2007), he secretly shelters in his residence the anti-registration splinter group of the Avengers. The legislation was eventually repealed. Strange then sought out a successor Sorcerer Supreme. After he had considered several magic-users such as [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]], the [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], and [[Doctor Doom]], the Eye of Agamotto chose [[Brother Voodoo]] in ''New Avengers'' #54 (Aug. 2009). Rechristened Doctor Voodoo, he sacrifices himself in ''New Avengers'' vol. 2, #6 (Jan. 2011) in order to stop the powerful mystical entity [[Agamotto]] from reclaiming the Eye. The following issue, a guilt-ridden Strange, rejoining the New Avengers, offers the team his servant Wong to act as their housekeeper.
