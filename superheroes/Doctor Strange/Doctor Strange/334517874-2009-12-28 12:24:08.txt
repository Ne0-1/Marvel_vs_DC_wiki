'''Doctor Strange''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in publications published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was co-created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] and first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963). 

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character has featured in several self-titled series and Marvel-endorsed products including arcade and [[video game]]s; [[animated]] [[television series]] and a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film and merchandise such as [[trading cards]]. 

==Publication history==
===1960s===
The character debuted in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963), a "split book" shared with fellow Marvel character the [[Human Torch (comics)|Human Torch]] until issue #134 (July 1965), and then super spy [[Nick Fury]] until issue #168 (May 1968). Strange appeared in the following issue and then #114 before co-creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] gave his [[origin story]] in #115 (Dec. 1963). In that eight-page tale, Strange is established as a world-renowned if selfish [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], until a car accident damages his hands and prevents him from conducting surgery. Learning of a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] who might cure his condition, Strange finds the man in the [[Himalayas]]. After Strange selflessly tries to thwart a traitorous disciple ([[Baron Mordo]]), the Ancient One teaches Strange the mystic arts. 

Steve Ditko drew the feature through ''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966), and during this period he and Lee introduced many of Strange's  allies, such as his eventual lover [[Clea]];<ref>Debuting - although not initially named - in ''Strange Tales'' #126 (Nov. 1964)</ref> and his enemies [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]];<ref name="tales110">''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963)</ref> [[Baron Mordo]];<ref>''Strange Tales'' #111 (Aug. 1963)</ref> and [[Dormammu]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #126 (Nov. 1964)</ref> Ditko also visualized the [[cosmic entity]] [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], a sometime ally of Strange.<ref>First mentioned in ''Strange Tales'' #134 (July 1965) and seen in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (July 1965)</ref> 

These stories revealed that Strange uses magical artifacts to augment his power, such as the [[Cloak of Levitation]];<ref>The blue "novice" version appears in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963) and the "master" version in ''Strange Tales'' #127 (Dec. 1964)</ref> [[Eye of Agamotto]];<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115 (Dec. 1963)</ref> [[Book of the Vishanti]]<ref>''Strange Tales'' #116 (Jan. 1964)</ref> and the [[Orb of Agamotto]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #118 (March 1964)</ref> From the first story, Strange's residence, the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], was a part of the character's mythos.<ref name="tales110"/> The trademark circular window divided by three sweeping lines on the front of the residence (actually the protective Seal of the Vishanti) appears in many Doctor Strange stories. Strange's personal servant, [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], guards the residence in his absence.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #147 (Aug. 1966)</ref>

In keeping with Lee's emphasis on continuity, Strange was also quickly established as part of the Marvel Universe, guest starring in a ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' story<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #27 (June 1964)</ref> and encountering the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], foster brother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #123 (Aug. 1964)</ref>

The series continued with writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artists [[Marie Severin]] and [[Herb Trimpe]] creating another cosmic entity, the [[Living Tribunal]],<ref>''Strange Tales'' #157 (June 1967)</ref> as well as the sister of Dormammu, [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #150 (Nov. 1966)</ref> The title, however, had been flagging as Strange encountered ever stranger one-off foes such as Nebulos<ref>''Strange Tales'' #162 (Nov. 1967)</ref> and Voltorg.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #166 (March 1968)</ref> After issue #168 (May 1968), the Nick Fury feature was spun off into its own series, and ''Strange Tales'' was retitled ''Doctor Strange''; the title feature, still written by Thomas and now penciled by [[Gene Colan]], was expanded to 20 pages.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #169 (June 1968)</ref>
[[Image:PanelStrangeTales-110.jpg|thumb|Splash page for the ''Doctor Strange'' story in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963). Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]

Thomas and Colan attempted to boost sales by revamping Strange and making the character closer to being a superhero. Given a form-fitting blue costume, a full-head mask and a [[secret identity]] as '''Dr. Stephen Sanders''', the character teamed with the superheroes the [[Black Knight (Marvel Comics)|Black Knight]]<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #178 (March 1969)</ref> and [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #179 (April 1969)</ref> and battled the [[X-Men]] foe the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #182 (Sept. 1969)</ref> The changes were unsuccessful and the title was canceled with issue #183 (Nov. 1969). The cancellation was abrupt (there was a "Next Issue" blurb in the last issue), and outstanding storylines were resolved in the titles ''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #22 (Feb. 1970) and ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #126 (April 1970).

===1970s===
Strange's next appearance was in the first three issues of showcase title ''[[Marvel Feature]]'', appearing in both the main storyline detailing the formation of superhero "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and the related back-up story.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #1 (Dec. 1971); ''Marvel Feature'' #2 (March 1972) & ''Marvel Feature'' #3 (June 1972)</ref> The character was showcased in the title ''Marvel Premiere''<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #3 - 14 (July 1972 - March 1974)</ref> with one story marking the debut of another of Strange's recurring foes, the entity [[Shuma-Gorath]]. To stop Shuma-Gorath entering reality, Strange is forced to shut down the Ancient One's mind, which causes his physical death. The Ancient One, however, assures Strange this was a necessary sacrifice and his soul merges with the cosmic entity Eternity. Strange then assumes the title of [[Sorcerer Supreme]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #8 - 10 (May, July & Sept. 1973)</ref>

===1980s - 1990s===
The character's adventures continued in a second ongoing series, ''Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts'', which ran for 81 issues (June 1974 - Feb. 1987). During this period Strange also meets allies [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]]<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #75-81 (Feb. 1986 - Feb. 1987; bi-monthly)</ref> and [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2. #80 (Dec. 1986)</ref> Following the title's cancellation, the character's adventures continued in a second volume of ''Strange Tales'', which was again published in the "split book" format, and shared with street heroes ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]''. The title ran for nineteen issues.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1 - 19 (April 1987 - Oct. 1988)</ref>

Strange again featured in another self-titled series; ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme''. The initial creative team was writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] & [[Randy Emberlin]], with storylines often written as multi-issue arcs. Strange was written as being on the defensive from the first issue, battling a host of [[supernatural]] foes including Dormammu,<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #1-2 (Nov. 1988 & Jan. 1989)</ref> demons [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]]<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #5-8 (July-Oct. 1989)</ref> and encounters with the [[Werewolf By Night]];<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #26-27 (Feb.-March 1991)</ref> [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]];<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #28 (April 1991)</ref> [[Baron Blood]]<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #29-30 (May-June 1991)</ref> and [[Morbius the Living Vampire]].<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #52 (April 1993)</ref> One significant development was Strange's temporary loss of the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the [[Vishanti]], mystical entities that empowered Strange's spells.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #48-49 (Dec. 1992-Jan. 1993)</ref> Despite this and other setbacks, Strange was triumphant and eventually restored to the title.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80 (Aug. 1995)</ref> The series ran for 90 issues (Nov. 1988-June 1996). 

Strange appeared - together with original regulars the Human Torch and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] - in a one-shot publication called ''Strange Tales''.<ref>''Strange Tales'' (Nov. 1994)</ref>

The character features in several [[limited series]], the first being ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones'', with a series of [[spontaneous combustion]]s by criminals instigated by old foe Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange:''The Flight of the Bones'' #1-4 (Feb.-May 1999)</ref> Strange was the [[catalyst]] for the creation of a trio of witches in the self-titled ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]''mini-series <ref>''Witches'' #1-4 (Aug.-Nov. 2004)</ref> and also appeared in the self-titled ''[[Strange (comics)|Strange]]'' mini-series, written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]], with artwork by [[Brandon Peterson]]. The series reimagined the character's origin, allies and enemies in a contemporary setting.<ref>''Strange'' #1-6 (Nov. 2004-Apr, 2005)</ref> A second limited series, ''Doctor Strange: The Oath'', written by [[Brian K Vaughan]] and illustrated by [[Marcos Martin]], focused on Strange's duty as Sorcerer Supreme and the nature of his powers.<ref>''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' #1-5 (Dec. 2006 - April 2007)</ref>

Doctor Strange also appeared in four [[graphic novels]].<ref>'Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa'' (1986); ''Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989); ''Spider-Man / Dr. Strange: The Way To Dusty Death'' (1992) and ''Dr. Strange: What is It that Disturbs You, Stephen?'' (Oct. 1997)</ref> 
 
The character has remained a constant in the Marvel Universe over the decades, appearing on a regular basis in three volumes of the title ''Defenders'';<ref>''Defenders'' #1-152 (Aug. 1972 - Feb. 1986); ''Defenders'' vol. 2, #1-12 (March 2001 - Feb. 2002) & ''Defenders'' vol. 3, #1-5 (Sept. 2005 - Jan. 2006)</ref> ''[[Secret Defenders]]''<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #1-25 (March 1993 - March 1995)</ref> and a limited series focused on the Defenders titled ''The Order''.<ref>''The Order'' #1-6 (April-Sept. 2002)</ref> Strange also featured in all three volumes of the title ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #21(May 1974); #35 (July 1975); #50 (Oct. 1976); #76 (Dec. 1978); #80-81 (April-May 1979); ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2, #8-9 (April-May 1998) & ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3, #3 (Feb. 2005) & #11-13 (Oct.-Nov. 2005)</ref> and other one-off stories in titles ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'';<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #6 (Nov. 1974) & #49 (March 1979)</ref> ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]''<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #5-6 (Nov. 1982 &  Jan. 1983); #8 (May 1983); #21 (July 1985); #41 (Dec. 1988); #49 (Feb. 1990)</ref> and the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''.<ref>''What If?'' #18 (Dec. 1979) & #40 (Aug. 1983)</ref> The character also featured in the first issue of the title ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]'', forming a team of anti-heroes in preparation for the return of [[vampires]] to the Marvel Universe.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1 - 19 (Nov. 1992 - April 1994)</ref>

===2000s===
Strange appears as a supporting character in pivotal stories in 2000s. In ''[[New Avengers]]'' #7 (July 2005), writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] [[retconned]] Marvel history and established that during the [[Kree-Skrull War]],<ref>''Avengers'' #88-97 (June 1971 - March 1972)</ref> several metahumans, including Strange, formed a secret council called the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]] to deal with future threats to Earth.

Strange played a pivotal role at the conclusion of the ''[[House of M]]'' [[miniseries]], as courtesy of his magic several of the mutant [[X-Men]] were able to retain their powers when reality was rewritten.<ref>''House of M'' #1-6 (Aug. 2005 - Jan. 2006)</ref> The "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline — involving the introduction of the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] and a split in the superhero community — found Strange opposed to mandatory registration. He leaves the Illuminati and goes into seclusion in the [[Arctic]] until the issue is resolved.<ref>''Civil War'' #1–7 (July 2006–Jan. 2007)</ref>

The ''[[New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' [[miniseries]] revealed that Strange and the Illuminati took proactive steps to avoid global threats by finding and isolating the [[Infinity Gems]], with Strange taking possession of the [[Soul Gem]] (a condition being that the individuals hide the Gems and never reveal their location to other members).<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #1-5 (Feb. 2007) - Jan. 2008)</ref> When Strange returns from the Arctic he secretly shelters the team the [[New Avengers]], formed after the events of the ''Civil War'', in his residence and assists on several missions.<ref>''New Avengers'' #27 (April 2007)</ref> Strange suffered a setback when his hands were broken during the events of the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, and he resorted to the use of [[Black magic|dark magic]] to try and stop the Hulk.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1-5 (Aug. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref>

Strange's use of dark magic becomes addictive, as he uses it again to repel an attack on his residence by the crime syndicate of the villain [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] (who is in turn backed by Strange's foe Dormammu).<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (Jan. 2008)</ref> After some reflection, Strange seeks out a successor Sorcerer Supreme, and considers several magic-users such as [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]], the [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], and [[Doctor Doom]], while Dormammu attacks Earth in a bid to seize Strange's power. The Avengers aid Strange against Dormammu's minions, with the Eye of Agamotto choosing [[Brother Voodoo]] as Strange's successor.<ref>''New Avengers'' #51-54 (March-Aug. 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Strange is a master magician and was the holder of the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" for many years. The character can use magic to achieve a number of effects, such as [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Energy blasts|energy projection]];<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1974)</ref> [[teleportation]];<ref>''The Defenders'' #13 (May 1974)</ref> [[telepathy]];<ref name="tales110"/> [[astral projection]]<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #1 (Nov. 1988)</ref> and the creation of materials, such as food<ref>''The Defenders''  #18 (Dec. 1974)</ref> and water.<ref>''The Defenders'' #6 (June 1973)</ref> Strange is capable of creating even planet-wide effects, such as a [[Force field|protective shield]].<ref>''Defenders''  #8 (Sep. 1973)</ref> When casting a spell the character is often written to be invoking the name of a mystical entity, such as one of the Vishanti ([[Hoggoth]], [[Oshtur]] and [[Agamotto]]) or the group the [[Octessence]]. These entities usually lend their power to a particular effect, such as the Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak]], that Strange can use to entrap foes.<ref>''The Defenders''  #15 (Sep. 1974)</ref>

Strange was also schooled in the use of dark magic by one-time foe [[Kaluu]], using it to destroy the entity [[Shuma-Gorath]]. The use of this magic, however, is both addictive and corruptive and Kaluu had to [[purge]] the magic from Strange before it could take full effect.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #8-14 (Nov. 1987 - May 1988)</ref>

==Other versions==
Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R. Berns") and [[Jack Kirby]] (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and [[Ph.D.]] with the same [[surname]] (called "Carl Strange"). Making his sole appearance as an early [[Iron Man]] foe, in the ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' story, "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange", the character gained mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #41 (May 1963)</ref>

The character stars in several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] titles: in the limited series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Sir Stephen Strange is both the court [[physician]] and [[magician]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref>''Marvel 1602'' #1-8 (Nov. 2003 - June 2004)</ref> The title ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' introduces a female version of Strange who shares her body with a [[demon]].<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #33 (July 1995)</ref> In the limited series ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' Strange is infected with a [[zombie]] virus with many other heroes;<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #1-5 (Feb.-June 2006)</ref> and reappears in the third installment in the series, ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]''. After being zombified, Strange is only capable of casting two spells.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #1-4 (Dec. 2008 - March 2009)</ref>

In the Marvel [[imprint]] [[MC2]], an alternate universe future, Dr. Strange is no longer the Sorcerer Supreme, the title being passed to "Doc Magnus". Dr. Strange uses his remaining power to reform the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]],<ref>''A-Next'' #3 (Dec. 1998)</ref> and to fight the Norse god of mischief, [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' #4 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] title ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' introduces a version of the character called "Stephen Strange Jr.", the son of the original Doctor Strange.<ref>''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #12 (July 2002)</ref> The character is eventually killed in battle by the Ultimate version of Dormammu during the ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'' storyline.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #1 (Dec. 2008); #2 (Jan. 2009); #3 - 4 (May 2009); #5 (Sep. 2009)</ref>
