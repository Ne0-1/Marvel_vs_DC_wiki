'''Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange''' (known as '''Doctor Strange''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Doctor Strange is a former neurosurgeon, a practicing sorcerer, and serves as the Sorcerer Supreme — the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] of comics, the character has featured in several self-titled series and Marvel-endorsed products including arcade and [[video game]]s; [[animated]] [[television series]]; a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film; and merchandise such as [[trading cards]].

<!--in-universe plot information needs moving into the Fictional character biography section-->

===1960s===
Co-created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], the character debuted in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963),<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 93|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= When Dr. Strange first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #110, it was only clear that he dabbled in black magic and had the ability to project his consciousness into an astral form that could leave his physical body.}}</ref> a split book shared with fellow Marvel character the [[Human Torch (comics)|Human Torch]] until issue #134 (July 1965), and then super-spy [[Nick Fury]] until issue #168 (May 1968). Doctor Strange appeared in issues #110–111 and #114 before the character's eight-page [[origin story]] appeared in #115 (December 1963). The character was inspired by the ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'' radio program which aired on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Ditko drew the feature through ''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966), and during this period he and Lee introduced many of Strange's allies, such as his eventual lover [[Clea]], who debuted (although not initially named) in ''Strange Tales'' #126 (November 1964); and enemies, such as [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in #110, and the flame-headed [[Dormammu]], in #126 (November 1964). ''Doctor Strange'' stories showcased [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly head-trippy visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. Comics historian Mike Benton wrote,
{{quote|The Dr. Strange stories of the 1960s constructed a cohesive [[cosmology]] that would have thrilled any self-respecting [[theosophy|theosophist]]. College students, minds freshly opened by [[psychedelic]] experiences and [[Eastern mysticism]], read Ditko and Lee's Dr. Strange stories with the belief of a recent [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] convert. Meaning was everywhere, and readers analyzed the Dr. Strange stories for their relationship to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] myths, [[Sumerian religion|Sumarian gods]], and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Benton|title=Superhero Comics of the Silver Age: The Illustrated History |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|location=[[Dallas]], [[Texas]]|isbn=978-0-87833-746-0|year=1991|page =63}}</ref>}}

"People who read 'Doctor Strange' thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e., drug users]," recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer [[Roy Thomas]] in 1971, "because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But ... I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do."<ref>{{Cite journal|authorlink=Robin Green (producer)|last=Green |first= Robin| url=http://www.reocities.com/area51/Chamber/8346/rs91.facefront.1.html |title=Face Front!

As co-plotter and later sole plotter, (in the "[[Marvel Method]]"), Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in ''Strange Tales'' #130–146 (March 1965 – July 1966), Ditko introduced the cosmic character [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos.<ref name=st134>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/|title=''Strange Tales'' #134|publisher= [[Grand Comics Database]]}} "Indexer notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (Nov. 1965)."</ref> As historian Bradford W. Wright describes,

{{bquote|Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. Dr. Strange's adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled [[Salvador Dalí]] paintings... Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lee's childhood as well as by contemporary [[Beat Generation|Beat]] culture. Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth counterculture's fascination with Eastern mysticism and [[psychedelia]]. Never among Marvel's more popular or accessible characters, Dr. Strange still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wright|first=Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation: Transformation of a Youth Culture|publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year=2001|isbn=0-8018-7450-5|page=213}}</ref>}}

From the beginning, Doctor Strange used magical artifacts to augment his power, such as the [[Cloak of Levitation]],<ref>The blue "novice" version first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963), with the red "master" version first appearing in ''Strange Tales'' #127 (December 1964).</ref> the [[Eye of Agamotto]],<ref name="ST115">{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= The Origin of Dr. Strange|title= [[Strange Tales]]|issue= 115|date= December 1963}}</ref> the [[Book of the Vishanti]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Return to the Nightmare World!|title= Strange Tales|issue= 116|date= January 1964}}</ref> and the [[Orb of Agamotto]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= The Possessed!|title= Strange Tales|issue= 118|date= March 1964}}</ref> From the first story, Strange's residence, the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], was a part of the character's mythos. Strange's personal servant, [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], introduced in #110 (July 1963), guarded the residence in his absence.

In keeping with Lee's emphasis on continuity, Strange guest starred in ''The [[Fantastic Four]]'' #27 (June 1964) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #2 (1965), and encountered the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], foster brother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], in ''Strange Tales'' #123 (August 1964).

The series continued with Lee dialoging Ditko's plots through ''Strange Tales'' #142, followed by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] (two issues each). [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] artist/writer [[Bill Everett]] succeeded Ditko as artist with issues #147–152, followed by [[Marie Severin]] through #160 and [[Dan Adkins]] through #168, the final issue before the ''Nick Fury'' feature moved to its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name="DeFalco128">DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles...''Strange Tales'' #168 [was followed] by ''Dr. Strange'' #169."</ref>

Lee returned to write the character in ''Strange Tales'' #151–157; followed by Thomas (#158–159); and two writers who did virtually no other Marvel work, Raymond Marais (#160–161) and Jim Lawrence (#162–166). Another cosmic entity, the [[Living Tribunal]], was introduced in issue #157 (June 1967) and the evil [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], sister of Dormammu, in #150 (November 1966).

Expanded to 20 pages per issue, the ''Doctor Strange'' solo series ran 15 issues, #169–183 (June 1968 – November 1969), continuing the numbering of ''Strange Tales''.<ref name="DeFalco128" /><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1863/ ''Doctor Strange''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> Thomas wrote the run of new stories, joined after the first three issues by the art team of [[penciler]] [[Gene Colan]] and [[inker]] [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] through the end. Colan drastically altered the look of the series, as Thomas recounted: "...he had his own view of what these other worlds should look like. Everyone else sort of copied Ditko's versions of those extra dimensions, which were great and wonderful. When Gene came on, he didn't feel a real rapport with that, I guess, so his extra dimensions tended to be just blackness and smoke and things of that sort... Sometimes it was a little strange for a dimension Doc Strange had been to before to look different when drawn by Gene, but nobody complained."<ref>{{cite book |last=Field|first=Tom|title= Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan|year=2005|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |location=Raleigh, North Carolina|isbn= 978-1893905450|pages= 79–80}}</ref> In #177, Thomas and Colan attempted to boost sales by revamping Strange's appearance to more closely resemble those of other superheroes, giving him a form-fitting blue costume, a full-head mask and a [[secret identity]] as '''Dr. Stephen Sanders'''. The cancellation with #183 was abrupt (there was a "Next issue" blurb in the last issue), and outstanding storylines were resolved in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #22 (February 1970) and ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #126 (April 1970).

Thomas recalled in 2000 that he eloped in July 1968 to marry his first wife, Jean, and returned to work a day late from a weekend [[Fan convention|comic book convention]] to find that Marvel production manager [[Sol Brodsky]] had assigned ''Doctor Strange'' to writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], newly ensconced at Marvel and writing ''[[Iron Man]]''. Thomas convinced Brodsky to allow him to continue writing the title. "I got very possessive about ''Doctor Strange''," Thomas recalled. "It wasn't a huge seller, but [by the time it was canceled] we were selling the low 40 percent range of more than 400,000 print run, so it was actually selling a couple hundred thousand copies [but] at the time you needed to sell even more."<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas (interviewer)|title=So You Want a Job, Eh?

In issues #8–10 (May–September 1973), in order to stop Shuma-Gorath from entering our reality, Strange was forced to shut down the Ancient One's mind, causing his mentor's physical death.

[[Stan Lee]], seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but ''a'' god, so as to avoid offending religious readers. The writer and artist concocted a fake [[comic book letter column|letter]] from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to Marvel from Texas; Marvel unwittingly printed the letter, and dropped the retraction order.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/12/22/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-30/|title= Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #30|first= Brian|last= Cronin|date= December 22, 2005|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120204213020/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/12/22/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-30/ |archivedate= January 12, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= December 26, 2008|quote= We cooked up this plot—we wrote a letter from a Reverend Billingsley in Texas, a fictional person, saying that one of the children in his parish brought him the comic book, and he was astounded and thrilled by it, and he said, 'Wow, this is the best comic book I've ever read.' And we signed it 'Reverend so-and-so, Austin Texas'—and when Steve was in Texas, he mailed the letter so it had the proper postmark.

The ''Marvel Premiere'' series segued to the character's second ongoing title, ''Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts'', also known as ''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, which ran 81 issues (June 1974 – February 1987).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2162/ ''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> ''Doctor Strange'' #14 featured a crossover story with ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #44, another series which was being drawn by Gene Colan at the time.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv|penciller= Colan, Gene|inker= Palmer, Tom|story= His Name Is Doctor Strange|title= [[The Tomb of Dracula]]|issue= 44|date= May 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]]|penciller= Colan, Gene|inker= Palmer, Tom|story= The Tomb of Dr. Strange!|title= Doctor Strange|volume= 2|issue= 14|date= May 1976}}</ref><ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: "The great Marvel artist Gene Colan was doing suberb work illustrating both ''Doctor Strange'' and ''The Tomb of Dracula''.

Strange met his allies [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] in #75 (February 1986) and [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]] in #80 (December 1986). The series ended with a cliffhanger as his home, the Sanctum Sanctorum was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses was Doctor Strange's entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker and several spells designed to protect humanity from vampires and the evil serpent god Set would now expire.

The title was discontinued so that the character's adventures could be transferred to another split book format series, ''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1–19 (April 1987 – October 1988), which was shared with street heroes [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. This new Doctor Strange series resolved Strange's quest to reclaim his power and missing artifacts, as well as resurrect the Defenders, who had died in the last issue of that team's title.

Strange was returned to his own series, this time titled ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'', which ran 90 issues (November 1988 – June 1996).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/3645/ ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> The initial creative team was writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] and [[Randy Emberlin]], with storylines often written as multi-issue arcs. Strange lost the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" in issues #48–49 (December 1992 – January 1993) when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the [[Vishanti]], the mystical entities that empower his spells. During this time the series became part of the "[[Midnight Sons#Publication history|Midnight Sons]]" group of Marvel's supernatural comics,<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #60-68</ref> and Doctor Strange found new sources of magical strength in the form of [[chaos magic]],<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80-90</ref> as well as a magic construct he used as a proxy.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #60-75</ref> He would form the Secret Defenders with a rotating roster of heroes,<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 262: "Writer Roy Thomas and penciller Andre Coates created this new series that ran until 1995."</ref> and reunite with the original Defenders. Strange regained his title in ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #80 (Aug. 1995).

Strange appeared—together with original regulars the Human Torch and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]—in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''Strange Tales'' vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1994).

The character was featured in several [[limited series]], the first being ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones'' #1–4 (February–May 1999), with a series of [[spontaneous combustion]]s by criminals instigated by old foe Dormammu. Strange was the [[catalyst]] for the creation of a trio of sorceresses in ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' #1–4 (August–November 2004). The ''Strange'' limited series (November 2004 – July 2005) by writers [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]] updated the character's origin.<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 323: "Scribes J. Michael Straczynski and Samm Barnes, with artist Brandon Peterson, retold Dr. Strange's mystical origin for a new generation of fans in this six-issue limited series."</ref> Another limited series, ''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' #1–5 (December 2006 – April 2007), written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and illustrated by [[Marcos Martin]], focused on Strange's responsibilities as both sorcerer and doctor.

Doctor Strange has appeared in four [[graphic novels]] over the years: ''Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa'' (1986); ''Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment'' (1989); ''Spider-Man/Dr. Strange: The Way to Dusty Death'' (1992); and ''Dr. Strange: What Is It That Disturbs You, Stephen?'' (October 1997).

===2000s===
Strange appeared as a supporting character in the 2000s. In ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #7 (July 2005), writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] [[retconned]] Marvel history and established that in the past, several superhumans, including Strange, formed a secret council called the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] to deal with future threats to Earth. In present-day continuity, during the 2006–2007 company-wide ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline involving the introduction of a federal [[Superhuman Registration Act]], which splits the superhero community, Strange is opposed to mandatory registration and later secretly shelters in his residence the anti-registration splinter group of the Avengers.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Leinil Francis Yu|Yu, Leinil Francis]]|inker= Yu, Leinil Francis|story= Revolution Part One|title= [[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]|issue= 27|date= April 2007}}</ref> Strange then sought out a successor Sorcerer Supreme and after he had considered several magicians such as [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]], the [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], and [[Doctor Doom]], the Eye of Agamotto chose [[Brother Voodoo]].<ref name="NA54">{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Billy Tan|Tan, Billy]]|inker= [[Matt Banning|Banning, Matt]]|story= You shouldn't be here, Jericho|title= The New Avengers|issue= 54|date= August 2009}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}
Doctor Stephen Strange is a brilliant but egotistical [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] who only cares about wealth from his career. However, a car accident damages his hands, shattering the bones. The damage and subsequent healing effectively ends his ability to conduct surgery as he had before, since his hands now tremble uncontrollably. Too proud to take on a teaching job, Strange desperately begins the search for a cure to restore his hands, consulting various doctors, homeopathic treatments and traveling around the world to remote regions for exotic cures, all to no avail.

Having completely exhausted all of his funds and reduced to homelessness, Strange is forced to perform back alley medical procedures for cash. Depressed and still searching for a cure, Strange locates a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] in the [[Himalayas]]. The Ancient One refuses to help Strange because of his selfishness, but senses his good side which he attempts to bring to the surface. He fails, but Strange's goodness does show itself when he discovers the Ancient One's disciple, [[Baron Mordo]], attempting to kill the old man. After Strange selflessly thwarts Mordo, (who becomes Strange's most enduring [[antagonist]]),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 93: "Dr. Strange's archenemy, Baron Mordo, was introduced in ''Strange Tales'' #111."</ref> he is taught the mystic arts.<ref name="ST115" />

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Doctor Strange}}
The character has starred in several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] titles. In the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' #1–8 (November 2003 – June 2004), Sir Stephen Strange is both the court [[physician]] and [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The title ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' introduces a female version of Strange who shares her body with a [[demon]] in issue #33 (July 1995). The miniseries ''[[Strange (comic book)|Strange]]'' #1–6 (November 2004 – April 2005), written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Samm Barnes]], with artwork by [[Brandon Peterson]], reimagined the character's origin, allies and enemies in a contemporary setting.

In the miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' #1–5 (February – June 2006), Strange is infected with a [[zombie]] virus along with many other heroes. He reappears in the second sequel, ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #1–4 (December 2008 – March 2009)

In the alternate future universe of the Marvel [[imprint]] [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Doctor Strange is no longer the Sorcerer Supreme, the title being passed to one Doc Magnus. Doctor Strange uses his remaining power to reform the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in ''A-Next'' #3 (December 1998) and to fight the Norse god of mischief, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], ''Last Hero Standing'' #4 (February 2005).

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] title ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' introduced a version of the character called "Stephen Strange, Jr.", the son of the original Doctor Strange, in ''Ultimate Marvel Team-Up'' #12 (July 2002). The character was killed in battle by the Ultimate Marvel version of Dormammu in the miniseries ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' #1–5 (January – September 2009).

Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R. Berns"), and [[Jack Kirby]] (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] with the same [[surname]] (called "Carl Strange"). Making his sole appearance in the [[Iron Man]] story "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #41 (May 1963), the character gained mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drstrng2.htm|title= Doctor Strange|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= May 11, 2002|publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EpuPbmOL|archivedate= March 3, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 3, 2013}}</ref>
