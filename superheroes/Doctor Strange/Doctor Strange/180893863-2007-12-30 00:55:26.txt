'''Doctor Strange''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Created by writer/editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963). Additionally, the name had been used for [[Doctor Strange#Previous Doctor Strange|a different Marvel character]] two months earlier.

Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange is the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of the Marvel Universe, responsible for defending it from mystic threats. He is a master of the [[magic (paranormal)|mystic arts]], using his abilities to battle evil magicians and other supernatural [[villain]]s. He is also often consulted by other superheroes on supernatural matters.

==Publication history==
After debuting in ''Strange Tales'' #110 and returning in the next issue, the nine- to 10-page feature "Dr. Strange" skipped two issues and then returned permanently with #114 (Nov. 1963). Steve Ditko's [[surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly head-trippy visuals helped make the feature a favorite of 1960s college students, according to accounts.{{fact|date=September 2007}} Ditko, as co-plotter and later sole plotter, in the "[[Marvel Method]]", would eventually take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms that nonetheless remained well-grounded thanks to Stan Lee's reliably humanistic, adventure/[[soap opera]] dialog. Doctor Strange shared the "split book" ''Strange Tales'' with solo adventures of [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Johnny Storm|Human Torch]] (whose feature had begun in issue #101), and, beginning with #135, with its replacement feature, ''[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.

During Ditko's run on the feature, many enduring elements were introduced.  His mentor the [[Ancient One]] and enemy [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] both debuted along with Strange in issue #110, and his nemesis [[Baron Mordo]] debuted in #111.  An even more powerful adversary, the Dread [[Dormammu]], was introduced in #126.  In issue #138, with what historians consider one of modern comics' great moments, Doctor Strange first encountered Ditko's grand and enduring conception of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the personification of the universe, depicted as a majestic silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos. It was a groundbreaking creation at a time before such cosmic conceits were commonplace.

While Lee and Ditko themselves interacted less and less as each went their different creative ways, Ditko took his final bow on the feature in issue #146 (July 1966) with the culmination of Strange's long-running conflict with Dormammu, in which Dormammu takes on Eternity single-handed.

"Doctor Strange" continued to the end of the book's run, when the "Fury" feature was spun off into its own title and ''Strange Tales'' was renamed ''Doctor Strange'' with issue #169 (June 1968). '''Note:''' This is the title as given in the book's postal [[indicia]]; Dr. Strange's various series, confusingly, have changed their cover-logo titles much more so than most series. See the [[Doctor Strange#Bibliography|Bibliography]] for details.

Doctor Strange's first namesake comic book, written by [[Roy Thomas]] with art by [[penciler]] [[Gene Colan]], lasted only until issue #183 (Nov. 1969), by which point Strange had been given, separately, both a new secret/civilian identity as "Dr. Stephen Sanders" and, previously, making that possible, a full-face cowl in an effort to more resemble a Marvel [[superhero]] and help low sales. These changes were unsuccessful and the series was subsequently abandoned. The cancellation was abrupt (there was a "Next Issue" blurb in the last edition), and loose ends were tied up in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #22 (Feb. 1970) and ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #126 (April 1970).

Strange's next appearance was a backup solo tale in the showcase title ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #1 (Dec. 1971) This story not only tied into the issue's lead feature, the creation of the loosely affiliated antihero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], but also led into a new ongoing feature for the sorcerer in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #3-14 (July 1972 - March 1974). This series continued into a solo book generally titled as ''Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts'', which ran 81 issues (June 1974 - Feb. 1987). An acclaimed{{Fact|date=August 2007}} early arc by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and [[penciler]]/co-plotter [[Frank Brunner]], featured the death of Strange's mentor, the [[Ancient One]], followed by a storyline in which Strange witnessed the [[Creation (theology)|Creation]], or re-creation, of the universe. Reflecting that era's trend toward "cosmic" characters and stories &mdash; a trend ironically begun in the Lee-Ditko '60s stories &mdash; this turn away from more traditionally occult, supernatural stories helped propel for 15 years under various teams.

Following this solo title's cancellation, the character continued uninterrupted in ''Strange Tales'' vol. 2, #1-19 (April 1987 - Oct. 1988), appearing in 11-page stories in this "split book" he shared predominantly with the feature "[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]". (The final issue's co-feature was "[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] and [[Mayhem (comics)|Mayhem]]", although the other pair's logo still appeared on the cover.) This in turn was followed directly by Strange's third solo title, generally listed as ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'', which lasted 90 issues (Nov. 1988 - June 1996) Writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artists [[Richard Case]] & [[Randy Emberlin]] were the creative team for the last few issues of the second self-titled comic, the entire ''Strange Tales'' run, and the first few issues of this new solo comic). Doctor Strange also appeared in various [[miniseries]] and two [[graphic novels]], and had major recurring roles both in the 1970s feature and later comic book ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' and the 1990s comic book ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Stephen Vincent Strange was born on [[November 18]], [[1930]]<ref>Biographical dates are taken from ''Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Marvel Knights'', except for Strange's birth month, November, taken from the cover of ''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 1, #176 (Jan. 1969).</ref> in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] to Eugene and Beverly Strange. A few months later, the Stranges move to a farm in [[Nebraska]] where Stephen is brought up alongside his brother Victor (who later became the second [[Baron Blood (comics)#Baron Blood II|Baron Blood]]) and sister Donna. 

Stephen becomes an accomplished, but arrogant, surgeon until he suffers subtle, though profound, neurological damage in an automobile accident in 1963. His hands in particular are no longer able to make the precise, fine movements necessary for surgery, although their overall mobility remains. Unable to continue his profession and too proud to accept subordinate medical assignments, he becomes unemployed and destitute. He is reduced to being a derelict, performing shady medical procedures for little money. Learning of a hermit called the [[Ancient One]] who might possibly cure him, the desperate Strange ventures to the man's isolated [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] abode and asks him for aid. The Ancient One instead offers to take Strange on as an apprentice in the mystic arts. Strange refuses, but cannot leave immediately due to a sudden blizzard.

While staying for the duration of the storm, Strange witnesses the Ancient One's apprentice, [[Baron Mordo]], secretly attack the teacher with mystically summoned skeletons, which the old man easily dispells. Strange, his skepticism eroding, confronts Mordo about the treachery but Mordo responds with restraining spells that keep Strange from warning the Ancient One or attacking Mordo physically. Amazed by these displays of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], alarmed by Mordo, but frustrated by the mystic restraints, Strange undergoes a change of heart. Deciding that the only way to stop Mordo is to learn magic himself in order to challenge Mordo on his terms, Strange accepts the Ancient One's offer.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #115</ref> Pleased by Strange's acceptance for unselfish reasons, the Ancient One removes the mystic restraints, explaining that he is well aware of Mordo's treachery but prefers to keep Mordo close by in order to control and possibly change him. Strange studies magic under the Ancient One for seven years and returns to the [[United States]] in the 1970s.

===Silver Age Strange===
[[Image:ST146.jpg|thumb|right|''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966): Artist Steve Ditko's only Dr. Strange cover<!--confirmed Ditko did both pencils & inks per GCD-->]]
Based in his [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] mansion in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood, Strange uses his new abilities to fight such mystic enemies as recurring nemesis Mordo; the flame-headed otherdimensional ruler [[Dormammu]] (and his sister [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]]), with whom he clashes often; and Strange's first recorded foe upon returning to America, [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]. He also gains a valuable ally in [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], a loyal servant who is part of a line trained to serve the current Sorcerer Supreme.

Doctor Strange encounters such cosmic beings as the [[Living Tribunal]], and the personification of the universe itself, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], as well as numerous superheroes and even, at one [[Times Square]] [[New Year's]] celebration, longtime family friend and author [[Tom Wolfe]] (who allowed his likeness to be used in ''Doctor Strange'' vol. #180, May 1969). On one journey to Dormammu's realm, Strange meets and eventually falls in love with [[Clea]], the tyrant's human-appearing niece.

When the demon Asmodeus briefly impersonates him, Strange dons a superheroic-looking full-face cowl and a "secret identity" as '''Dr. Stephen Sanders''' from vol. 1, #177 through the final issue, #183 (Feb.-Nov. 1969).

===Death of the Ancient One===
When the demonic entity [[Shuma-Gorath]] (first mentioned in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #5, Nov. 1972) tries to cross into the Earth's dimension from within the mind of the Ancient One (#9, July 1973), Strange is forced to sacrifice his mentor in order to save humanity's collective soul (#10, Sept. 1973). After his mentor's death — in which the Ancient One becomes "one with the universe" and a lingering presence — Strange inherits the mantle and power of Sorcerer Supreme of [[Earth]]'s plane. 

After taking his lover Clea as his disciple (''Marvel Premiere'' #12, Nov. 1973), one of his first tasks as Sorcerer Supreme is to confront the personification of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].  After proving himself worthy, Strange is granted the immortality befitting his new role. As Sorcerer Supreme, Dr. Strange is near ageless and immune to dying from natural causes. His predecessor, the Ancient One, had lived for over five centuries.

The Ancient One, much later, fought Dr. Strange in the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'' (March-July 2006). He was depicted as having been condemned to [[Hell]], without a Marvel Universe-continuity explanation.

===Defenders and Nightstalkers===
When fighting the undying ones, Dr. Strange manipulates the Hulk and Namor to assist him in defeating them. When Baron Mordo returns the identity of Stephen Strange to Dr. Strange, Dr. Strange again recruits the [[anti-heroes]] the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] to form the sporadically summoned superhero "non-team", the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. 

In a 1982-83 arc (''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2, #56-62), Strange successfully invokes the "Montesi Formula" that eliminates all [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]] in the Marvel Universe. Though this is considered permanent at the time, in the early 1990s Strange finds it necessary to organize, in Defenders fashion, a group of [[vampire hunter]]s dubbed the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] — [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and the vampiric private detective [[Hannibal King]]. The three are told they have been brought together to fend off [[supernatural]] threats, and only later learn it is in fact to prepare for the weakening of the Montesi Formula and the expected return of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. By the time vampires do indeed come back, throughout various Marvel occult comics in the mid-1990s, Strange has been temporarily usurped as Sorcerer Supreme by the demonic Salome and replaced by his own creation [[Strange (Midnight Sons)|Strange]]. In the Acts of Vengeance, Strange is attacked by the Hobgoblin, Enchantress, Executioner, and Arkon, all who are given the order to kill him. Fortunately, Strange manages to defeat them all.

His position restored shortly afterward, Strange, by the mid-2000s, serves chiefly as a  supporting character to whom Marvel superheroes might turn for matters concerning magic and the supernatural.  Other times, he directly intervenes in crises. In one instance, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] psionic personnel are hunting the [[Dire Wraith]]s with help of [[Rom the Spaceknight]], but are being easily killed by the enemy's wizards. Strange appears of his own accord to give the psionic personnel improved resistance to the attacks.

===Civil War and aftermath===
It is revealed that Doctor Strange has been a member of the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]], a secret alliance of several prominent superheroes, since just after the [[Kree-Skrull War]].<ref>''[[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' #1 (June 2006)</ref> In the final known meeting of the group, Strange vehemently opposes the proposed [[Superhuman Registration Act]], and informs [[Iron Man]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] that they are never to call on him again. Some time later,<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #3 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Wong tells [[Hank Pym]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] that Strange has no intention of supporting the Act and is in seclusion in the Arctic. The government declares Dr. Strange exempt from registration. <ref>''Civil War'' #6 (Jan. 2007)</ref>He is then seen in the North Pole, fasting and meditating. During his meditation, he speaks with [[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]] who asks why he doesn't use his immense power to end the conflict with a wave of his hand. Strange says that a Sorcerer Supreme has no business in mankind's social matters but he will pray for an outcome that will benefit mankind and spill the least amount of blood.  

Following the Civil War, Doctor Strange joins the renegade team [[New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]],<ref>http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=97297</ref> and houses the team in his Sanctum Sanctorum under the guise of a [[Starbucks]] under construction<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/newavengers/meet_the_new.html</ref>. The team's objectives are twofold; they are dedicated to 'saving people the way [they] want to', and finding out who is behind the recent events that have turned the world upside down (The Scarlet Witch's madness, the decision to banish the Hulk, etc.) When the New Avengers go to Japan to retrieve [[Echo (comics)|Maya Lopez]] (who has been killed, resurrected, and brainwashed by [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]] under [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'s leadership) he is stabbed by Maya<ref>''New Avengers'' #30</ref>. He then contacts [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] through the Orb of Agamotto, who helps him release his Astral Form from the Hand's dark magic; he then uses his Astral Form to free Maya from the Hand's brainwashing<ref>''New Avengers'' #31</ref>. After the team has returned to the Sanctum Sanctorum, he casts a spell to reveal the true natures of the team to their teammates, apparently confirming that none of the current New Avengers team are Skrulls<ref>''New Avengers'' #34</ref>. 

===World War Hulk===
{{main|World War Hulk}}
Dr. Strange was among the members of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] who, alarmed at the continuing destruction caused by the Hulk, agreed to exile the Hulk into space. Upon the Hulk's return to Earth, Strange declines [[Iron Man]]'s request to use magic to again banish the Hulk, arguing the Hulk would simply return again. Entering Hulk's mind, Strange attempts to reason with the Bruce Banner persona.  Using this as a distraction, the Hulk crushes Strange's hands. His ability to cast spells hindered, a desperate Strange invokes the highly powerful demon [[Zom]]. In semi-demonic form, Strange successfully battles the Hulk until a mishap with civilians distracts Strange, leading to his defeat and capture.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #3 (Oct. 2007)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
[[Image:DeodatoDrStrange.jpg|thumb|Dr. Strange performing an incantation.  Art by [[Mike Deodato]].]]
 
Dr. Strange is the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth's Universe. He has unparalleled mastery of the mystic arts, which he uses to defend this reality from otherworldly threats. His primary magical patrons are a group of entities known as "the [[Vishanti]]", a trinity of godly beings composed of Agamotto, Hoggoth and Oshtur. He has, on rare occasions, called upon the power of the demon Dormammu, an archnemesis.

Strange holds an M.D. in neurosurgery, although his ability to perform such delicate tasks has been compromised due to his accident. He is also an accomplished martial artist, learning martial arts as part of his training to be a mystic. Because of his long life, he has great skill in strategy and has been the leader of many groups throughout his lifetime.

Dr. Strange's powers are all mystical but take several forms. Main manifestations include:

* Personal abilities — As a result of his mystic training, Dr. Strange is capable of a great many abilities such as [[astral projection]], [[telepathy]], [[hypnotism]], and several others. These are put in a separate category because he seems to perform these functions as a telepath would, not needing to manipulate magic to do it. These abilities can be exhausted through over-use but can be amplified by mystic energy (as against [[Moondragon]]) or the [[Eye of Agamotto]] (done countless times) to afford Strange powerful psychic abilities
* Universal sources — By manipulating the ambient mystical energy of this universe, Dr. Strange can perform a great many functions. Commonly this is seen as energy bolts that range from low power to planet destroying, transmutation, telekinesis, teleportation, protective shields, etc. He uses this mystical energy to cast spells of a near infinite variety. Dr. Strange has also been shown to amass as much wealth/gold as he desires using magic, as he has done to pay debts.
* Divine sources — Dr. Strange can channel the virtually unlimited energy of nigh-omnipotent mystical and non-mystical beings in multiple dimensions (known as Principalities) to empower his spells, as many other sorcerers do. This can take the form of standard spells ("Crimson Bands of Cyttorak") or just stating what he wants to occur and channeling some being to make it happen. This ability to be a conduit to multiversal power sources has given rise to the phrase "Dr. Strange is as powerful as the god he invokes"
* By force of will, Dr. Strange can "take" the power of another entity. This does not require the use of a spell. He uses this ability against [[Captain Universe]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}} as well as against Arioch and [[Shuma-Gorath]] in ''Strange Tales Volume 2''. This is considered [[black magic]] and as such, he rarely employs this. Also, when taking the powers of omnipotent entities, he can absorb their mind and assume their duties and roles in the dimension in which they exist. But, if his will falters, he can lose all sense of self. (He used this in the recent animated movie to defeat Dormammu by draining its power)

In the [[Marvel Universe]] canon, virtually any human is capable of learning and harnessing magic — considered simply another form of energy within continuity — through training; however, each person has a different potential.

Strange's own power is often amplified by the numerous magical artifacts that are in his possession or by artifacts that he uses in the course of his adventures.  The two artifacts he carries with him at all times are the [[Eye of Agamotto]] and the [[Cloak of Levitation]]: 
 
* '''The Eye of Agamotto''' (which resides within the Amulet of Agamotto worn at Dr. Strange's throat) is a powerful and valued artifact that has many functions.  Using the Eye, Strange can see through any [[lie]], deception or [[illusion]], send the eye out at [[light speed]] to intercept and absorb massive amounts of any type of energy and free others who are trapped in their own illusions.  It is often used to amplify his [[mind's eye]], giving [[psychic]] abilities that rival the most powerful of telepaths.  It is also often used to play back an area's past events and open dimensional portals.  When used offensively, no being can withstand its light for long; due to its lethal effect, it is often used as a weapon of last resort. The amulet can only be used by a being with a pure heart and a clean soul.
 
* '''The Cloak of Levitation''' allows him to fly, and responds to his thoughts.  Strange has used it many times as a "third set of hands" to attack a foe when his own body has been incapacitated.  The Cloak is nearly indestructible, often escaping damage during even the most violent confrontations. The cloak has acted independently from Strange as though it has a will of its own. The cloak has been nearly destroyed on at least three occasions: 
:# ''Strange Tales'' vol. 1, #157 — During a battle with Zom at [[Stonehenge]]. Strange was able to reconstruct it in a display of power to prove to The Living Tribunal that Strange was worthy to set right the cosmic events recently unleashed
:# ''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #77 — During a battle with the demon Khat while Strange was in the slow decline of his white-magical powers. The cloak was repaired by Enitharmon the Weaver, the former master of Strange's second apprentice, Rintrah. While the damage to the Cloak on this occasion was not as severe as previously, Strange was unable to repair it himself
:# The third instance is convoluted. During his attempt to garner a new power-base for himself, after foregoing the powers and protections of the Vishanti, Strange went underground to create his new power forge, and when he was finished he was rejuvenated, younger-looking and wearing a new costume (including a mystical black body suit) and he had transformed the Cloak into something more resembling a Kimono or robe (''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3, #76), however, soon he was drafted into the War of the Seven Spheres by the Vishanti. After battling for five thousand years in another dimension, Strange was returned to Earth (at a time mere months from when he was spirited away) a tattered shambles (issue #80). His magical abilities depleted and his new Robe/Cloak shredded. He soon incorporated elements of the cloak into what would be called the "Overcoat of Levitation"; a red [[trench coat]] with the Cloak's gold trim along the collar. He soon returned, however, to his traditional Cloak.

Other artifacts include the Orb of Agamotto, which he uses daily to monitor the surrounding dimensions for trouble; the Wand of Watoomb, which amplifies his power; and the Book of the Vishanti, which contains some of the multiverse's most powerful and secret spells and counter-spells. He owns countless other artifacts he can bring out in times of need. As a result of being a member of the Illuminati, he has also come into possession of the "Soul" gem of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].

For a brief period, research from the Vishanti library led Strange to tap into "catastrophe magic" by invoking a syzygy of all the planets, but this source of magic was limited and he ceased using it specifically as a source of his power.

The mansion where Dr. Strange lives, his Sanctum Sanctorum, is located at 177A [[Bleecker Street]], [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], [[New York]], which in this universe was the actual address of the apartment building in which the series writer at that time actually lived. Strange has imbued the mansion with several spells (mostly protective, some proactive). In the comic, "Steven Sanders" was shown reading a telegram addressed to him there.

==Spell manifestations==
Dr. Strange often conjures specific magical effects for specific purposes. Among them are:

* Bolts of Bedevilment (as an offensive weapon)
* a Conjurer's Cone (to transport an enemy away to another realm)
* The Crimson Bands of Cyttorak (to bind someone)
* The Flames of the Faltine (as an offensive weapon)
* The Images of Ikonn (to create duplicate images of himself or others to confuse an enemy)
* The Light of the All-Seeing Eye of Agamotto (to disperse an assailant's spell, to reveal the truth or to destroy an enemy's actual soul)
* The Shield of the Seraphim (as a protective barrier)
* The Vapors of Valtorr (as an obscuring fog)
* The Winds of Watoomb (as an offensive weapon or transportation)
* Chains of Krakkan (constricts an enemy in strong chains)
* Seven Suns of Cinnibus (an energy blast that is as hot as seven suns)
* A Sorcerer's Sphere (a black-colored bubble that protects the Sorcerer inside, but absorbs all the mystical energy in the surrounding area. This absorbing-process normally takes one hour, but an adept sorcerer can make time go by faster so that it seems only minutes have elapsed.)

===Sorcerous phrases===
Co-creator and longtime original scripter Stan Lee wrote many [[Alliteration|alliterative]] exclamations and incantations that Dr. Strange would utter. Lee and later writers often created characters and storylines based on these casually created phrases:
* "By the Flames of the Faltine!"
* "By the [[Sons of Satannish|Sons]] of [[Satannish]]!"
* "By the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth!"
* "By the Hoary Hand of Hoggoth!"
* "By the Ruby Rings of [[Raggadorr]]!"
* "By the Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak]]!"
* "By the Deathless [[Vishanti]]!"
* "By the Vapors of the [[Vishanti]]!"
* "By the Eye of [[Agamotto]]!"
* "By the Vapors [also: Vipers] of [[Valtorr]]!"
* "By the Images of [[Ikonn]]!"
* "By the Demons of Denak!"
* "By the Fangs of [[Farallah]]!"
* "By the Mystic Moons of Munnopor!"
* "By the Shades of the [[Seraphim]]!"
* "By the Omnipotent Oshtur!"
* "By the fires of [[Ikthalon]]!"
* "By the Wondrous Winds [also: Wand] of Watoomb!"

==Doctor Strange as [[deus ex machina]]==
Marvel editor [[Joe Quesada]] has commented that:
{{cquote|...you can place Dr. Strange in peril but it never really seems like much because at any moment he can cast a spell of crimson bands or what have you and he's out. There are no rules to his universe and from a storytelling perspective that's problematic. When you look at imaginary situations, worlds like the world of ''Toy Story'' or even [[Roger Rabbit]] have rules of their universe clearly defined. Heck in Roger Rabbit it's very clear how to kill a 'toon, so the viewer gets the feeling that the characters can be placed in peril and have their backs placed against the wall. This is exactly what I'm looking for in regards to our magic characters. Rules that govern them. How do you kill Doctor Strange? How do you hurt him?<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/Joechristmas06.htm ''Newsarama'': "Joe Christmas, A Special Holiday Q&A With Joe Quesada" (column), 2006 (n.d.)]</ref>}}

In the Marvel canon, there are no clearly defined limits of what Dr. Strange can or cannot do. The stories themselves contradict one another: Dr. Strange is shown easily altering memories, or having complete mastery over time by either stopping it all together and rewinding it or traveling into the past in one story, then stating that his magic cannot do so in another instance. In some appearances he can stand against something as powerful as the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], and in others he appears defenseless against simple physical attack by another person.

Some writers have ignored canonical evidence that Dr. Strange has enchantments that shield his body from physical harm, and that he virtually does not age and can not die unless under his own terms (having made a deal with the omnipotent being [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] which grants Stephen life as long as he wishes it so), with his predecessor as Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, having lived several centuries.

Dr. Strange is often used as a deus ex machina to stop, prevent or undo many world-altering events that occur in other characters' comic books. Prominent examples include:

*In ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #190-191 (Feb.-March 1985), the wizard [[Kulan Gath]] magically transformed New York City into an approximation of his own ancient time. Everyone, save for Strange and a handful of others, forgot who they were and assumed roles appropriate to such a reality. Strange was held prisoner by Kulan Gath, his flesh warped to prevent him speaking aloud or making mystical gestures. Despite numerous characters dying, the spell was eventually broken and reality was restored by Dr. Strange and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].
*In ''[[Micronauts]]'' #35 (Nov. 1981){{Fact|date=February 2007}}<!--Just need to confirm, since Dr. Strange isn't listed in this issue per GCD and he isn't on the cover. See: [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=35817]-->, Dr. Strange was instrumental in helping the Micronauts defeat ancient demons from Earth's past. As he kept the demons at bay, Commander Arcturus Rann rushed the Keys to the Enigma Force to the tomb of Prince Wayfinder, the creator of the Microverse. After opening the Tomb, Strange and Rann encountered the Sword in the Star, who merged them into a single entity, [[Captain Universe]], in order to save the rapidly deteriorating Space Wall between Earth and the Microverse.
*In the ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' six issue limited series, Dr. Strange recruited the heroes to stop [[Thanos]], was one of the few heroes to survive Thanos' destruction of his opposition, and was responsible for rescuing the few survivors in the final battle against Thanos and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. Strange was one of the few people to remember that these events had occurred.
*In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' {{issue}}, Dr. Strange brought Vance Astro back to the 20th Century where Charlie-27 was about to be murdered by a Badoon Captain named L'Matto. The long-standing battle, which was appearing to be in L'Matto's favor, suddenly went in Vance and Charlie's favour when [[Aleta Ogord]] became the new Starhawk. With Dr. Strange's help, she defeated the Captain Universe-empowered L'Matto and then exorcised the Uni-Power from L'Matto's body and returned with it to the 20th Century; there, they parted ways with Strange, who returned to his studies, while the Uni-Power headed off to find a new host.
*In ''[[House of M]]'' #7-8 (Nov.-Dec. 2005), Dr. Strange and [[Emma Frost]] prevented the [[Scarlet Witch]] from imposing her will on the entire world. Driven insane by her powers, the Witch reverted to the alternate reality she had created but stripped the majority of the world's mutants of their powers. Only a few who were shielded by Dr. Strange's spell and Frost's psychic powers retained their memories of the House of M reality and of what had transpired.
*In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #500, Dr. Strange appeared during an invasion by Dormammu and the Mindless Ones on New York City  Reed Richards of [[The Fantastic Four]] inadvertently released Dormammu from his "prison" by making a gun to send the Mindless Ones back to their dimension. Doctor Strange appeared in time to fight Dormammu and, with the help of [[Spider-Man]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and other heroes, Dormammu and the Mindless Ones were sent back to their dimension. As a result of the dimensional tampering, Baron Mordo was resurrected and after the battle he kidnapped Strange; what happened between this event and Strange's reappearance in the Marvel Universe is thus far unrevealed.

==Major supporting characters, villains, and allies==
===Villains===
[[Image:DitkoDrStrange,Clea,Dormammu.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Dormammu]], [[Clea]] and Dr. Strange, in a ''[[Strange Tales]]'' panel by artist [[Steve Ditko]].]]
*[[Baron Mordo]] — A dark sorcerer and frequent threat.
*[[Dormammu]] — A fallen Faltinian being. When outcast, he chose to take a form of pure mystical energy to maintain most of his Faltine essence.  He took over the Dark Dimension from the [[Mindless Ones]] and consistently tries to expand into other dimensions through conquest. Dormammu is a being of immense power and one of Strange's most frequent foes, perhaps even rightfully called his [[archenemy]].
*[[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] — A fallen Faltine. Sister of Dormammu, she choose to take a lesser and more conventionally human physical form in order to experiment with physical pleasures.  She is the mother of Clea.
*[[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] — Ruler of the dream dimension, father of [[Dreamqueen]] and inspiration for Gaiman's [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Though he is a threat to Strange and to humanity, his existence is necessary, since without Nightmare, humanity would go insane. Appeared in Doctor Strange's debut story in ''Strange Tales'' #110 (July 1963). 
*[[Shuma-Gorath]] — A vastly powerful extradimensional being of chaos magic and the ruler of thousands of realms which ruled the Earth ages ago. Unable to be destroyed, its essence is taken on by its supplanter. Shuma-Gorath crossing over into our dimension would be disastrous, and Doctor Strange has been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to stop it.
*[[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] — The personification of Death in Earth's dimension. It was in Doctor Strange's fight against Death that he proved himself worthy to be Sorcerer Supreme. <!--There is antipathy between Death and Strange since as Sorcerer Supreme Death is not allowed to take him. THIS NEEDS EXPLANATION; Ancient One died, and this article says Strange can be killed--> Death has claimed that when Stephen finally fails in his duty she will take him; however, it is more likely that he will become one with Eternity, as have the Sorcerers Supreme before him.
*[[Satannish]] —  One of the demon rulers of the dead. Strange's duties have occasionally led to conflict with this being.
*[[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] — One of the demon rulers of the dead, originally introduced as a [[Silver Surfer]] foe, but who has since become a major entity in story arcs here and in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' and other Marvel series. Strange's duties have occasionally led to conflict with this being.

"She-Hulk 2") # 20, wherein he helps Stu the Intern return to Earth (since Stu's extensive knowledge of Marvel Comics continuity reminded him that he could find the Ducktor and how he could be returned by the Mystic Mallard).

===Earth-A/Earth-721===
In ''She-Hulk'' v. 2 #21, a non-powered counterpart of Dr. Strange from Earth-A comes to Earth-616 (aka Earth-B) and impersonates the 616 Dr. Strange. The impostor is revealed when he can't think of a rhyme for the word "Cyttorak".

He supports himself as a new-age guru to the rich, powerful and famous, and is seen as celebrity, appearing on television and talk shows. He is known to the public as "Dr. Strange," although he does not hold a medical degree or doctorate. He has bemoaned his lack of knowledge in things mystical and usually, just barely saves the day with one last desperate, untried spell.

==Previous Doctor Strange==
[[Image:TalesOfSuspense41.jpg|thumb|Marvel's first Dr. Strange: ''Tales of Suspense'' #41 (May 1963), cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Sol Brodsky]]]]
Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Stan Lee (editor and story-plotter), [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (scripter, under the [[pseudonym]] "R. Berns") and [[Jack Kirby]] (artist) introduced a criminal scientist and [[Ph.D.]] with the same [[surname]]. This Dr. Strange was one of [[Iron Man]]'s earliest [[antagonists]] in the story "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #41 (May 1963). After gaining mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike, this Dr. Strange established a [[force field (science fiction)|force field]]-protected island base staffed with corrupt scientists and [[mercenaries]]. He attempted world domination but was thwarted by Iron Man and his own estranged daughter, Carla. 

This [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] story was reprinted in ''Marvel Collectors' Item Classics'' #4 (Aug. 1966), the hardcover collection ''Marvel Masterworks: Iron Man from Tales of Suspense Nos. 39-50'', and ''Essential Iron Man Volume 1''.

As well, the publisher [[Nedor Comics]] featured a character known as [[Doc Strange]] in the 1940s.
