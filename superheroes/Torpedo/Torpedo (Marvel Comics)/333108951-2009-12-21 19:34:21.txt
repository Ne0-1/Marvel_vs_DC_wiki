'''Torpedo''' is the name of five [[fictional characters]] that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

== Publication history == 
The first version of the Torpedo - a [[hitman]] sent by a crime boss to [[assassinate]] a witness - appears in the title [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]]. The character is defeated by the hero Daredevil and has yet to reappear.<ref>''Daredevil'' #59 (Dec. 1969)</ref>

The second version was '''Michael Stivak''', a young scientist brought to the [[United States]] by his uncle, [[U.S. Senator]] Eugene Stivak. Asked to design a battlesuit for national defense,  Michael Stivak developed a costume equipped with turbo-jets that could propel the wearer through the air and magnify physical blows.  Learning that his uncle was the leader of the criminal organization the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], Michael Stivak designed an inferior battlesuit for his uncle and secretly developed another suit. Using the title ''Torpedo'', Michael Stivak attempted to destroy the plans for the suit and battles Daredevil, who mistakes him for a criminal. During their battle a building collapses, apparently killing Torpedo.<ref>''Daredevil'' #126 (Oct. 1975)</ref>

The third version, '''Brock Jones''', witnesses the battle between Daredevil and Torpedo and frees the dying Michael Stivak. Stivak explains to Jones the history of the battlesuit, and the latter becomes the new Torpedo. Becoming a minor crimefighter, the Jones Torpedo is attacked by the [[Rocketeers (comics)|Rocketeers]], mercenaries wearing versions of the battlesuit sent by Senator Stivak to retrieve the suit. Torpedo defeats the Rocketeers,<ref>''Daredevil'' #127 (Nov. 1975)</ref> and aids Daredevil when the villain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] frames the hero for [[murder]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #134 (June 1976)</ref>

In the title ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' Senator Stivak sends another squad of Rocketeers to attack the Torpedo, but after several skirmishes the character defeats them, with Stivak dying soon after.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #39 - 40 (Dec. 1977 - Feb. 1978)</ref> Torpedo briefly aids superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]<ref>''Defenders'' #62 - 64 (Aug. - Oct. 1978)</ref> and reappears in the title [[Rom (comics)|Rom]], and it is revealed that the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Dire Wraiths]] instigated the creation of the battlesuit with the intent to use it against Rom. The character allies with Rom and together they battle a squad of Rocketeers.<ref>''Rom'' #21 - 22 (Aug. - Sep. 1981)</ref> The Torpedo acts as the guardian of the town Clairton in Rom's absence,<ref>''Rom'' #23 (Oct. 1981)</ref> and after thinking the Wraith threat ended retires. Jones is then murderered by a group of newly-arrived Wraiths who use [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].<ref>''Rom'' #50 (Jan. 1984)</ref>

The battlesuit is bequeathed to Jones's first cousin Phillip Jeffries, and is found in storage by his son [[Michael Jeffries]]. Michael Jeffries and friend Mickey Musashi share the suit and adopt the codename [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]].<ref>First appearance in ''New Warriors'' #28 (Oct. 1992)</ref>
