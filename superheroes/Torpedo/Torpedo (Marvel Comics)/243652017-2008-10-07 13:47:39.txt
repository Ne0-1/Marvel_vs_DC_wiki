'''Torpedo''' is the name of a number of fictional characters in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Michael Stivak==
Michael Stivak was a young Yugoslavian scientist who had been brought to the United States by his uncle, U.S. Sentaor Eugene Kligger Stivak in order to design a new battlesuit for national defense.  Michael followed a design by the [[Dire Wraiths]], developing a costume equipped with turbo-jets that could propel its wearer through the air like a rocket and greatly increase the power of blows from his fists.  Michael's uncle was a leader of the criminal organization the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]] and was actually in league with the Dire Wraiths, planned to use the suit to attempt to take over the United States.  Angered by this betrayal, Michael had designed a much less powerful battlesuit to present to his uncle.  Michael's uncle learned of the real Torpedo suit, and planned to steal the suit's only existing plans.

Attempting to destroy the plans, Michael was mistaken as a criminal by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].  During the battle, a building collapsed on Michael, fatally injuring him.<ref>Daredevil #126</ref>

==Brock Jones==
Brock Jones was born in [[New York City]].  He was a former professional football player, and later a vice-president at the Delmar Insurance Company.

Jones accidentally stumbled onto a battle between Daredevil and Torpedo, and witnessed the building collapsing onto Torpedo.  Jones frantically dug Torepdo out of the rubble, and Torpedo explained to Jones the history of his suit.  As Torpedo died, Jones felt a responsibility to don the armor and become the new Torpedo, stopping Senator Stivak's plans.  As Torpedo, Jones began a career as a part-time costumed crimefighter.  Senator Stivak was determined to procure the suit and sent a small band of agents known as the [[Rocketeers (comics)|Rocketeers]] to retrieve it.  Torpedo defeated the Rocketeers, and when Senator Stivak died soon after Jones felt the threat had passed.

Jones, however, continued to be harassed by the Rocketeers, and later encountered the [[Dire Wraith]]s, enemies of [[Rom (comics)|Rom]].  Senator Stivak, as an agent of the Dire Wraiths, wanted the Torpedo suit to defeat Rom.  Torpedo helped Rom in his struggles against the Wraiths.  When he thought the threat was over and retired as the Torpedo, a group of Wraiths revealed themselves to him, outnumbering him and killing him.<ref>Rom #50</ref>

Though it was once thought that the suit was destroyed in the ensuing fire that destroyed the Jones' family home, it survived and was eventually given to Mickey Musashi, who became known as [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]].

==Other Torpedoes==
Another character named Torpedo was a costumed underground assassin who worked for [[Crime-Wave]], who died in his first appearance.<ref>''Daredevil'' #58</ref>
