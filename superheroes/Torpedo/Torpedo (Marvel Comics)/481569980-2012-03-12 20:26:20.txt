'''Torpedo''' is the name of five [[fictional characters]] that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history== 
The first version of the Torpedo was not related to subsequent versions and debuted in a one-shot story in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #59 (Dec. 1969).

The second version debuted wearing the Torpedo suit that was to become a feature for successive characters, but also only appeared in one story in ''Daredevil'' #126 (Oct. 1975). The third version, Brock Jones, appeared in ''Daredevil'' #127 (Nov. 1975) and #134 (June 1976) and then starred in a storyline in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #39 - 40 (Dec. 1977 - Feb. 1978). After a guest appearance in ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #62 - 64 (Aug. - Oct. 1978) plot threads from the ''Marvel Premiere'' story were resolved in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #21 - 22 (Aug. - Sept. 1981). After appearing sporadically in the title, the character was killed in ''Rom'' #50 (Jan. 1984).

The battlesuit reappeared in ''[[New Warriors]]'' #28 (Oct. 1992), now shared between two characters under the alias of [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]].

==Fictional character biography==
The first version of the Torpedo is a [[hitman]] sent by a crime boss to [[assassinate]] a witness, but is defeated by the hero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #59 (Dec. 1969)</ref>

The second version is '''Michael Stivak''', a young scientist brought to the [[United States]] by his uncle, [[U.S. Senator]] Eugene Stivak. Asked to design a battlesuit for national defense,  Michael Stivak developed a costume equipped with turbo-jets that could propel the wearer through the air and magnify physical blows.  Learning that his uncle was the leader of the criminal organization the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], Michael Stivak designed an inferior battlesuit for his uncle and secretly developed another suit. Using the alias ''Torpedo'', Michael Stivak attempted to destroy the plans for the suit and battles Daredevil, who mistakes him for a criminal. During their battle a building collapses, apparently killing Torpedo.<ref>''Daredevil'' #126 (Oct. 1975)</ref>

The third version, '''Brock Jones''', witnesses the battle between Daredevil and Torpedo and frees the dying Michael Stivak. Stivak explains to Jones the history of the battlesuit, and the latter becomes the new Torpedo. Becoming a minor crimefighter, the Jones Torpedo is attacked by the [[Rocketeers (comics)|Rocketeers]], mercenaries wearing versions of the battlesuit sent by Senator Stivak to retrieve the suit. Torpedo defeats the Rocketeers,<ref>''Daredevil'' #127 (Nov. 1975)</ref> and aids Daredevil when the villain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] frames the hero for [[murder]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #134 (June 1976)</ref>

Senator Stivak sends another squad of Rocketeers to attack the new Torpedo, but after several skirmishes Jones defeats them (with Stivak dying of a [[heart attack]]).<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #39 - 40 (Dec. 1977 - Feb. 1978)</ref> Torpedo briefly aids superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]<ref>''Defenders'' #62 - 64 (Aug. - Oct. 1978)</ref> and reappears in the town of Clairton as an ally of the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]]. It is revealed that the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Dire Wraiths]] instigated the creation of the battlesuit with the intent to use it against Rom. The Torpedo allies with Rom and together they battle a squad of Rocketeers.<ref>''Rom'' #21 - 22 (Aug. - Sep. 1981)</ref> The Torpedo acts as the guardian of the town Clairton in Rom's absence,<ref>''Rom'' #23 (Oct. 1981)</ref> and after thinking the Wraith threat ended retires. Jones is then murdered by a group of newly-arrived Wraiths who use [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].<ref>''Rom'' #50 (Jan. 1984)</ref>

The battlesuit is bequeathed to Jones's first cousin Phillip Jeffries, and is found in storage by his son [[Michael Jeffries]]. Michael Jeffries and friend Mickey Musashi shared the suit and adopted the codename [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #28 (Oct. 1992)</ref> Michael Jeffries was murdered by the Dire Wraith queen Volx, who was posing as Brock Jones's son Danny (Michael's second cousin).<ref>''New Warriors'' #73</ref>
