==Fictional character biography==
Having experienced a problematic childhood, Jean became a tough, unrelenting police captain for the [[NYPD]]. She notably prefers clothing and cars from the 1930s era. In the course of her work she becomes acquainted with and befriends [[Spider-Man]],{{Issue|date=June 2011}} and becomes one of his staunchest admirers and allies in the NYPD force, who had previously been hostile to him, thanks to the antagonistic editorials of ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'''s [[J. Jonah Jameson]].

Jean is killed by her lover<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #135</ref> Stan Carter, aka [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]].<ref name="death">''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #107</ref> After her death, Spider-Man discovers that she had kept a collection of Spider-Man news clippings (a photo of him with the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] was cut to remove the Black Cat from the image). This implied that her feelings towards him were warmer than she generally indicated, leaving Spider-Man even more dejected.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #108</ref> 

Jean's brother Brian, who was separated from her when she was six months old,<ref name="death"/> is also known as the [[Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|Wraith]]. Upon her death, Brian goes insane, blaming the NYPD for her death. But before he can commence his attack, he is killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #278</ref>

Later, a new Wraith appears, targeting [[Mister Negative]]'s criminal syndicate. The new Wraith, Police Captain Yuri Watanabe, was a close friend of Jean, and uses a mask fabricated by Mysterio to pose as her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663-664</ref>

==Other versions==

===Spider-Man Noir===
''[[Spider-Man Noir]]: Eyes Without A Face'' features Federal Agent Jean De Wolfe, who is trying to track down [[The Crime Master]], and is skeptical of Spider-Man's motives in crimefighting. In keeping with the 1930s setting, this version of De Wolfe is male.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without A Face'' #1-4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, while still tough and unrelenting, her morality is in question, and she is a supporting character in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]].'' Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] changed her name to '''Jeanne De Wolfe'''.

In Captain Jeanne De Wolfe's first appearance she is shown outside a bank being robbed by an impersonator Spider-Man, though her name was written as it was in the regular Marvel Universe (Jean DeWolff). It is this impersonator who killed [[George Stacy|Captain Stacy]], [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy's]] father. Spider-Man arrives and attacks the man, nearly killing the imposter in his rage. However, Spider-Man comes to his senses and instead webs up the imposter and leaves him for the police.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #31-32</ref>

Her next appearance is following a fight between Spider-Man and [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)#Ultimate Gladiator|Gladiator]]. It is this appearance where the spelling used for this version of the character is introduced (Jeanne DeWolfe). She is the first police officer not to shoot Spider-Man on sight, and orders others in her squad not to arrest him.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #60</ref> Spider-Man is pleased to have an ally in official law enforcement, and she continues to help him during the "Hobgoblin" and "Warriors" storylines.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #72-85</ref> However, it is later revealed that Jeanne De Wolfe is employed by Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin]], as a spy to obtain insider information about the actions of the police, Spider-Man and other [[superheroes]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85</ref>

Jeanne De Wolfe was shot and killed by the [[Punisher#Ultimate Marvel|Punisher]]. Afterwards Spider-Man was told that she was in Kingpin's employ, and the rumour was that she was the Kingpin's lover. Fisk was later seen mourning her death, indicating this may indeed be true.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Annual #2</ref>
