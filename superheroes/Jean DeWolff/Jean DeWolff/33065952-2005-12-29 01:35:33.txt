'''Jean DeWolff''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supporting character of the comic [[Spider-Man]]. Having experienced a problematic childhood, she was a tough, unrelenting police captain for the [[NYPD]] and Spider-Man's useful ally. She noteably preferred a [[retro]] style, preferring clothing and cars from the 1930s era.

She was killed by her ex-lover Stan Carter, aka [[Sin-Eater]], in the story arc suitably named "[[The Death of Jean DeWolff]]". When she was killed, Spider-Man discovered that she had been secretly in love with his [[alter ego]], Peter Parker.

==Ultimate Jean DeWolff/ Jeanne De Wolfe==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, she remained essentially unchanged, and is a supporting character in [[Ultimate Spider-Man]]. One important thing changed: writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] changed her name to '''Jeanne De Wolfe'''.

It was recently revealed in [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] that Jean De Wolfe is employed by Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] as a possible spy to obtain insider information about the actions of the police, Spider-Man and other superheroes.
