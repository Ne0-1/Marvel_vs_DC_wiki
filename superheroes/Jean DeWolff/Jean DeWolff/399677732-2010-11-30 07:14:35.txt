==Fictional character biography==
Having experienced a problematic childhood, Jean became a tough, unrelenting police captain for the [[NYPD]]. She notably preferred a [[retro]] style, preferring clothing and cars from the 1930s era. In the course of her work she became acquainted with [[Spider-Man]] and became one of his staunchest admirers and allies in the NYPD force, who had previously been hostile to him, thanks to the antagonistic editiorials of ''Daily Bugle'''s [[J. Jonah Jameson]].

Jean was killed by her ex-lover Stan Carter, aka [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]], in the story arc suitably named "[[The Death of Jean DeWolff]]". After she was killed, Spider-Man discovered that she had kept a collection of photographs of him and of the two of them together (one of them originally featuring the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], had been altered to remove the Cat from the image). This implied that her feelings towards him were warmer than she generally indicated, leaving Spider-Man somewhat dejected.

Jean's brother Brian is also known as the [[Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|Wraith]]. Upon her death, Brian went insane, blaming the NYPD for her death. But before he could commence his attack, he was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Jeanne De Wolfe===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, while still tough and unrelenting, her morality is in question, and she is a supporting character in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]].'' Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] changed her name to '''Jeanne De Wolfe'''.

Captain Jeanne De Wolfe first appeared in Ultimate Spider-Man #31 and #32. She is shown outside a bank being robbed by an impersonator Spider-Man, though her name was written as it was in the regular Marvel Universe (Jean DeWolff). It is this impersonator who killed [[George Stacy|Captain Stacy]], [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy's]] father. Spider-Man arrives and attacks the man, nearly killing the imposter in his rage. However, Spider-Man comes to his senses and instead webs up the imposter and leaves him for the police.

She later appeared in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #60, following a fight between Spider-Man and [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)#Ultimate Gladiator|Gladiator]]. It is this appearance where the spelling used for this version of the character is introduced (Jeanne DeWolfe). She is the first police officer not to shoot Spider-Man on sight, and orders others in her squad not to arrest him. Spider-Man is pleased to have an ally in official law enforcement, and she continues to help him during the "Hobgoblin" and "Warriors" storylines. However, it is revealed in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85, the final part of "Warriors", that Jeanne De Wolfe is employed by Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin]], as a spy to obtain insider information about the actions of the police, Spider-Man and other [[superheroes]].  

In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Annual #2 Jeanne De Wolfe was shot and killed by the [[Punisher#Ultimate Marvel|Punisher]]. Afterwards Spider-Man was told that she was in Kingpin's employ, and the rumour was that she was the Kingpin's lover. Fisk was later seen mourning her death, indicating this may indeed be true.

While no reason is known for the name change, but given that early on Bendis was [[Kenny McFarlane#Character's name|not consistent on Kenny McFarlane's name]], it's possible that the name was a continuity error.{{Citation needed|reason=Is this original research?|date=November 2009}}

===Spider-Man Noir===
''[[Spider-Man Noir]]: Eyes Without A Face'' features Federal Agent Jean De Wolfe, who is trying to track down [[The Crime Master]], and is sceptial of Spider-Man's motives in crimefighting. In keeping with the 1930s setting, this version of De Wolfe is male.

==Other media==
===Television===
* The character Lt. Terri Lee from [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|the Spider Man animated series]] is supposedly based on Jean DeWolff.

* Jean DeWolff appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Irene Bedard]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/29/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Tuesday, January 29, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She is Native American and shown to be partnered with [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Stan Carter]]. Unlike Carter, DeWolff doesn't share her enthusiasm for Spider-Man, and believes him to be a criminal.

===Video games===
* In the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game (on the [[PS3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] versions), DeWolff (now spelled as DeWolfe and voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]) appears as a detective who enlists Spider-Man to help crack down on gun running and crooked cops. The nature of these missions tend to include Spidey taking evidence photos for DeWolfe before fighting. The climax of the DeWolfe arc hints at the building friendship between the two, although she gruffly makes it clear that they're not friends. In the Nintendo DS version, she tells Spider-Man about events involving gangs, including the Apocalypse Gang and the Dragon-tail Brotherhood.
