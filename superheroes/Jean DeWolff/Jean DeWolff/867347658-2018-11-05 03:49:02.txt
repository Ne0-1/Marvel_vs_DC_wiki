'''Jean DeWolff''' is a fictional police detective appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She functions as a supporting character in particular titles featuring [[Spider-Man]].

==Publication history==
Jean DeWolff first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #48-51 (August–November 1976), and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]]. She was one of the few supporting cast members in ''Marvel Team-Up''.<ref name="back44"/>

Comics journalist Jonathan Miller described Jean DeWolff as "a secondary character that could facilitate a sense of continuity [in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''], someone who knew only the costumed side of Peter's personality, and yet had a genuine relationship with him. Hard-edged and no-nonsense, DeWolff usually made her entrance in her vintage [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth, a modern, post-feminist take on the classic tough-guy heroes of [[Dashiell Hammett]] and [[Mickey Spillane]]."<ref name="back44">{{cite journal|last= Miller|first= Jonathan|date= October 2010|title= Spider-Man and Company: The Wide World of Marvel Team-Up|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 39|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Jean DeWolff experienced a problematic childhood, with the rejection she suffered from her father, former Commissioner Phillip DeWolff, her mother's disapproval of Jean following in her father's and later her beloved stepfather, Carl's footsteps as a cop,<ref name="death"/> and the loss of her brother [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Brian DeWolff|Brian]] in the line of police duty. Still determined to make her living with the police force, she became a tough, unrelenting captain for the [[NYPD]] in order to prove to her father that she could survive as a woman in a man's world. She notably preferred clothing and cars from the 1930s era.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #49</ref>

In the course of her work, Jean became acquainted with and befriended [[Spider-Man]] when he and [[Iron Man]] became involved in a serial bombing investigation, which were committed by the still-living Brian under their father's mental control. With their help and the aid of [[Doctor Strange]], Brian was restored and reunited with his sister, while Phillip went to prison.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #48-51</ref> In time, Jean became one of Spider-Man's staunchest admirers and allies in the NYPD force, who had previously been hostile to him, thanks to the antagonistic editorials of ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'''s [[J. Jonah Jameson]].

Jean [[The Death of Jean DeWolff|was eventually killed]] by her lover<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #135</ref> Stan Carter, aka [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]].<ref name="death">''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #107</ref> After her death, Spider-Man discovered that she had kept a collection of Spider-Man news clippings (a photo of him with the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] was cut to remove the Black Cat from the image). This implied that her feelings towards him were warmer than she generally indicated, leaving Spider-Man even more dejected.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #108</ref>

===Legacy===
Upon her death, Jean's brother Brian went insane, blaming the NYPD for her death. But before he could commence his attack on them as the Wraith, he was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #278</ref>

===Faux Return===
Later, a new Wraith appears, targeting [[Mister Negative]]'s criminal syndicate. The new Wraith, [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Yuri Watanabe|Police Captain Yuri Watanabe]], was a close friend of Jean and uses a mask fabricated by Mysterio to pose as her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663-664</ref>

===Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy===
Jean was one of the deceased resurrected as a clone in the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' event. During the final fight, she assists Spider-Man and [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] in stopping the cloned villains from escaping the facility as her body decayed from the Carrion Virus, presumably killing her in the process.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5</ref>

==Other versions==
===Spider-Gwen===
In the ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' reality, DeWolff is partnered with Captain [[Punisher|Frank Castle]] on the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s Special Crimes Task Force.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Jason Latour|penciller = Robbi Rodriguez|inker = Robbi Rodriguez|colorist = Rico Renzi|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Nick Lowe|story = Most Wanted?

===Spider-Man Noir===
''[[Spider-Man Noir]]: Eyes Without A Face'' features Federal Agent Jean De Wolfe, who is trying to track down [[The Crime Master]], and is skeptical of Spider-Man's motives in crimefighting. In keeping with the 1930s setting, this version of De Wolfe is male, as a woman could never have joined the police force.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without A Face'' #1-4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, while still tough and unrelenting, her morality is in question, and she is a supporting character in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]].'' Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] changed her name to '''Jeanne De Wolfe'''.

In Captain Jeanne De Wolfe's first appearance she is shown outside a bank being robbed by an impersonator Spider-Man, though her name was written as it was in the regular Marvel Universe (Jean DeWolff). It is this impersonator who killed [[George Stacy|Captain Stacy]], [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy's]] father. Spider-Man arrives and attacks the man, nearly killing the imposter in his rage. However, Spider-Man comes to his senses and instead webs up the imposter and leaves him for the police.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #31-32</ref>

Her next appearance is following a fight between Spider-Man and [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)#Ultimate Gladiator|Gladiator]]. It is this appearance where the spelling used for this version of the character is introduced (Jeanne DeWolfe). She is the first police officer not to shoot Spider-Man on sight, and orders others in her squad not to arrest him.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #60</ref> Spider-Man is pleased to have an ally in official law enforcement, and she continues to help him during the "Hobgoblin" and "Warriors" storylines.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #72-85</ref> However, it is later revealed that Jeanne De Wolfe is employed by Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin]], as a spy to obtain insider information about the actions of the police, Spider-Man and other [[superheroes]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85</ref>

Jeanne De Wolfe was shot and killed by the [[Punisher#Ultimate Marvel|Punisher]]. Afterwards Spider-Man was told that she was in Kingpin's employ, and the rumour was that she was the Kingpin's lover. Fisk was later seen mourning her death, indicating this may definitely be true.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Annual #2</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Jean DeWolff appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Irene Bedard]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/29/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Tuesday, January 29, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She is Native American and shown to be partnered with [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Stan Carter]] - they are uniformed patrol officers sharing a squad car. Unlike Carter, DeWolff doesn't share his enthusiasm for Spider-Man. Originally if the show was to continue, Jean DeWolff and Stan Carter's characters were to change in where DeWolff, who doesn't respect Spider-Man, comes to be a supportive ally and helps him in his missions while Carter, who has enthusiasm for Spider-Man, loses it when he becomes Sin-Eater. However that plan was never made when [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] canceled the show when [[Disney]] bought them.

===Video games===
* In the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, on the [[PS3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] versions, DeWolff, now spelled as DeWolfe and voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]], appears as a detective who enlists Spider-Man to help crack down on gun running and crooked cops, although she also shares information with him about the [[Luke Carlyle|'Mad Bomber']] case. The nature of these missions tend to include Spidey taking evidence photos for DeWolfe before fighting. The climax of the DeWolfe arc hints at the building friendship between the two, although she gruffly makes it clear that they're not friends. In the [[Nintendo DS]] version, she tells Spider-Man about events involving gangs, including the Apocalypse Gang and the Dragon-tail Brotherhood. In this game, DeWolfe is portrayed as an [[African-American]], while in the Nintendo DS version, she is portrayed with long [[blonde]] hair.
* Jean DeWolff appears in the video game ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Mary Faber]]. While investigating the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], she witnesses them almost killing the hero [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]]. Without thinking or hesitating, Jean kills the Enforcers in self-defense and rescues Speedball. However, Kingpin caught this on camera and bribed Jean to work for him, otherwise he would release the images and it would mean the end of her career as a police officer. Her double life was discovered by befriended reporter [[Ben Urich]] (who mentioned it to the other heroes). After they helped defeat [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], Jean had a change of heart and decided to turn herself in.
* Jean DeWolff being murdered is referenced in a newspaper in ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]''.
* Jean DeWolff appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' voiced by [[Misty Lee]]. Photographs taken of police computers provide Spider-Man with access to her files on various criminal gang leaders active in New York at this time, including [[Mister Negative]], [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and [[Hood (comics)|Hood]].
