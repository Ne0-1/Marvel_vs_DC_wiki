'''Jean DeWolff''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supporting character of the comic [[Spider-Man]]. Having experienced a problematic childhood, she was a tough, unrelenting police captain for the [[NYPD]] and Spider-Man's useful ally. She notably preferred a [[retro]] style, preferring clothing and cars from the 1930s era. 

She was killed by her ex-lover Stan Carter, aka [[Sin-Eater]], in the story arc suitably named "[[The Death of Jean DeWolff]]". When she was killed, Spider-Man discovered that she kept a collection of photographs of him and of the two of them together, implying that her feelings towards him were warmer than she generally indicated.

==Ultimate Jean DeWolff/ Jeanne De Wolfe==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, while still tough and unrelenting, her morality is in question, and she is a supporting character in [[Ultimate Spider-Man]]. One minor change: writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] changed her name to '''Jeanne De Wolfe'''.

It was recently revealed in [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] that Jean De Wolfe is employed by Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] as a possible spy to obtain insider information about the actions of the police, Spider-Man and other superheroes. If true, this makes her a "dirty cop," not the heroine she was in the other continuity.

In the second [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] annual Jean De Wolfe was shot and, presumably, killed by the [[Punisher]]. Afterwards Spider-Man was told that she was in Kingpin's employ, and the rumor was that she slept with the Kingpin. Fisk was later seen mourning her death, indicating this may indeed be true or that the two just had a close relationship.
