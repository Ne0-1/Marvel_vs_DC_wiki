'''Jean DeWolff''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supporting character of the comic [[Spider-Man]]. Having experienced a problematic childhood, she was a tough, unrelenting police captain for the [[NYPD]] and Spider-Man's useful ally. She notably preferred a [[retro]] style, preferring clothing and cars from the 1930s era. 

She was killed by her ex-lover Stan Carter, aka [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]], in the story arc suitably named "[[The Death of Jean DeWolff]]". When she was killed, Spider-Man discovered that she kept a collection of photographs of him (One of them originally featuring the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], had been altered to remove the Cat from the image) and of the two of them together, implying that her feelings towards him were warmer than she generally indicated, leaving Spider-Man somewhat dejected after he searched her apartment.

Jean's brother Brian is also known as the [[Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|Wraith]].

==Ultimate Jeanne De Wolfe==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, while still tough and unrelenting, her morality is in question, and she is a supporting character in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]].'' Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] changed her name to '''Jeanne De Wolfe'''.

Captain Jeanne De Wolfe first appeared in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #60, following a fight between Spider-Man and [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]]. She is the first police officer not to shoot Spider-Man on sight, and orders other her squad not to arrest him. Spider-Man is pleased to have an ally in official law enforcement, and she continues to help him during the "Hobgoblin" and "Warriors" storlines.

However, it is revealed in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85, the final part of "Warriors", that Jeanne De Wolfe is employed by Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], as a spy to obtain insider information about the actions of the police, Spider-Man and other superheroes.  

In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Annual #2 Jeanne De Wolfe was shot and, presumably, killed by the [[Punisher]]. Afterwards Spider-Man was told that she was in Kingpin's employ, and the rumor was that she slept with the Kingpin. Fisk was later seen mourning her death, indicating this may indeed be true or that the two just had a close relationship.

==Other media==

*In the [[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]] video game (on the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC  versions), DeWolff, now spelled as DeWolfe, appears as a detective who enlists Spider-Man to help crack down on gun running and crooked cops. The nature of these missions tend to include Spidey taking evidence photos for DeWolfe before fighting. The climax of the DeWolfe arc hints at the building friendship between the two, although she gruffly makes it clear that they're not friends.

*Jean DeWolff will appear in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.
