'''Vicki Vale''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], a reporter who was the most prominent and longest lasting love interest of Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, [[Batman]].

==In Batman comic books==
===1940s-1960s===
Vicki Vale first appeared in ''Batman'' #49 (Oct/Nov [[1948]]). Her role in the story was very similar to that of [[Lois Lane]]:  she reported on Batman's activities for a newspaper, she was romantically attracted to Batman (and sometimes Bruce Wayne as well), and she repeatedly suspected they were the same person.

Often the plot of a story featuring Vicki Vale revolved around her suspicions regarding Batman's identity. Batman would usually manage to fool her into concluding that he was not really Bruce Wayne by the end of the story, but then her suspicions would reemerge in a later story.

Vicki Vale remained a prominent character in Batman stories from ''Batman'' # 49, in 1948, until ''Detective'' # 320 in October 1963. In 1964, [[Julie Schwartz]] became the editor of the Batman-related comics. Schwartz dropped a number of Batman's [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] backing characters, including Vicki Vale, [[Batwoman]], [[Batgirl#Betty Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Bat-Mite]], and [[Ace the Bat-Hound]].

===1970s-1980s===
Vicki Vale surfaced thirteen years later, in ''Batman Family'' # 11 (June [[1977]]). She was now married: '''Mrs. Vicki Vale Powers'''.  She was also mentioned in ''Batman Family'' #16.  After that, she vanished for another five years.

She returned around [[1982]]. The editor and writer were apparently unaware of her [[1970s]] appearances, so there was no mention of her being married, and it was stated in a footnote that she had not appeared since ''Detective'' # 320.  Supposedly she had been in [[Europe]] for years, but now had returned to [[Gotham City]]. She became Bruce Wayne's romantic interest again, earning the wrath of [[Catwoman]] in ''Batman'' # 355 (Jan [[1983]]). She also had a rivalry for Bruce's affections with Julia Remarque, the daughter of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and Mdme. Marie. (Julia Remarque was wiped from [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] after [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]). 

===1990s onward===
Vicki disappeared from the comics soon after the Crisis, but returned in 1989/1990. She once again began a romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne, but became upset over his frequent absences and left him for another man. 

She eventually became one of the hosts of the television program ''The Scene'', which is similar to ''[[The View]]''.  Her co-hosts included [[Looker (comics)|Lia Briggs]], [[Tawny Young]], and [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]. Two episodes were shown in which they interviewed [[Wonder Woman]] on her career, which was shown in that title comic.

== In other media ==
===Television===
In the pilot episode of the [[NBC]] TV show ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'', [[Morgan Grimes]] refers to [[CIA]] Agent [[Sarah Walker]] as "Vicki Vale" upon seeing her for the first time.  This is in reference to [[Kim Basinger]]'s portrayal, as she shares several general physical characteristics with [[Yvonne Strahovski]], the actress who portrays Sarah Walker.

===Live-action===
In the [[1949 in film|1949]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[Batman and Robin (1948 movie)|Batman and Robin]]'', Vicki Vale was portrayed by [[Poni Adams|Jane Adams]].

Vicki Vale had a prominent role in the [[1989 in film|1989]] film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', in which she was portrayed by [[Kim Basinger]] (a last minute replacement for an injured [[Sean Young]]). Some aspects of this movie's "Vicki Vale" were influenced by [[1970s]] Bruce Wayne girlfriend [[Silver St. Cloud]], such as her hair color ([[blond]]e, instead of Vicki Vale's red), losing her shoes twice in the film and the fact that she learns Batman's [[secret identity|true identity]] and breaks up with him so he can continue being Batman.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Vicki Vale was portrayed as a prize-winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret of the mysterious Batman and inadvertently becomes the object of obsession for the Joker and thus another point of contention between hero and villain.

===Animation===

Vicki Vale appeared in the [[direct-to-video]] film, ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'', portrayed by [[Tara Strong]], and fits her typical role of intrepid reporter/[[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]'s love interest, though this incarnation is a television reporter as opposed to a newspaper reporter. This marked her first appearance in animation.

===Spoof===
''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'' episode [[List of Alvin and the Chipmunks episodes#The Chipmunks Go to the Movies (1990)|"Batmunk"]], which spoofs the movie, features Vicki Vale portrayed by [[The Chipettes|Brittany Miller]]. She goes by the name Nicki Nale.

===Music===
The song "Who's That" on [[Tiga (musician)|Tiga]]'s album [[Sexor]] mentions Vicki Vale.
[[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s song "[[Batdance]]" from the soundtrack of the 1989 film mentions Vale several times.
The song "Aquaman's Lament" by [[Mark Aaron James]] depicts DC Superhero [[Aquaman]] trying to win the affections of Vicki Vale.

==Other versions==
===All-Star Batman and Robin===
Vicki Vale plays the role of a romantic interest for Bruce Wayne in the new series ''[[All Star Batman and Robin]]'', which is written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and drawn by [[Jim Lee]] as part of DC's All Star line of comics. This depiction of Vicki drew some criticism for its very sexualized depiction of her, specifically her introduction in the first issue alone in her apartment wearing nothing but a [[pink]] [[bra]] and equally [[pink]] [[panties]] with high heels.

===The Batman Strikes===
Vicki Vale makes a brief appearance in ''[[The Batman Strikes!]] #15'', which itself is a companion tale of ''The Batman VS Dracula''.
