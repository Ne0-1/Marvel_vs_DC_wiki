Vicki Vale first appeared in ''Batman'' #49 (Oct/Nov 1948).  She remained a prominent character in Batman stories for the next fifteen years.  Her role in the story was very similar to that of [[Lois Lane]]:  she reported on Batman's activities for a newspaper, she was romantically attracted to Batman (and sometimes Bruce Wayne as well), and she repeatedly suspected they were the same person, forcing Batman to fool her into giving up this belief (for a while).

''Detective'' # 320 (Oct [[1963]]) was Vicki's last appearance for a long time.  In [[1964]], new Batman editor [[Julie Schwartz]] dropped a number of Batman's [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] backing characters, including Vicki Vale, [[Batwoman]], [[Batgirl#Betty Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Bat-Mite]], and [[Ace the Bat-Hound]].

Vicki Vale surfaced again in ''Batman Family'' # 11 (June [[1977]]).  She was now married: '''Mrs. Vicki Vale Powers'''.  She was also mentioned in ''Batman Family'' # 16, but then vanished for almost another decade.

She returned around [[1982]].  The editor and writer were apparently unaware of her [[1970s]] appearances, so there was no mention of her being married, and it was stated in a footnote that she had not appeared since ''Detective'' # 320.  Supposedly she had been in [[Europe]] for years, but now had returned to [[Gotham City]].  She became a romantic interest of Bruce Wayne again, earning the wrath of [[Catwoman]] in ''Batman'' # 355 (Jan [[1983]]). She also had a rivalry for Bruce's affections with Julia Remarque, the daughter of Alfred Pennyworth and Mdme. Marie. (Julia Remarque was wiped from continuity after [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]). 

Vicki disappeared from the comics soon after the Crisis, but returned in 1989/1990 after the Batman movie came out. She once again began a romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne, but became upset over his frequent absences and left him for another man. 

She was last seen hosting a television program similar to "The View" with Lia Briggs (aka [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] and [[Tawny Young]]. 

Vicki Vale also plays the role of a romantic interest for Bruce Wayne in the new series All Star Batman and Robin, which is written by [[Frank Miller]] and drawn by [[Jim Lee]] as part of DC's All Star line of comics. This comic is NOT in regular continuity.

In the [[1949 in film|1949]] [[serial]] ''[[Batman and Robin (1948 movie)|Batman and Robin]]'', Vicki Vale was portrayed by [[Poni Adams|Jane Adams]].

Vicki Vale had a prominent role in the [[1989 in film|1989]] film ''[[Batman (1989 movie)|Batman]]'', in which she was portrayed by [[Kim Basinger]]. The movie's "Vicki Vale" is also  based on [[1970s]] Bruce Wayne girlfriend [[Silver St. Cloud]], a name deemed too silly for a movie character. 

Recently, Vicki Vale appeared in the [[direct-to-video]] film, ''[[The Batman Vs. Dracula]]''. She is portrayed by [[Tara Strong]], and fits her typical role of intrepid reporter/[[Bruce Wayne]]'s love interest.

A character very similar to Vicki Vale appeared in [[1992 in television|1992]]'s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in the form of red-haired reporter [[Summer Gleason]], although the connection or reason why Summer Gleason was used in Vicki Vale's place is unknown.
