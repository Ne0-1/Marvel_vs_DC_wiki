'''Victoria "Vicki" Vale''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appears in ''Batman'' #49 (October/November 1948), and was created by [[Bob Kane]] and [[Bill Finger]].

==Fictional character biography==
===1940s-1960s===
Vicki Vale first appeared in ''Batman'' #49 (Oct/Nov 1948), in a 12-page story entitled "Scoop of the Century!", written by [[Bill Finger]], with art by [[Bob Kane]] and [[Lew Schwartz]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=7092 The Grand Comics Database: ''Batman'' #49]. Accessed April 5, 2008</ref> Her look is said to have been modelled by Kane on that of young model Norma Jean Mortensen, who would later become known as [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref>[http://norma-jean-mortensen.blogspot.com/2007/07/trivia.html Norma Jean Mortensen: Trivia]. Accessed April 5, 2008</ref> Mortensen had signed with the Blue Book Modeling Agency in the mid-1940s.<ref>[http://glamournet.com/legends/Marilyn/nj/ "A Model Girl: Norma Jeane"]. Accessed April 5, 2008</ref> Reputedly created to mirror the success of Superman/Clark Kent's reporter colleague and love-interest [[Lois Lane]], her role in the story consisted largely of reporting on Batman's activities for a newspaper (the ''Gotham Gazette'').<ref>[http://www.comicvine.com/vicki-vale/8264/ Comic Vine: Vicki Vale]. Accessed April 5, 2008</ref> She was frequently romantically attracted to Batman (and Bruce Wayne on occasion also), and repeatedly suspected they were the same person.

Often the plot of a story featuring Vicki Vale revolved around her suspicions regarding Batman's identity. Batman would usually manage to fool her into concluding that he was not really Bruce Wayne by the end of the story, but then her suspicions would reemerge in a later story.

Vicki Vale remained a prominent character in Batman stories from ''Batman'' #49, in 1948, until ''Detective'' #320 in October 1963. In 1964, [[Julie Schwartz]] became the editor of the Batman-related comics. Schwartz dropped a number of Batman's [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] backing characters, including Vicki Vale, [[Batwoman]], [[Batgirl#Betty Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Bat-Mite]], and [[Ace the Bat-Hound]].

===1970s-1980s===
Vicki Vale surfaced thirteen years later, in ''Batman Family'' #11 (June 1977). She was now married and known as '''Vicki Vale Powers'''. She was also mentioned in ''Batman Family'' #16.  After that, she vanished for another five years.

She returned around 1982 in ''Batman'' #344 (February 1982). The editor and writer were apparently unaware of her 1970s appearances, so there was no mention of her being married, and it was stated in a footnote that she had not appeared since ''Detective'' #320.  Supposedly she had been in [[Europe]] for years, but now had returned to [[Gotham City]]. She became Bruce Wayne's romantic interest again, earning the wrath of [[Catwoman]] in ''Batman'' #355 (Jan 1983). She also had a rivalry for Bruce's affections with Julia Remarque, the daughter of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and Mdme. Marie. (Julia Remarque was wiped from [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] after ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'').

===1990s onward===
Vicki disappeared from the comics soon after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' rebooted DC continuity, but returned in 1989/1990 in the Grant/Breyfogle era to coincide with the movie release. She once again began a romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne, but became upset over his frequent absences. When hospitalized after an attack by the Ventriloquist and Scarface, Bruce struggles over whether or not to tell her he is Batman, but decides not to, precipitating a break up. Bruce would later regret this when he descends into a brief depression following his defeat at the hands of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]].  

The character appeared again in the [[Wonder Woman]] title as one of the hosts of the television program ''The Scene'' (similar to ''[[The View]]''). Her co-hosts included [[Looker (comics)|Lia Briggs]], Tawny Young, and [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]. Two episodes were shown in which they interviewed [[Wonder Woman]] on her career. In "[[the Black Glove]]" book she wishes Bruce and his new lady Jezebel Jet well on the air, albeit grudgingly and in a somewhat brisk manner.

Vicki shows up (as a blonde) in the first of the 2008 two part story ''[[Two Face]]: Year One''. She interviews a corrupt mob lawyer named Weinstein, who is running for Gotham district attorney against [[Harvey Dent]]. She is also in part two of the story where Two Face confronts Weinstein and [[Bruce Wayne]] at a party in Wayne Manor.

==Other versions==
Vicki Vale plays the role of a romantic interest for Bruce Wayne in the new series ''[[All Star Batman and Robin]]'', which is written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and drawn by [[Jim Lee]] as part of DC's All Star line of comics. This depiction of Vicki drew some criticism[http://girl-wonder.org/girlsreadcomics/?p=13] for its very sexualized depiction of her, specifically her introduction in the first issue alone in her apartment wearing nothing but a pink [[bra]] and [[panties]] with high heels. In the introduction to Miller's ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', Vicki Vale is a gossip reporter who flirts with the judge during a shoplifting trial.
In [[DC: The New Frontier]] the reader sees an article by Vicki Vale.

The character is featured prominently in the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', played by [[Kim Basinger]]. [[Sean Young]] was originally cast as Vicki Vale before being forced to bow out due to an injury. The movie's interpretation of the character is actually a hybrid with 1970s character [[Silver St. Cloud]].{{fact|date=November 2008}} When the movie begins, she has come to Gotham to do a story on Batman, but becomes drawn into the conflict with [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] when the Clown Prince of Crime develops an affection for her. She does not appear but is mentioned in the sequel ''[[Batman Returns]]'', once flippantly when Bruce Wayne chides Alfred for letting her into the Batcave, and again during a conversation between Bruce and [[Catwoman#Batman Returns|Selina Kyle]], where Bruce mentions that she ended the relationship and left because she ultimately couldn't accept his dual life.

===OnStar commercials===
Vicki Vale is also portrayed by [[Texas]]-born ''[[Baywatch]]'' actress [[Brooke Burns]] in "Very Late" (AKA "Hot Date"), one of the [[Batman OnStar commercials|"Batman" OnStar commercials]] that mimicked the look of the 1989 film.<ref>[http://brooke.dark-delusion.net/filmography.php Brooke Burns' filmography]. Accessed April 6, 2008</ref> In the commercial, Batman is fighting [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] and contacts Vicki via [[OnStar]] to tell her that he will be 'very late'.

===''The Batman vs. Dracula''===

Vicki Vale appears in the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. Instead of working for a newspaper, she is portrayed as a television reporter, reporting on the "Lost Ones" — the victims of [[Dracula]] — and is nearly used by Dracula to resurrect his long-dead bride before Batman interrupts the ritual. Vale is also romantically linked to Bruce Wayne, even going as far as to mention the kind of impact the death of his parents could have on him, hinting that she may know he is the Batman. Vale also makes a brief appearance in ''[[The Batman Strikes!]]'' #15, which itself is a companion tale of ''The Batman vs. Dracula''.
