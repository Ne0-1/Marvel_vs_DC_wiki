'''Jonathan Raven''', best known as '''Killraven''', the "'''Warrior of the Worlds'''", is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[freedom fighter]] in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[alternate future]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #18 (May 1973), created by co-plotters [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Neal Adams]], scripter [[Gerry Conway]], and penciller Adams. The series featured the first [[Interracial couple|interracial kiss]] in American color comic books.<ref>One previous interracial kiss occurred not in a color comic book but in [[Warren Publishing]]'s black-and-white comics [[magazine]] ''[[Creepy]]'' #43 (Jan. 1972), in "The Men Who Called Him Monster", by the same writer, Don McGregor, and artist [[Luis Garcia (artist)|Luis Garcia]]</ref>.

==Publishing history==
Co-creator Neal Adams' early ideas for Killraven involved the character being the son of a [[Doc Savage]] [[archetype]].<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/03adams.html ''Comic Book Artist'' #3 (Winter 1999): Neal Adams interview]</ref> This conception had been reworked by the first issue, a multiple-creator goulash in which the two originators and co-plotters turned the scripting over to another writer, and in which artist co-creator Adams [[penciler|penciled]] only the first 11 pages and [[Howard Chaykin]] the remaining nine. The second issue was fully written by the debut's scripter, Gerry Conway, followed in the third by [[Marv Wolfman]].

After this, the book became the province of writer [[Don McGregor]] for an acclaimed run <ref>In addition to contemporaneous reviews in the 1970s, latter-day reviews include: "Don McGregor took over the 'Killraven' writing chores, and was joined soon after by P. Craig Russell. With their combined talents, and the freedom that comes with working on a low-selling book that could be canceled at any moment, the two of them produced a groundbreaking series that explored philosophy, madness, love, violence, and the nature of freedom". ([http://www.feoamante.com/Comics/Reviews/JKL/Kill_Raven.html Christos N. Gage, FeoAmante.com]);  "Though quite a few folks had their hand in the original run back in ''Amazing Adventures'', it was the words-and-pictures team of [[Don McGregor]] and [[P. Craig Russell]] that made my tentacles twitch. ...a classic". ([http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=2868 Michael Sangiacomo, Newsarama.com, Jan. 25, 2003]); "As for Don McGregor, what can be said? At his worst, he could be overwritten and almost incoherent in his pretensions. At his best, he brought to comics like ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' and ''[[Jungle Action]]'' a literary style and philosophical ambition, and a maturity even in Comics Code-approved stuff, that's rarely been matched. He makes [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Alan Moore]] look like...well, like comic book writers". (Critic [http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/study/4273/general5.html "The Masked Bookwyrm"]); "As his work progressed, readers saw [P. Craig Russell] take artistic ownership of 'Killraven'. ... Much like [[Jim Steranko]]'s work on Marvel's ''[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D]]'', events flowed through some pages in a style that was as reminiscent of fine art as it was of comic art. Also impressive was his sense of design. Russell arguably produced some of the most imaginative, and visually horrific, monsters and villains in Marvel's history. Don McGregor handled the writing for this issue-run, and credit must be given to his involved plots, as well as his ability to pack a lot of story into a 32-page pamphlet". ([http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug01/amazingadventures.htm Michael Vance, SciFiDimensions.com, Aug. 17, 2001])</ref>  from #21 (Nov. 1973) to the final issue, #39 (Nov. 1976). Pencillers were [[Herb Trimpe]], [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gene Colan]], and, most prominently, [[P. Craig Russell]] from issue #27 on.

Aside from McGregor, with whom the character became as associated as [[Howard the Duck]] with [[Steve Gerber]] or ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' with [[Marv Wolfman]], other writers include [[Bill Mantlo]] (a fill-in ''Amazing Adventures'' and a ''Marvel Team-Up'' with Killraven and a future-flung [[Spider-Man]]); [[Joseph Michael Linsner|Joe Linsner]] (a 2001 [[Marvel Knights]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''Killraven'', set in 2020 [[New York City]], at odds with the original series' locale by that fictional year); and [[Alan Davis]] (also artist), in a 2002 [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|parallel universe]] miniseries, ''Killraven'' vol. 2.

McGregor and Russell, however, remain the series' signature creative team; more than two decades after the original series end, comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that,
{{cquote| "It was writer Don McGregor who transformed the Killraven saga ... into a classic. Of all of Marvel's writers, McGregor has the most romantic view of heroism. Killraven and his warrior band were also a community of friends and lovers motivated by a poetic vision of freedom and of humanity's potential greatness. McGregor's finest artistic collaborator on the series was P. Craig Russell, whose sensitive, elaborate artwork, evocative of [[Art Nouveau]] illustration, gave the landscape of Killraven's America a nostalgic, pastoral feel, and the Martian architecture the look of futuristic castles.<ref name=sanderson175>Sanderson, Peter. ''Marvel Universe'' (Harry N. Abrams, 1998) ISBN 0810981718, ISBN 978-0810981713, p. 175</ref>}}

In the 2008 ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' series, Killraven is shown to be a member of the original team while set in the future.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===Unrealized projects===
In 2005, writer [[Jim Valentino]] said his aborted plans for the Marvel comic ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' involved Killraven, in his 50s, joining the team and forming an attraction to [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)]]. Valentino said he would have established [[Franklin Richards]] as Killraven's father.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/glakandar/gotw/jimmyvee.htm?200510?200622 Guardians of the Worlds: Archive of Image.com's Jim Valentino annotations, "Jim Valentino's Guardians of the Galaxy Retrospective"]</ref>

Writer [[Robert Kirkman]] and artist [[Rob Liefeld]] said in August 2007 they were creating a five-issue, [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] Killraven [[miniseries]] planned for release in 2008.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070930165318/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005565211.cfm "Kirkman on 'Killraven'"] (archive), WizardUniverse.com (Aug. 10, 2007), by Jim Gibbons and Sean T. Collins. Per Kirkman, "[T]his is really just another Killraven from another universe. The original Killraven is still out there".</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124804 WW Chicago - Robert Kirkman Talks Killraven w/ Liefeld], [[Newsarama]], August 10, 2007</ref> As of late 2009, the series had not materialized.

==Fictional character biography==
On the alternate-future Earth designated [[Earth-691]] by Marvel Comics, the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]] from [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' returned in 2001 for another attempt at conquering the planet. (They were later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] as [[extrasolar planet|extrasolar]] [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] using [[Mars]] as a staging area.) After humanity's enslavement, men not used as breeders or collaborators were trained and forced to battle [[gladiator]]-style for the Martians' amusement; women were used as breeders to supply infants, eaten by the Martians as a delicacy. Jonathan Raven, dubbed Killraven as his gladiatorial ''[[Pseudonym#Nom de guerre|nom de guerre]]'', escaped with the help of the gladiatorial "keeper", but without his brother, '''Deathraven'''. Killraven joined the Freemen, a group of freedom fighters against Martian oppression.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #18 (May 1973)</ref>

The story follows Killraven and his companions from 2018 through 2020 as they travel across the eastern portion of [[North America]], from [[New York City]] to [[Cape Canaveral]] while searching for Killraven's lost brother. Pursued by the [[cyborg]] '''Skar''', the Freemen encounter various victims of Martian [[Transhumanism|transhuman]] experiments, as well as emotionally and psychologically scarred survivors. According to writer McGregor, some story ideas that did not make it into the book before cancellation were explored in his [[graphic novel]] ''[[Sabre (graphic novel)|Sabre]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Killraven was seen alongside his Freemen in most of his adventures and battles. Killraven battled Skarlet and the Sirens in his second appearance.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #19 (July 1973)</ref> He then first encounters Carmilla Frost and Grok, and alongside his Freemen, he battled the Warlord.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #20-21 (Sept. & Nov. 1973)</ref> The Freemen met Mint Julep, and  battled Abraxas, Rattack, the High Overlord, and Skar.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #22-25 (Jan.-July 1974)</ref> Killraven tamed a mutated serpent-horse to use as his mount, and his Freemen battled Pstun-Rage in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] (in this encounter, the antagonists' names are anagrams of the Battle Creek-based [[Kellogg Company]]'s breakfast cereals).<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #26 (Sept. 1974)</ref> The Freeman met Volcana Ash, who helped them battle Atalon and the Death-Breeders.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #27-29 (Nov. 1974 - March 1975)</ref> After learning that his brother Joshua (Deathraven) was still alive,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #30 (May 1975)</ref> and fighting Martian slaves alongside a time-traveling [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #45 (May 1976)</ref> the Freeman reach the [[Everglades]], where they encounter Mourning Prey.<ref>''Amazing Adventures''  #39 (Nov. 1976, the final issue)</ref>

The Freemen encounter Killraven's brother, Deathraven, and discover he has become a Martian collaborator in a sequel [[graphic novel]], ''Killraven, Warrior of the Worlds'' (''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #7, 1983).

===Supporting cast===
Killraven's Freemen allies included his [[African American]] "mud-brother", '''[[M'Shulla]] Scott''', and the feisty scientist '''[[Carmilla Frost]]''', who shared color comic books' earliest known interracial kiss, in issue #31 (July 1975), page nine, final panel; the cynical and bitter [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] '''Hawk'''; the slow-witted strongman '''[[Old Skull (comics)|Old Skull]]'''; the flirty and sensual '''Volcana Ash'''; the human/plant hybrid '''Mint Julep'''; and '''Grok''', the severely damaged apelike clone of Carmilla's father.

==Powers and abilities==
As a youth, Jonathan Raven's physical prowess was heightened thanks to injections of experimental chemicals by Keeper Whitman.  He was later given mental powers through Keeper Whitman's psycho-electric experiments, including the psionic ability to project his consciousness into and take over a Martian's mind, and the psychic ability to resist mental assaults and to mask his presence from robot scanners.

Killraven is also a superb hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled swordsman, wrestler, and martial artist. He is a master of most hand weaponry, especially shuriken. He is a master strategist in guerilla warfare. Killraven possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of human history, art, and science predating the Martian invasion of A.D. 2001, implanted in his mind by Keeper Whitman.

Killraven wears bulletproof fabrics and leather. He is armed with various weapons as needed, and usually carried a sword and [[shuriken]]. He sometimes rides a mutated serpent-horse, or appropriated Martian vehicles and aircraft.
