'''Jonathan Raven''', better known as '''Killraven''', the "'''Warrior of the Worlds'''", is a [[freedom fighter]] in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[alternative future|alternate future]] of the [[fiction]]al [[Marvel Universe]].

==Synopsis==
100 years after failing to conquer Earth, the [[Martian]]s from [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|War of the Worlds]]'' returned in the year [[2001]] and successfully enslaved humanity.  Men not used as breeders or collaborators were trained and forced to battle [[gladiator]]-style for the Martians' amusement.  Killraven escaped and joined the Freemen, a group of freedom fighters against Martian oppression.

The story followed Killraven and his friends from [[2018]] through [[2020]] as they traveled across the eastern portion of [[North America]], from [[New York City]] to [[Cape Canaveral]]. Pursued by the cyborg hunter Skar, they encountered various eccentric people (many the victims of Martian [[Transhumanism|transhuman]] experiments) during their search for Killraven's lost brother.

Notable creators who worked on the series included writer [[Don McGregor]], artists [[Herb Trimpe]], [[Gene Colan]] and [[P. Craig Russell]].

==Cast==
Killraven's Freemen allies included his African-American "mud-brother," '''Mâ€™Shulla Scott''', and the feisty scientist '''Carmilla Frost''' (who shared possibly comics' earliest [[Interracial couple|interracial kiss]]); the cynical and bitter '''Hawk'''; the slow-witted strongman '''Old Skull'''; the Mae West-like '''Volcana Ash'''; the human/plant hybrid '''Mint Julep'''; and '''Grok''', the severely damaged clone of Carmilla's father.  Antagonists included '''Skar''', '''Pstun-Rage''', the '''Death-Breeders''', '''Atalon the Fear Master''', the '''Sacrificer''' and '''Abraxas'''.

Killraven's complete adventures, listed here, were collected in 2005 in ''The Essential Killraven''.

==Other Killravens==
There have been [[multiverse|counterparts]] of Killraven in several stories:

* There is some controversy over whether the Killraven depicted in ''Amazing Adventures'' is the same one shown in the past of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. The matter will likely be addressed in the forthcoming ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005]]''.

* ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' had Killraven as a member of an [[alternative future|alternate future]] [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] led by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

==Movie==
Hollywood trade stories in 2005 reported plans to adapt Killraven, with Marvel and [[Sony Pictures]] in negotations with [[Robert Schenkkan]] to write a script.

==Trivia==
* Neal Adams' early ideas for Killraven involved him being the son of a [[Doc Savage]] [[archetype]].

* Killraven's story has similarities to ''[[Battlefield Earth]]'', with a group of ex-slaves fighting alien oppressors on a conquered Earth.

* Fans regarded [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2005 ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' as a realistic depiction of events in Killraven's world.

* In 2005, [[Jim Valentino]] said that his aborted plans for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' involved Killraven, in his 50s, joining the team and forming an attraction to [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket (II)]].  K.R.'s father would have been revealed as [[Franklin Richards]].
