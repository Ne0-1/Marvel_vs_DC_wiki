'''Jonathan Raven''', best known as '''Killraven''', the "'''Warrior of the Worlds'''", is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[freedom fighter]] in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[alternate future]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #18 (May 1973), created by co-plotters [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Neal Adams]], scripter [[Gerry Conway]], and penciller Adams. The series featured the first [[Interracial couple|interracial kiss]] in American comic books.<ref>One previous interracial kiss occurred not in a color comic book but in [[Warren Publishing]]'s black-and-white comics [[magazine]] ''[[Creepy]]'' #43 (Jan. 1972), in "The Men Who Called Him Monster", by the same writer, Don McGregor, and artist [[Luis Garcia (artist)|Luis Garcia]]</ref>.

==Publishing history==
Co-creator Neal Adams' early ideas for Killraven involved the character being the son of a [[Doc Savage]] [[archetype]].<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/03adams.html ''Comic Book Artist'' #3 (Winter 1999): Neal Adams interview]</ref> This conception had been reworked by the first issue, a multiple-creator goulash in which the two originators and co-plotters turned the scripting over to another writer, and in which artist co-creator Adams [[penciler|penciled]] only the first 11 pages and [[Howard Chaykin]] the remaining nine. The second issue was fully written by the debut's scripter, Gerry Conway, followed in the third by [[Marv Wolfman]].

After this, the book became the province of writer [[Don McGregor]] for an acclaimed run <ref>In addition to contemporaneous reviews in the 1970s, latter-day reviews include: "Don McGregor took over the 'Killraven' writing chores, and was joined soon after by P. Craig Russell. With their combined talents, and the freedom that comes with working on a low-selling book that could be canceled at any moment, the two of them produced a groundbreaking series that explored philosophy, madness, love, violence, and the nature of freedom". ([http://www.feoamante.com/Comics/Reviews/JKL/Kill_Raven.html Christos N. Gage, FeoAmante.com]);  "Though quite a few folks had their hand in the original run back in ''Amazing Adventures'', it was the words-and-pictures team of [[Don McGregor]] and [[P. Craig Russell]] that made my tentacles twitch. ...a classic". ([http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=2868 Michael Sangiacomo, Newsarama.com, Jan. 25, 2003]); "As for Don McGregor, what can be said? At his worst, he could be overwritten and almost incoherent in his pretensions. At his best, he brought to comics like ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' and ''[[Jungle Action]]'' a literary style and philosophical ambition, and a maturity even in Comics Code-approved stuff, that's rarely been matched. He makes [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Alan Moore]] look like...well, like comic book writers". (Critic [http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/study/4273/general5.html "The Masked Bookwyrm"]); "As his work progressed, readers saw [P. Craig Russell] take artistic ownership of 'Killraven'. ... Much like [[Jim Steranko]]'s work on Marvel's ''[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D]]'', events flowed through some pages in a style that was as reminiscent of fine art as it was of comic art. Also impressive was his sense of design. Russell arguably produced some of the most imaginative, and visually horrific, monsters and villains in Marvel's history. Don McGregor handled the writing for this issue-run, and credit must be given to his involved plots, as well as his ability to pack a lot of story into a 32-page pamphlet". ([http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug01/amazingadventures.htm Michael Vance, SciFiDimensions.com, Aug. 17, 2001])</ref>  from #21 (Nov. 1973) to the final issue, #39 (Nov. 1976). Pencillers were [[Herb Trimpe]], [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gene Colan]], and, most prominently, [[P. Craig Russell]] from issue #27 on.

Aside from McGregor, with whom the character became as associated as [[Howard the Duck]] and [[Man-Thing]] with [[Steve Gerber]] or ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' with [[Marv Wolfman]], other writers include [[Bill Mantlo]] (a fill-in ''Amazing Adventures'' and a ''Marvel Team-Up'' with Killraven and a future-flung [[Spider-Man]]); [[Joseph Michael Linsner|Joe Linsner]] (a 2001 [[Marvel Knights]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], set in 2020 [[New York City]], at odds with the original series' locale by that fictional year); and [[Alan Davis]] (also artist), in a 2002 [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|parallel universe]] miniseries.

In 2005, writer [[Jim Valentino]] said his aborted plans for the Marvel comic ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' involved Killraven, in his 50s, joining the team and forming an attraction to [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)]]. Valentino said he would have established [[Franklin Richards]] as Killraven's father.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/glakandar/gotw/jimmyvee.htm?200510?200622 Guardians of the Worlds: Archive of Image.com's Jim Valentino annotations, "Jim Valentino's Guardians of the Galaxy Retrospective"]</ref>

Writer [[Robert Kirkman]] and artist [[Rob Liefeld]] said in August 2007 they were creating a five-issue, [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] Killraven [[miniseries]] planned for release in 2008.<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005565211.cfm WizardUniverse.com (Aug. 10, 2007): "Kirkman on 'Killraven'", by Jim Gibbons and Sean T. Collins]. Per Kirkman, "[T]his is really just another Killraven from another universe. The original Killraven is still out there".</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
On the alternate-future Earth designated [[Earth-691]] by Marvel Comics, the [[Martian]]s from [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' returned in 2001 for another attempt at conquering the planet. (They were later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] as [[extrasolar planet|extrasolar]] [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] using [[Mars]] as a staging area). After humanity's enslavement, men not used as breeders or collaborators were trained and forced to battle [[gladiator]]-style for the Martians' amusement; women were used as breeders to supply infants, eaten by the Martians as a delicacy. Jonathan Raven, dubbed Killraven as his gladiatorial ''[[Pseudonym#Nom de guerre|nom de guerre]]'', escaped with the help of the gladiatorial "keeper", but without his brother, '''Deathraven'''. Killraven joined the Freemen, a group of freedom fighters against Martian oppression.

The story follows Killraven and his companions from 2018 through 2020 as they travel across the eastern portion of [[North America]], from [[New York City]] to [[Cape Canaveral]] while searching for Killraven's lost brother. Pursued by the [[cyborg]] '''Skar''', the Freemen encounter various victims of Martian [[Transhumanism|transhuman]] experiments, as well as emotionally and psychologically scarred survivors. According to writer McGregor, some story ideas that did not make it into the book before cancellation were explored in his [[graphic novel]] ''[[Sabre (graphic novel)|Sabre]]''.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

The Freemen encounter Killraven's brother, Deathraven, and discover he has become a Martian collaborator in a sequel [[graphic novel]], ''Killraven, Warrior of the Worlds'' (''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #7, 1983).

===Supporting cast===

Killraven's Freemen allies included his [[African American]] "mud-brother", '''Mâ€™Shulla Scott''', and the feisty scientist '''Carmilla Frost''', who shared comic books' earliest known interracial kiss, in issue #31 (July 1975), page nine, final panel; the cynical and bitter '''Hawk'''; the slow-witted strongman '''Old Skull'''; the Mae West-like '''Volcana Ash'''; the human/plant hybrid '''Mint Julep'''; and '''Grok''', the severely damaged clone of Carmilla's father.

Antagonists, besides the Martians and Skar, included '''Pstun-Rage''', the '''Death-Breeders''', '''Atalon the Fear Master''', the '''Sacrificer''' and '''Abraxas'''.

==Other versions==
[[Image:Killraven Davis.jpg|thumb|left|''Killraven'' (2002 miniseres) #3. Cover art by Alan Davis.]]
There have been counterparts of Killraven in several stories:

* Following minor controversy among fans whether the Killraven of ''Amazing Adventures'' is the same as that depicted in the past of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005]]'' established that Killraven and the Guardians share the same timeline, christened "Earth-691". The relationship to the mainstream timeline, [[Earth-616]], is unclear.  The ''Handbook'' also established the Killraven of the 2002-2003 miniseries ''[[Earth X|Paradise X]]'' as the "real" (Earth-691) Killraven.

* The 1998-1999 [[miniseries]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' depicts Killraven as a member of an [[alternate future]] [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] (Earth-9930) led by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

* Alan Davis' 2002 miniseries ''Killraven'' (Earth-2120) depicted an alternate-future variation of the original series.

* Killraven is mentioned in the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint. The 2006-2007 ''[[Pete Wisdom|Wisdom]]'' miniseries depicts Jonathan Raven as the son of Pete Wisdom's MI-13 co-worker and lover, Maureen Raven. In the final issue, the Martians traveled interdimensionally to the main Marvel continuity, bringing Maureen to [[London|London, England]] in a plot to kill Jonathan and thus stop him from opposing their possible future invasion. Wisdom is forced to kill Maureen, sending the Martians back to their dimension and saving her son.

==Parodies==
* In Marvel's ''Howard the Duck'' vol. 1, #2 (March 1976), Howard dreamt he was "Killmallard", a freedom fighter battling alien overlords who used tripods identical to those of Killraven's Martian opponents.

==Movie==
[[Hollywood]] trade stories in 2005 reported plans to adapt Killraven for a theatrical [[motion picture]], with Marvel and [[Sony Pictures]] in negotiations with [[Robert Schenkkan]] to write a script.<ref>''[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi]] Magazine'' (Aug. 2005): "Brave New Worlds" (p. 33; side story, "We Are the Worlds")</ref> <ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=175325 Rotten Tomatoes: News: "Sony to Bring Old-School Comic 'Killraven' to the Big Screen"]</ref>
