'''U-Man''' (codename for '''Meranno''') is a [[super-villain]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a frequent adversary of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].

Meranno is a member of the [[homo mermanus]] species, also known as the [[Atlanteans]]. He was banished from Atlantis for treason, after allying with [[Nazi Germany]]. Filled with a burning desire for revenge against Atlantis' ruler, Prince, Namor, Meranno renamed himself '''U-Man''' and joined the Axis Powers to fight Namor and his allies, the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Meranno used Nazi scientific procedures to augment his natural abilities, making himself much stronger than the average Atlantean and enabling himself to survive on the surface for extended periods of time. A Japanese spy called [[Lady Lotus]] used her psychic powers to control Meranno, [[Baron Blood]], and [[Warrior Woman]], and made them into the villainous team known as the [[Super-Axis]].

Later, Meranno allied with another Atlantean malcontent, [[Attuma]], in an attempt to conquer the surface world. He has recently appeared in the new [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] series, along with Warrior Woman.

It was revealed in New Invaders #3 that Meranno raped Lady Lotus and fathered her daughter, Nia.
