'''U-Man''' (codename for '''Meranno''') is a [[super-villain]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a frequent adversary of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].

==Fictional character biography==
Meranno is a member of the ''[[Homo mermanus]]'' species, also known as the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlanteans]]. He was a childhood playmate for Namor but never liked him. Later, he worked as a research scientist in Atlantis' Antarctic facility in the late 1930's. There he allied himself with Nazi Germany. He betrayed the location of Atlantis to the Nazis, who launched an attack. The fleet and the Hall of Sciences were destroyed and the Emperor Thakorr was left in a coma. He was banished from Atlantis for treason. Filled with a burning desire for revenge against Atlantis' ruler, Prince [[Namor]], Meranno renamed himself '''U-Man''' (or, '''Unter-Wasser Mann''') and joined the Axis Powers to fight Namor and his allies, the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Meranno used Nazi scientific procedures to augment his natural abilities, making himself much stronger than the average Atlantean and enabling himself to survive on the surface for extended periods of time. A Japanese spy called [[Lady Lotus]] used her psychic powers to control Meranno, [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]], [[Baron Blood (comics)|Baron Blood]], and [[Warrior Woman]], and made them into the villainous team known as the [[Super-Axis]].

Later, Meranno allied with another Atlantean malcontent, [[Attuma (comics)|Attuma]], in an attempt to conquer the surface world. He has recently appeared in the new Invaders series, along with Warrior Woman.

It was revealed in ''New Invaders'' #3 that Meranno [[rape]]d Lady Lotus and fathered her daughter, [[Nia Noble|Nia]].

==Powers and abilities==
U-Man enjoys the benefits of his Atlantean nature, including complete freedom of movement in the water, increased resistance to injury, and the ability to breathe above and under water. He has superhuman strength and endurance.
