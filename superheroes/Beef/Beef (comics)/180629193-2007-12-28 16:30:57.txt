'''Beef''' ('''Buford Wilson''') is a [[fictional character]] from [[Marvel Comics]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] from the [[Hellions]] group created as the [[antithesis]] to the [[X-Men]]'s junior team of mutants, the [[New Mutants]].  

==Ficitional character biography==
Beef was recruited to the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s junior team of mutants by the villainous [[Emma Frost|White Queen]]. After suffering the loss of [[Warpath (comics)|the second Thunderbird]], Beef was picked up as the Hellions new powerhouse. His first mission, and the only one he appeared as part of, required the Hellions to fight the [[New Warriors]] to vie for the membership of [[Firestar]]. During the initial stages of the fight, Beef was fully willing to kill [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]] and [[Tai (comics)|Tai]], though the latter was most likely immune to any efforts he would have made. Beef fell short of the mark placed on him when he was beaten by the New Warrior [[Namorita]].

Soon after, Emma throws a party which the Hellions, as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team, attended. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]—a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]—crashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group. The Hellions were mere formalities: Beef was killed in the initial onslaught, sent crashing through the [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] window to die on the streets below. The rest of his teammates were drained of their life energies in order to fuel Fitzroy's [[teleportation|teleportation portal]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #281-282 ([[1991]]).

Beef makes a [[postmortem]] appearance in the [[1997]] Annual of ''Generation X''. However, this was just a trick played by the [[demon]] [[D'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.

==Powers and abilities==
Beef's abilities include super strength and stamina, however it is assumed that he did not have the durability of most individuals with super strength, as his death was caused by a fall that others might have survived.
