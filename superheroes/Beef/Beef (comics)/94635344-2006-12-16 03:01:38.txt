'''Beef (Buford Wilson)''' is a [[fictional character]] from [[Marvel Comics]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] from the [[Hellions]] group created as the [[antithesis]] to the [[X-Men]]'s junior team of mutants, the [[New Mutants]].  

==Ficitional character history==
Beef was recruited to the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s junior team of mutants by the villainous [[White Queen]]. After suffering the loss of [[Warpath (comics)|the second Thunderbird]], Beef was picked up as the Hellions new powerhouse. His first mission, and the only one he appeared as part of, required the Hellions to fight the [[New Warriors]] to vie for the membership of [[Firestar]]. However, Beef fell short of the mark placed on him when he was beaten by the New Warrior [[Namorita]].

Soon after, Emma threw a party which the Hellions, as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team, attended. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]—a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]—crashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group. The Hellions were mere formalities: Beef was killed in the initial onslaught, sent crashing through the [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] window to die on the streets below. The rest of his teammates were drained of their life energies in order to fuel Fitzroy's [[teleportation|teleportation portal]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #281-282 ([[1991]]).

==Powers==
Beef's abilities include super strength and stamina, however it is assumed that he did not have the durability of most individuals with super strength, as his death was caused by a fall that others would have survived.

==Notes==
*Beef made a [[postmortem]] appearance in the [[1997]] Annual of ''Generation X''. However, this was just a trick played by the [[demon]] [[D'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.

*His real name was finally revealed in the ''All-New Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe A To Z 05 (2006): Hellions''.
