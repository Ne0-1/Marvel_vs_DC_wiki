'''Beef''' is a mutant from the [[Hellions]] group.  His abilities include super strength and stamina, but he was pretty dumb and tended to be a bully and a jerk.  He was orginally going to replace [[Warpath (comics)|the second Thunderbird]] as the Hellions powerhouse. He fell short of the mark however by losing both of his two battles and dying in the second.
