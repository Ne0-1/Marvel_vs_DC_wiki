==Fictional character biography==
===Marvel beginnings===
Mantis is the half-Vietnamese, half-German daughter of Gustav Brandt—[[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]]—and was born in [[Huế]], [[Vietnam]]. In her childhood, her father leaves her in Vietnam at the Temple of the alien Priests of Pama, a sect of the [[Kree]]. The Kree believe she might become the Celestial Madonna and mate with the eldest [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] on Earth to become the mother of the Celestial Messiah, "the most important being in the universe".

She excels in her [[martial arts]] studies, but when she reaches adulthood, she is [[mind control|mind-wiped]] and sent into the world to gain life experience. She becomes a [[prostitute]] and barmaid in a [[Vietnam]]ese bar, where she meets the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. She helps him regain his self-respect and follows him when the former villain attempts to rejoin the Avengers. She becomes an Avengers ally when the Swordsman rejoins the Avengers, and she battled the Lion God alongside them.<ref>''Avengers'' #114</ref>

With the Avengers, Mantis has many adventures. She battles the original [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], and learns that Libra is her father and that she was raised by the Priests of Pama. She encounters the [[Star Stalker (comics)|Star-Stalker]],<ref>''Avengers'' #120-124</ref> battles [[Thanos]],<ref>''Avengers'' #125 ''Captain Marvel'' #33</ref> [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and [[Solarr]],<ref>''Avengers'' #126</ref> [[Nuklo]],<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1</ref> and then alongside the Avengers, [[Fantastic Four]], and [[Inhumans]], she faces [[Ultron]] at the wedding of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]].<ref>''Avengers'' #127; ''Fantastic Four'' #150</ref>

Mantis becomes taken with the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and—although rejected by the android—neglects the Swordsman. Alongside the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Agatha Harkness]], she was abducted by [[Kang the Conquerer|Kang]]. She was revealed as the Celestial Madonna and witnessed the death of the Swordsman at the hands of Kang, only realizing the depth of her love for the Swordsman just as he dies.<ref>''Avengers'' #129; ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #2</ref> She then buried the Swordsman, and battled the [[Titanic Three]].<ref>''Avengers'' #130-132; ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #3</ref> She would learn the origins of the [[Kree-Skrull War]], the Cotati, and the Priests of Pama.<ref>''Avengers'' #133-135</ref> Mantis then formally joined the Avengers and is revealed to be, indeed, the Celestial Madonna and marries a [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] in the reanimated body of the Swordsman, leaving the Avengers and the Earth to mate with him.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4</ref>

===DC Comics: Willow===
After leaving Marvel Comics, writer Steve Englehart carried Mantis' tale through three other companies before returning to Marvel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny3/docnebula/stainlss02.htm|title=DOING COMICS THE STAINLESS STEVE ENGLEHART WAY:|work=angelfire.com}}</ref>

In [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #142, she appears as '''Willow'''. Asked where she came from, Willow replies, "This one has come from a place she must not name, to reach a place no man must know." (Mantis refers to herself as "this one"). After two issues, she leaves to go give birth.

===Eclipse: Lorelei===
In the [[Eclipse Comics]] series ''Scorpio Rose'' #2 (according to Englehart's website [http://www.steveenglehart.com/]), the character calls herself '''Lorelei'''. By this time, she has given birth to a son. What would have been issue #3, a "lost" Lorelei/Scorpio Rose story, was later published in ''[[Coyote (comics)|Coyote Collection]]'' #1 from [[Image Comics]], the character's fourth company. Lorelei is later name-dropped in Englehart's 2010 novel ''The Long Man'' (page 355, mass market paperback edition).

===Marvel history resumes===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
After she bears her child, [[Sequoia (comics)|Sequoia]],<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/quoimessiah.htm Quoi] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> she takes the name "Mandy Celestine" and lives with him for a year in [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]], [[Connecticut]] before handing him to his father's people and going into space with the [[Silver Surfer]] and battling the [[Elders of the Universe]] alongside the Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4-5</ref> The Silver Surfer finds himself falling in love with Mantis. However, Mantis (whose body was now green and had begun to manifest new powers of invulnerability that allowed her to survive in space due to side-effects of her pregnancy) grows bitter with her life and the way she was forced to abandon her child.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} This comes to a head when Mantis is caught in an explosion and presumed dead by Silver Surfer.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She survives, but the strain of the previous years causes her to literally split into multiple versions of herself, each representing conflicting aspects of her psyche that could no longer co-exist inside her mind.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The fragments arrive on Earth and one version of Mantis rejoins the [[West Coast Avengers]] team, with portions of her memories missing.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} (Steve Englehart intended the storyline involving Mantis and her amnesia to be his next major plotline, but editorial problems caused him to quit the series, with the plotline resolved hastily.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}) Mantis discovers, through the temporarily resurrected corpse of the Swordsman, that her psyche had shattered and that she needs to find her counterparts in order to restore her memories.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She made her way to [[New York City]] where she encountered the [[Fantastic Four]] as they dealt with the effects of the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] storyline.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' 324</ref> Kang pursued Mantis, not realizing she had lost her power and hoping to use her to attack the [[Dreaming Celestial]], and in the process the Surfer was summoned to Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' 323</ref> With the aid of the Cotati, Kang was defeated but Mantis realized she must leave her body and join with the Cotati to raise her son.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' 325</ref>

Aside from mentions by Silver Surfer, Mantis does not reappear until 1995's controversial Avengers crossover story "The Crossing". In "The Crossing", Mantis returns as the villainous bride of Kang the Conqueror with the intention of bringing death to the Avengers; her father Libra (who by now was going by the name "[[Moonraker (comics)|Moonraker]]" as part of [[Force Works]]); and the Cotati alien who had possessed the Swordsman's body and married/impregnated her. Her anger at her father (whom she had [[Vivisection|vivisected]]) and the Cotati center around their "defilement" of her and that she hates the Avengers for believing their manipulative lies.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The storyline was controversial, so much so that Kurt Busiek, in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], [[retcon]]ned the Mantis who appeared in the story as being a [[Space Phantom]] brainwashed into thinking he was Mantis.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}
[[File:Mantisavengers131.jpg|thumb|200px| Mantis in action, taking on a larger, stronger foe with characteristic bravado and self-narration. Art by [[Sal Buscema]] and [[Joe Staton]].]]

Eventually, Mantis reappears in the Steve Englehart written ''[[Avengers: Celestial Quest]]'' limited series. She returns to Earth and merges with her remaining fragmented portions of her personality (which we learn represent "freak, mother, prostitute, mystic, and Avenger") after the first four are killed by [[Thanos]] (later retroactively declared to be a clone of the real Thanos).{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The final Mantis merges with them to become a "complete" Mantis for the first time since her dispersion. Thus reformed, she and a group of the Avengers go into space to stop "Thanos" from killing her son, Quoi, who by this time is a rebellious teenager desperate to leave the isolation of the Cotati home-world and travel the stars. During the adventure, Mantis flirts with Vision (with the implication that she has sex with him), but ultimately ends the flirting when she realizes that he has feelings for his estranged wife Scarlet Witch, who is jealous of Mantis and Vision's friendship. Mantis also appears in the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" storyline, although many occurrences in that storyline are illusions.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Mantis appears in the 2007 miniseries ''[[Annihilation Conquest]]: Star-Lord'', where she is shown as a Kree prisoner who volunteers for a mission led by Peter Quill, a.k.a. [[Star-Lord]].<ref>''[[Annihilation: Conquest]] – Starlord'' #1</ref>

After the defeat of [[Ultron]] and the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], Mantis takes up residence on the [[Knowhere]] station with the rest of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy #1">''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #1</ref> She has assumed the role of counselor for the group, using her knowledge of the mind to maintain a balance with all the very eclectic personalities of the group.<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy #1" />

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, it was discovered that Star-Lord had Mantis use her mental powers to manipulate the members of the Guardians of the Galaxy to join the team against their will. Overhearing Mantis and Star-Lord converse about their deception, [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] shared this knowledge with the rest of the team. This caused most of the members to leave. Mantis was promoted to field status by [[Rocket Raccoon]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 2 #4-6</ref>

Mantis was apparently killed by the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], who, upon anticipating that Mantis would use her mental powers to incapacitate him, struck her and her fellow psionic Cosmo dead with a powerful blast of energy.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #19, December 2009</ref> However, it was revealed that she, along with fellow Guardians [[Phyla-Vell]], Cosmo, [[Gamora]] and [[Vance Astro|Major Victory]] are still alive, but being held prisoner in suspended animation by the Magus.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #22</ref> She reunites with the other team of Guardians, telling Moondragon that Phyla-Vell was the first one killed by Thanos' rampage.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Mantis later rescues [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] from a group of pursuing Spartax soldiers. Though she refuses to join his new incarnation of the Guardians, she helps him track down the source of mysterious "time quakes" that have been plaguing him in the wake of the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' (Vol. 3) #5 (July 2013)</ref>

==Reception==
The character was ranked 99th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 61| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mantis was trained by the Priests of Pama to become a grandmistress of the martial arts, demonstrated as capable of defeating opponents as skilled as [[Captain America]] (although he was distracted while fighting a dragon).<ref name="The Avengers V. I # 114">''The Avengers'' V. I # 114</ref> She could also instinctively sense weak points in an opponent and with her skills in pressure points, knock out beings as powerful as the thunder god, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref name="The Avengers V. I # 114" /><ref>''The Avengers'' V. I # 123</ref> She has only lost in hand to hand martial arts match to [[Moondragon]],<ref name="Fantastic Four Annual Vol. 1, #25 (October 1992)">Fantastic Four Annual Vol. 1, #25 (October 1992)</ref> and her father Libra.{{issue|date=July 2014}}

She has attained a mastery of meditational disciplines, giving her an unusual amount of control over her body, including autonomic functions like heartbeat, bleeding, and breathing, as well as awareness of pain, allowing her to more quickly heal injuries through sheer force of will, and affording almost superhuman reflexes and reactions. She also had psychic empathy, a [[telepathy|telepathic]] power that allowed her to sense the emotions of others.

Mantis gained additional abilities as a result of communion with the Prime Cotati. Her empathic ability enabled her to communicate with the plant-like [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] and with plant life. To travel in space, Mantis had the ability to separate her physical and [[astral projection|astral]] forms, projecting her consciousness from her body, allowing her to travel interplanetary distances. She also had the ability to transfer her astral form to any place where plant life exists. She could form and inhabit a plant like simulacrum of her human body for herself out of the destination planet's local vegetation. Her fighting skills remained intact, and her empathic abilities were heightened to a superhuman degree and extended to the planet’s flora and biosphere. She could control the vegetation within her vicinity.

During her confrontations with a powerful Thanos clone, she displayed superhuman strength, a talent to simultaneously inhabit multiple simulacra, and the ability to project strong blasts of energy, but has not been seen using these powers since.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1-8 (2001)</ref>

As of her appearance in ''Annihilation Conquest: Star-Lord'', Mantis also appears to have gained telepathic and precognitive abilities, and apparently now labors under a constant awareness of future events.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} The source of these new powers is as yet unclear. Other powers displayed or referred to during the series were [[pyrokinesis]], mid-range [[mentat]] training, and invisibility to the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
In the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] reality, the alternate version of Mantis is the woman [[Kang the Conqueror]] loves, and Kang's motive to attack the 20th Century and the Avengers is to show that he is worthy of her love. Mantis recognizes her love for Kang after he is killed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who kills her shortly after.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2-8</ref>

===House of M===
In this reality, Mantis is a member of [[Shang-Chi]]'s Dragons criminal organization, alongside, [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], [[Zaran]], and [[Machete (comics)|Machete]].<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref> Mantis is arrested after the Dragons are ambushed by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s assassins. She and Shang-Chi are two of the three survivors of the group.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #4</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Mantis appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY2R7D_T6XI|title=Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Season 1, Ep. 15 - Clip 1|first=|last=Marvel Entertainment|date=10 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> This version is a member of the Universal Believers. In the episode "Don't Stop Believin'" the Guardians of the Galaxy members Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot encounter Mantis where she takes them through the tunnels beneath the Spartaxian Royal Palace in order to save Star-Lord. They go through various obstacles where Mantis tells them to believe. After the group frees Star-Lord, they end up in the throne room where the Cosmic Seed energy is even after a fight with the robots there and a brief fight with Emperor [[J'son (comics)|J'son]]. When Mantis claims that J'son is a tyrant, she tries to attack him only to be subdued by the Guardians of the Galaxy. While being remanded to the dungeon, Mantis still claims that J'son is a tyrant and that they will eventually believe that fact. In the episode "Lyin' Eyes," Mantis had escaped from the Spartaxian Dungeon and has joined her cult, the Universal Believers's fellow members in a criminal only auction house on Knowhere. While accessing the vault in Knowhere's Sinus Cavity to look for the Pocket Dimension Vial, Rocket Raccoon and Drax the Destroyer run into Mantis who has gained Ebony Maw of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] as the latest member of the Universal Believers. They defeat Rocket Raccoon and Drax the Destroyer and then have the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] dispose of them on a nearby planet. Upon the two of them being rescued by Star-Lord, Gamora, and Groot, Rocket Raccoon and Drax the Destroyer confront Mantis and the rest of the Universal Believers on their flagship that was orbiting another planet. They used a device which converts mental energy into physical energy to aid them in combat. With the help of Rocket Raccoon's lies, the Guardians of the Galaxy cause doubt in the cult's belief and thus removes their powers allowing them to defeat Mantis, Ebony Maw, and the rest of the Universal Believers fanatics. In the episode "Black Helmet Women," Mantis and the Universal Believers were able to steal the sarcophagus from the Guardians of the Galaxy. During a fight on the Universal Flagship, Gamora in the Nova Centurion helmet managed to damage the Universal Believers' ship and the Guardians of the Galaxy make off with the sarcophagus as Mantis and the Universal Believers work to recharge their flagship's engines. In the episode "Me and You and a Dog Named Cosmo," Mantis and Ebony Maw drain Cosmo the Spacedog's energies as part of their plans to disrupt the Rigellian Peace Conference on Nowhere. The Guardians of the Galaxy managed to cause their flagship to crash into Knowhere's cranium. In the episode "Can't Get It Out of My Head," Mantis and the Universal Believers use the advantage of their crashed flagship to turn Knowhere's inhabitants into zombies that obey the Universal Believer's orders where the zombies build a weapon that they will use on Xandar and the sarcophagus. When their plot is thwarted, the Universal Believers' flagship drifts towards Xandar. In the episode "Rock Your Baby," Mantis, Ebony Maw, and the Universal Believers confront the Guardians of the Galaxy and Cosmo when the sarcophagus hatches into a [[Adam Warlock|Warlock]]. With help from Cosmo and Warlock's evolving powers, the Guardians of the Galaxy get away from the Universal Believers. In the episode "Back in Black," it was revealed that Mantis and the Universal Believers had been imprisoned in a secret lab that was run by J'son where is the Universal Believers' patriarch. Upon drawing Sam Alexander to Spartax, she manipulates events that lead to him freeing J'son. In the episode "Knights in Black Helmets," Mantis and J'son take Sam Alexander to a Xandarian spaceship that was in the stomach of a space whale. When it comes to the room where the Nova Centurian Helmets are, Mantis believes she has obtained a true one. When she tries it on, she is turned to stone which then crumbles into dust.

She is depicted as somewhat innocent and naïve, showing no offense when Drax refers to her as Ego's pet or refers to her as being hideous, but swiftly decides to aid the Guardians against Ego when she realizes that Quill's ability to channel Celestial energy will help Ego achieve his goal of 'awakening' other planets from the seeds he has planted in his travels. As the Guardians try to destroy Ego, Mantis is able to buy them time by travelling down to Ego's core and forcing him to sleep while Groot plants a bomb in his brain even though she is knocked unconscious by the debris of the Sovereign ships. At the film's conclusion, Mantis joins the Guardians.

Klementieff will reprise her role in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
