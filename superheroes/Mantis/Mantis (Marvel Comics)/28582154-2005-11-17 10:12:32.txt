'''Mantis''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and former member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She first appeared in "Avengers" vol. 1 #112 (June, [[1973]]). Her creators were writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Don Heck]].

==Character biography==

Mantis is the daughter of Gustav Brandt, [[Libra (comics)|Libra]]. While a child, her father left her with the alien Priests of Pama, who believed that she might become the Celestial Madonna.

She excelled in her studies, but when she reached adulthood, she was mindwiped and sent into the world to gain life experience. She became a [[prostitute]] in a Vietnamese bar, where she met the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. She helped him regain his self-respect, and followed him when the former villain attempted to rejoin the Avengers.

There, she became taken with the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], and - though rejected by the android - neglected the Swordsman until his death at the hands of [[Kang the Conqueror]], only proclaiming her love for him as he died. Shortly afterward, she was revealed to be, indeed, the Celestial Madonna and married a plant in the form of the Swordsman, leaving the Avengers to mate with him.

After she bore her child, Sequoia, she lived with him for a year in a small American town before handing him to his father's people and going into space with the [[Silver Surfer]]. Shortly afterward, she was dispersed in an explosion.

At this point, her history becomes confused, as most of her subsquent appearances were [[retcon]]ned into being only "fragments" of her which were not remembered by most of those who came into contact with them.

Eventually, five fragments of her reformed into five more solid personages, representing five different aspects of her personality - freak, mother, prostitute, mystic and Avenger - and, after four of these were killed by [[Thanos]], the final Mantis was merged with them to become a "complete" Mantis for the first time since her dispersion. Thus reformed, she became briefly involved with the Vision while attempting to save her son from Thanos, before parting on amicable terms.
