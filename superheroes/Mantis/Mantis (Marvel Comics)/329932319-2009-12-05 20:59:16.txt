'''Mantis''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], and former member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She first appeared in ''Avengers'' (volume 1) #112 (June 1973), drawn by [[Don Heck]]. Created by writer [[Steve Englehart]], the character may be unique in the fact that she later appeared (in slightly different name and form) in books published by other comic book companies, moving from Marvel to [[DC Comics|DC]] to [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]] to [[Image Comics|Image]] and finally back to Marvel again.

==Fictional character biography==
===Marvel beginnings===
Mantis is the half-Vietnamese, half-German daughter of Gustav Brandt—[[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]]—and was born in Hue, Vietnam. In her childhood, her father leaves her in Vietnam at the Temple of the alien Priests of Pama, a sect of the [[Kree]]. The Kree believe she might become the Celestial Madonna and mate with the eldest [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] on Earth to become the mother of the Celestial Messiah, "the most important being in the universe."

She excels in her [[martial arts]] studies, but when she reaches adulthood, she is [[brainwashing|mind-wiped]] and sent into the world to gain life experience. She becomes a [[prostitute]] and barmaid in a [[Vietnam]]ese bar, where she meets the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. She helps him regain his self-respect and follows him when the former villain attempts to rejoin the Avengers. She became an Avengers ally when the Swordsman rejoined the Avengers, and she battled the Lion God alongside them.<ref>''Avengers'' #114</ref>

With the Avengers, Mantis battled the original [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], and learned that Libra was her father and that she was raised by the Priests of Pama. With the Avengers she battled the [[Star Stalker (comics)|Star-Stalker]].<ref>''Avengers'' #120-124</ref> Alongside the Avengers, [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]], and [[Drax the Destroyer]], she battled [[Thanos]].<ref>''Avengers'' #125; ''Captain Marvel'' #33</ref> With the Avengers, she then battled [[Klaw]] and [[Solarr]].<ref>''Avengers'' #126</ref> With the Avengers, she then battled [[Nuklo]].<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1</ref> Alongside the Avengers, [[Fantastic Four]], and [[Inhumans]], she battled [[Ultron]] at the wedding of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]].<ref>''Avengers'' #127; ''Fantastic Four'' #150</ref>

While with the Avengers, Mantis becomes taken with the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and — although rejected by the android — neglects the Swordsman. Alongside the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Agatha Harkness]], she was abducted by [[Kang the Conquerer|Kang]]. She was revealed as the Celestial Madonna and witnessed the death of the Swordsman at the hands of Kang the Conqueror, only proclaiming her love for the Swordsman as he dies.<ref>''Avengers'' #129; ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #2</ref> With the Avengers, she then buried the Swordsman, and battled the [[Titanic Three]].<ref>''Avengers'' #130-132; ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #3</ref> Alongside the Avengers, she learned the origins of the Kree-[[Skrull]] War, the Cotati, and the Priests of Pama.<ref>''Avengers'' #133-135</ref> Mantis then formally joined the Avengers and is revealed to be, indeed, the Celestial Madonna and marries a [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] in the reanimated body of the Swordsman, leaving the Avengers and the Earth to mate with him.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4</ref>

===DC Comics: Willow===
After leaving Marvel Comics, writer Steve Englehart carried Mantis's tale through two other companies before returning to Marvel.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/09/15/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-16/ Comics Should Be Good! » Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #16!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/ny3/docnebula/stainlss02.htm Doing Comics The Stainless Steve Englehart Way:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In [[DC Comics]]' ''Justice League of America'' #142, she appears as '''Willow'''. Asked where she came from, Willow replies, "This one has come from a place she must not name, to reach a place no man must know." (Mantis refers to herself as "this one".) After two issues, she leaves to go give birth.

===Eclipse: Lorelei===
In the [[Eclipse Comics]] series ''[[Scorpio Rose]]'' #2 (according to Englehart's website [http://www.steveenglehart.com/]), the character calls herself '''Lorelei'''. By this time, she has given birth to a son. What would have been issue #3, a "lost" Lorelei/Scorpio Rose story, was later published in ''[[Coyote (comics)|Coyote Collection]]'' #1 from [[Image Comics]], the character's fourth company.

===Marvel history resumes===
After she bears her child, Sequoia,<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/quoimessiah.htm Quoi] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> she takes the name "Mandy Celestine" and lives with him for a year in the suburbs of [[Connecticut]] before handing him to his father's people and going into space with the [[Silver Surfer]] and battling the [[Elders of the Universe]] alongside the Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4-5</ref> The Silver Surfer finds himself falling in love with Mantis. But Mantis (whose body was now green and had begun to manifest new powers of invulnerability that allowed her to survive in space due to side-effects of her pregnancy) grows bitter with her life and the way she was forced to abandon her child.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  This comes to a head when Mantis is caught in an explosion and presumed dead by Silver Surfer.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She survives, but the strain of the previous years causes her to literally split into multiple versions of herself, each representing conflicting aspects of her psyche that could no longer co-exist inside her mind.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The fragments arrive on Earth and one version of Mantis rejoins the [[West Coast Avengers]] team, with portions of her memories missing.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} (Steve Englehart intended the storyline involving Mantis and her amnesia to be his next major plotline, but editorial problems caused him to quit the series, with the plotline resolved hastily.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}) Mantis discovers, through the temporarily resurrected corpse of the Swordsman, that her psyche had shattered and that she needs to find her counterparts in order to restore her memories.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She made her way to [[New York City]] where she encountered the [[Fantastic Four]] as they dealt with the effects of [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' 324</ref> Kang pursued Mantis and in the process the Surfer was summoned to Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' 325</ref> With the aid of the Cotati, Kang was defeated but Mantis realized she must leave her body and join with the Cotati to raise her son.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' 327</ref>

Aside from mentions by Silver Surfer, Mantis does not reappear until 1995's controversial Avengers crossover story "[[The Crossing (comics)|The Crossing]]". In "The Crossing", Mantis returns as the villainous bride of Kang the Conqueror with the intention of bringing death to the Avengers; her father [[Libra (comics)|Libra]] (who by now was going by the name "[[Moonraker (comics)|Moonraker]]" as part of [[Force Works]]); and the Cotati alien who had possessed the Swordsman's body and married/impregnated her. Her anger at her father (whom she had [[Vivisection|vivisected]]) and the Cotati center around their "defilement" of her and that she hates the Avengers for believing their manipulative lies.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The storyline was controversial, so much so that Kurt Busiek, in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' [[limited series]], [[retcon]]ned the Mantis who appeared in the story as being a [[Space Phantom]] brainwashed into thinking he was Mantis.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Eventually, Mantis reappears in the Steve Englehart written ''[[Avengers: Celestial Quest]]'' limited series. She returns to Earth and merges with her remaining fragmented portions of her personality (which we learn represent "freak, mother, prostitute, mystic and Avenger") after the first four are killed by [[Thanos]] (later retroactively declared to be a clone of the real Thanos).{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The final Mantis merges with them to become a "complete" Mantis for the first time since her dispersion. Thus reformed, she and a group of the Avengers go into space to stop "Thanos" from killing her son, Quoi, who by this time is a rebellious teenager desperate to leave the isolation of the Cotati home-world and travel the stars. During the adventure, Mantis flirts with Vision (with the implication that she has sex with him), but ultimately ends the flirting when she realizes that he has feelings for his estranged wife Scarlet Witch, who is jealous of Mantis and Vision's friendship. Mantis also appears in "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" storyline, although many occurrences in that storyline are illusions.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Mantis appears in the 2007 mini-series ''[[Annihilation Conquest]]: Star-Lord'', where she is shown as a Kree prisoner who volunteers for a mission led by Peter Quill, a.k.a. [[Star-Lord]].<ref>''[[Annihilation Conquest]]: Star-Lord'' #1</ref>

After the defeat of [[Ultron]] and the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], Mantis takes up residence on the [[Knowhere]] station with the rest of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy #1">''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #1</ref> She has assumed the role of counselor for the group, using her knowledge of the mind to maintain a balance with all the very eclectic personalities of the group.<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy #1"/>

During the [[Secret Invasion]] storyline, it was discovered that Star-Lord had Mantis use her mental powers to manipulate the members of the Guardians of the Galaxy to join the team against their will.  Overhearing Mantis and Star-Lord converse about their deception, [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] shared this knowledge with the rest of the team.  This caused most of the members to leave.  Mantis was promoted to field status by [[Rocket Raccoon]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Mantis was apparently killed by the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], who, upon anticipating that Mantis would use her mental powers to incapacitate him, struck her and her fellow psionic Cosmo dead with a powerful blast of energy.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Issue #19, December 2009</ref> Given Mantis' ability to create new bodies for herself out of plant life across the universe, it is unknown whether or not this is permanent, or merely an inconvenience.

==Powers and abilities==
Mantis was trained by the Priests of Pama to have total control over her body, and had almost superhuman reflexes and reactions, thus making her a mistress of the martial arts as developed by the Priests of Pama.  She could instinctively sense weak points in an opponent and knock out any opponent (even [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]).  She has attained a mastery of meditational disciplines giving her an unusual amount of control over her body, including autonomic functions like heartbeat, bleeding, and breathing, as well as awareness of pain, and the ability to recuperate quickly after being injured.  Her control over her body was so powerful, that if she was injured, she could quickly heal her injuries through sheer force of will. She also had psychic empathy, a [[telepathy|telepathic]] power that allowed her to sense the emotions of others.

Mantis gained additional abilities are a result of communion with the Prime Cotati. Her empathic ability enabled her to communicate with the plant-like Cotati and with plant-life.  To travel in space, Mantis had the ability to separate her physical and [[astral projection|astral]] forms, projecting her consciousness from her body, allowing her to travel interplanetary distances.  She also had the ability to transfer her astral form to any place where plant life exists. She could form and inhabit a plant like simulacrum of her human body for herself out of the destination planet's local vegetation.  Her fighting skills remained intact, and her empathic abilities were heightened to a superhuman degree and extended to the planet’s flora and biosphere.  She could control the vegetation within her vicinity.

During her confrontations with a powerful Thanos clone, she displayed superhuman strength, a talent to simultaneously inhabit multiple simulacrums, and the ability to project strong blasts of energy, but has not been seen using these powers since. As of her appearance in Annihilation Conquest: Star-Lord, Mantis also appears to have gained precognitive abilities, and apparently now labors under a constant awareness of future events. The source of the these new powers is as yet unclear.  Other powers displayed or referred to during the series were [[pyrokinesis]] and invisibility to the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].
