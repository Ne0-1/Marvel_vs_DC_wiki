'''Mercurio the 4-D Man''' (abbreviation of four dimensional - a feature of Mercurio's home world) is a [[fictional]] character that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Mercurio first  appears in ''Thor'' vol. 1, #208 (February 1973).

==Fictional character biography==
Mercurio is a native of the planet Gramos, a world threatened with extinction when a gravitational distortion blocks out all sunlight. In a bid to save Gramos, Mercurio was chosen to project his consciousness across the galaxy to Earth, where he takes control of a wealthy landlord and uses his resources to build a device to siphon off Earth's electro-magnetic field. Mercurio also detects strange energies coming from the offices of Dr. Donald Blake, the alter-ego of the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Witnessing a transformation from Blake to Thor, Mercurio siphons off some of the magical energy in attempt to transport his body across space to Earth. The process is only partially successful as the left side of Mercurio's body is turned blue-black and his normal fire-generating ability is reverted to ice (on the left side only). Mercurio then battles Thor but is quickly defeated. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #214</ref>

Several weeks after returning to Gramos, Mercurio leads an army to find the God Jewel, a gem containing enough energy to sustain Gramos forever. The God Jewel, however, proves to be sentient and evolves into a humanoid form called '''[[Xorr the God-Jewel|Xorr]]''', and is capable of sucking the life energy from any source. Coincidentally, Thor and several allies are also seeking the God Jewel as it has imprisoned two [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] goddesses. With Thor's help Xorr is defeated, and Mercurio retrieves several fragments of the God Jewel for use on Gramos. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #214 - 216</ref>

Although Gramos is saved, Mercurio develops a desire to conquer, and attempts to trick [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] into visiting Gramos and building the '''Omni-Wave Projector''' - a device capable of emitting energies on a galaxy-wide scale. Captain Marvel's cosmic awareness, however, warns him of the trap and after defeating Mercurio he returns to Earth. <ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1, #51</ref>

Mercurio was most recently seen as a prisoner on the laboratory-world of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]. <ref>''Quasar'' vol. 1, #14 - 16</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
As a native of the planet Gramos, Mercurio possesses the ability to generate intense heat, usually in the form of a fireball or wall of flame. As a result of his "accident", Mercurio can now emit intense cold from the left side of his body. He is also able to use both abilities simultaneously. Mercurio also possesses enhanced strength and flight, although it is not known whether the latter is an innate ability or is achieved via technological means.
