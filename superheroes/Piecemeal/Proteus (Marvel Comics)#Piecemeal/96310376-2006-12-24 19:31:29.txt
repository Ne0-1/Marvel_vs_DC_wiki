'''Kevin MacTaggert,''' best known as '''Proteus''' and also called '''Mutant X,''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #125 ([[1979#September|September 1979]]), though hints to his character appeared in earlier issues.

Kevin was the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] son of Scottish genetic researcher [[Moira MacTaggert]] and politician Joseph MacTaggert. Kevin had [[reality warper|reality warping]] and [[Spiritual possession|possession]] powers and lived most of his life in forced seclusion at his mother’s [[Muir Island]] research facility. 

His attempt to break free and find his father made up a classic 1979–80 ''Uncanny X-Men'' storyline that was adapted in the [[X-Men (animated series)|1990s ''X-Men'' animated series]].

==Fictional character biography==
Proteus is one of the strongest and deadliest mutants ever to appear in Marvel Comics. Despite being one of the most powerful mutants, Proteus was not fortunate enough to have a happy life. Even his conception was under unpleasant circumstances. He was the son of Moira MacTaggert and her sinister husband, Joseph MacTaggert, who forced Moira into an unhappy marriage. Kevin was conceived after his mother, Moira, was severely beaten by Joseph. After this traumatic experience, Moira left Joseph. She did not notify him that she was pregnant with his child.

Moira and Kevin lived on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of [[Scotland]]. Kevin eventually began manifesting his mutant abilities and became a danger to everyone around him. His abilities gave him an uncontrollable hunger for energy. To protect herself and others, Moira was forced to confine Kevin. To keep the truth about her son secret, she began to describe him to others only as ''Mutant X.''

For years, Kevin remained inside his cell, until one day, after a battle between [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the X-Men, Kevin was able to escape. During his escape, Kevin came into contact with [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and [[Multiple Man]]. While he was able to defeat Polaris and Multiple Man, he barely escaped with his life when he confronted Phoenix. The only problem was, without the isosteric energy fields of his cell to sustain him, Kevin began to burn his body out. The only temporary solution he could find was to possess several human host bodies, including a duplicate of Multiple Man's.

Kevin eventually encountered the X-Men and proceeded to rename himself as Proteus, after the [[Proteus|Greek god]]. Proteus eventually went to [[Edinburgh]], to possess his father, Joseph. After possessing his father, Proteus made a last stand against the X-Men. He destroyed the body of Joseph MacTaggert in battle. Before Proteus could take another host, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (in his metallic form) punched Proteus in his energy form. Due to Proteus' weakness to metal, Proteus was unable to maintain his energy form. His energy was therefore dispersed across the world. 

Some time after his death, Moira MacTaggert thought about [[cloning]] Kevin, but she was discouraged successfully by [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]].

Several years later, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] attempted to recreate Proteus. The organization used a woman named Harness and her mutant son, Piecemeal, to absorb all of the dispersed energy of Proteus. As the boy went about absorbing the energy, his body grew too large for his system to handle. Eventually, what was left of Proteus' [[consciousness]] and Piecemeal merged as one being.

The combined efforts of the [[New Warriors]], the [[New Mutants]], the [[X-Men|Muir Islanders]], and the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] wasn't enough against this new creature. When the amalgamated being decided that it would not find happiness, it decided to disappear.

==Powers and abilities==
Proteus is a being made out of [[psionic]] energy, and as a result he possesses many psionic abilities.  He possesses [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities, the ability to possess human bodies (eventually, these human bodies "burn out", due to the nature of his powerful energies), and powerful [[Reality warper|reality-warping powers]] - able to practically change the face of the world by pure force of will. For example, he can easily turn a standing building into liquid, turn buildings into bees that attack at his mental command, and transform [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops']] optic blasts into flowers. Proteus' main weaknesses was to metal, such as a bullet entering his host body or, to a greater extent, when his energy form came into contact with the organic metal of Colossus' body.  He is also vulnerable to magicks and other reality-warpers.

The combined Proteus and Piecemeal creature was not vulnerable to metal and did not have the need for host bodies.

==Other versions==
===''Star Trek/X-Men'' crossover===

In the ''Star Trek/X-Men'' [[Intercompany crossover|crossover]], the spirit of Proteus crosses over to to the universe of [[Star Trek]] because of a rift created by classic Star Trek antagonist [[Gary Mitchell (Star Trek)|Gary Mitchell]] (who also had reality-warping powers).  Proteus is able to reanimate and inhabit Mitchell's corpse, which does not deteriorate like other hosts.  While chasing [[Deathbird]], the X-Men end up teaming up with the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] to stop Proteus, who forms an alliance with Deathbird to escape the planet.

At one point, Proteus compares Mitchell's fate (as seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' TV series episode "[[Where No Man Has Gone Before (TOS episode)|Where No Man Has Gone Before]]") to the kind of anti-mutant prejudice that the X-Men are fighting.

===House of M===
When the [[Scarlet Witch]] re-shapes [[Earth-616]], Proteus is resurrected as the [[serial killer]] Mutant X, who steals bodies across two continents and is hunted down by Moira MacTaggert, who is framed by the government for Proteus' deaths. He encounters the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] and actually manages to escape the [[House of M]] by stealing data from the Panoptichron. Something notable is when he leaves his home reality, he only inhabits bodies of superhumans from "approximation" realities or Exiles members. He has inhabited the bodies of an unnamed mutant, Blunderbuss, and [[Angel Salvadore]] in ''House of M''; [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]] and [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] in ''Exiles''; [[Justice (New Universe)|Justice]] from the [[New Universe]]; and [[Hulk 2099|the Hulk]] from the [[Marvel 2099]] universe. None of these bodies last for long and eventually wither away, with the exception of Angel Salvadore. Mutant X's current body, [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] from Exiles, also does not seem to deteriorate while Proteus is inhabiting it. 

In ''Exiles'' #76, Proteus states that he could not stop thinking about [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]. Whether it was because he still had some of Mimic's memories or because he actually felt something for her is not yet clear. He states he was tired of fighting and that he just wants to talk, but before he can say anything, [[Longshot (comics)|Longshot]] shields Blink, allowing her to [[teleport]] to safety. It is revealed by Proteus himself that his mind is able to recall all memories and feelings of his previous hosts. Blink tricks Proteus into wearing a portable Behavior Modification System (from [[Squadron Supreme]]'s world), which she teleported into the crown he was wearing. The device brainwashes him into believing he is actually Morph and leaves him able to recall only Morph's memories prior to his possession. Unaware of his true identity, he begins behaving exactly like Morph and a member of the Exiles, much to the discomfort of the other Exiles.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Proteus is named David Xavier and is the son of Moira MacTaggert and her ex-husband [[Professor X]] (Charles Xavier). Like in the mainstream version, he escapes his mother's keep on Muir Island, seeking his father in order to kill him. Before David can finish his deadly vendetta, [[Colossus (comics)#Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]] [[mercy killing|mercy-kills]] him by crushing him under a car, while he was possessing [[Psylocke]].  Given his name and biological relationship to Xavier, this version can be considered an amalgamation of the Regular Marvel Universe versions of Proteus and David Haller ([[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]), Charles Xavier's son.
