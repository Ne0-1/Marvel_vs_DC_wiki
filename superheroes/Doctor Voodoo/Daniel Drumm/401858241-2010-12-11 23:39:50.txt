'''Daniel Drumm''' is a fictional character existing in the [[Marvel Comic]]'s universe.

==Fictional character biography==
Drumm is twin brothers with Jericho Drumm, who would later become [[Doctor Voodoo]]. They were raised by their aunt Matilda, in an impoverished neighborhood in Por-au-Prince, Haiti. Jericho left to pursue an education in the [[United States]], whilst Daniel remained in Haiti and studied magic, eventually earning the title Brother Voodoo. Twelve years later, Jericho learned that Daniel was ill, and returned to Haiti, where he learned that an evil occultist called Damballah had placed a curse on him. At midnight, Damballah used a voodoo doll resembling Daniel to kill him, but not before Jericho promised Daniel that he would stop Damballah.  A witch doctor, Papa Jambo, then used magic to link the two brother's spiritis together, and Jericho became the new Brother Voodoo, with his brother's spirit occasionally assisting him.[http://marvel.wikia.com/Daniel_Drumm_(Earth-616)]
