'''Daniel Drumm''' is a fictional character existing in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
Drumm is twin brothers with Jericho Drumm, who would later become [[Doctor Voodoo]]. They were raised by their aunt Matilda, in an impoverished neighborhood in Por-au-Prince, Haiti. Jericho left to pursue an education in the United States, whilst Daniel remained in Haiti and studied magic, eventually earning the title Brother Voodoo. Twelve years later, Jericho learned that Daniel was ill, and returned to Haiti, where he learned that an evil occultist called Damballah had placed a curse on him. At midnight, Damballah used a voodoo doll resembling Daniel to kill him, but not before Jericho promised Daniel that he would stop Damballah. A witch doctor, Papa Jambo, then used magic to link the two brother's spiritis together, and Jericho became the new Brother Voodoo, with his brother's spirit.

Many years later, when the Eye of Agamotto leaves [[Doctor Strange]] after showing him and the New Avengers nearly thirty candidates who would possibly replace him, Jericho Drumm, due to his mystical power and heritage, and being apparently chosen by the Eye itself, is chosen as the acting [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of [[Earth 616]] reality. Due to their shared bond, Daniel Drumm chooses to stand for his brother and help him in his new role <ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #53 (July 2009)</ref> In this capacity, he joins Jericho and the Avengers in a battle on the mystical plane against the entity Agamotto itself, willing to retrieve his Eye and rule Earth. Despite their combined efforts, Strange, the Avengers and Daniel fail, forcing Jericho to sacrifice himself in a mystical explosion, taking out both Agamotto and the Eye. Daniel, however, is able to survive the explosion, and, briefly taking control of [[Luke Cage]]'s body, angrily blames Doctor Strange for Jericho's death, fleeing to parts unknown.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #6 (Jan. 2011)</ref> He later returns, possessing various Avengers and killing other sorcerers in preparation for his final assault on Strange (now convinced that Strange set his brother up to fail in his new role), but Strange defeats him by using dark magic (recognizing that Drumm had only killed dark magic specialists while trying to frame Strange), subsequently regaining his position of Sorcerer Supreme as a result.<ref>''The New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #31-34</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Brother Voodoo Drumm possessed many magical abilities. He can also merge his soul with his brother's body, which increases his speed, stamina and stength, and can also enter and control other bodies as he pleases.

Somehow surviving Jericho's apparent death, Daniel Drumm lost the abilities tied to Jericho's one: however, he retained the ability to enter and control other bodies, using them as physical mediums.

==Publication history==
Drumm first appeared in [[Strange Tales]] issue1 169, in September 1973. This issue also featured the first appearance of [[Brother Voodoo]].
