'''Crossfire''' ('''William Cross''') is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] fictional [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by writer [[Steven Grant]] and artist [[Jim Craig (comics)|Jim Craig]] in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #52 (June 1979).

==Fictional character biography==
William Cross was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  He is a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative and master of brainwashing techniques, out to save the world by destroying all superheroes. He forms his own private army, and becomes a professional subversive and criminal entrepreneur with his company, [[Cross Technological Enterprises]].

Crossfire abducts the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to test a brainwashing device on him. He is defeated along with his private army by the Thing and [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #52</ref>

He hires [[Silencer (comics)|Silencer]], [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], and [[Bombshell (Marvel Comics)|Bombshell]] to capture [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] as bait to capture other superhuman crime-fighters. A vengeful Crossfire stalks Hawkeye and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] to the estate of former film star [[Moira Brandon]]. The elderly actress assists the heroes in capturing Cross.<ref>''Hawkeye'' #2-4</ref> The criminal mercenary jugglers known as the [[Death-Throws]] free Cross from police custody. When he proves unable to pay them, they held him for ransom until [[Captain America]], Hawkeye, and Mockingbird capture the whole gang.<ref>''Captain America'' #317</ref> Crossfire later escapes and places a bounty on Hawkeye's arm, hoping to destroy the hero's archery skills and break his spirit. Cross and his small army of superhuman bounty hunters (including [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]], [[Bobcat (comics)|Bobcat]], [[Razor Fist]], [[Bullet Biker]], and the Death-Throws) are defeated and captured by Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trickshot]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #24-25</ref>

===Raft===
At some point during one of his prison stays he befriends Vector of the [[U-Foes]] whose secret power nullification technology Cross had hoped to exploit. Recaptured following an encounter with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Cross is imprisoned in the Vault, a super-human prison, where Rozalyn Backus (long since exonerated) was a member of the Vault's Guardsman force. Seemingly aiding and then foiling an escape plot by the U-Foes and Crossfire, Backus turns the criminals against each other, fakes her own death, and steals a fortune in cash and goods from the criminals. This includes including Vector's power nullification chamber (which Backus later claimed she secretly destroyed since she felt it was too dangerous to preserve). The criminals are later transferred to the new Raft super-prison and all escape during [[Electro (comics)#Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s mass breakout. During this, Crossfire leads a gang of his fellow mind-manipulators: [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]], [[Corruptor]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], and [[Mister Fear#Alan Fagan|Mister Fear]]. Pursuing Backus, the chamber and their grudges against each other, the U-Foes and Crossfire's gang fight a super-powered gang war in New York until the Avengers break it up. Crossfire and his gang are recaptured (except the Corruptor) and Backus surrenders herself to the authorities.<ref>''Spider-Man: Breakout'' #1-5</ref>

===Secret War===
Crossfire plays a small role in the "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]" crossover event.<ref>''Secret War'' #4</ref>

He was later involved in a [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Splinter groups|R.A.I.D]] terror plot in [[London]], only to be foiled by [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]].<ref>''Union Jack'' #1-2</ref>

===Hood===
Crossfire is hired by the criminal known as the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers #35''</ref> He helps them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.<ref>"New Avengers Annual" #2</ref>

Crossfire appears as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes; the grouping is intent on defeating the Skrull invasion force of New York City.<ref>"[[Secret Invasion]]" #6</ref>

As seen in flashbacks, the Hood has used his powers to help Crossfire and the others escape jail. They also come under threat from Skrull infiltrators. <ref>"New Avengers" #46</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead. The battle, which takes place in the remains of the notorious [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], ends with Crossfire and his fellow gang members soundly beaten.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

Crossfire is later seen conferring with the Hood regarding procuring the [[Marvel Zombies|zombie virus]]. He argrues with the Hood that the virus is too dangerous, but the Hood is compelled by Dormammu to procure the virus anyway.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Crossfire has no superhuman powers, but has a gifted intellect. He is highly skilled at the various arts of espionage. He possesses sufficient technical ability to develop and modify moderately sophisticated computer technology without aid. He also has specialized knowledge of applied ultra-sonics.

He is highly trained by the CIA in unarmed combat and is proficient in delivering killing blows and is an excellent marksman.

His various paraphernalia was built either by himself, or his company Cross Technological Enterprises. His uniform is composed of Kevlar and has special hidden compartments containing various weaponry and devices.  He uses conventional handguns, also various small single-shot weapons concealed within his uniform. He has also employed the "undertaker" machine, which employs ultrasonic waves to stimulate rage in the emotion centers of his victims' brains. His left eye has been replaced by an infrared imaging device which affords him a semblance of sight even in total darkness. His left ear has been replaced by an audio sensor that is far more sensitive than the human ear. An explosion caused 85% hearing loss in his right ear, and thanks to his near-deafness in this ear he is immune to the effects of his own ultrasonic machinery as long as he adjusts his artificial ear to be unaffected by it. He has a compressed oxygen tank and various miniature surveillance devices concealed within his uniform.
