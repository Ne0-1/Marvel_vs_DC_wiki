'''Crossfire''' ('''William Cross''') is the name of a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] fictional [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by writer [[Steven Grant]] and artist [[Jim Craig (comics)|Jim Craig]] in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #52 (June 1979).

==Fictional character biography==
William Cross was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  He is a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative and master of brainwashing techniques, out to save the world by destroying all superheroes. He formed his own private army, and became a professional subversive and criminal entrepreneur with his company, Cross Technological Enterprises.

Crossfire abducted the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to test a brainwashing device on him. He was defeated along with his private army by the Thing and [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #52</ref>

He hired [[Silencer (comics)|Silencer]], [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], and [[Bombshell (Marvel Comics)|Bombshell]] to capture [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] as bait to capture other superhuman crime-fighters. A vengeful Crossfire stalked Hawkeye and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] to the estate of former film star [[Moira Brandon]] who helped the heroes recapture Cross and was then declared an honorary [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]].<ref>''Hawkeye'' #2-4</ref> The criminal mercenary jugglers known as the [[Death-Throws]] freed Cross from police custody, but when he proved unable to pay them, they held him for ransom until [[Captain America]], Hawkeye, and Mockingbird captured the whole gang.<ref>''Captain America'' #317</ref> Crossfire later escaped and placed a bounty on Hawkeye's arm, hoping to destroy the hero's archery skills and break his spirit. Cross and his small army of superhuman bounty hunters (including [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]], [[Bobcat (comics)|Bobcat]], [[Razor Fist]], [[Bullet Biker]], and the Death-Throws) were defeated and captured by Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trickshot]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #24-25</ref>

At some point during one of his prison stays he befriended Vector of the [[U-Foes]] whose secret power nullification technology Cross had hoped to exploit. Recaptured following an encounter with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Cross was imprisoned in the Vault where Rozalyn Backus (long since exonerated) was a member of the Vault's Guardsman force. Seemingly aiding and then foiling an escape plot by the U-Foes and Crossfire, Backus turned the criminals against each other, faked her own death, and stole a fortune in cash and goods from the criminals, including Vector's power nullification chamber (which Backus later claimed she secretly destroyed since she felt it was too dangerous to preserve). The criminals were later transferred to the new Raft super-prison and all escaped during [[Electro (comics)#Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s mass breakout, with Crossfire leading a gang of his fellow mind-manipulators: [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]], [[Corruptor]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], and [[Mister Fear#Alan Fagan|Mister Fear]]. Pursuing Backus, the chamber and their grudges against each other, the U-Foes and Crossfire's gang fought a super-powered gang war in New York until the Avengers broke it up. Crossfire and his gang were recaptured (except the Corruptor) and Backus surrendered herself to the authorities.

Crossfire has been later hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers #35''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Crossfire has no superhuman powers, but has a gifted intellect. He is highly skilled at the various arts of espionage. He possesses sufficient technical ability to develop and modify moderately sophisticated computer technology without aid. He also has specialized knowledge of applied ultra-sonics.

He is highly trained by the CIA in unarmed combat and is proficient in delivering killing blows and is an excellent marksman.

His various paraphernalia was built either by himself, or his company Cross Technological Enterprises. His uniform is composed of Kevlar and has special hidden compartments containing various weaponry and devices.  He uses conventional handguns, also various small single-shot weapons concealed within his uniform. He has also employed the "undertaker" machine, which employs ultrasonic waves to stimulate rage in the emotion centers of his victims' brains. His left eye has been replaced by an infrared imaging device which affords him a semblance of sight even in total darkness. His left ear has been replaced by an audio sensor that is far more sensitive than the human ear. An explosion caused 85% hearing loss in his right ear, and thanks to his near-deafness in this ear he is immune to the effects of his own ultrasonic machinery as long as he adjusts his artificial ear to be unaffected by it. He has a compressed oxygen tank and various miniature surveillance devices concealed within his uniform.
