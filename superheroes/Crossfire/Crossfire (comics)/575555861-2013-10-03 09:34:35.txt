==Fictional character biography==
William Cross was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. He later became an interrogation expert for the CIA. Cross was already building his own rogue covert operations when he romanced federal corrections officer Rozalyn Backus with whom he developed ultrasonic brainwashing technology. Backus was unaware of Cross' illicit activities, and they were engaged to be married until Cross stole the technology and disappeared. In his disappearance he faked his own murder and framed Backus for the murder. Surviving an attempt on his life, which cost him his left eye and his left ear, he replaced them with cybernetic implants and became a prosperous high-tech freelance subversive as Crossfire.<ref>''Spider-Man: Breakout'' #1-5</ref>

Plotting to make the growing superhero community exterminate each other via ultrasonic mind control, Crossfire abducted the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to test his technology. [[Moon Knight]] (secretly Cross' ex-CIA colleague Marc Spector) interfered and Crossfire was defeated.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #52</ref>

Crossfire secretly rebuilt his operations at [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] (CTE), founded by his cousin, Darren Cross. When [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] investigated, Crossfire first tried to eliminate them using the assassins [[Bombshell (Marvel Comics)|Bombshell]], [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], and [[Silencer (comics)|Silencer]]. When his three assassins failed, Crossfire decided Hawkeye would make an ideal test subject for his super hero mind control plot, because Hawkeye was prominent enough in the super hero community to attract them en masse at his funeral and weak enough to be an easy target. Hawkeye thwarted the brainwashing, captured the criminals and rescued Mockingbird, whom he married shortly thereafter.<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.1 #1-4</ref>

A vengeful Crossfire subsequently stalked the newlyweds to the estate of former film star [[Moira Brandon]]. The elderly actress was declared an honorary Avenger after she helped Hawkeye and Mockingbird recapture the supervillain.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #100</ref> The juggling supervillain team known as the [[Death-Throws]] freed Crossfire from police custody. But when he proved unable to pay them, they held Crossfire for ransom until [[Captain America]], Hawkeye, and Mockingbird captured the whole gang.<ref>''Captain America'' #317</ref> Crossfire later escaped and placed a bounty on Hawkeye's arm, hoping to destroy the hero's archery skills and break his spirit. An army of supervillains (including [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]], [[Bobcat (comics)|Bobcat]], [[Razor Fist]], [[Bullet Biker (comics)|Bullet Biker]], and the Death-Throws) look to claim the reward, but are defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and [[Trickshot (comics)|Trick Shot]]. With the bounty hunting supervillains captured, Hawkeye pursues Crossfire through the sewers. Crossfire is knocked off the edge of an outfall dam and is left clinging on for his life. Hawkeye contemplates letting his foe fall to his doom and ending the feud between them once and for all. The archer ultimately saves Crossfire's life, letting him rot in prison instead.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #24-25</ref>

Crossfire was among the army of technology based supervillains recruited by [[Lucia Von Bardas]] to attack Nick Fury and a group of superheroes who were involved in a [[Secret War (comics)|secret war]] in [[Latveria]] a year earlier. The hired supervillains were revealed to each be a component of a bomb designed to destroy the city. Nick Fury and the heroes were able to foil the plot and arrested the supervillains involved, including Crossfire.<ref>''Secret War'' #4</ref>

At some point during one of his prison stays he befriended Vector of the [[U-Foes]] whose secret power nullification technology Cross had hoped to exploit. Recaptured following an encounter with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Cross was imprisoned in the Vault where Rozalyn Backus (long since exonerated) was a member of the Vault's [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] force. Seemingly aiding and then foiling an escape plot by the U-Foes and Crossfire, Backus turned the criminals against each other, faked her own death, and stole a fortune in cash and goods from the criminals, including Vector's power nullification chamber (which Backus later claimed she secretly destroyed since she felt it was too dangerous to preserve). The criminals were later transferred to the new Raft super-prison, and all escaped during [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s mass breakout, with Crossfire leading a gang of his fellow mind-manipulators: [[Controller (comics)|Controller]], [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], and [[Mister Fear]]. Pursuing Backus, the chamber and their grudges against each other, the U-Foes and Crossfire's gang fought a super-powered gang war in New York until the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] broke it up. Crossfire and his gang were recaptured (except the Corruptor) and Backus surrendered herself to the authorities.<ref>''Spider-Man: Breakout'' #1-5</ref>

Along with the Death-Throws, Crossfire was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Splinter groups|R.A.I.D]] to take part in a terror plot in [[London]], only to be foiled by [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] and [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]]. Crossfire was knocked from the top of [[Tower Bridge]] and fell to the [[River Thames]] below. He was believed to have perished when he didn't resurface.<ref>''Union Jack'' #2</ref>

Crossfire is revealed to have survived the fall and is among the supervillains gathered by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], who is looking to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers #35''</ref> Crossfire becomes a member of the Hood's crime syndicate who go on to battle the New Avengers. He is seen battling his old enemy, Clint Barton, in his Ronin guise.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2</ref>

Crossfire appears is part of the Hood's crime syndicate that come together with the superheroes to battle the Skrull invasion force in New York City.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6 & 8</ref> After the Skrull invasion was thwarted, the Hood led his criminal army (including Crossfire) against the New Avengers, who were laying in wait for the Norman Osborn's newly formed [[Dark Avengers]]. Once again, Crossfire is seen battling Clint Barton and the recently returned Mockingbird.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

Crossfire is later seen conferring with the Hood to discuss the [[Marvel Zombies|zombie virus]]. The Hood wishes to use the virus to gain more power and influence in the world. Crossfire protests, explaining that one of the reasons he was compelled to ally himself with the Hood was that 'world-conquering' schemes would be avoided. Crossfire is quickly put in his place with a single stern gaze from the supervillain kingpin.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref>

Led by the Wrecking Crew and Dr. Jonas Harrow, Crossfire and the rest of the Hood's crime syndicate rebel against their leader and seek out to make their own deal with Norman Osborn. They attack and defeat the New Avengers and subdue the Dark Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' #55-58</ref> Crossfire was part of the Hood's criminal army that took part in the [[Siege (comics)|siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], an event orchrestrated by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. After the battle was over and the heroes had won, Crossfire managed to evade capture and branched out on his own once more.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #1</ref>

[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] thwart Crossfire's illegal arms dealings, much to the supervillain's anger. He is later confronted by [[Phantom Rider (Jaime Slade)|Jaime Slade]] (the new [[Phantom Rider]]) who suggests that they form an alliance. Together, along with Crossfire's new robotic army of Death T.H.R.O.W.S. (Techno Hybrid Remotely Operated Weapons Systems), the villainous pair plot to destroy the lives of the two heroes. Crossfire and the Phantom Rider are ultimately foiled, but not before Crossfire almost succeeds in killing Hawkeye and Mockingbird, severely wounds Mockingbird's mother, and murders [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Hamilton Slade]]. As a result, Crossfire is captured and viciously beaten by Hawkeye. Despite being imprisoned with numerous injuries, Crossfire takes away a small victory in knowing that he has pushed Hawkeye to his breaking point.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #1-5</ref> Hawkeye later discovered that [[Baron Zemo]] was the mysterious "benefactor" behind Crossfire's illegal arms dealings.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #3-4 (2011)</ref>

[[Luke Cage]] tells Hawkeye that, as long as he is the leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Crossfire will never be given the opportunity to be part of his team.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #6</ref> [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] had already recommended that Crossfire should not be considered for the Thunderbolt program due to his technological prowess that could see the supervillain override the nanite system used to control the inmates.<ref>''The Heroic Age: Villains'' #1</ref>

Crossfire was hired as part of [[Misty Knight]]'s "Villains for Hire" team in a battle against the [[Purple Man]].<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #1 (2011)</ref>

Crossfire was later recruited by Max Fury to join the [[Shadow Council]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #29</ref> He is later seen in Bagalia being paid off by [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] to let the [[Taskmaster]] out of his imprisonment at the time when the [[Secret Avengers]] raid Bagalia to recruit Taskmaster.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Crossfire has no superhuman powers, but is a highly trained former CIA operative. He is an expert marksman with proficient unarmed combat skills and extensive espionage training. Crossfire is a master of brainwashing techniques and has been known to develop his own technology to further these skills. With his gifted intellect, Crossfire is an expert in the field of robotics and cybernetics. He also has specialized knowledge of applied ultrasonics. Crossfire created the "undertaker" machine, a brainwashing device which employs ultrasonic waves to stimulate rage in the emotion centers of his victims' brains.<ref>''Hawkeye'' vol. 1 #4</ref>

An explosion caused Crossfire to lose his left eye, left ear, and 85% loss of hearing in his right ear. His left eye was replaced with an infrared imaging device which affords him a semblance of sight even in total darkness, while his left ear was replaced by an audio sensor that is far more sensitive than the human ear.<ref>''Marvel Two in One'' #52</ref> The loss of natural hearing in his right ear has resulted in Crossfire being unaffected by his own ultrasonic technology. His costume is made of Kevlar and has special hidden compartments containing various weaponry and devices. Crossfire uses twin handguns and a sniper rifle as his weapons of choice.

==Death T.H.R.O.W.S.==
In the past, Crossfire was known to employ the supervillain group, the [[Death-Throws]], as his foot soldiers.<ref>''Captain America'' #317</ref> However, deciding to leave behind the "fifth rate hacks in ridiculous costumes", Crossfire created a new army for himself. His "Death T.H.R.O.W.S". (Techno Hybird Remotely Operated Weapons Systems) are robotic constructs that obey only his commands and each carry a small capable arsenal concealed within their armored shells.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #3</ref>

Originally, the robotic Death T.H.R.O.W.S. were known as 'Magnum Z's'.<ref>''Heroic Age: Villains'' #1 (2011)</ref> The Magnum Z's were fully automated smart soldiers created for the United States. But the US senate ceased their development when they realised that the Magnum Z's abilities were in conflict with the [[Geneva Convention]]. Crossfire acquired some of the defunct Magnum Z's to use in a plot to conquer the Isle of El Guapo,<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #40-41 (1992)</ref> then later adapted them for his own purposes.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #3 (2010)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Covenant of the Shield===
An alternate version of Crossfire appears in the 2000 three issue [[limited series]] ''Avataars: Covenant of the Shield'', where the Marvel Universe is re-imagined in a fantasy setting. In this reality, Crossfire is known as Iron Cross, and is a member of the [[Masters of Evil|Minions of Evil]].<ref>''Avataars: Covenant of the Shield'' #3</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Crossfire appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode "To Steal an Ant-Man", voiced by [[Neil Ross]]. This version is a former criminal partner of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]. When William Cross and his men (consisting of Big Ben Donovan, Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton, [[Gideon Mace]], Ray "Piranha" Jones, and Spear) kidnapped Scott's daughter [[Cassandra Lang]] so that Scott could pay the money he owed him, Scott had to steal the Ant-Man costume to obtain the money. When Scott met up with William Cross and his men to pay him off, William Cross thought that Scott Lang was Ant-Man all along and alters the deal. Just then, [[Henry Pym]] arrives with [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] where they help fight William Cross' henchmen. After getting Cassandra to safety, Scott summons a swarm of ants to swarm all over William Cross before knocking him out.
