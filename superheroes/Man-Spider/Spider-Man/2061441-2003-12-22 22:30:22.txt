'''Spider-Man/Peter Parker''' is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. He first appeared in ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 ([[1962]]) in an issue so successful that he was soon given his own comic entitled ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

Spider-Man is the quintessential Marvel character. Despite being blessed by powers and abilities he is beset by the travails and problems of ordinary life as well. His power gives him the ability to do good but does not allow him to improve his lot in life. The main theme of the Spider-Man series is: ''"With great power comes great responsibility."''

==Character History==

Peter Parker was born to Richard Parker and his wife Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker, both of whom were agents of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and later of [[Nick Fury|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (a fictional secret agency playing an important role in the [[Marvel Universe]]). Their last assignment was the infiltration as double-agents of the organization of Albert Malik, who had taken on the name of [[Red Skull]] in the absence of the original. Albert found out about their plans and arranged a plane-crash that proved fatal for them.

After his parents' death the infant Peter Parker was left in the care of his [[Uncle Ben]] and [[Aunt May]] (Richard's older brother Benjamin Parker and his wife May Reilly-Parker). Ben immediately took to the role of the boy's father but May was at first reluctant. She still remembered her parents blaming her own birth for the destruction of their marriage, and she was afraid that Peter might signal the end of her own marriage. In time, however, she warmed up to Peter, who unexpectedly ''strengthened'' the couple's marriage. Though Peter was always loved by the aging couple he was unpopular among those of his own age. Over time he grew to be a rather lonely, timid teenager who showed more interest in his studies and science in general than in any kind of social life. He was often the target of jokes by more popular fellow students like Eugene "Flash" Thompson, the high-school's star athlete.

Peter's life took a strange turn when he was 16 years old. While attending a science exhibit he was bitten by a [[spider]] which had been imbued with a fantastic amount of [[radiation]]. The spider bite gave Parker an array of superpowers including the proportional speed, strength and agility of a spider, a so-called "spider-sense" that warns him of impending danger, a fast healing ability that allows him to quickly recover from injuries and poisons, and the ability to stick to walls through what has been hypothesized to be a system of molecular adhesion. A lesser effect was the improvement of his eyesight. Originally near-sighted and bespectacled, he now has perfect vision.

In addition to his physical powers Parker used his knowledge of the sciences to build mechanical web shooters which allow him to spin the webs Spider-Man uses in a variety of ways. Spider-Man uses his webs to travel through the cavernous chasms between the Manhattan high-rises by swinging between them, to ensnare criminals, and to form protective shields or nets. Later, he also developed small electronic "spider-tracers" which allow him to track objects or individuals.

Initially, Parker designed a costume and adopted the identity of Spider-Man in order to become a celebrity and gain a lot of money. His ego grew with his initial fame, however, and when an opportunity to stop a thief presented itself, Parker chose to do nothing, feeling he no longer had to look after anyone but himself. Upon learning that his beloved Uncle Ben had been killed by a burglar, Parker charged into action as Spider-Man. To his horror he learned that the burglar who had killed his Uncle Ben was the same thief he had earlier allowed to escape. Thereafter he devoted himself to fighting injustice in memory of his uncle and the sense of responsibility he instilled in him. Though the death of a loved one is a commonplace motive for crime-fighting in comics, Spider-Man is driven by guilt rather than revenge.

Although Spider-Man eternally tries to do the right thing he is viewed with suspicion by a number of authority figures and is often considered little more than a lawbreaker himself. Much of this negative publicity is the result of a smear campaign by [[J. Jonah Jameson]], publisher of the daily newspaper the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. Ironically, Parker works as a freelance photographer for Jameson, selling photographs of himself as Spider-Man.

As originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Parker was something of an everyman character. However, as with many characters spanning a lengthy publishing history and handled by multiple creators, Spider-Man's history is somewhat convoluted. He continued working as a freelance photographer for the ''Daily Bugle'' and living with his elderly and somewhat fragile Aunt May until he graduated from high school. He enrolled in the fictional Empire State University where he befriended Harry Osborn, who was in fact the son of his arch-enemy the [[Green Goblin]], and [[Gwen Stacy]], with whom he would have a lengthy romance.

Stacy was eventually killed by the Green Goblin who seemingly died soon thereafter in battle with Spider-Man. Parker eventually wed long-time friend, [[Mary Jane Watson]], an occasional [[fashion]] model. His marriage did not overly affect his career as a crime-fighter, and the stresses of his dual identity coupled with Mary Jane's tempestuous career as a model/actress and capricious editorial mandates led to the dissolution of their marriage. Having been separated but not officially divorced, she has recently returned from an unsuccessful movie career and is once again living with Peter in New York City.

[[As of 2003|Currently]], Peter is once again single and employed as a science teacher at his old [[high school]], living in a Manhattan apartment, and receiving the occasional visit from his Aunt May (who was at one point thought dead--but the elderly woman who died turned out to be an actress who impersonated her). She has finally learned the truth about her nephew's secret identity.

Green Goblin/Norman Osborn has also returned to Peter's life recently as it was revealed that his powers also include an extra-ordinary healing ability and that he had been living incognito in [[Europe]] during the years of his absence. He made his return after the death of his son Harold "Harry" Osborn, who had served as the second Green Goblin during most of his absence, and has resumed his activities as head of a business corporation. Though he still operates as the Goblin occasionally he prefers now to manipulate others rather than acting on his own. He also wants to ensure that the "Goblin/Osborn" Legacy remains by preparing a heir for it. His grandson, Norman Osborn II ("Normie"), is still a very young child and so the elder Norman has attempted to prepare another person to act as his heir and adoptive son, Harry's replacement and Normie's future mentor and adoptive father. Surprisingly, the person he has chosen is Peter himself. The Goblin's attempts to either force Peter to accept this role or to kill him have been unsuccessful but have taken their toll on Peter's life on more than one occasion. The relationship between the duo continues to play an important role in their lives.

Spider-Man, like [[Batman]], is one of the few characters in comics with a well-known list of enemies (his "Rogues' Gallery"). Among the most infamous of the [[supervillain|supervillains]] he encounters regularly are:

*''[[Green Goblin]]'':

==Adaptations==

Spider-Man has been adapted to [[television]] numerous times, through a short-lived live-action [[Television program|TV series]] and several animated cartoon series. The first was produced in [[1967]] by [[animator]] [[Ralph Bakshi]], with Spider-Man voiced originally by Bernard Cowan and later by Paul Soles. The latter episodes, while suffering from extremely low budgets, were stylized and featured dark ominous settings and pervasive background music. The series may be best remembered for its theme song.

In [[1980]], with the creation of the animation studio Marvel Productions Ltd., Marvel endeavored to translate more of their comic characters to television. Towards this end the cartoon series ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends'' was created featuring Spider-Man, [[Iceman]] of the [[X-Men]], and a new character, Firestar. Actor Dan Gilvezan gave voice to this incarnation of the wall-crawler. In the early [[1990]]s, another successful series was made with a bigger budget and closer fidelity to the comics.  In [[2002]], another animated television series adaptation, this time with [[computer animation]] was produced by [[Mainframe Entertainment]] and broadcast on [[MTV]].

The biggest increase in Spider-Man's popularity came with the release of the [[film]] ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' in May [[2002]]. It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]] (of ''Evil Dead'' and ''Xena: Warrior Princess'' fame) and starred actor [[Tobey Maguire]] as Peter Parker. The film featured a number of impressive [[Computer generated image|CGI]] effects to bring Spider-Man himself to life. Though the film adaptation took a number of liberties with the character's history, it was essentially true to the character and was widely embraced by the viewing public. Earning over $430 million in domestic box office revenue alone, it was the highest-grossing movie of the year, outperforming [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Attack of the Clones]]'' (the first time a ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie was not the biggest box-office hit of the year). It landed a spot on many lists of all-time biggest box office smashes.
