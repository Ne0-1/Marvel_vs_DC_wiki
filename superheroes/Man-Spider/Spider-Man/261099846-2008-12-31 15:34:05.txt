'''Spider-Man''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962), and was created by scripter-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-plotter [[Steve Ditko]]. When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, [[teenagers]] in [[superhero]] [[American comic book|comic books]] were usually relegated to the role of [[sidekick]] to the series' main character. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring '''Peter Parker''', a teenage high school student to whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" young readers could relate.<ref>Wright, 210.</ref> Unlike previous teen heroes such as [[Bucky]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], Spider-Man did not benefit from adult mentors like [[Captain America]] and [[Batman]] and had to learn for himself that "with great power comes great responsibility".

Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several [[Bibliography of Spider-Man titles|comic book series]], the first titled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy [[high school]] student to troubled college student to a married teacher and a member of the superhero team the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. In the comics, Spider-Man is often referred to as "Spidey", "web-slinger", "wall-crawler", or "web-head".

Along with [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful characters of all time, and has appeared in many various forms of media, including several animated and live-action [[Spider-Man on television|television series]], [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspaper [[The Amazing Spider-Man#Newspaper comic strip|comic strips]] and a successful [[Spider-Man (film series)|series of films]] starring actor [[Tobey Maguire]] as the character. Spiderman was named the fifth greatest comic book character by the magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=5 ''Empire'' | The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Publication history==
===Creation===
In 1962, with the success of the [[Fantastic Four]] and other stars, Marvel Comics editor and head writer [[Stan Lee]] was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said that the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.<ref>DeFalco, 1.</ref> In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman [[pulp magazine]] crime fighter [[The Spider]] as an influence,<ref>Lee & Mair, 130.</ref> and in a multitude of print and video interviews Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a [[fly]] climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not it is true.<ref>Lee & Mair, 126. — "He goes further in his biography, claiming that even while pitching the concept to publisher Martin Goodman, 'I can't remember if that was literally true or not, but I thought it would lend a big color to my pitch'."</ref> [[Jack Kirby]] claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation, and that the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and [[Joe Simon]], who in the 1950s had developed a character called The Silver Spider for the [[Crestwood]] comic ''Black Magic'', who was subsequently not used.{{ref_label|Kirby1|1b|1b}} Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputes Kirby's account, asserting that ''Black Magic'' was not a factor, and that he (Simon) devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's [[Archie Comics]] superhero [[The Fly (Archie Comics)|The Fly]]. Artist [[Steve Ditko]] stated that Lee liked the name [[Hawkman]] from [[DC Comics]], and that "Spider-Man" was an outgrowth of that interest.<ref name="ditko-history"/> The hyphen was included in the character's name to avoid confusion with DC Comics' [[Superman]].<ref>[http://www.thehotspotonline.com/blahblah/articles/spidy.htm thehotspotonline.com: Spider-Man: The Birth of an Icon]</ref>

Looking back on the creation of Spider-Man, [[Tom DeFalco]] stated he did not believe that Spider-Man would have been given a chance in today's comics world, where new characters are vetted with test audiences and marketers.<ref name="defalco 9">DeFalco, 9.</ref> At the time, however, Lee only had to get the consent of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] for approval for the character.<ref name="defalco 9"/> In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.{{ref_label|Lee|1a|1a}} Goodman eventually agreed to let Lee try out Spider-Man in the upcoming final issue of the canceled [[science-fiction]]/[[supernatural]] anthology series  ''[[Amazing Adult Fantasy]]'', which was renamed ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' for that single issue, #15 (Aug. 1962).<ref>Daniels, 95.</ref> 
<!--add in info about approving the character -->

Comics historian [[Greg Theakston]] says that Lee, after receiving Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept, approached Kirby. Kirby told Lee about his 1950s Silver Spider/Spider-Man, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that gives him superpowers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference" and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker.<ref>Ditko, "Alter Ego." — "'Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in #15 [of what became titled ''Amazing Fantasy'']. He would be called Spider-Man. Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character.' At this point still, 'Stan said Spider-Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero &mdash; Spider-Man. I said it sounded like [[The Fly (Archie Comics)|The Fly]], which Joe Simon had done for [[Archie Comics]]. Stan called Jack about it but I don't know what was discussed. I never talked to Jack about Spider-Man... Later, at some point, I was given the job of drawing Spider-Man.'"</ref> When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it. Not that he did it badly — it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".<ref>Theakston, 12.</ref>
[[Image:AmazingFantasy15.jpg|thumb|''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Aug. 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] (penciller) & [[Steve Ditko]] (inker).]]
Simon concurs that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon's description, "[[Captain America]] with cobwebs".{{ref_label|Simon1|1c|1c}} Writer [[Mark Evanier]] notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for the first issues of ''Spider-Man''. Likewise, Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to also draw ''Spider-Man'' in addition to his other duties seems false, as Kirby was, in Evanier's words, "always busy".<ref name="evanier127">Evanier, 127.</ref> Both Lee's and Kirby's explanations also do not explain why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman or one of his assistants decided that Spider-Man as drawn and envisioned by Kirby was too similar to The Fly.<ref name="evanier127"/>

For whichever of the above reasons, Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled, <blockquote>One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....<ref name="ditko-history">Ditko, "Alter Ego."</ref></blockquote>

In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in ''Comic Fan'' #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal".<ref>{{cite web|author=Ditko, Steve; Martin, Gary|year=1965|url=http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html|title= Steve Ditko - A Portrait of the Master|work=Comic Fan #2, Summer 1965|accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref> Additionally, Ditko shared a [[Manhattan]] studio with noted [[fetish]] artist [[Eric Stanton]], an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands".<ref>Theakston, 14.</ref>

===Commercial success===
[[Image:AmazingSpiderMan23.jpg|185px|thumb|left|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #23 (April 1965), featuring the [[Green Goblin]]. Cover art by co-creator [[Steve Ditko]].]]

A few months after Spider-Man's introduction in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962), publisher Martin Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue, finding it to have been one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.<ref>Daniels, p. 97</ref> A solo series followed, beginning with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series<ref>Wright, pg. 211</ref> with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] alongside [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Che Guevara]] as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was "beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us".<ref>Wright, pg. 223</ref> Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), [[John Romita, Sr.]] replaced him as artist, and would pencil the character over the next several years.

An early 1970s Spider-Man story led to the revision of the [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of [[illegal drugs]], even negatively. However, in 1970 the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles.<ref name="drugs">Wright, p. 239</ref> Lee chose the top-selling [[Spider-Man: Green Goblin Reborn!|''The Amazing Spider-Man''; issues #96–98]] (May–July 1971) feature a [[story arc]] depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend [[Harry Osborn]] becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut<ref name="drugs"/> and the Code was subsequently revised.
[[Image:SpiderMan96.jpg|thumb|220px|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #96 (May 1971), the first of three non-[[Comics Code]] issues that prompted the Code's first update, allowing comics to show the negative effects of illegal-drug use.

Cover art by [[Gil Kane]]<!--confirmed: both penciled and inked-->]]<!--Wiki image MOS allows images to be larger than default size if details cannot be read/seen otherwise. That applies to cover blurb in this instance-->
In 1972, a second monthly [[ongoing series]] starring Spider-Man began: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and villains. In 1976, his second solo series, ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' began, running parallel to the main series. A third series featuring Spider-Man, ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'', launched in 1985, replacing ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''. The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, written and drawn by popular artist [[Todd McFarlane]], debuted with several different covers, all with the same interior content. The various versions combined sold over 3 million copies, an industry record at the time.<ref>Wright, p. 279</ref> There have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. Several [[limited series]], [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and loosely related comics have also been published, and Spider-Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic series.

The original ''Amazing Spider-Man'' ran through issue #441 (Nov. 1998). Writer-artist [[John Byrne]] then revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Spider-Man: Chapter One]]'' (Dec. 1998 - Oct. 1999, with an issue #0 midway through and some months containing two issues), similar to Byrne's adding details and some revisions to Superman's origin in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]''. Running concurrently, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' was restarted with vol. 2, #1 (Jan, 1999). With what would have been vol. 2, #59, Marvel reintroduced the original numbering, starting with #500 (Dec. 2003).

By the end of 2007, Spider-Man regularly appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', ''[[New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]]'', ''[[Spider-Man Family]]'' and various [[limited series]] in mainstream Marvel Comics continuity, as well as in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] series ''[[Spider-Girl|The Amazing Spider-Girl]]'', the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] title ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', the alternate-universe [[tween]] series ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'', and the alternate-universe children's series ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Avengers (comics)#Marvel Adventures: The Avengers|Marvel Adventures: The Avengers]]''.

When primary series ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' reached issue #545 (Dec. 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' three times monthly, beginning with #546-549 (each January 2008).

==Fictional character biography==

{{main|Fictional history of Spider-Man}}
In his first appearance, Peter Parker is introduced as an orphaned [[science]] [[whiz kid|whiz]] teenager living with his aunt and uncle in the [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] section of [[New York City]]. He is a brilliant student but the subject of mockery by his peers who regard him as a [[Bibliophily|bookworm]]. One day he gets bitten by a [[radioactive]] spider during a science demonstration. He gains spider-like powers such as super-strength, the ability to climb walls, and a phenomenal jumping skill. Peter's own cleverness enables him to develop gadgets that fire webbing.
[[Image:Spider-Man spider-bite.jpg|220px|left|thumb|The fateful spider bite that gave Peter Parker his powers.  ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15, art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]

As Spider-Man, he becomes a successful TV star. One day at a studio he refuses to stop a thief, saying that it is the job of the police not that of a number one star. Weeks later his beloved guardian, [[Uncle Ben]], is murdered and an angry Spider-Man sets off to capture the killer. When he does, he is horrified to find that the man is none other than the thief he refused to subdue. Learning that with great power comes great responsibility, Spider-Man becomes a vigilante.<ref>''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Aug. 1962)</ref>

After his uncle's death, Peter and his Aunt May become desperate for money, so he gets a job as a photographer at the [[Daily Bugle]] selling photos to [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who villifies Spider-Man in the paper.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (March 1963)</ref> As he battles his enemies for the first time, Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult, even attempting to give up.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50, (July 1967)</ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #100 (Sept. 1971)</ref>  Fortunately, in the course of his adventures Spider-Man has made a wide variety of friends and contacts within the superhero community, who often come to his aid when he faces problems that he cannot solve on his own.  

Enemies frequently endanger his loved ones,<ref>As, for example, in ''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1 (1963)</ref> with the [[Green Goblin]] managing to kill his girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121 (June 1973)</ref> Though haunted by her death, he eventually [[The Wedding! (Spider-Man)|marries]] [[Mary Jane Watson]], and much later reveals his civilian identity to the world,<ref>''Civil War'' #2 (June 2006)</ref> furthering his already numerous problems. His marriage to Mary Jane and public unmasking are later erased due to a deal made with the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], resulting in several adjustments to the timeline, such as the resurrection of Harry Osborn and the return of Peter's mechanical web-shooters.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Dec. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and equipment==
{{Main|Spider-Man's powers and equipment}}
[[Image:Spidey costumes.png|185px|thumb|right|Three Spider-Man costumes of the "Civil War" story arc. Promotional art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].]]
A bite from an [[irradiated]] spider causes a variety of changes in the body of Peter Parker, giving him [[List of comic book superpowers|superpowers]]. In the original [[Stan Lee|Lee]]-[[Steve Ditko|Ditko]] stories, Spider-Man has the ability to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility. Brilliant, Parker excells in [[applied science]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but not a genius. However, later writers have depicted the character as a [[genius]].<ref>Kiefer & Couper.</ref> With his talents, he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters. (This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single strand to swing from, a net to bind enemies, a single strand for yanking opponents into objects, strands for whipping foreign objects at enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a hang-glider wing.)  Other equipment include spider-tracers (spider-shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider-sense), a light beacon which can either be used as a flashlight or project a "Spider-Signal" design, and a specially modified [[camera]] that can take pictures automatically. He has also used an invention of Ben Reilly's (a clone of Peter Parker), called "impact webbing": a pellet that explodes on impact into a wrap-around net of webbing. He also used Reilly's stingers, which are small diamond-shaped darts coated with a paralytic chemical agent for incapacitating opponents. 

In stories published in 2005 and 2006 (such as "[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]"), he develops additional spider-like abilities including biological web-shooters, toxic stingers that extend from his forearms, the ability to stick individuals to his back, better control over Spider-sense for detection, and night vision. Spider-Man's strength and speed have also increased beyond his original limits. 

After the events of "One More Day," Spider-Man loses all the above powers gained during the Insect Queen and "Other" storylines, marking the decrease of his strength, senses, and the removal of organic web-shooters and stingers gained as a result of the Other metamorphosis.

Spider-Man's overall metabolic efficiency has been greatly increased, and the composition of his skeleton, inter-connected tissues, and nervous system have all been enhanced. Spider-Man's musculature has been augmented so that he is superhumanly strong and flexible.
 
Though lacking in directed training, Spider-Man is one of the most experienced superheroes in the Marvel Universe. He has worked with virtually everyone in the superhero community at one time or another. Due to this experience, he has beaten foes with far greater powers and abilities. His fighting style is purely freestyle, which incorporates his speed, agility, strength, equilibrium and spider-sense. A very large part of his combat ability is improvisation and using his wits to out-think his opponents. One constant is his habit of using jokes, puns and insults. This serves a dual purpose, in that it not only causes his adversaries to become angry and distracted, it also helps Spider-Man deal with any fears or doubts that he might have during a battle. 

Spider-Man has had a few costume changes over his history, with three notable costumes; his traditional red-and-blue costume, the black-and-white alien [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] (later developed into a regular costume for stealth) and the technologically advanced [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|Iron Spider]] costume designed by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. In early comics and sporadically throughout his run depending on any given artist's interpretation, Spider-Man's costume included webbing that extended from his underarms to his torso.

==Enemies==
{{main|List of Spider-Man enemies}}
Spider-Man has one of the best-known [[rogues gallery|rogues galleries]] in comics. Spider-Man's most infamous and dangerous enemies are generally considered to be the  [[Green Goblin]], [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].<ref> {{cite web | author=Goldstein, Hilary|date=2006-02-01|title = Spider-Man villain poll| work = [[IGN]]| url = http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/684/684904p5.html| accessdate = 2006-10-01}}</ref> Others include the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mysterio]], the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], [[Hydro-Man]], the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], and [[Morlun]]. As with Spider-Man, the majority of these villains' powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and they tend to have animal-themed costumes or powers. At times these villains have formed groups such as the [[Sinister Six]] to oppose Spider-Man.

==Supporting characters==

{{main|Spider-Man supporting characters}}

Spider-Man was conceived as an ordinary person given great power, and the comics detail his civilian life, friends, family and romances as much as his super-heroic adventures.

Some of the more important and well-known members of his extensive supporting cast include: <!-- keep this list as short as possible please! Additions should be added to 'Spider-Man supporting characters' -->
*[[Aunt May]] – Peter Parker's loving aunt, who, along with her husband Uncle Ben, raised him after his parents died. After the murder of her husband, May is virtually his only family, and they are very close.
*[[Uncle Ben]] - Peter Parker's uncle and father figure. He is tragically murdered by a burglar that Peter had allowed to escape before. Peter believes that his uncle's death was morally his fault, and he decides to use his powers responsibly and become a super-hero.
*[[Mary Jane Watson]] – Originally merely Gwen Stacy's competition, 'MJ' eventually became Peter's best friend and wife. Her marriage to Peter was later erased due to a [[Spider-Man: One More Day|deal]] made with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to save Aunt May's life. She remains married to him in the [[MC2]] canon and the Spider-Man newspaper strip.

*[[J. Jonah Jameson]] – The irascible publisher of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' newspaper. While he employs Peter Parker as a photographer, he is also Spider-Man's greatest critic and largely responsible for public distrust of the hero. No longer owner of the Daily Bugle, Dexter Bennett is.
*[[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]] – Editor-in-chief at the ''Daily Bugle'', a moderating influence on Jameson, and a father figure to Peter after Uncle Ben's death. Currently working for front lines with Ben Urich
*[[Betty Brant]] – Secretary at the Daily Bugle who was once in love with Peter.
*[[Gwen Stacy]] – Peter's college girlfriend, who is tragically killed by the [[Green Goblin]] after she refused to give custody of her children to their biological father Norman Osborn, (the Goblin's true identity), who she had an intimate relationship with behind Peter's back.
*[[Flash Thompson]] – Peter Parker's high school [[bullying|tormentor]], later one of his closest friends. Due to brain damage, he suffered [[amnesia]] and regressed to his bullying personality, though he eventually recovered from this.
*[[Harry Osborn]] – Peter's best friend in college, who eventually follows his father's footsteps and becomes the second [[Green Goblin]], ultimately resulting in his death. He was resurrected due to the erasure of Peter's marriage to Mary Jane, and all related events, from history. 
*[[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat, Felicia Hardy]] – a reformed cat burglar who was Spider-Man's girlfriend and partner at one point, but rejected him when he revealed his identity to her, as she was only interested in his costumed persona. She eventually learned to love Peter on his own merit, but never on the level she loved Spider-Man.

Spider-Man has become Marvel's flagship character, and has often been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1991, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' announced "Spider-Man is coming to [[Wall Street]]"; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange.<ref>Wright, p. 254</ref>  When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11th, 2001 attacks]], the company settled on the December 2001 issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Yarbrough, Beau | year=2001-09-24 | title=Marvel to Take on World Trade Center Attack in 'Amazing Spider-Man'| work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=418 | accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the revealing of the character's secret identity,<ref>{{cite web | author= Staff|date=2006-06-15| title=Spider-Man Removes Mask at Last | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5084326.stm | accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> an event detailed in a full page story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' before the issue containing the story was even released.<ref>{{cite web | author= Brady, Matt| date=2006-06-14| title=New York Post Spoils Civil War #2  | work=[[Newsarama]] | url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/CivilWar/CivilWar2_End.html | accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>

{{note_label|Lee|1a|1a}}Stan Lee, 1986: "He gave me 1,000 reasons why Spider-Man would never work. Nobody likes spiders; it sounds too much like Superman; and how could a teenager be a superhero? Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy, someone who makes mistakes, who worries, who gets acne, has trouble with his girlfriend, things like that. [Goodman replied,] 'He's a hero! He's not an average man!' I said, "No, we make him an average man who happens to have super powers, that's what will make him good'. He told me I was crazy".
::''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' interview, quoted in ''The Steve Ditko Reader'' by [[Greg Theakston]] (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, NY; ISBN 1-56685-011-8), p. 12 (unnumbered)
 
{{note_label|Kirby1|1b|1b}}Jack Kirby, 1982: "Spider-Man was discussed between [[Joe Simon]] and myself. It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed. We had a strip called the 'The Silver Spider'. The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called ''Black Magic''. ''Black Magic'' folded with [[Crestwood]] (Simon & Kirby's 1950s comics company) and we were left with the script. I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider-Man, see, a superhero character. I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back... and I said Spider-Man would be a fine character to start with. But Joe had already moved on. So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan".
::"Shop Talk: Jack Kirby", ''[[Will Eisner]]'s [[The Spirit|Spirit]] Magazine'' #39 (Feb. 1982)

{{note_label|Simon1|1c|1c}}Joe Simon, 1990: "There were a few holes in Jack's never-dependable memory. For instance, there was no ''Black Magic'' involved at all. ... Jack brought in the Spider-Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider. Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb, gets his powers from the ring, and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider's old web-spinning pistol. Stan Lee said, 'Perfect, just what I want.' After obtaining permission from publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee told Kirby to pencil-up an origin story. Kirby... using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter... revamped the old Silver Spider script, including revisions suggested by Lee. But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages, it was Lee's turn to gripe. He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers. Kirby had him turn into... Captain America with cobwebs. He turned Spider-Man over to Steve Ditko, who... ignored Kirby's pages, tossed the character's magic ring, web-pistol and goggles... and completely redesigned Spider-Man's costume and equipment. In this life, he became high-school student Peter Parker, who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. ... Lastly, the Spider-Man logo was redone and a dashing hyphen added".
