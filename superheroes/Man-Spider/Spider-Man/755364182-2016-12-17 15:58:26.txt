'''Spider-Man''' (also sometimes called '''Spiderman''' and '''Spider Man''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]], and [[first appearance|first appeared]] in the [[anthology]] comic book ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]], and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|super strength and agility]], the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls "web-shooters", and react to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him to combat his foes.

When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of [[sidekick]] to the [[protagonist]]. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring '''Peter Parker''', the high school student behind Spider-Man's [[secret identity]] and with whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" young readers could relate.<ref name="Wright">{{Cite book|author=Wright, Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press : Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7450-5}}</ref> While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as [[Bucky]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like [[Captain America]] and [[Batman]]; he thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later [[retcon|retroactively attributed]] to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.

Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several [[List of Spider-Man titles|comic book series]], the first and longest-lasting of which is titled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy, nerdy high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Marvel's flagship superhero team. Spider-Man's nemesis [[Doctor Octopus]] also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following [[Dying Wish|a body swap plot]] in which Peter appears to die.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/comics/exclusive-spider-man-alter-ego-peter-parker-return-death-article-1.1575793|title=Exclusive: Peter Parker to return from death in 'Amazing Spider-Man' #1 this April|publisher=New York Daily News|last=Sacks|first=Ethan|date=12 January 2014}}</ref> Separately, Marvel has also published books featuring [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate versions of Spider-Man]], including ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'', which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in [[Ultimate Marvel|an alternate universe]]; and ''[[Ultimate Comics Spider-Man]]'', which depicts the teenager [[Miles Morales]], who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death.

===Creation and development===
[[File:Spider Strikes v1n1 i05 Wentworth.png|thumb|right|Richard Wentworth a.k.a. the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] in the pulp magazine ''The Spider''. Stan Lee stated that it was the name of this character that inspired him to create a character that would become Spider-Man.<ref name="LeeMair"/>]]
In 1962, with the success of the [[Fantastic Four]], Marvel Comics editor and head writer [[Stan Lee]] was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.<ref name="DeFalco">{{Cite book|author=[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]; [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|editor=O'Neill, Cynthia|title=Spider-Man: The Ultimate Guide|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=New York|isbn=0-7894-7946-X|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|1}} In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman [[pulp magazine]] crime fighter the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] (see also [[The Spider's Web]] and [[The Spider Returns]]) as a great influence,<ref name="LeeMair">{{Cite book|author=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]; Mair, George|title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee|publisher=Fireside|year=2002|isbn=0-684-87305-2}}</ref>{{rp|130}} and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a [[spider]] climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.<ref group="note">{{Cite book|author=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]; Mair, George|title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee|publisher=Fireside|year=2002|isbn=0-684-87305-2|quote=He goes further in his biography, claiming that even while pitching the concept to publisher Martin Goodman, "I can't remember if that was literally true or not, but I thought it would lend a big color to my pitch."}}</ref> Though at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name "Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.<ref name="alter104">{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 3–45|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.<ref group="note">''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' interview with Stan Lee, quoted in ''The Steve Ditko Reader'' by [[Greg Theakston]] (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, NY; ISBN 1-56685-011-8), p. 12 (unnumbered). "He gave me 1,000 reasons why Spider-Man would never work. Nobody likes spiders; it sounds too much like Superman; and how could a teenager be a superhero? Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy, someone who makes mistakes, who worries, who gets acne, has trouble with his girlfriend, things like that. [Goodman replied,] 'He's a hero! He's not an average man!' I said, 'No, we make him an average man who happens to have super powers, that's what will make him good.' He told me I was crazy".</ref> Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series ''Amazing Adult Fantasy,'' which was renamed ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' for that single issue, #15 ([[cover-date]]d August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).<ref name=gcd-af>[http://www.comics.org/series/1514/ ''Amazing Fantasy'' (Marvel, 1962 series)] at the Grand Comics Database: "1990 copyright renewal lists the publication date as June 5, 1962"; "[T]he decision to cancel the series had not been made when it went to print, since it is announced that future issues will include a Spider-Man feature."</ref> In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that ''Amazing Fantasy'' would be cancelled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.<ref name="alter104"/> While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spiderman [sic] ... will appear every month in ''Amazing''."<ref name=gcd-af /><ref>"Important Announcement from the Editor!", ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Aug. 1962), reprinted at {{cite book | first=Cory, ed. | last= Sedlmeier | title = Amazing Fantasy Omnibus | publisher = Marvel Publishing | year= 2007 | isbn = 978-0785124580 | page = 394}}</ref>

Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept, and approached artist [[Jack Kirby]]. As comics historian [[Greg Theakston]] recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with [[Joe Simon]] in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.<ref name="Theakston" /> Steve Ditko would be the inker.<ref group="note">{{Cite book|author=Ditko, Steve|authorlink=Steve Ditko|title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection|editor=Roy Thomas|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2000|isbn=1-893905-06-3|editor-link= Roy Thomas}} "'Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in #15 [of what became titled ''Amazing Fantasy'']. He would be called Spider-Man. Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character.' At this point still, Stan said Spider-Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero—Spider-Man. I said it sounded like the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]], which Joe Simon had done for [[Archie Comics]]. Stan called Jack about it but I don't know what was discussed. I never talked to Jack about Spider-Man... Later, at some point, I was given the job of drawing Spider-Man'".</ref> When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I ''hated'' the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".<ref name="Theakston">{{Cite book|author=Theakston, Greg|title=The Steve Ditko Reader|publisher=Pure Imagination|location=Brooklyn, NY|year=2002|isbn=1-56685-011-8}}</ref>{{rp|12}} Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
{{quote|One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....<ref name="ditko-history"/>}}

Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.<ref name=gcd-af /> As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B_lZovnpi13JNWQ5MDJmOTgtZDMzYy00MzI3LTllYjctNmM0ZWE4NjgyOWEx&hl=en_US | title= Deposition of Stan Lee|publisher = United States District Court, Southern District of New York: "Marvel Worldwide, Inc., et al., vs. Lisa R. Kirby, et al."| page= 37|location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]|date=December 8, 2010}}</ref>

In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in ''Comic Fan'' #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal."<ref name=comicfan2>{{cite web|archivedate=April 30, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430081615/www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html |author=Ditko interview|title=Steve Ditko - A Portrait of the Master|url= http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html| publisher= ''Comic Fan'' #2 (Larry Herndon) via Ditko.Comics.org (Blake Bell, ed.)|date=Summer 1965|accessdate=2008-04-03}} Additional [http://www.webcitation.org/65nM6oj4b WebCitation archive], February 28, 2012.</ref> At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] artist [[Eric Stanton]], an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands."<ref name="Theakston" />{{rp|14}}
[[File:Amazing Fantasy 15.jpg|thumb|''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Aug. 1962). The issue that first introduced the fictional character. It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero and inspired the launch of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' comic book. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] (penciller) and [[Steve Ditko]] (inker).]]
Kirby disputed Lee's version of the story, and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and [[Joe Simon]], who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the [[Crestwood Publications]] comic ''Black Magic,'' who was subsequently not used.<ref group="note">Jack Kirby in "Shop Talk: Jack Kirby", ''[[Will Eisner]]'s [[The Spirit|Spirit]] Magazine'' #39 (February 1982): "Spider-Man was discussed between [[Joe Simon]] and myself. It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed. We had a strip called 'The Silver Spider.' The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called ''Black Magic.'' ''Black Magic'' folded with [[Crestwood Publications|Crestwood]] (Simon & Kirby's 1950s comics company) and we were left with the script. I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider-Man, see, a superhero character. I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back... and I said Spider-Man would be a fine character to start with. But Joe had already moved on. So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan".</ref> Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that ''Black Magic'' was not a factor, and that he (Simon) devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's [[Archie Comics]] superhero the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Simon|first=Joe|title=Joe Simon: My Life in Comics|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|year= 2011|location= London, UK| isbn = 978-1-84576-930-7}}</ref> Artist [[Steve Ditko]] stated that Lee liked the name [[Hawkman]] from [[DC Comics]], and that "Spider-Man" was an outgrowth of that interest.<ref name="ditko-history">{{Cite book|author=Ditko, Steve|authorlink=Steve Ditko|title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection|editor=Roy Thomas|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2000|isbn=1-893905-06-3|editor-link= Roy Thomas}}</ref>

Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon's description, "[[Captain America]] with cobwebs".<ref group="note">Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. ''The Comic Book Makers'' (Crestwood/II, 1990) ISBN 1-887591-35-4. "There were a few holes in Jack's never-dependable memory. For instance, there was no ''Black Magic'' involved at all. ... Jack brought in the Spider-Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider. Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb, gets his powers from the ring, and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider's old web-spinning pistol. Stan Lee said, 'Perfect, just what I want.' After obtaining permission from publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee told Kirby to pencil-up an origin story. Kirby... using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter... revamped the old Silver Spider script, including revisions suggested by Lee. But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages, it was Lee's turn to gripe. He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers. Kirby had him turn into... Captain America with cobwebs. He turned Spider-Man over to Steve Ditko, who... ignored Kirby's pages, tossed the character's magic ring, web-pistol and goggles... and completely redesigned Spider-Man's costume and equipment. In this life, he became high-school student Peter Parker, who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. ... Lastly, the Spider-Man logo was redone and a dashing hyphen added".</ref> Writer [[Mark Evanier]] notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 and the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to also draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, "always busy".<ref name="Evanier">{{Cite book|author=[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]; [[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]]|year=2008|title=Kirby: King of Comics|publisher=Abrams|location=|isbn=0-8109-9447-X}}</ref>{{rp|127}} Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man as drawn and envisioned by Kirby was too similar to the Fly.<ref name="Evanier" />{{rp|127}}

Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that, "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that "[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed. "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as "the first [[work for hire]] artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man".<ref>Bell, Blake. ''Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko'' (2008). Fantagraphic Books.p.54-57.</ref> Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who "got ''Spider-Man'' to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did".<ref>Skelly, Tim.

May 2002, Fantagraphics Books. p. 16</ref> Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]".<ref>Ross, Jonathon. ''In Search of Steve Ditko'', BBC 4, September 16, 2007.</ref> He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character.<ref name="alter104"/> Writer Al Nickerson believes "that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar with today [but that] ultimately, Spider-Man came into existence, and prospered, through the efforts of not just one or two, but many, comic book creators".<ref>Nickerson, Al.

===Commercial success===
A few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it to have been one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.<ref name="Daniels">{{Cite book|author=Daniels, Les|authorlink=Les Daniels|title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher=Harry N.

In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Magazine|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', a proto-[[graphic novel]] designed to appeal to older readers. It only lasted for two issues, but it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' [[annual publication|summer annuals]] that began in 1964.<ref>Saffel, Steve.

An early 1970s Spider-Man story led to the revision of the [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of [[illegal drugs]], even negatively. However, in 1970, the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}} Lee chose the top-selling [[Green Goblin Reborn!|''The Amazing Spider-Man;'' issues #96–98]] (May–July 1971) feature a [[story arc]] depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend [[Harry Osborn]] becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}}

In 1972, a second monthly [[ongoing series]] starring Spider-Man began: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]],'' in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and villains.<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 60|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote=  Spider-Man was a proven hit, so Marvel decided to expand the wall-crawler's horizons with a new Spider-Man title...Its first issue featured Spidey teaming up with the Human Torch against the Sandman in a Christmas tale written by Roy Thomas with art by Ross Andru.}}</ref> From that point on there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Spider-Man spider-bite.jpg|thumb|left|The spider bite that gave Peter Parker his powers. ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15, art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
In [[Forest Hills, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]],<ref name=kempton /> [[high school]] student Peter Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his [[Uncle Ben]] and [[Aunt May]]. As depicted in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a [[radioactive]] [[spider]] (erroneously classified as an [[insect]] in the panel) at a science exhibit and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an [[arachnid]]".<ref name="Debut">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | artist=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] | story= | title=[[Amazing Fantasy]] | issue=15 |date = Aug 1962| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | location=[[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] }}</ref> Along with super strength, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a novelty television star. However, "He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing [[Burglar (comics)|thief]], [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben." Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, "With great power there must also come—great responsibility!"<ref name=daniels95>[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]].

From 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest.

{{quote box|width=33%|quote="People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera. What Lee and Ditko actually did in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character's life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers' lives than thwarting this month's bad guys.... Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one, falling in love for the first time, struggling to make a living, and undergoing crises of conscience."|source=Comics historian [[Peter Sanderson]]<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]].

As one contemporaneous journalist observed, "Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked [[inferiority complex]], and a fear of women. He is [[Antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], {{sic}} [[castration]]-ridden, racked with [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal guilt]], and accident-prone ... [a] functioning [[neurosis|neurotic]]".<ref name=kempton>Kempton, Sally, "Spiderman's {{sic}} Dilemma: Super-Anti-Hero in Forest Hills", ''[[The Village Voice]]'', April 1, 1965</ref> Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.<ref name=daniels96>Daniels, p. 96</ref>

Notes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,

{{blockquote|Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', launches an editorial campaign against the "Spider-Man menace." The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's ''Daily Bugle''.<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|212}}}}

The mid-1960s stories reflected the political tensions of the time, as early 1960s Marvel stories had often dealt with the [[Cold War]] and [[Communism]].<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|220–223}} As Wright observes,

{{blockquote|From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant [[student demonstration]]s at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|234–235}}}}

{{Main|Alternative versions of Spider-Man}}

In ''The Creation of Spider-Man'', comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers "nothing too original"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a "nerdy high school student".<ref name="Kupperberg" />{{rp|5}} Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included "heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama".

 |quote  = The culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes. He's got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he’s more relatable than playboy billionaire [[Iron Man]]. And he's an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like [[Captain America]]. Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.
