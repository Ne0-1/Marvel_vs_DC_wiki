'''Spider-Man''' ('''Peter Parker''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], and [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 ([[1962]]). He has since become one of the world's most popular superheroes.

Spider-Man is the quintessential Marvel character. Blessed with extraordinary, [[spider]]-like superpowers, Peter Parker is beset by the travails and problems of ordinary life. His powers give him the ability to do good, but seriously complicate his career and personal relationships. In spite of this, he feels a strong duty to continue his crusade against crime and corruption. The theme of the Spider-Man series is ''"With great power comes great responsibility."''

The character expanded the dramatic potential of the [[fantasy]] [[subgenre]] by proving that a series with a strong focus on a more human character and his personal struggles was a viable basis for a successful series.

Spider-Man is tremendously popular and is perhaps the most recognizable superhero outside of [[DC Comics]]â€™ canon. Throughout the years, he has appeared in a handful of [[animated series]], a weekly [[comic strip]] and, recently, two successful [[film]]s.

Meanwhile, Marvel has published several [[comic book]] series featuring the character (most notably ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''). The character has grown from shy high school kid to troubled college student to married man, but has always continued his mission as Spider-Man at all costs.

==Creation of Character==
[[Image:Amazing_fantasy_15.bmp|right|190px|thumb|''Amazing Fantasy #15'' (1962), the first appearance and origin story of Spider-Man with cover art by [[Jack Kirby]]]]
According to Stan Lee, the idea for the series sprang out of the apparent increased teenage interest in the new Marvel comics characters and so he decided to create a character that could cater to them specifically.

One of the influences for the character came from the [[pulp magazine]], [[The Spider]], and perhaps from an earlier minor spider-themed character, the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]] from [[DC Comics]].  When [[Martin Goodman]] was presented with the concept, he was resistant to the unorthodox ideas of a teenage hero with troubled personal life, but allowed the character to be used as a cover story for a dying anthology title, ''Amazing Fantasy'', since content mattered little for a title slated to be cancelled.

Originally, Lee assigned [[Jack Kirby]] to illustrate the story, but after seeing his designs, Lee decided that Jack's style was "too larger than life" for what he wanted.  Thus, Lee assigned artist Steve Ditko, who found the concept particularly appealing and developed a visual motif that Lee found satisfactory.

The story was released in ''Amazing Fantasy #15'', and months later, the sales figures revealed that the cover story was unexpectedly popular. Goodman called for a regular series for the character to capitalize on his overwhelming success.

==Character history==
'''Peter Benjamin Parker''' was born to Richard Parker and his wife Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker, both of whom were agents of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and later of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (a fictional secret agency). Their last assignment was the infiltration as double-agents of the organization of Albert Malik, who had taken on the name of [[Red Skull]] in the absence of the original. Albert found out about their plans and arranged a plane-crash that resulted in their deaths.

After his parents' death the infant Peter Parker was left in the care of his [[Uncle Ben]] and [[Aunt May]] (Richard's older brother Benjamin Parker and his wife May Reilly-Parker), who were both in the [[Forest Hills]] neighborhood of [[Queens]], [[New York, New York|New York City]]. Ben immediately took to the role of the boy's father but May was at first reluctant. She still remembered her parents blaming her own birth for the destruction of their marriage, and she was afraid that Peter might signal the end of her own marriage. In time, however, she warmed up to Peter, who unexpectedly strengthened the couple's marriage. Though Peter was always loved by the aging couple he was unpopular among those of his own age. Over time he grew to be a rather lonely, timid [[teenager]] who showed more interest in his studies and [[science]] in general than in any kind of social life. He was often the target of jokes by more popular fellow students like [[Flash Thompson]], the high-school's star athlete.

When he was 16 years old, Parker attended a science exhibit where he was bitten by a [[spider]] which had been [[radiation|irradiated]]. The spider bite gave Parker an array of [[superhuman]] powers, including the proportional speed, strength and agility of a spider, a so-called "spider-sense" that would warn him of impending danger, a fast-healing ability that allows him to quickly recover from injuries and poisons, and the ability to stick to walls. A lesser effect was the improvement of his eyesight. Originally near-sighted and bespectacled, he now has perfect vision.

In addition to his physical powers, Spider-Man used mechanical web shooters to spin webs in a variety of ways. Current Spider-Man [[continuity]] has given him organic web shooters like those seen in the ''Spider-Man'' movies.

Though the death of a loved one is a commonplace motive for crime-fighting in comics, Spider-Man is driven by guilt rather than revenge. Initially, Parker designed a costume and adopted the identity of Spider-Man in order to win money as a wrestler. His ego grew with his fame, and when he had the chance to stop a thief, Parker chose to do nothing, feeling he no longer had to look after anyone but himself. Upon learning that his beloved Uncle Ben had been killed by a burglar, Parker charged into action as Spider-Man. To his horror, he learned that the burglar who had killed his Uncle Ben was the same thief he had earlier allowed to escape. He devoted himself to fighting injustice in memory of his uncle, driven by the sense of responsibility the older man instilled in him. 

Spider-Man eternally tries to do the right thing, but is viewed with suspicion by many authority figures. He is often considered little more than a lawbreaker himself, thanks largely to a smear campaign by [[J. Jonah Jameson]], publisher of the daily newspaper the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. Ironically, Parker works as a [[freelance]] [[photographer]] for Jameson, selling photographs of himself as Spider-Man.

As originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Peter Parker was something of an [[everyman]] character. However, as with many characters spanning a lengthy publishing history and handled by multiple creators, Spider-Man's history is somewhat convoluted. He continued working as a freelance photographer for the ''Daily Bugle'' and living with his elderly and somewhat fragile Aunt May until he graduated from high school. He enrolled in the fictional [[Empire State University]] where he befriended [[Harry Osborn]], who was in fact the son of his arch-enemy the [[Green Goblin]], and [[Gwen Stacy]], with whom he would have a lengthy romance.

Stacy was eventually killed by the Green Goblin, who himself seemingly died soon thereafter in battle with Spider-Man. Parker eventually wed long-time friend, [[Mary Jane Watson]], an occasional [[fashion]] model and [[Actor|actress]], though not before he engaged in lengthy on-again off-again relationship with  semi-criminal [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].

This marriage did not overly affect his career as a crime-fighter, until it was discovered that she was pregnant. This caused him to retire for a time, turning the mantle of Spider-Man over to [[Ben Reilly]]. After Reilly was killed by the [[Green Goblin]] and his daughter apparently stillborn, he returned to the role (an alternate version of his daughter who survived later got her own title, set 15 years into the future, titled [[Spider-Girl]]). Later, the stresses of his dual identity coupled with Mary Jane's tempestuous career as a model/actress and capricious editorial mandates led to the two separating. However, the two later reconciled.

Currently, Parker works as a science teacher at his old [[high school]], lives in a Manhattan apartment, and receives the occasional visit from his Aunt May (who was at one point thought dead--but the elderly woman who died turned out to be an actress who impersonated her). She has since learned the truth about her nephew's secret identity.

==Superhuman powers==
The irradiated spider's bite caused a variety of physiological mutations in Peter Parker's body that mirror the characteristics of a spider.

His physical strength, agility, and reflexes were greatly improved. He gained a fast-healing ability that allows him to recover quickly from mild to moderate injuries (although nowhere near as quickly as [[X-Men|X-man]] [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]).  In addition, his vision also lost its [[myopia]].

Spider-Man also gained the ability to adhere to any smooth surface, allowing to him to support more than his own weight while on a vertical surface or upside down.  He can also grip any solid object with any part of his body as long as it can accommodate the mass of the object.  For instance, if he wanted to catch a ball, all he would really need is one fingertip to make contact.  It has been theorized that his body can consciously attract the basic molecules of a solid object when pressed against it.  Another idea is that this ability is similar to [[static electricity]].  However, the superhero has had trouble keeping his grip on heavily lubricated surfaces.

Spider-Man's most subtle power is his spider-sense.  A form of [[clairvoyance]] or sixth sense, it unconsciously activates and alerts him to any threat to himself, manifesting as a tingling at the back of his skull.  While it cannot tell him of the exact nature of the threat, Spider-Man can judge the severity of it by the intensity of the tingling.  For instance, if an enemy passes by Spider-Man with no intention of interacting with him, the spider-sense would give a low signal indicating that he should be alert for a possible danger.  On the other hand, if there is an immediate lethal physical danger to Parker such as a sniper is taking aim and about to fire for a kill shot, the spider-sense's tingling would take on an almost painful intensity to indicate a need to take extreme evasive action without hesitation.  

The spider-sense not only alerts Spider-Man to threats to his physical safety, but it also warns him to threats to his privacy such as being observed while changing identities.  Spider-Man also uses the spider-sense as a means to time his evasive maneuvers to the point where he can avoid multiple gunshots or [[machine gun]] fire.  When combined with his superhuman reflexes and agility, this makes him an extremely difficult target who is almost impossible to shoot in combat.  Extremely skilled martial artists taking Spidey on hand to hand often have better luck wounding him, although he's no slouch in that department either.

Although his spider-sense has saved his life innumerable times, Spider-Man has learned the hard way that it can be beaten.  For instance, the Green Goblin once secretly attacked him with a gas that temporarily suppressed this perceptive ability, allowing the supervillain to shadow him and learn his secret identity.  Additionally, the alien symbiotes [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] are not recognized by the spider-sense. This gives the supervillains an edge that Spider-Man often has trouble countering.

The phrase "My spider-sense is tingling" has since become an ironic [[catch phrase]] in American [[pop culture]].

In addition to his amazing powers, the famous Wall Crawler (a nickname for Spider-man. Other known nicknames for him is Web Slinger or Webhead) also has super strength. Spider-Man can lift 10 tons or more if he is under great stress or pressure.

Because of his strength, he can leap to great heights. Spider-Man can jump the width of a city block, or almost five stories straight up.

==Equipment==
Although he is usually of limited financial means, Spider-Man has developed personal equipment that plays an important role in his superhero career. 

===Web-shooters===
The most important of this equipment are his web-shooters.  They are wrist mounted guns that fire a strong [[adhesive]] of his own design.  The trigger rests in the palm, which is carefully positioned to prevent unwanted firings like when he is making a fist.

The default setting has the adhesive threaded through a special mesh to take on a [[spider web]] like design.  The substance dries almost immediately into a strong material that can support very heavy loads: into the one-[[ton]] range. Typical uses of his webs include creating long swing lines which he uses to travel through the cavernous chasms between the Manhattan high-rises.  He can change the setting to a wide spray to ensnare criminals, and to form protective shields or nets. He can also form crude objects with a heavy application.  In addition, when Spider-Man desires it, he can fire the web fluid as a straight liquid when he needs to use the substance's maximum adhesive strength.  However, the default meshed spray generally allows for sufficient strength while being more versatile in its use and easier to remove when desired.  The substance is formulated to dissolve after one hour which is generally sufficient time for Spider-Man's needs while ensuring the webs he makes do not cause undue litter.  In addition, Parker can modify the fluid formulation to suit particular specialized needs when called for. The web-shooters can also be used to expel other liquids, using interchangeable cartridges, but are only seldom used to do this.

===Spider tracers===
Spider-Man has also developed small electronic "spider-tracers" which allow him to track objects or individuals.  The outer casing is shaped like a spider and is designed to cling to a target without attracting attention.  While he originally threw his tracers at a target in the hopes that at least one hits, he later developed a wrist launcher which ejects tracers above the wrist while the web is fired from below to allow for more precise and reliable applications of the tracers.

Spider-Man originally used a small receiver device to follow the tracers.  However, he eventually learned that he could tune the tracer signal frequency to his own spider-sense for more convenient use, but the receiver is still used as a back-up and long-range measure.

===Other equipment===
Spider-Man keeps his regular field equipment in a specially designed utility belt that contains his web fluid cartridges and his tracers.  

It also carries his camera, which has an extended rear metal plate that allows him to use his web to position it without interfering with its functions.  The camera also has an automatic shutter mechanism linked to an internal motion detector so it will take a picture whenever Spider-Man moves in front of the camera lens.  

Finally, the belt contains a strong light called a Spider Signal that creates an image of his mask when activated.  He typically uses it not only for a light source, but as a way of unnerving opponents and to call attention.

In addition, the [[Human Torch]] once helped Spider-Man build a car called the Spidermobile which had a paint job and modifications that follow his spider motif.  Unfortunately, Spider-Man had never learned to drive and he crashed the car soon after receiving it.

Also, early on in his career, Peter bought a motorcycle.

==Adaptations==

===Television===

Spider-Man has been adapted to [[television]] numerous times, through a short-lived live-action [[television series]] and several animated cartoon series. The first was produced in [[1967]] by [[Grantray-Lawrence Animation]], which soon went bankrupt. In [[1968]], [[animator]] [[Ralph Bakshi]] took over. Bakshi's episodes, which suffered from extremely low budgets, were stylized and featured dark ominous settings and pervasive background music. One episode reused complete background animation, characters, and storyline from an episode of ''[[Rocket Robin Hood]]''. The series may be best remembered for its theme song. Spider-Man was voiced originally by [[Bernard Cowan]] and later by [[Paul Soles]].

Spider-Man was also an occasional character in the children's educational show ''[[The Electric Company]]'' which presented brief tales using a combination of animation and live action.

In [[1977]], a short-lived live action television series was produced, starring [[Nicholas Hammond]] in the title role.  Although the series earned good ratings, fans complained about its low-budget production values and its writing, which neither followed the comics' spirit nor provided adventures that were distinctively appropriate for the character. It also suffered from a sporadic broadcast schedule. The [[CBS|CBS Television Network]] cancelled it, along with ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', to avoid being called "the superhero network."

In [[1978]], a live action Spider-Man series was produced for [[Japan|Japanese]] television by [[Toei]], but apart from Spider-Man's costume it was not based on the original source.

In [[1980]], with the creation of the animation studio [[Marvel Productions Ltd|Marvel Productions Ltd.]], Marvel endeavored to translate more of their comic characters to television. Towards this end the cartoon series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' was created featuring Spider-Man, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] of the [[X-Men]], and a new character, [[Firestar]]. Actor [[Dan Gilvezan]] gave voice to this incarnation of the wall-crawler. In the early [[1990]]s, another successful series was made, with [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] providing the webslinger's voice.  This series had a bigger budget and followed the comic book continuity more closely. In [[2003]], another animated television series adaptation, this time using [[computer animation]] was produced by [[Mainframe Entertainment]] and broadcast on [[MTV]]; it featured characters and continuity from the 2002 ''[[Spider Man (movie)|Spider Man]]'' film, as well as the character [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] as depicted in the ''[[Daredevil]]'' film.

===Film===

In May [[2002 in film|2002]], the [[film]] ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' was released. It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and starred actor [[Tobey Maguire]] as Peter Parker. The film featured a number of impressive [[Computer generated image|CGI]] effects to bring Spider-Man to life. Though the film adaptation took a number of liberties with the character's history and powers, most notably giving him organic web-shooters rather than mechanical, it was essentially true to the character and was widely embraced by the viewing public. Earning more than $403 million at U.S. box offices, it was the highest-grossing movie of the year, outperforming ''[[Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Attack of the Clones]]'' (the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie not to be the biggest box-office hit of the year).  ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was released on [[June 30]], [[2004]]; ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' will be released on [[May 4]], [[2007]]. ''Spider-Man'' went on to become the fifth highest-grossing film in North American history -- not adjusting for inflation -- with a total take of more than $800 million internationally.

[[As of 2004|As of July 2004]], ''Spider-Man 2'' may be on track to become 2004's most financially successful movie -- perhaps even the highest-grossing release in history.

It has already broken a number of records. It premiered in more North American movie theaters than any previous movie. Its first-day gross ($40.5 million) surpassed its predecessor's $39.4 million record. The only higher single-day movie gross was ''[[Shrek 2]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s $44.8 million in the first weekend of its May 2004 release.

''Spider-Man 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s opening-day gross was even more impressive for occurring on a Wednesday, usually a weak day of the week for movies. The first ''Spider-Man''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s opening-day record was set on Friday, a more traditional opening day; ''Shrek 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s record-breaking day was the Saturday after the Wednesday of its release.

''Spider-Man 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s three-day weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) total failed to beat its predecessor's $114.8 million record, but its six-day $180.1 million total outpaced ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s $146.9 million mark.

===Video games===

Spider-Man first appeared in video game form in [[1982]], in the [[Parker Brothers]] game ''Spider-Man'' for the [[Atari 2600]].  Subsequently, Spider-Man games were created by [[Acclaim]], [[Sega]], [[Paragon Software Corporation]], [[LJN]], and [[Activision]] for various video game consoles over the years.  Spider-Man has also been featured as a character in several fighting games made by [[Capcom]], beginning with ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' and continuing in the [[Marvel vs. Capcom series|''Marvel vs. Capcom'' series]].

Most recently, the [[2004]] video game ''Spider-Man 2'' by Activision was released along with the ''Spider-Man 2'' movie.  Like the movie, it opened to critical and commercial success.
