'''Spider-Man''' is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]]. He [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962). Lee and Ditko conceived of the character as an orphan being raised by his [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]], and as a [[teenager]], having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using devices of his own invention which he called "web-shooters", and react to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him to combat his foes.

When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of [[sidekick]] to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a teenage high school student and person behind Spider-Man's [[secret identity]] to whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" young readers could relate.<ref name="Wright">{{Cite book|author=Wright, Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press : Baltimore|isbn=0801874505}}</ref> Unlike previous teen heroes such as [[Bucky]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], Spider-Man did not benefit from being the protégé of any adult mentors like [[Captain America]] and [[Batman]], and thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story, but later [[retcon|retroactively attributed]] to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.

Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several [[List of Spider-Man titles|comic book series]], the first and longest-lasting of which is titled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]].'' Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy, high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer, his most typical adult role. As of 2011, he is additionally a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], Marvel's flagship superhero teams. In the comics, Spider-Man is often referred to as "Spidey", "web-slinger", "wall-crawler", or "web-head".

Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Spider-Man is popular.|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101230&page=1|accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref> As Marvel's flagship character and company mascot, he has appeared in many forms of media, including several animated and live-action [[Spider-Man television series|television shows]], [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspaper [[The Amazing Spider-Man#Newspaper comic strip|comic strips]], and a [[Spider-Man in film|series of films]] starring [[Tobey Maguire]] as the "friendly neighborhood" hero in the first three movies.

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
[[File:Spider Strikes v1n1 i05 Wentworth.png|thumb|right|Richard Wentworth a.k.a. the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] in the pulp magazine ''The Spider''. Stan Lee stated that it was the name of this character that inspired him to create a character that would become Spider-Man.<ref name="LeeMair"/>]]
In 1962, with the success of the [[Fantastic Four]], Marvel Comics editor and head writer [[Stan Lee]] was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.<ref name="DeFalco" />{{rp|1}} In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman [[pulp magazine]] crime fighter the [[Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider]] as a great influence,<ref name="LeeMair">{{Cite book|author=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]; Mair, George|title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee|publisher=Fireside|year=2002|isbn=0-684-87305-2}}</ref>{{rp|130}} and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a [[spider]] climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.<ref group="note">{{Cite book|author=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]; Mair, George|title=Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee|publisher=Fireside|year=2002|isbn=0-684-87305-2|quote=He goes further in his biography, claiming that even while pitching the concept to publisher Martin Goodman, "I can't remember if that was literally true or not, but I thought it would lend a big color to my pitch."}}</ref> Looking back on the creation of Spider-Man, 1990s Marvel editor-in-chief [[Tom DeFalco]] stated he did not believe that Spider-Man would have been given a chance in today's comics world, where new characters are vetted with test audiences and marketers.<ref name="DeFalco">{{Cite book|author=[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]; [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|editor=O'Neill, Cynthia|title=Spider-Man: The Ultimate Guide|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=New York|isbn=078947946X|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|9}} At that time, however, Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] for the character's approval.<ref name="DeFalco" />{{rp|9}} In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.<ref group="note">''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' interview with Stan Lee, quoted in ''The Steve Ditko Reader'' by [[Greg Theakston]] (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, NY; ISBN 1-56685-011-8), p. 12 (unnumbered). "He gave me 1,000 reasons why Spider-Man would never work. Nobody likes spiders; it sounds too much like Superman; and how could a teenager be a superhero? Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy, someone who makes mistakes, who worries, who gets acne, has trouble with his girlfriend, things like that. [Goodman replied,] 'He's a hero! He's not an average man!' I said, 'No, we make him an average man who happens to have super powers, that's what will make him good.' He told me I was crazy".</ref> Goodman eventually agreed to let Lee try out Spider-Man in the upcoming final issue of the canceled science-fiction and supernatural anthology series ''Amazing Adult Fantasy,'' which was renamed ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' for that single issue, #15 (Aug. 1962).<ref name="Daniels">{{Cite book|author=Daniels, Les|authorlink=Les Daniels|title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher=Harry N.

<!--add in info about approving the character -->

Comics historian [[Greg Theakston]] says that Lee, after receiving Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept, approached artist [[Jack Kirby]]. Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he collaborated with [[Joe Simon]] in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference" and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker.<ref group="note">{{Cite book|author=Ditko, Steve|authorlink=Steve Ditko|title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection|editor=Roy Thomas|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2000|isbn=1893905063|editor-link= Roy Thomas}} "'Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in #15 [of what became titled ''Amazing Fantasy'']. He would be called Spider-Man. Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character.' At this point still, 'Stan said Spider-Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero—Spider-Man. I said it sounded like the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]], which Joe Simon had done for [[Archie Comics]]. Stan called Jack about it but I don't know what was discussed. I never talked to Jack about Spider-Man... Later, at some point, I was given the job of drawing Spider-Man'".</ref> When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I ''hated'' the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".<ref name="Theakston">{{Cite book|author=Theakston, Greg|title=The Steve Ditko Reader|publisher=Pure Imagination|location=Brooklyn, NY|year=2002|isbn=1-56685-011-8}}</ref>{{rp|12}} Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
{{blockquote|One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....<ref name="ditko-history"/>}} Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.<ref name=gcd-af>[http://www.comics.org/series/1514/ ''Amazing Fantasy''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B_lZovnpi13JNWQ5MDJmOTgtZDMzYy00MzI3LTllYjctNmM0ZWE4NjgyOWEx&hl=en_US | title= Deposition of Stan Lee|publisher = United States District Court, Southern District of New York: "Marvel Worldwide, Inc., et al., vs. Lisa R. Kirby, et al."| page= 37|location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]|date=December 8, 2010}}</ref>

In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in ''Comic Fan'' #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal."<ref>{{cite web|author=Ditko, Steve; Martin, Gary|year=1965|url=http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html|title= Steve Ditko - A Portrait of the Master|work=Comic Fan #2, Summer 1965|accessdate=2008-04-03}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] artist [[Eric Stanton]], an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands".<ref name="Theakston" />{{rp|14}}

Kirby disputed Lee's version of the story, and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and [[Joe Simon]], who in the 1950s had developed a character called The Silver Spider for the [[Crestwood Publications|Crestwood]] comic ''Black Magic,'' who was subsequently not used.<ref group="note">Jack Kirby in "Shop Talk: Jack Kirby", ''[[Will Eisner]]'s [[The Spirit|Spirit]] Magazine'' #39 (February 1982): "Spider-Man was discussed between [[Joe Simon]] and myself. It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed. We had a strip called 'The Silver Spider.' The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called ''Black Magic.'' ''Black Magic'' folded with [[Crestwood Publications|Crestwood]] (Simon & Kirby's 1950s comics company) and we were left with the script. I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider-Man, see, a superhero character. I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back... and I said Spider-Man would be a fine character to start with. But Joe had already moved on. So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan".</ref> Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that ''Black Magic'' was not a factor, and that he (Simon) devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's [[Archie Comics]] superhero the [[Fly (Red Circle Comics)|Fly]]. Artist [[Steve Ditko]] stated that Lee liked the name [[Hawkman]] from [[DC Comics]], and that "Spider-Man" was an outgrowth of that interest.<ref name="ditko-history">{{Cite book|author=Ditko, Steve|authorlink=Steve Ditko|title=Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection|editor=Roy Thomas|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year= 2000|isbn=1893905063|editor-link= Roy Thomas}}</ref> The hyphen was included in the character's name to avoid confusion with DC Comics' [[Superman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehotspotonline.com/blahblah/articles/spidy.htm |title=Spider-Man: The Birth of an Icon |publisher=thehotspotonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref>

Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon's description, "[[Captain America]] with cobwebs".<ref group="note">Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. ''The Comic Book Makers'' (Crestwood/II, 1990) ISBN 1-887591-35-4. "There were a few holes in Jack's never-dependable memory. For instance, there was no ''Black Magic'' involved at all. ... Jack brought in the Spider-Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider. Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb, gets his powers from the ring, and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider's old web-spinning pistol. Stan Lee said, 'Perfect, just what I want.' After obtaining permission from publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee told Kirby to pencil-up an origin story. Kirby... using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter... revamped the old Silver Spider script, including revisions suggested by Lee. But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages, it was Lee's turn to gripe. He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers. Kirby had him turn into... Captain America with cobwebs. He turned Spider-Man over to Steve Ditko, who... ignored Kirby's pages, tossed the character's magic ring, web-pistol and goggles... and completely redesigned Spider-Man's costume and equipment. In this life, he became high-school student Peter Parker, who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. ... Lastly, the Spider-Man logo was redone and a dashing hyphen added".</ref> Writer [[Mark Evanier]] notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 and the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to also draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, "always busy".<ref name="Evanier">{{Cite book|author=[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]; [[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]]|year=2008|title=Kirby: King of Comics|publisher=Abrams|location=|isbn=081099447X}}</ref>{{rp|127}} Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man as drawn and envisioned by Kirby was too similar to the Fly.<ref name="Evanier" />{{rp|127}}

Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that, "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that "[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed. "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as "the first [[work for hire]] artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man".<ref>Bell, Blake. ''Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko'' (2008). Fantagraphic Books.p.54-57.</ref> Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who "got ''Spider-Man'' to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did".<ref>Skelly, Tim.

===Commercial success===

A few months after Spider-Man's introduction in ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Aug. 1962), publisher Martin Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it to have been one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.<ref name="Daniels" />{{rp|97}} A solo [[ongoing series]] followed, beginning with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|211}} with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] alongside [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Che Guevara]] as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was "beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us."<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|223}} Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), [[John Romita, Sr.]] replaced him as [[penciler]] and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Magazine|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', a proto-[[graphic novel]] designed to appeal to older readers but which lasted only two issues.<ref>Saffel, Steve. ''Spider-Man the Icon: The Life and Times of a Pop Culture Phenomenon'' ([[Titan Books]], 2007) ISBN 978-1-84576-324-4, "A Not-So-Spectacular Experiment", p. 31</ref> Nonetheless, it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' [[annual publication|summer annuals]] that began in 1964.

An early 1970s Spider-Man story led to the revision of the [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of [[illegal drugs]], even negatively. However, in 1970, the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}} Lee chose the top-selling [[Green Goblin Reborn!|''The Amazing Spider-Man;'' issues #96–98]] (May–July 1971) feature a [[story arc]] depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend [[Harry Osborn]] becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|239}}

In 1972, a second monthly [[ongoing series]] starring Spider-Man began: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]],'' in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and villains. In 1976, his second solo series, ''[[Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' began running parallel to the main series. A third series featuring Spider-Man, ''[[Web of Spider-Man]],'' launched in 1985, replacing ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''. The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, the "adjectiveless" ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' (with the storyline "[[Torment (comics)|Torment]]"), written and drawn by popular artist [[Todd McFarlane]], debuted with several different covers, all with the same interior content. The various versions combined sold over 3 million copies, an industry record at the time. There have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. Several [[limited series]], [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]], and loosely related comics have also been published, and Spider-Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic series.<ref name="Wright" />{{rp|279}}

The original ''Amazing Spider-Man'' ran through issue #441 (Nov. 1998). Writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] then revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series ''[[Spider-Man: Chapter One]]'' (Dec. 1998 - Oct. 1999, with an issue #0 midway through and some months containing two issues), similar to Byrne's adding details and some revisions to Superman's origin in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]''.<ref name="Byrne">{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=151=article | title=John Byrne: The Hidden Story | publisher=Comic book resources | accessdate=May 27, 2011 | author=Michael Thomas}}</ref> Running concurrently, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' was restarted with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999). With what would have been vol. 2, #59, Marvel reintroduced the original numbering, starting with #500 (Dec. 2003).

By the end of 2007, Spider-Man regularly appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man,'' ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'', ''[[Spider-Man Family]]'', and various limited series in mainstream Marvel Comics continuity, as well as in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] series ''[[Spider-Girl|The Amazing Spider-Girl]],'' the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] title ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]],'' the alternate-universe [[Preadolescence|tween]] series ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]],'' the alternate-universe children's series ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'', and ''[[Marvel Adventures: The Avengers]].''

When primary series ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' reached issue #545 (Dec. 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' three times monthly, beginning with #546-549 (each Jan. 2008). The three times monthly scheduling of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' lasted until November 2010 when the comic book was increased from 22 pages to 30 pages each issue and published only twice a month, beginning with #648-649 (each Nov. 2010). The following year (Nov. 2011) Marvel started publishing ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' as the first spin-off ongoing series in addition to the still twice monthly ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' since the previous ones were cancelled at the end of 2007.

{{quote box|width=33%|quote="People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera. What Lee and Ditko actually did in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character's life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers' lives than thwarting this month's bad guys....

As one contemporaneous journalist observed, "Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked [[inferiority complex]], and a fear of women. He is [[Antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], [sic] [[castration]]-ridden, racked with [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal guilt]], and accident-prone ...

Notes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,
{{blockquote|Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', launches an editorial campaign against the "Spider-Man menace." The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's ''[[Daily Bugle]]''.<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|212}}}}

The mid-1960s stories reflected the political tensions of the time, as early 1960s Marvel stories had often dealt with the [[Cold War]] and [[Communism]].<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|220-223}} As Wright observes,
{{blockquote|From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant [[student demonstration]]s at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University. ... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.<ref name="Wright"/>{{rp|234-235}}}}

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Spider-Man}}
Due to Spider-Man's popularity in the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], publishers have been able to introduce different variations of Spider-Man outside of mainstream comics as well as reimagined stories in many other [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiversed]] spinoffs such as ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man: India]]''. Marvel has also made its own parodies of Spider-Man in comics such as ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'', which was published in the late 1960s and featured such characters as Peter Pooper alias Spidey-Man,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/180/ |title=examples of "Not Brand Echh" comics |publisher=Dialbforblog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> and Peter Porker, the Spectacular [[Spider-Ham]], who appeared in the 1980s. The fictional character has also inspired a number of deratives such as a [[Spider-Man: The Manga|manga version of Spider-Man]] drawn by
