'''Nocturna''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. The first storyline involving her began in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #529 (August 1983), but her first appearance is credited to ''[[Batman]]'' #363 (September 1983), where she is first actually seen and mentioned by name.  Nocturna was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Gene Colan]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
'''Natalia Knight''' had a hard childhood. She grew up on the streets as a beggar. She was eventually found and taken in by Charles Knight, who adopted her and provided her with a life of luxury.

She has a passion for [[astronomy]] and the night and eventually found a job at [[Gotham City]] Observatory. While working there one night, she became victim to a [[radioactive]] laser, which drained her skin of all [[pigment]]. It also rendered her sensitive to light.

After Charles Knight was murdered, she discovered that her lifestyle was funded by criminal activity. It was then that she met Charles' son, Anton Knight, who fell in love with her. They both decided to keep the inheritance and took it upon themselves to keep them in their accustomed lifestyle through burglary, since Natalia needed expensive medical equipment to treat her pigmentation.

Anton, having spent much time in [[Asia]], proved to be a highly capable [[martial arts|martial artist]]. He and Natalia entered a life of crime together, he as the [[Nightslayer|Night-Thief]], and she as "Nocturna", Mistress of the Night. However their burglary soon brought them into conflict with [[Batman]].

After several clashes with Batman, Anton was captured and sent to prison. Nocturna remained free and continued her life of crime along with a new ally, Nightshade. Nocturna would conceive the plans of robbery and theft, Nightshade and his people would carry out the crimes. Once the scheme had run its course, Nocturna called it quits. During this time, she became an intimate friend of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman, something that made both lives more complicated, especially after they had slept together after Bruce lost custody of Jason. She also became a [[surrogate mother]] to [[Jason Todd]], the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and even adopted him. Not wanting Bruce out of Jason's life she proposed that there was only one sensible solution. She and Bruce must get married at once.

Anton Knight finally escaped and, after being rejected by his beloved Nocturna, changed his style and became the murderous ''Night-Slayer''. He killed Nightshade, even trading identities with a delirious Batman. After being betrayed one time too many times by Nocturna, Anton vowed to kill her. However, it never came to that, as Night-Slayer was captured by [[Catwoman]]. Nocturna, having been stabbed, was last seen being put into a balloon by Jason Todd which he then set off into the air.

===Post-Crisis===
'''Natalie Metternich''' (alias '''Natalia Mitternacht''') is introduced in ''Robin'' #100. She is a former astronomer that encounters [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Spoiler]] in a storyline that ran through ''Robin'' #101-105. 

[[File:Robin 103.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Natalia Mitternacht on the cover of ''Robin'' #103 (August 2002), by Michael Lopez]]
She first encounters Spoiler after leaving a theater where she had been playing the piano. Her music caused everyone in the theater, including Robin, to cry; with the exception of Spoiler (who was recovering from a cold<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batmanytb.com/comics/titles/robin/101_200/robin101.php|title=Robin #101|publisher=Batman: Yesterday, Today, & Beyond|accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>). Outside the theater, she is attacked by an unknown man, but rescued by Spoiler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batmanytb.com/comics/titles/robin/101_200/robin102.php|title=Robin #102|publisher=Batman: Yesterday, Today, & Beyond|accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> She refuses to share her name with Stephanie to provide to the police. This causes Spoiler to become suspicious of her, and eventually Spoiler and Robin perform a stakeout at the theater where she performs. During her performance, Spoiler cries but Robin (who has his nose plugged) is unmoved by Natalia's music. Spoiler later track Natalia to her apartment and helps her save her scientific research papers when it is discovered that her apartment is on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batmanytb.com/comics/titles/robin/101_200/robin103.php|title=Robin #103|publisher=Batman: Yesterday, Today, & Beyond|accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>

While Natalia stays at Spoiler's house, Robin and Spoiler learn that Natalia secretes a pheromone that causes those around her to become emotional and lose their inhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batmanytb.com/comics/titles/robin/101_200/robin104.php|title=Robin #104|publisher=Batman: Yesterday, Today, & Beyond|accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> They deduce that the pheromones caused her attacker, a former schizophrenic patient named Dylan Arthur Prescott, to relapse and attack her. When confronted with this information, Natalia denies any knowledge of her powers. She had been an aspiring scientist that eventually quit the scientific field once she contracted her powers, which caused her to lose her inhibitions and pursue other interests (including playing the piano, acquiring a medieval sense of fashion, and other unconventional choices). Robin and Spoiler convince her to visit [[STAR Labs]] to have her powers examined.

Spoiler and Natalia developed a friendship and Spoiler shared a great amount of personal information with Natalia while her nose was not plugged. When her nose was plugged, she was able to control what she said and how she behaved around Natalia. After Spoiler contacted Natalia's estranged mother, Natalia fled from her. Robin and Spoiler eventually found her as she was being confronted by Prescott. After a mental showdown, Prescott flees from Robin and Spoiler and dies from electrocution on an underground railway. Spoiler then convinced Natalia to return to STAR Labs for further testing; otherwise, she would contact her mother again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batmanytb.com/comics/titles/robin/101_200/robin105.php|title=Robin #105|publisher=Batman: Yesterday, Today, & Beyond|accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>

Although she does not assume the Nocturna identity during this storyline, the title the story in ''Robin'' #105 is ''"Exit Natalia, Enter... Nocturna?"''. Series writer Jon Lewis, who was reintroducing characters that had encountered various versions of Robin, confirmed that she is a "rebuild of Nocturna".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.comicbookresources.com/archive/index.php/t-91134.html|title=The Nocturna storyline: should it be collected?|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>

''[[One Year Later]]'', Nocturna appears in the ''[[Black Canary]]/[[Green Arrow]] Wedding Special'' #1 as a member of the [[Injustice League]]. She's next seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]'' as a member of [[Vandal Savage]]'s camp, her appearance in this title borrowing from Bruce Timm's unused ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' concept artwork.

Recently, she appeared in ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' as an opponent to [[Hawkman]], appearing in an updated version of her classic appearance and using a hot-air balloons as transportation. She then had cameos in the ''Gotham Gazette: Batman Dead?'' and ''Gotham Gazette: Batman Alive?'' one-shots, where she battles her former friend Spoiler (who comments that Nocturna has given up on hot air balloons) and uses stealth technology to turn invisible during their fight.

===The New 52===

* Nocturna was scheduled to appear in an episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' as a [[vampire]], but the episode was canceled after [[Fox Network|Fox]] censors objected to the storyline, which would have involved Batman being turned into a vampire and craving human blood. Producer [[Alan Burnett]] later recounted the events by saying "We also wanted to do a Nocturna story – Bruce had drawn a hot model of her - but she’s a vampire, which would’ve involved bloodletting, which was a huge no-no for kids TV."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/burnett.php |title=The World's Finest - Batman: The Animated Series |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>
