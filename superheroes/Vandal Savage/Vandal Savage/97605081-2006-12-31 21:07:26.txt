'''Vandal Savage''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. Savage first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' # 10 in [[1943]], and was created by [[Alfred Bester (author)|Alfred Bester]] and [[Martin Nodell]].

Savage's threat lies in the fact that he is a brilliant tactician, an immortal and possesses immense technological prowess. He is one of DC's most persistent villains and has fought many different heroes throughout history.

==History==
In the days of [[prehistory]], [[Upper Paleolithic|50,000 BC]], Savage was known as a [[caveman]] named Vandar Adg, leader of the Blood Tribe, who would find himself bathed in the radiation of a mysterious [[meteorite]], which gave him incredible intellect and [[immortality]]. An observer from the Bear Tribe would later approach that same meteorite and became Savage's eternal nemesis, the [[Immortal Man]], possessing the power to [[Resurrection|resurrect]] as a new persona every time he is killed.

Savage's first mark in the "history" of the DC Universe came when he and a select group of people successfully undermined and destroyed the lost city of [[Atlantis]]. That group of people became known as the [[Illuminati]], with Savage serving as its leader, then and ever since.

He claims to have ruled hundreds of civilizations under hundreds of names: [[Khafra|Khafre]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Blackbeard]], and [[Vlad III Dracula|Vlad the Impaler]], to name a few. He has also worked as close friends and advisers to the likes of [[Erik the Red]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Otto von Bismarck]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].

During the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]], Savage battled the [[Justice Society of America]]. Savage's first [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] appearance was in ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' # 137 in [[1962]], in which he attempted to capture the members of the Justice Society out of revenge, but was thwarted by the Golden and Silver Age Flashes ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]). Savage would continue to make various attacks on the Justice Society in later stories.

====Immortal Man====
Ultimately, Savage's enemy the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]],'' and Mitch Shelley, the [[Resurrection Man]], an amnesiac with similar powers, took over as Savage's nemesis. However, Savage's list of foes is not limited to those two characters. Having lived so long, Savage has butted heads with possibly every single [[hero]] featured in the DC Universe, past, present, and future, most notably the Justice Society of America and the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. At present, in DC universe, Savage is about 52,000 years old. 

====DC One Million====
{{main|DC One Million}}
Savage will possibly meet his end in the year 85,271 A.D. (as seen in the ''[[DC One Million]]'' storyline), when he is sent back in time to [[20th century]] [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], seconds before it is obliterated by a [[nuclear weapon]], an action that was, ironically, ordered by Savage himself. This is, however, only one possible future for Savage.
These events may change due to the tampering with the forces of the universe by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] and [[Superboy-Prime]] during the [[Infinite Crisis]].

====Villains United/Scandal Savage====
{{main|Villains United}}
Vandal Savage was seen in the final two issues of ''[[Villains United]]''.  Originally Savage was a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]], but he quit the Society and told Lex not to contact him for any reason.  While no reason was given it is likely Vandal quit because his daughter [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal]] was working against the Society as part of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].  When the Society lodged a final ambush against the Six, Savage threatened to kill Luthor if he didn't call off the attack, saying that he couldn't allow anyone to harm his daughter. This was shown to be due more to ulterior motives than fatherly love, as in issue three of the Secret Six miniseries it was revealed Savage wants his daughter to produce an heir with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]], and he's been putting bounties on the Secret Six's heads as a warning of what will happen to her lover if she refuses him.

====Flash and JSA====
{{main|One Year Later}}
Savage was seen in the final story arc of ''Flash (vol. 2)'' as leader of a doomsday cult. He attempted to use a device to pull an asteroid into the Earth, but was thrown into space with the asteroid itself when the [[Wally West|Flash]] reversed the polarity of the device. Eventually the asteroid fell back on Earth with Savage, who found his power greatly diminished. His immortality completely drained, he's still able to survive otherwise fatal wounds, but a brain tumor and a strong decay of his biological function are leading him to a fast death, with an estimated life span of eleven days. Savage tried to capture [[Alan Scott]] by baiting him with a grotesque (and disguised) [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Wesley Dodds]] clone, who, in fact, was his own clone. After a failed attempt to steal Scott's DNA, Savage was left alone in the rubble of his former secret base. Realizing that his clone could be considered his own offspring, and that the blood of his descendants has always renewed his strength, Savage cooked and ate his clone, renewing his energies at least for another year.

==Elseworlds==
Vandal Savage was the villain in the 1997 Elseworld [[limited series]] ''Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty''.  In this story, Savage is obsessed with recovering the meteor that gave him his immortality, believing that it will reveal why he has become what he became. Over the centuries, he finds himself opposing the members of the Wayne family throughout history, starting with medieval knight Sir Joshua of Wainwright, to contemporary Bruce Wayne (Vandal saved Bruce's parents, but killed them when Bruce was an adult to stop them preventing him reacquiring the meteor, and he and Bruce died after a battle in space), to futuristic Vice President Brenda Wayne. At the conclusion of this last battle, Vandal was left drifting through space on the meteor, determined to learn the purpose of his life.

Another Elseworld story, ''Flashpoint'', had Savage running a space-exploration corporation with the help of the crippled Barry Allen. He tried to use technology stolen from [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] to kill humanity (he wanted to commit suicide in the grandest manner possible), but was killed by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], who sacrificed his life to stop the alien device.

In the limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', Vandal Savage is a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s Mankind Liberation Front, but is captured by Batman and his allies.

== In other media ==
 
Savage in several episodes of the [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', where he is voiced by [[Phil Morris]]. This version of Savage, in addition to being an immortal, has enhanced healing properties in the style of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. His origin is the same as that of his comic book counterpart, except it is revealed in the episode "Maid of Honor" his age is half of that in the comics - 25,000 years.

The League first encounters Savage in the three-part episode "The Savage Time", when he manages to alter time and cause Nazi Germany to win [[World War II]].  The League (minus [[Batman]], who was in their satellite headquarters at the time) was protected by [[Green Lantern]] energy (As he guided their space ship in for docking) and were unaffected by the temporal alteration. With the aid of this timeline's version of Batman, they traveled back in time to learn that Vandal Savage had sent himself, from the present-day to the past, a laptop that contained  technologically advanced plans for weaponry, as well as information on the future plans of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. This knowledge and technology allowed Savage to catapult himself to the top of the Axis authority, deposing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and assuming the title of [[Führer]]. The League managed to end Savage's campaign just as he mounts a jet-powered aerial assault heading towards America, and he is forced to retreat, with Hitler restored to power in time for D-Day to succeed.

Savage's second appearance was in "Maid of Honor", in which he turned up as the fiancé of Princess Audrey of [[Kasnia]]. Savage disguised himself as his own descendant, Vandal Savage the Third. He married Audrey and used the Kasnian involvement in an international space station to set up a [[rail gun]] that shoots meteors with pinpoint accuracy. With this, he hoped to threaten the world into bowing to his authority. The League (in particular, [[Wonder Woman]], who had become a good friend of Audrey's) dismantles Savage's plot yet again. 

His final appearance was in the two-part "[[Hereafter (Justice League episode)|Hereafter]]".  [[Superman]], having been thrown forward to a time when the Earth's sun is red (leaving him powerless) meets Savage, the sole surviving human. Savage was responsible for the destruction of the human race, having stolen the [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]]'s piece of dwarf star, and using it to build a machine that would allow him to control the force of gravity. In Superman's absence he slaughtered the Justice League, but the side effects of his gravity manipulation shifted the balance of the entire solar system, killing all human life. The centuries of loneliness and isolation have caused him to regret his mad pursuits of power. He and Superman end up working together to revive a [[Zero Point Energy]] powered time machine that Savage built so that Superman can go back in time and stop Savage's past self from dooming the human race (Savage couldn't go himself as the machine couldn't send him somewhere he already existed, but Superman, having been thought to be dead, was free to go back). Once operational, the radiation from the time machine's power source also has the effect of restoring Superman to his full abilities (it's like a miniature yellow sun). Superman returns to the present and the future Savage sees the future restore itself just as he slowly fades from existence, his last words being "''Thank you, my friend...''".
