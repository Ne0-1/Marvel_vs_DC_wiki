He is a brilliant tactician with immense technological prowess. He is one of DC's most persistent villains and has fought hundreds of heroes throughout history.

Vandal Savage, under the name "Curtis Knox", made his live-action debut in ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed by [[Dean Cain]]. The character was later introduced into [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]], where he was portrayed by [[Casper Crump]]. He was the main antagonist in "[[Heroes Join Forces]]", the crossover between the [[The Flash (season 2)|season two]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]] of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and during the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', later making a cameo appearance in the latter's [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 4)|fourth season]].

==Publication history==
Vandal Savage first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' vol. 1 #10 (December 1943), and was created by [[Alfred Bester]] and [[Martin Nodell]].

==Fictional character biography==
In the days of [[prehistory]], [[Upper Paleolithic|50,000 BC]], Savage was a [[caveman]] named Vandar Adg, leader of the [[Cro-Magnon]] Wolf Tribe. He was bathed in the [[radiation]] of a mysterious [[meteorite]], which gave him incredible intellect and immortality. An observer from the Bear Tribe would later approach that same meteorite and become Savage's eternal nemesis, the [[Immortal Man]], possessing the power to [[Resurrection|resurrect]] as a new person every time he is killed. According to [[Lex Luthor]], there may be evidence to suggest that Savage was the first cannibal on record. Though the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] took this to be a joke, Luthor was apparently serious, and Savage has not shown much regard for human life.

In the Pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' universe, Savage was native to Earth-Two, but as seen in ''Action Comics'' #516, thousands of years in the past a sorcerer revealed to him both the future existence of the [[Justice Society]] (even showing him a battle he would have with them, with [[Hourman]] in their ranks), and the existence of Earth-One.

Savage's first mark in the history came when he and a select group of people successfully undermined and destroyed the lost city of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. That group of people became known as the [[Illuminati]], with Savage serving as its leader.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

He claims to have ruled hundreds of civilizations under hundreds of names: [[Khafra|Khafre]], [[Khufu|Cheops]] (builder of the pyramids), [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]] (though he has also claimed to have participated in the murder of Julius Caesar, but Pre-''Crisis'' he claimed history was inaccurate and Brutus failed), [[Genghis Khan]], [[Blackbeard]], and [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad the Impaler]], to name a few. He also terrorized Victorian era London as [[Jack the Ripper]]. He realized that his prominence could cause him to be killed accidentally, so he decided to work behind the scenes. He has also worked as close friends and advisers to the likes of [[Erik the Red]], [[William the Conqueror]] (whom he advised to invade England under the name Sir Von Savage), [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (whom he served as Marshal Savage), [[Otto von Bismarck]] (whom he helped to invade France as Baron Von Savage), and [[Adolf Hitler]]. He also led the [[Spanish Armada]] in its attempted invasion of England (suggesting he may have been [[Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Alonso Pérez de Guzmán]]). He was the court physician in France and even used the royal family for syphilis experiments.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

Following DC's 2011 reboot of its continuity, ''[[The New 52]]'', Vandal Savage is revealed to have been a part of the ''[[Demon Knights]]'', an informal band of medieval-based characters operating in the Middle Ages of the DCU, opposing [[Mordru]] after the Fall of [[Camelot]]. This incarnation of Vandal Savage was less of a threatening, scheming villain and more a likeable, roguish thug. Savage was still a force to be reckoned with, but nonetheless bound to a deep-seated respect for "his fellow immortals" [[Etrigan]] and [[Madame Xanadu]], even taking a place among the assembled heroes.<ref>''[[Demon Knights]]'' #1-3 (2011)</ref> He is eventually thought to be a traitor.<ref>''[[Demon Knights]]'' #5 (January 2012). DC Comics</ref> Savage ends up betraying Mordru in turn in order to pillage the supplies of the Horde.<ref>''[[Demon Knights]]'' #7 (March 2012). DC Comics</ref> He rejoins the rest of the Demon Knights, saying that he planned this all along.  It is unknown whether or not he is telling the truth.  This behavior is more in line with the present-day Vandal Savage.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

During the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]], Savage battled the [[Justice Society of America]] after first meeting Green Lantern. He attempted to capture the members of the Justice Society out of revenge and place them in suspended animation using technology developed by the Injustice Society of the World member [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]], but was thwarted by the Golden and Silver Age Flashes ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]), Barry travelling to Earth-2 after mysterious [[Power outage|blackout]]s happened in cities where JSA members lived. He used a weapon to make them fight each other, captured Jay after the younger Barry beat him, and tried to capture Barry, trying to use an illusion to trap Barry in a suspended animation container. But Barry realiZed his trick and freed the heroes. This caused the JSA to revive.<ref>''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' #137 (1962, Savage's first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] appearance)</ref> Savage would continue to make various attacks on the Justice Society in later stories. He was also one of the founding members of the [[Injustice Society]], who were each assigned to capture or kill a JSA member and engineer five jailbreaks to each attack a location in an attempt to conquer the United States. While leading an army of prison escapees from Gartmoor prison whom he had incited to riot by dropping leaflets about the ISW from a plane, he attacked an airport where Federal planes were about to land, and captured Hawkman, before Green Lantern impersonated the Thinker during the 'trial' of the JSA and freed the JSA, who jailed the villains. He briefly formed a group of villains called [[Tartarus (DC Comics)|Tartarus]].{{issue|date=January 2015}}

After the events of the 2008 "[[Final Crisis]]" storyline, Savage found himself hardly affected by the event, aside from gaining more enemies. Knowing his developed hatred for the Justice Society, the re-installation of a new team consisting superheroes within the modern time known as the Justice League, quickly gained Savage's attention to where he did not hesitate on forming a group of villains to make an attack on this new team so that they would not pose any threat towards Savage's future goals. Yet, none would gain any more hatred from Savage than the supposed new Immortal Man, which was the mysterious Resurrection Man. Over time, Savage forgot many of his special powers, and never exhibited them to Barry Allen. After his recent fallout with the Justice League, Vandal Savage decided to take care of each member individually, starting with the newest Flash (Wally West). During this time, he operated the Villers Gallery, an antique salon on Fifth Avenue in New York City. A private investigator by the name of Harold Halston from Thermopolis, Wyoming had been investigating one Varney Sack at the request of a local realtor. Sack turned out to be Savage, and the immortal man killed Halston once he figured the private eye knew too much. In a showdown at the Club Neon, Wally, with the help of Frances Kane, fought Savage. He fell out of a window, but he disappeared before he hit the ground.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

Savage surfaced again later, this time selling Velocity 9, a highly addictive super-speed drug of his own creation, which interfered with much of the existing drug trade in New York. He put an ad in the paper that attracted successful yuppies, whom he used to do his bidding by giving them Velocity 9 so they could perform high speed crimes. However, these junkies aged at magnificent rates and suffered strokes very easily.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

Savage wished to use the heroin distribution network of mob boss Nick Bassaglia to distribute Velocity 9 to lawyers and stockbrokers, hoping to gain financial control of New York. However, Flash, who had gone looking for Bassaglia after he was kidnapped by Savage, was injected with Velocity 9. After giving him a short spurt of incredible speed, it took away his powers. Hoping that a second dose would make him another one of his junkies, Savage told Dr. Conrad Bortz to inject the Flash, who instead injected Savage, who ran away.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

He reappeared later, wanting money to leave the country. This money he attempted to acquire by kidnapping Rosie, the daughter of Wally's landlord, Mr. Gilchrist, with a ransom of five million dollars. He set many traps for the Flash, who was looking for Rosie, that led him to Barry Allen's grave, where Rosie was being kept. However, throughout all of this, Savage never showed his face.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

He is one of the main villains in the ''JLA: Year One'' storyline, working against the recently formed JLA, and harboring a deep hatred towards superheroes and the invading alien Appellaxians. During one confrontation with the aliens, Savage claims to have designed [[Stonehenge]] itself, which the aliens have just partially demolished. Savage also mentions that he shut down the Justice Society with "a few well-placed senators."{{issue|date=January 2015}}

===Immortal Man===
Ultimately, Savage's enemy the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', and Mitch Shelley, the [[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]], an amnesiac with similar powers which actually came from nanobots, took over as Savage's nemesis. However, Savage's list of foes is not limited to those two characters. Having lived so long, Savage has butted heads with possibly every single [[hero]] featured in the DC Universe, most notably the [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. Original Green Lantern Alan Scott (in comics, his very first opponent) has been portrayed as one of Savage's main enemies, as well as the original Flash, Jay Garrick. It has been revealed that Savage refers to Hawkman – who has been reincarnated for a few millennia – as "the cockroach". At present, in the DC universe, Savage is about 54,001 years old, although different numbers have been given in the past, from 1 million years in his first depiction, to 31,637 years in recent issues of ''JSA: Classified''.

===''DC One Million''===
{{Main|DC One Million}}

In this series, it is learned Savage has a base deep inside the Egyptian [[Sphinx]]. A confrontation with the [[Martian Manhunter]] leaves him with a burnt-out eye, which seemingly afflicts him far into the future.

Savage will possibly meet his end after he has lived to the year A.D. 85,271 (as seen in the ''[[DC One Million]]'' storyline), when he is sent back in time to 20th century [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], by a pair of doctored time traveling gauntlets, seconds before it is obliterated by a [[Rocket Red Brigade|Rocket Red]] armorsuit carrying a huge nuclear payload, an action that was, ironically, ordered by Savage himself (Savage was hoping to use the gauntlets to move only through space and arrive at the 853rd century [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]). At this point, the time-traveling hero [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]] is heard in the background, gloating about having conned Savage in retaliation for a previous adventure when Savage had him stranded in time.

===Tartarus===
After being foiled or after defeating some thugs, Savage is known to return for bloodthirsty revenge. This time he had his eyes set on the Titans, a team he had nearly defeated before they ruined his plans for a nuclear assault. This time, Savage decided to form a team of his own. To do this, Savage kidnapped the Titans member known as [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] and forced her to recruit the perfect team for him using her mental powers. Though Omen did what Savage commanded, she secretly selected a team that would quickly fall apart. Recruiting [[Gorilla Grodd]], [[Lady Vic]], [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], the [[Siren (comics)|Siren]], and the [[Red Panzer]], Savage formed the group Tartarus. Their first mission was to find the H.I.V.E. Mistress known as Adeline Wilson so that Savage could use her blood in an immortality serum. After slitting her throat, Savage and his team were confronted by the Titans. The Red Panzer died in the fight, but Savage and his remaining team managed to escape by shooting Cheshire and using her as a distraction, leaving her to be captured by the Titans. After learning the location of Omen, the Titans found her and engaged in another fight with Tartarus that quickly ended after the Siren switched sides.

===''Villains United''===
{{Main|Villains United}}
Vandal Savage was seen in the final two issues of ''[[Villains United]]''.  Originally, Savage was a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]], but he quit the Society and told Lex not to contact him for any reason after Luthor blew him off to welcome some less than competent new recruits.  It is also plausible that Vandal quit because his daughter [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal Savage]] was working against the Society as part of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].<ref>''Villains United'' #5</ref> When the Society lodged a final ambush against the Six, Savage threatened to kill Luthor if he did not call off the attack, saying that he could not allow anyone to harm his daughter. This was shown to be due more to ulterior motives than fatherly love, as in issue #3 of the ''Secret Six'' miniseries, it was revealed Savage wants his daughter to produce an heir with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]], and he has been putting bounties on the Secret Six's heads as a warning of what will happen to her lover, [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]], if she refuses him.<ref>''Villains United'' #6</ref> He has, however, been seen as a member of the Society's second incarnation underneath Libra during the Final Crisis. He actually even serves as one of its inner cabinet members.

===The Flash and the JSA===
{{Main|One Year Later}}
Savage was seen as leader of a [[doomsday cult]]. He attempted to use a device to pull an asteroid into Earth, but was thrown into space with the asteroid itself when the [[Wally West|Flash]] reversed the polarity of the device.<ref>''Flash'' (2nd series)</ref> Eventually, the asteroid fell back on Earth with Savage, who found his power greatly diminished and having lived through what he called the worst year of his life. His immortality completely drained, he is still able to survive otherwise fatal wounds, but a brain tumor and a strong decay of his biological function are leading him to a fast death, with an estimated life span of 11 days. Savage tries to capture [[Alan Scott]] by baiting him with a grotesque (and disguised) [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Wesley Dodds]] clone, who, in fact, is his own clone. After a failed attempt to steal Scott's DNA, Savage is left alone in the rubble of his former secret base. Realizing that his clone could be considered his own offspring, and that the blood of his descendants has always renewed his strength, Savage cooks and eats his clone, renewing his energies at least for another year.<ref>''JSA: Classified'' #10-13</ref>

Savage returns in the first story arc of the new ''Justice Society of America'', the mastermind behind a group of [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] superpowered villains called the Fourth [[Reich]], targeting the heirs of several [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superhero bloodlines, in the belief that eliminating the bloodlines will eliminate the heroes' legacies and allow him to continue his goal of reshaping the world according to his own desires. He kills the [[Minute Man]], [[General Glory]] and [[Mister America (comics)|Mister America]], along with their families. The Fourth Reich kills nearly all of [[Commander Steel]]'s Family. In issue #4, after a battle with [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] and his newly discovered son, who is revealed to have the ability to turn into a cat-like creature, at which Savage is surprised (which he claims to have not been in 116 years), Savage is defeated when hit by a fire truck. He later reappears in Atlantis where he is revealed to have been behind the atrocities in [[Sub Diego]] and [[Black Manta]]'s occupation of the city.<ref>''[[Aquaman|Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis]]'' #54</ref>

===''Salvation Run''===
Vandal Savage was one of the villains imprisoned on the "Hell Planet" of ''[[Salvation Run]]''. He claims to have puzzled out the mechanical workings of the planet and used this knowledge to locate a "safe zone" without any of the predators that roam the rest of the world.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #4</ref>  He intends to mate with the female supervillains in his group, and produce an immortal progeny. He has placated some of the more willful of the females (like [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]] and the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]) by promising each of them that they will be his queen when he rules the planet. Ultimately, Savage escapes back to Earth, along with the rest of the imprisoned villains, following an attack by [[Parademon]]s sent by [[Desaad|DeSaad]] (who used the planet as a training ground).

===''Final Crisis''===
After returning to Earth, in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' Vandal Savage is placed on the new Society's inner circle by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]. As he says to Lex Luthor, Vandal is willing to follow Libra in exchange for his heart's desire, an end to his boredom.

In ''[[Final Crisis: Revelations]]'', the ''Order of the Stone'' (the followers of [[Cain]]) comes in possession of the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]]. Later, a group of followers led by Sister Wrack enter Vandal Savage's tent. They plunge the Spear of Destiny into Vandal's body. Thus Cain is reborn in him, and agrees to lead the Followers into punishing the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] for [[Curse and mark of Cain|branding him]] because of his ancient [[Murder|crime]].<ref>''[[Final Crisis: Revelations]]'' #2</ref> Using the Spear, Cain is able to separate the Spectre from his human host, and make him his slave.<ref>''Final Crisis: Revelations'' #3</ref> Cain's plans are undone by [[Renee Montoya]], who manages to steal the Spear and reunite the Spectre with his host. The Spectre, forbidden by God to kill Cain, instead sentences him to walk the Earth, unable to disguise himself, being forever reviled and persecuted by the rest of the human race and denied rest until God says otherwise (the [[Mark of Cain]]).<ref>''Final Crisis: Revelations'' #5</ref>

The superhero team known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] come into conflict with a mysterious group calling themselves the Insiders, who are tracking down the fragments of the meteorite that granted Savage his immortality. It is ultimately revealed that the Insiders were members of Savage's tribe who were also exposed to the meteorite and gained immortality. Savage (still possessing the Mark of Cain) forms a temporary alliance with fellow immortal and cult leader (as well as at times Mass Murderer) [[Ra's al Ghul]] to thwart the group's plan.

Whether true or not, Vandal Savage has come to believe he literally ''is'' the Biblical Cain. The mark he still bears hampers his ability to do his business and thus he attempts to pass it off - to either the Question or the Huntress. He succeeds, imparting the mark to the Question, who accepts to be branded to spare the Huntress from the disfigurement and the pain<ref>''Detective Comics'' #863</ref> (despite the fact that The Question later proves how the brand could be suppressed by acknowledging the flaws, the shortcomings and the guilt of the bearer, a feat made seemingly impossible by Vandal Savage's mindset).<ref>''Detective Comics Annual'' #12 (December 2010)</ref>

===''Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne''===
In the distant past, an amnesiac Bruce Wayne walks out of the cave where [[Anthro (comics)|Anthro]] died<ref>As shown in ''Final Crisis" #7 (March 2009)</ref> and is discovered by a tribe of primitives led by Vandal Savage, who attempts to kill Wayne in the belief that he is a member of the "Sky People." Savage holds Wayne hostage until a younger member of the tribe frees him and aids in his subsequent fight against Savage's mob.<ref>''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'' #1</ref>

In the 1800s, Vandal Savage, under the name of "Monsewer Sauvage" and currently weakened from a cancer in his intestines, wants [[Jonah Hex]] to eliminate the man who has been attacking his men, while Savage attempts to torture a woman whose family have been entrusted with a box, marked with the symbol of the bat, that they are to keep sealed until its owner comes to claim it. When he finds from the "doctor" torturing the girl how to open the box; Savage and the doctor escape in a carriage, with the girl and the box, while Batman is busy with Vandal's thugs. Batman catches up with the carriage which eventually falls into a nearby river. The doctor and Savage fall in but when they get out they come face to face with the Batman. Vandal, in an opium fueled delusion (which he took to control the pain from his cancer), sees Batman as an actual bat, compared to the girl and Alan Wayne (who had been on the way to kill himself when the carriage had careened into the river) whom he sees as skeletons, and remembers that night thousands of years ago when a bat-man had appeared. He is then knocked out by Batman.<ref>''Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne'' #4</ref>

===''The New 52''===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Vandal Savage is a supporting character in ''[[Demon Knights]]'', a story based on [[Arthurian]] Lore, co-starring with characters like [[Etrigan the Demon]], [[Madame Xanadu]], and the [[Shining Knight]].<ref>''Demon Knights'' #4</ref> This story taking place in the Middle Ages, Savage is, at this point, traveling the world content to simply enjoy life, living for wine, women, and war.<ref>''Demon Knights'' #16</ref> He is a master tactician and incredibly strong, and uses his many skills that he has picked up over his long lifetime to aid his teammates.<ref>''Demon Knights'' #1-26</ref>

An older Savage appears in ''[[DC Universe Presents]]'', fashioned as a serial killer. He claims to be of ancient origin, his crimes sacrifices to forgotten gods. He has a daughter named Kassandra (a.k.a. Kass Sage), who is a police officer.<ref>''DC Universe Presents'' #9</ref>

During the [[Trinity War]] storyline, Vandal Savage appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains. He assists [[Giganta]] and the [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] into tracking [[Pandora (DC Comics)|Pandora]]. After Giganta was subdued, Vandal Savage steps in and the two fight, until Pandora seemingly kills him. However, Vandal Savage gets up and demands that Pandora give him the box, or else he will continue to try to find a way to kill her. To his surprise, Pandora willingly gives him the box, as she thinks she needs him to open it. Vandal Savage takes the box and fails to open it, with Pandora noting that he must have some good on his conscience.<ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #2</ref>

A recent storyline where Superman loses his powers is revealed to be part of a complex plan by Vandal Savage to undermine the world's heroes before abducting several members of the Justice League, using them to power a machine that will draw in the asteroid that gave him his immortality while triggering that power in various modern descendants of his. Although Superman is able to regain his powers by subjecting himself to a dangerous form of 'chemotherapy', where he deliberately exposes himself to kryptonite to burn away what radiation was preventing his cells from absorbing sunlight,<ref>''Superman'' vol. 3 #47</ref> analysis reveals that Superman is now absorbing power from kryptonite that will soon kill him. Despite this, Superman refuses to give in, as various minor heroes assist him in confronting Savage's descendants before he takes Metallo's kryptonite heart (willingly donated) and charges into Savage's base.<ref>''Superman'' vol. 3 #48</ref> Although Savage is able to use the asteroid and the drained Justice League to charge his children's powers, when Savage shoots Superman with a toxic bullet, the toxins burn away the last of the radiation contaminating Superman's cells, allowing him to literally fall into the [[Fortress of Solitude]]- 'stolen' by Vandal as part of his plans- and regain the last of his powers.<ref>''Superman'' vol. 3 #49</ref> Using his enhanced abilities, Savage attempts to win Superman's loyalty by revealing that the asteroid that empowered him could have hit Krypton before it was redirected to Earth, suggesting that a Kryptonian with his powers would have saved the planet, and then showing him a vision of a future where Savage rules the world with Superman as his general against enemy threats, but Superman rejects both of these visions as he genuinely doesn't believe that strength alone solves anything, working with Savage's son the Puzzler to push the asteroid back out of Earth's orbit.<ref>''Superman'' vol. 3 #50</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Since exposure to an unusual radiation generated by a crashed meteor, Savage has been functionally and biologically immortal, remaining unaged for over fifty thousand years. He was also endowed with meta-human regenerative capacities, although this ability is intermittently portrayed between allowing him to recover from any injuries sustained to just allowing him to survive anything that might kill him; he is even capable of getting drunk like any normal human. The radiation also enhanced Savage's strength, stamina, and speed, and enhanced his intellect to above average levels. Savage still feels pain, but over time he has developed great endurance to it. His long life span has allowed him to gain a broad range of knowledge in a variety of fields, as well as granting him a great deal of influence over the world in general and the villain community in particular. Since a recent experience when he was trapped on an asteroid, Savage's immortality has been weakened, forcing him to cannibalize his own children and clones as a way of replenishing his energy.

Recent stories have revealed that Savage was suffering from cancer when he acquired his immortality. As a result, while the cancerous cells in his body naturally cannot kill him, they cause him intermittent pain throughout his life, Savage being unable to have them removed as they are considered to be as much a part of his body as his healthy tissue.

Vandal Savage is stated to be [[Cain]], the first murderer, and as such he may be as old as the entire human race. He briefly wore the ''Mark of Cain'', a metaphysical scarring with a cross pattern disfiguring his face, until he passed it to [[Renee Montoya]]. Though the mark can be suppressed by willpower and by the recognition of one's shortcomings and flaws, Vandal Savage never realized it, instead trying to force the mark on other people.

In the DCnU story line it was revealed the irradiated meteor which gave Savage his immortality and augmented physicality was Kryptonian in origin.<ref>{{c|Superman Vol 3 50}}</ref> Im-El, an ancestor of Kal-El's, managed to avert a cataclysmic impact event by sending the asteroid towards prehistoric Earth. A fragment of the asteroid was what gave Savage his bolstered physique and immortality, also having the effect of bestowing on the progeny of his family line with odd powers and abilities included. The closer Savage's asteroid came to the planet, the more these powers would intensify, to the point that Savage was able to injure a weakened Superman.  The extent of all these new abilities bestowed to him was not fully explored, as the comet was forced away before it could be explored in greater depth.

==Other versions==

=== ''Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty'' ===
Vandal Savage is the villain in the 1997 ''[[Elseworlds]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty]]''.  In this story, Savage is obsessed with recovering the meteor that gave him his immortality, believing that it will reveal why he became what he has. Over the centuries, he finds himself opposing the members of the Wayne family, starting with medieval knight Sir Joshua of Wainwright, to contemporary Bruce Wayne (Vandal saved Bruce's parents from the mugging that killed them otherwise, but killed them when Bruce was an adult to ensure they did not stop him from reacquiring the meteor, only for him and Bruce to perish when they fell to Earth after a battle in space), to futuristic Vice President Brenda Wayne, admiring their spirit and strength of character even as he refuses to allow them to stop his efforts. At the conclusion of this last battle, Vandal is left drifting through space on the meteor, determined to learn the purpose of his life.

===''Kingdom Come''===
In the limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Vandal Savage is a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s Mankind Liberation Front, but is captured by [[Batman]] and his allies when he is mauled by that timeline's version of Wildcat. In the novelization, Spectre expresses deep annoyance at the fact that Savage's immortality prevents him from administering justice on him. Savage, like Luthor, assists with victims of the nuclear fallout – in the additional epilogue, Batman praises Savage for his extensive healing experience.

===''Star Trek/Legion of Super-Heroes''===
Savage appears in the ''[[Star Trek]]''/''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], co-published by [[DC Comics]] and [[IDW Publishing]] in 2011.  In the 6 issue miniseries, the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] join forces with the Legion of Super-Heroes after they are both accidentally thrown into an alternate timeline.  In this timeline, Earth rules a galactic empire and is led by Vandal Savage.  [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] realizes Savage is also the mysterious immortal [[Requiem for Methuselah|Flint]]. Savage/Flint had captured [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] during a visit to the distant past and used his power to accelerate Earth's development and create an empire. While half of the group go back in time to discover when history diverged, the rest confront "Emperor Vandar the First" in the future. Vandar attempts to torture them with the goal of learning about the 'mistakes' in their histories so that he can 'correct' them in his timeline, but Kirk mockingly informs Vandar that his actions prove that he is nothing more than the caveman he was at the start, incapable of considering the idea that progress might be possible in any way other than beating his opponent to death. The alternate timeline is undone when [[Spock]] and [[Brainiac 5]] release Q in the past; Q's escape undoes Vandar's changes and splits Vandal and Flint back into separate entities, Flint being a Vandal Savage who turned his life towards art and science rather than conquest.

===''Flashpoint''===
In the 1999 ''Elseworlds'' story "Flashpoint" (not to be confused with [[Flashpoint (comics)|the 2011 crossover story arc of the same name]]), Savage runs a space-exploration corporation with the help of the crippled Barry Allen. He tries to use technology stolen from [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] to kill humanity (he wants to commit suicide in the grandest manner possible), but is killed by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], who sacrifices his life to stop the alien device.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1-3 (Dec 1999--Feb 2000)</ref>

===''The Multiversity''===
Another version of Savage, this one an interdimensional pirate, features in ''The Society of Superheroes #1'', part of the [[Grant Morrison]]-written 2014 limited series ''[[The Multiversity]]''. This Vandal Savage is a native of Earth-40, a world dominated by [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]] villains. With a crew that includes versions of [[Lady Shiva]] and [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], he invades Earth-20, another pulp-inspired world with a cadre of heroes led by [[Doctor Fate|Doc Fate]]. Savage sets his sights on [[Immortal Man]], needing to spill immortal blood to raise the demon Niczhuotan. Immortal Man overpowers Savage and it is Savage's own blood that is spilled. Although he dies, Savage's purpose has been fulfilled.

==Children==
Being immortal has not stopped Vandal Savage from procreating. [[Scandal Savage]] is his daughter and the only one of his children he considers his heir. He has trained her in combat since she was a young child. Scandal is a member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] and by her own admission is "damned hard to kill". The demon [[Grendel]] (from ''[[Beowulf]]'') is also one of Vandal Savage's children<ref>Secret Six #14</ref> claiming that Vandal Savage "mounted the [[Grendel's mother|cave beast of my mother]]". He refers to Vandal as Cain, the first murderer. Another of his children is Cliff DeWitt, the owner of the Lab, the organization that gave Resurrection Man his powers. Within the New 52 he has another daughter named Kassandra Sage, an FBI agent who reluctantly consults her imprisoned father on a case.

==In other media==

===Television===

====Animation====
* Vandal Savage is seen in several episodes of the [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', voiced by [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]. In this version, in addition to being an ageless immortal, Savage also has superhuman regenerative powers, allowing him to heal and regenerate any injuries instantly to leave no trace of damage. His origin is the same as that of his comic book counterpart, except, as revealed in the episode "Maid of Honor" that his age is half of that in the comics - 25,000 years. He first appears in "The Savage Time", where Vandal's future self goes back in time and gives his past self technology to [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|help the Germans win World War II]]. His plans are thwarted by the [[Justice League]], along with the help of the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]] and [[Easy Company (comics)|Easy Company]]. He next appears in "Maid of Honor", where he claims to be his own grandson and is betrothed to Princess Audrey in order to become the ruler of [[Kasnia]], seeking command of a satellite rail gun before it is destroyed by the Justice League. The two part episode "Hereafter" features a version of Savage from an alternate future, in which he succeeded in destroying all life on Earth. Having lived alone for 30,000 years, he regrets his earlier actions, going so far as deciding not to use a spaceship he'd built to leave Earth, instead opting to stay on the planet as a form of penance. Working with a time-displaced [[Superman]], who had been seemingly killed by the [[Superman Revenge Squad]] a few months before Vandal destroyed humanity but had been sent to this future instead, Vandal is able to reset the timeline by sending the Man of Steel back to the 20th century via his new time machine. (He couldn't do this himself as the machine prevented him going back to a time where he already existed.) As a result of the timeline being reset and his destruction of life on Earth undone, the alternate future Vandal Savage quietly thanked his friend, Superman, before being erased from existence, finally at peace with his newfound redemption.
* Vandal Savage appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]] in the first two seasons and [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in season 3 due to the former's death. He appears as member L-1  and head of "[[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]]" ([[Project Cadmus]]' Board of Directors). In "Evolution", it is revealed Vandal Savage was a prehistoric Cro-Magnon from [[Mongolia]] and gained 3 facial scars from the claws of a [[cave bear]], prior to acquiring his powers of immortality and accelerated healing which helped him survive a fight with [[Neanderthals]]. He is also revealed to have been allies with [[Darkseid]] since when he was posing as Genghis Khan on the [[13th century]]. Savage also posed as Blackbeard and [[Sun Tzu]] as well as [[Atilla]], and also posed as [[Marduk]] when he led [[Babylon]] and foiled [[Starro]] during the [[2nd millennium]]. He's also revealed to have spawned many children including Ishthur and [[Nabu]] from Babylon, two unnamed ones which used elements during the [[Mongol Empire]], Cassandra (similar to her "Legends of Tomorrow counterpart), and Olympia. He believes in the [[survival of the fittest]] and sees the Justice League's actions as keeping humanity from evolving.  He shows a softer side. He shows sympathy for [[Black Manta]] when [[Aqualad]] was comatose, being able to relate from being a father himself. He  shows affection to his children and is willing to guide them, as he told his daughter Cassandra how to use [[Warworld]]. He also shared a moment with his other daughter, Olympia before killing her as a show of mercy to prevent her from suffering further from [[Alzheimer's]] and told Cassandra to prepare a proper [[funeral]] for her. After being informed by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] in "Antisocial Pathologies" that [[Granny Goodness]] has discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]] after she kidnapped [[Halo (comics)|Halo]], Savage snaps a tablet he was holding in anger. In "Terminus", he goes to the Outsiders' base and informs them of Halo's whereabouts in exchange for one thing: they tell Granny who sent them after her. After Granny's plan is foiled, the Light has seemingly reconciled their partnership with Darkseid, though Vandal now secretly considers him a potential threat to be dealt with in time. He also vows to keep an eye on Halo as she could potentially help the Light with their future plans.

====Live action====
* [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul DeMeo]] had expressed interest in featuring Vandal Savage on the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' TV show]] had the series been picked up for a second season.<ref>{{cite comic|story= Behind the Scenes with the Flash|title= The Flash TV Special|issue= 1|date= 1991}}</ref> 
* During the season 7 episode of ''[[Smallville]]'' called "Cure", the character of '''Dr. Curtis Knox''' (portrayed by [[Dean Cain]]) is an immortal who has lived for centuries under various names, and has actually been historical figures such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Jack the Ripper]], as well as being an apparent member of the Nazi Party. The character was originally referred to as Vandal Savage in the script, but the producers were told by the studio that they could not use that name. However, it is still implied that the character of Knox is just Vandal Savage using an alias. This notion is reinforced years later when the Vandal Savage character uses the alias Curtis Knox in an episode of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Night of the Hawk|date=March 10, 2016|series=[[DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]|network=[[The CW]]}}</ref>
[[File:Vandal Savage (Casper Crump).png|thumb|right|[[Casper Crump]] as Vandal Savage in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode "[[Legends of Yesterday]]".]]
* In the [[Arrowverse]], Vandal Savage is portrayed by [[Casper Crump]]. This version of the villain has had his origin story combined with that of the character [[Hath-Set]].<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/arrow/251048/arrow-legends-of-yesterday-review |title=Arrow: Legends of Yesterday review|publisher=Den of Geek |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref> Hath-Set is an Egyptian priest who kills Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara. The three are exposed to dark matter from meteorites, later revealed to originate from [[Thanagar]], which grants Hath-Set immortality and Khufu and Chay-Ara the ability to reincarnate.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Their Time is Now|date=January 19, 2016|series=[[DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]|network=[[The CW]]}}</ref> For 4,000 years, as Vandal Savage, he kills each of Khufu and Chay-Ara's incarnations throughout history to retain his immortality. He serves as mentor to some of history's greatest conquerors and amasses a wealth of knowledge on many subjects.
**Savage serves as the main antagonist of "[[Heroes Join Forces]]", the second annual crossover between ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. He attempts to force [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|the Flash]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]] into handing over Khufu and Chay-Ara's current incarnations, [[Carter Hall (Arrowverse)|Carter Hall]] and [[Kendra Saunders (Arrowverse)|Kendra Saunders]], by threatening to destroy [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] and [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] with the Staff of Horus. He succeeds, and most of the heroes and their teams die, but the Flash survives, travels back in time and warns Green Arrow. When the events play out the second time, the heroes defeat Savage, and he is reduced to ashes by the Staff. His ashes are later collected by [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], who claims that Savage now owes him a debt.
**Savage returns as the main antagonist of the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24501-vandal-savage-revealed-at-dc-s-legends-of-tomorrow-s-first-big-bad.html |title=VANDAL SAVAGE Revealed As DC's LEGENDS OF TOMORROW's First Big Bad |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=2015-05-14 |accessdate=2015-10-02}}</ref> With Savage destined to conquer the world by around 2166, Time Master [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]] assembles a team to track him through various points in history, ranging between the past and the future, attempting to limit his allies and eliminate his resources. Hunter reveals that Savage cannot be killed for good unless Hawkgirl delivers the killing blow with a dagger that Chay-Ara was holding at the moment of her first death. After the team have been chasing him around various periods of history trying to limit his powers, they learn that Savage is actually working with the other Time Masters who see him as the only one who can avert a Thanagarian invasion to occur after 2166. After the Legends destroy the Time Masters, Savage contacts two past versions of himself and looks to create a complex temporal paradox by detonating three Thanagarian meteorites in three different times. However, the radiation exposure renderes Savage mortal, leaving him and his past selves open to be killed by Rip and the team in the season finale. The team then destroy the meteorites, foiling Savage's plan. In [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 4)|season four]], Savage appears in [[Hell (Arrowverse)|hell]], where after apparently being assigned to torture [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] he has instead been befriended by him, having grown fond of the Legends after his death.

===Film===
* Vandal Savage appears as the main enemy in the animated film ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'' with [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] reprising his role from the ''Justice League'' animated series. His origins are mentioned to be the same as it is, with him receiving his superhuman intellect and immortality from radiation of a meteorite.... only it was set on [[Sumatra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=1135 |title=World's Finest |publisher=Worldsfinestonlnie.com |accessdate=2015-10-02}}</ref>
* Vandal Savage appears in the animated film ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Cosmic Clash]]'', voiced again by Phil Morris. After [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] scatters the Justice League across time, Batman and Flash use the [[Cosmic treadmill]] to travel to the Stone Age to find Wonder Woman. That timeline's Vandal (who has not yet experienced the Meteorite that gave him his intellect and immortality) enslaved several cavewomen in hopes of forming an empire with them, until Wonder Woman (who had her memories warped to stabilize the timeline) arrived to banish him and his male warriors. Vandal is then seen by Batman holding a cavewoman hostage. When Batman frees the hostage, she captures Vandal and Batman and takes them to Wonder Woman to be roasted in a pit of lava. Batman manages to free him and Vandal from the restraints and Vandal gets away. The present day Vandal can be seen along with Cheetah at the beginning of the film being arrested by the Justice League and forced into a police car.
* Vandal Savage appears in ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]'', voiced by [[Jim Pirri]]. His origins are mentioned to be the same as it is, with him receiving his superhuman intellect and immortality from radiation of a meteorite. It is also mentioned that he adopted the names of several conquerors in history such as [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], and [[Genghis Khan]]. He is the father of [[Scandal Savage]]. It also appears that he holds no regard for his daughter's happiness, as he is evidenced by ordering his men to mortally shoot Scandal's lover, [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]], and further wounded her himself when Scandal asked for his help in saving her. In the film, he pursues the "Get Out Of Hell Free" card, despite being immortal; so that he may be spared from damnation and spend his afterlife in Heaven. During the confrontation at his residence, the Suicide Squad questioned his desire for the card, stating that he was immortal and does not need it. Vandal later revealed that despite his immortality, he has had many near-death experiences within the last decade than ever over the millennia before, due to the existence of meta-humans. This led him to the logical conclusion that despite his immortality, death is inevitable; even for him. He has [[Professor Pyg]] surgically implant the card inside his body to prevent anyone from getting it, and positioning it in such a way that any attempts to get the card would instantly kill him, thus using up the card on him instantly. He is seemingly killed when [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom]] removes the card from his body by vibrating and phasing his hand through Savage's chest.
