'''Vandal Savage''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Savage first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (volume 1) #10 in [[1943]], and was created by [[Alfred Bester]] and [[Martin Nodell]].

Savage's threat lies in the fact that he is a brilliant tactician and immortal. Although never an incredibly popular villain, he is one of DC's most persistent.

==History==
In the days of [[prehistory]], [[Upper Paleolithic|50,000 BC]], Savage was known as a [[caveman]] named Vandar Adg, leader of the Blood Tribe, who would find himself bathed in the radiation of a mysterious [[meteorite]], which gave him incredible intellect and [[immortality]]. An observer from the Bear Tribe would later approach that same meteorite and become Savage's eternal nemesis, the [[Immortal Man]], possessing the power to [[Resurrection|resurrect]] as a new persona every time he is killed.

Savage's first mark in the "history" of the DC Universe came when he and a select group of people successfully undermined and destroyed the lost city of [[Atlantis]]. That group of people became known as the [[Illuminati]], with Savage serving as its leader, then and ever since.

He claims to have ruled hundreds of civilizations under hundreds of names: [[Khafra|Khafre]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Genghis Khan]], and [[Vlad III Dracula|Vlad the Impaler]], to name a few. He has also worked as close friends and advisers to the likes of [[Erik the Red]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Otto von Bismarck]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].

During the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]], Savage battled the [[Justice Society of America]]. Savage's first [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] appearance was in ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' (volume 1) #137 in [[1962]], in which he attempted to capture the members of the Justice Society out of revenge, but was thwarted by the Golden and Silver Age Flashes. Savage would continue to make various attacks on the Justice Society in later stories.

Ultimately, Savage's enemy the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]],'' and Mitch Shelley, the [[Resurrection Man]], an amnesiac with similar powers, took over as Savage's nemesis. However, Savage's list of foes is not limited to those two characters. Having lived so long, Savage has butted heads with possibly every single [[hero]] featured in the DC Universe, past, present, and future, most notably the Justice Society of America and the [[Justice League of America]]. At present, in DC universe, Savage is about 52,000 years old. 

Savage will possibly meet his end in the year 85,271 A.D. (as seen in the ''[[DC One Million]]'' storyline), when he is sent back in time to [[20th century]] [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], seconds before it is decimated by a [[nuclear weapon]], an action that was, ironically, ordered by Savage himself. This is, however, only one possible future for Savage. 

Vandal Savage was seen in the final two issues of ''[[Villains United]]''.  Originally Savage was a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Supervillains|Society]], but he quit the Society and told Lex not to contact him for any reason.  While no reason was given it is likely Vandal quit because his daughter [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal]] was working against the Society as part of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].  When the Society lodged a final ambush against the Six Vandal threatened to kill Luthor if he didn't call off the attack, saying that he couldn't allow anyone to harm his daughter.  Whether this was a case of fatherly concern  or Vandal has ulterior motives for his daughter remains to be seen.

== Other appearances ==
Savage also figures as a prominent villain in the [[2000s]] [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', where he is voiced by [[Phil Morris]]. This version of Savage differs slightly in his powers from the comics' incarnation: not only is this Savage immortal in his mere inability to age, but he is also unkillable in a physical sense, featuring enhanced healing properties in the style of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. Apart from that, he shares the same origin, radiating himself by the side of a mysterious meteorite.

{{spoiler}}
The League first encounters Savage in the three-part episode ''The Savage Time'', when his machinations create a present-day in which Savage reigns supreme - and apparently has done so since the end of [[World War II]]. The League (excepting [[Batman]]) was protected by [[Green Lantern]] energy and so they were unaffected by the temporal alteration. They traveled back in time to learn that Vandal Savage had sent himself, from the present-day to the past, a laptop that contained all sorts of technologically advanced plans (resulting in the remarkable weaponry that the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] bears in the episode) and foreknowledge of the future plans of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. This knowledge and technology allowed Savage to catapult himself to the top of the Axis authority, disposing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and assuming the title of [[Führer]]. The League managed to end Savage's campaign just as he mounts a jet-powered aerial assault heading towards America.

Savage's present-day introduction would come in ''Maid of Honor'', in which Savage turned up as the fiancé of Princess Audrey of [[Kasnia]]. His fame as the failed Führer has caused him to need to identify himself as his own descendant, Vandal Savage the Third. He married Audrey and used the Kasnian involvement in an international space station to set up a rail gun that shoots meteors with pinpoint accuracy. With this, he hoped to threaten the world into bowing to his authority. However, the League (in particular, [[Wonder Woman]], who had become a good friend of Audrey's) dismantles Savage's plot yet again. Worthy of note in this episode is a difference in Batman's opinion of Savage: while the comic version fears him, the [[DCAU]] version is flat-out disdainful of him (as seen when Batman coldly hits Savage to the side with a chair and says, "You're in my way.").

His most recent appearance was in ''Hereafter'', in which [[Superman]] encounters Savage millennia later in the future, when Earth is lit by a red sun. The years have changed Savage's disposition rather drastically: because Savage is responsible for the destruction of the human race, having stolen a machine that would allow him to control the force of gravity. He slaughtered the Justice League, he later said: "I believe that Green Lantern was most difficult to kill. I finished him off right here, Or maybe it was over there". Now however, he is the only one left, thanks to the side effects of his gravity manipulation, and the centuries of loneliness and isolation have caused him to severely regret his mad pursuits of power. He and Superman end up working together to revive a time machine that Savage built so that Savage can send the Kryptonian back to stop his past self from succeeding in the scheme that ended the lives of the League and doomed the human race. We do not see the League engaging in this battle with present-day Savage, but we do see the future Savage watch his surroundings change to a prosperous and living future and his last moment of peace before he also disappears.
