'''Vandal Savage''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. His threat lies in the fact that he is a brilliant tactician, and immortal.  Although never an incredibly popular villain, he is one of DC's most persistent.

In the days of prehistory, Savage was known as a caveman named Vandar Adg, leader of the Blood Tribe, who would find himself bathed in the radiation of a mysterious meteor, which gave him incredible intellect and immortality.  An observer from the Bear Tribe would later approach that same meteor and become Savage's eternal nemesis, the [[Immortal Man]], possessing the power to resurrect as a new persona every time he is killed.

Savage's first mark in the "history" of the DC Universe came when he and a select group of people successfully undermined and destroyed the lost city of [[Atlantis]]. That group of people became known as the [[Illuminati]], with Savage serving as its leader, then and ever since.

He claims to have ruled hundreds of civilizations under hundreds of names: [[Chephren|Khafre]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Genghis Khan]], and [[Vlad the Impaler]], to name a few. He has also worked as close friends and advisers to the likes of [[Erik the Red]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and [[Adolf Hitler]].

Ultimately, Savage's enemy the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], and Mitch Shelley, the [[Resurrection Man]], an amnesiac with similar powers, took over as Savage's nemesis. However, Savage's list of foes is not limited to those two characters. Having lived so long, Savage has butted heads with possibly every single hero featured in the DC Universe, past, present, and future, most notably the [[Justice Society]] and [[Justice League]].

Savage will meet his end in the year 85,271 A.D. (as part of the [[DC One Million]] storyline), when he is sent back in time to the [[20th century]], to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], seconds before it is decimated by a [[nuclear weapon]], an action that was, ironically, ordered by Savage himself.
