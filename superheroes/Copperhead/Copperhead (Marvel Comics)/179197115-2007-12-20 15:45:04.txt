==Powers and abilities==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Copperhead strikes.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Copperhead strikes.]] -->
Copperhead has no superhuman powers. He has moderate experience in hand-to-hand combat and street fighting techniques, but mainly relies on his weaponry.

He wears finger-shooters on his gauntlets which project electrical discharges ("poison-blasts"); a spring-loaded, telescoping, rapid-retracting, wrist-mounted, titanium steel alloy grapping hook ("shooting fang"), with 30-foot cable line; exploding magnesium flare-bombs stored in his snake-head helmet compartment ("copper-bursts"); micro-suction cups in gloves and boots, enabling adhesion to walls and ceilings.  His equipment was designed by technicians hired by the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]. His gauntlets need to be recharged regularly using the spare poison-blast cartridges in his belt. 

For protection, Copperhead wears a copper suit of scale mail, which functions as light body armor made of micro-mesh chain-mail covered with reinforced synthetic chain-mail tunic.

==Other Marvel characters named Copperhead==
Davis Lawfers, the third Copperhead, is not to be confused with [[Copperhead (Daredevil foe)|Lawrence Chesney or Arthur Reynolds]], two previous Marvel characters who used the name.
