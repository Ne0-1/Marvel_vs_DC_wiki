'''Copperhead''' ('''Davis Lawfers''') is a fictional supervillain from [[Marvel Comics]]. He was a member of the [[Serpent Society]]. Very little has been revealed about Copperhead's past and his origins.

===Fictional character biography===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Copperhead and the Serpent Squad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Copperhead and the fourth Serpent Squad ready to cause some mayhem.]] -->
Davis Lawfers was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. He was a civil servant before becoming an agent of the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and professional criminal. Copperhead was the leader of the fourth [[Serpent Squad]], consisting also of [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-de-lance]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]], and [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]]. The quartet robbed a Las Vegas casino and battled [[Captain America]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], and [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]] in order to attract the attention of [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], then the leader of the Serpent Society.<ref>''Captain America'' #337</ref> The Serpent Squad was freed from jail by the Sidewinder,<ref>''Captain America'' #338</ref> and were inducted into the Serpent Society. In truth, they were sent by the Viper so she could infiltrate the organization and take over as its new leader.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342</ref>  After the coup was staged, Copperhead was assigned by the Viper, along with the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]] and [[Boomslang (comics)|Boomslang]] to put a mutagenic agent into the water supply of Washington D.C. During that mission, he and Cobra had personality conflicts and did not get along, and battled Captain America and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' #343-344</ref>  After the Viper's plot was foiled, the Society re-organized with Cobra was the new leader. Copperhead did not stay long and quietly disappeared from the ranks of the Society.

====Secret Invasion====
In [[Secret Invasion]], Lawfers rejoined the Society. The Society held a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the [[American Midwest]] claiming they were protecting themselves from the [[Skrull]]s. However, they were easily defeated by [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and his new Nova Corps.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #19</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Copperhead strikes.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Copperhead strikes.]] -->
Copperhead has no superhuman powers. He has moderate experience in hand-to-hand combat and street fighting techniques, but mainly relies on his weaponry.

He wears finger-shooters on his gauntlets which project electrical discharges ("poison-blasts"); a spring-loaded, telescoping, rapid-retracting, wrist-mounted, titanium steel alloy grapping hook ("shooting fang"), with {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} cable line; exploding magnesium flare-bombs stored in his snake-head helmet compartment ("copper-bursts"); micro-suction cups in gloves and boots, enabling adhesion to walls and ceilings.  His equipment was designed by technicians hired by the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]. His gauntlets need to be recharged regularly using the spare poison-blast cartridges in his belt. 

For protection, Copperhead wears a copper suit of scale mail, which functions as light body armor made of micro-mesh chain-mail covered with reinforced synthetic chain-mail tunic.
