The '''Mad Thinker''' is a [[Marvel comics]] [[supervillain]]. He is a genius specializing in evil robotics and usually comes up with very elaborate infallible devious plans that unfold like clockwork (until they don't).

The Mad Thinker was introduced by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in
in [[Fantastic Four]] #15 (June, [[1963]]). His real name and origin has never been revealed.

==Character biography==

The Mad Thinker made his debut fighting the Fantastic Four. He once attempted to take over New York City using the [[Baxter Building]] as his base and all organized crime members as his lieutenants. He trapped the Fantastic Four in the lower quarters of the building but was eventually caught, after being stopped by the building's mailman, [[Willie Lumpkin]].

It seemed that his primary objective had not really been to take over the city but to manipulate organized crime into helping him get into the Baxter building so that he could indulge his intellectual avarice by stealing the technology of [[Reed Richards]]. In that sense, the Fantastic Four did not really defeat him, they only defeated his pretext. The Mad Thinker would gladly get sent to prison for a peek at the secrets of what he considered the greatest mind in the world.

Prisons don't do well to hold the Mad Thinker and he escapes from all levels of incarceration with little difficulty. Since his first attack on the Fantastic Four, he and his androids have struck often.

The Mad Thinker became interested in the young supergroup called the [[New Warriors]], and posed them a riddle when they first formed. In the final issue of the series, the answer to the riddle was revealed: the Mad Thinker's nephew had accidentally gained uncontrollable superpowers from his lab, killing his mother in the process. Now, the Thinker wanted them to help him. Presumably they did so using the Neoneutralizer they acquired in that adventure.

Since then, the Mad Thinker has been seen battling [[She-Hulk]] in a prison escape attempt. However, this Mad Thinker was revealed to be merely an android duplicate of the real Mad Thinker, created for purposes as yet unknown.

==Powers and abilities==

The Mad Thinker has no superhuman powers. However, he is an extraordinary genius with knowledge of technology centuries beyond conventional science. He has the facilities and means to create all manner of sophisticated weaponry, androids, armor, and vehicles. 

His analytical, mathematical, and geometrical abilities are of a sophisticated order not commonly found on Earth. He is particularly adept at robotics and [[artificial intelligence]]. He has constructed his own android, [[The Awesome Android]], and once resurrected the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]]. In addition to his own achievements he has stolen much of the secret technology of Reed Richards, back in the incident when he took over the Baxter building.

==Ultimate Thinker==
In the Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Baxter Building was the home of a Think Tank of young geniuses, funded by the US Government. A girl named Rhona Burchill was considered for the project, but was denied due to her borderline psychotic tendencies. Enraged, she went home and concocted an accelerant that would allow her to think many times faster. Needing more brain power to handle the drug, she anaesthetized her brother, and using a crude surgical technique, cut out portions of his brain and grafted them onto her own. Claiming that 'You don't need a Think Tank - You just need a Thinker,' she attacked the Baxter Building and laid a trap for the Fantastic Four. When she tells her story to the Four, Reed calls her mad. She replies, 'If it's mad to think the unthinkable, then I'm the Maddest Thinker you ever met'. Based on this comment, she has since been referred to as the Mad Thinker. She is slated to appear as the villain in the Ultimate FF/Ultimate X-Men miniseries.
