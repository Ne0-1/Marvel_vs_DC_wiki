'''Rose Wilson''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. She is a member of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] daughter of [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]].

==Fictional character biography==
Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) met Lillian Worth on a search-and-rescue mission a few years after his [[divorce]] from Adeline Kane. His mission was to make sure that she escaped war-torn [[Cambodia]] safely. After an intermittent love affair with Wilson, Worth gave birth to a daughter whom she named Rose. Believing it to be in the child's best interest, Worth kept Rose a secret from Wilson. Worth eventually settled down at a [[brothel]] in [[New York City]], and during a time when Deathstroke is injured and a fugitive from the law, Worth takes him in and nurses his wounds. Deathstroke's butler [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]] discovers 14-year-old Rose and suspects that she is Deathstroke's daughter.

Deathstroke's half-brother Wade DeFarge, using the name [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]], later kills Deathstroke's friends and family. DeFarge discovers Rose, captures her, and tells her that Deathstroke is her father. Wintergreen and Worth launch a rescue attempt, but Worth is presumed dead after she drives a jeep off a cliff while trying to run over DeFarge. Wintergreen successfully rescues Rose and escapes.

Rose tries to reach out to her father, but he turns her away. He fears for her safety because he believes himself to be responsible for the deaths of two of his sons. Deathstroke leaves her in the care of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Titans]] superhero team. During a training exercise, Rose is injured and taken to the hospital, and her precognitive powers emerge for the first time when she has a lengthy vision of Deathstroke's future. She awakens before she can test her powers further. She leaves the Titans shortly after and does not see them again until the Technis Imperative conflict when she allies herself with the Titans to save fellow Titan [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. During this incident she vocally challenges the New God [[Big Barda]], as the Titans and the Justice League had come to blows. Barda seems more amused than concerned over Rose and their potential fight is neutralized by other forces. 

===New Ravager===
The Madison family in [[Chicago]] adopt Rose, but DeFarge kills her new family. The Ravager claims to have been offered $100,000 for her death by an anonymous source, but neither of them know that Deathstroke hired DeFarge, in an attempt to bring Rose closer to him.

Deathstroke anonymously alerts the Titans that Rose's life is in danger, and they fight to defend her. All of the fighters are rendered unconscious by an explosion of [[halothane]] gas, and Rose awakens in Deathstroke's lair. He apologizes to Rose for abandoning her and says that she is the only family he has left. Deathstroke suggests that she become his apprentice, offering DeFarge as her first kill. Rose accepts and takes the name “Ravager” for herself. Deathstroke secretly injects Rose with the same serum that gave him his abilities, and it causes her to suffer from [[psychosis]]. 

Deathstroke doubts Rose’s readiness to work with him and plans to disown her after she hesitates and is unable to kill Deathstroke’s son [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] (when he has possessed the body of [[Beast Boy]]). To prove her loyalty, she gouges out an eye to match his missing eye.

After Rose suffers a defeat at the hands of [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]], Deathstroke allows her to be trained by [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], who leads Slade to believe has given up being a hero. Nightwing agrees to train Rose so that he can teach her to lead a better life. In order to test Grayson's loyalty, Deathstroke replaces Rose's missing eye with a [[kryptonite]] one and pits Nightwing and Rose against [[Superman]]. Rose attempts to kill Superman with the kryptonite, but Nightwing, proving he is still a hero, tells her that over time, the kryptonite will slowly kill her and lead to a painful death. Enraged that her father has betrayed her, Rose breaks her ties with Deathstroke and runs away.

===One Year Later===

[[One Year Later|One year after the events]] depicted in the “[[Infinite Crisis]]” crossover, Rose became a member of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. She wore the same costume and wielded two [[katana]]-style swords. With Deathstroke and his serum's influence gone, Rose appeared more balanced than previously depicted. [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the newest [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], admitted Rose to the team as a favor to her former mentor, Nightwing.  

After Rose joins the team, she develops a sexual attraction to Robin.  One night, naked, she was on the Boy Wonder's bed, propositioning him for sex. Robin not only just rejected her, but handcuffed her as well, and another member, Kid Devil, enters to his immense shock and amusement.      

Rose formed a friendship with [[Kid Devil]], the other new Teen Titan. When Kid Devil was injured during a mission, Rose defended him, and on multiple occasions threatened those she deems a threat to him. Rose had an antagonistic relationship with [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], and she told Kid Devil that she was afraid that if the old Teen Titans rejoined the team, she would be kicked out. She also said she was afraid that if she was kicked out, her father would find her and inject her with the serum again. Unknown to her, that Robin prepared a counter-serum in case her father does it to her again, revealed on ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #44.

Recently, the Teen Titans came to the conclusion that they needed more members. After discovering that Raven believed there was a traitor on the team during the previous year, the team agreed to begin with her. The team traveled the world in search of Raven, who was apparently on the run from the traitor. They also met several other former Titans, such as [[Red Star (comics)|Red Star]], [[Zachary Zatara|Zatara]], and [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]]. During a meeting with Bombshell, Rose was accused of being the latest Traitor, working for Deathstroke instead. She denied the accusation, supported by not only Kid Devil, but also Wonder Girl, who believed Rose would never go back to her father. Robin and Cyborg agreed that Ravager would return to the Tower. Furious, Rose prepared to quit the team altogether until the team's caretakers, Wendy and Marvin, revealed to her that the traitor had stolen one particular object: the computer disk containing Jericho's essence.

Realizing why Raven is truly on the run, Ravager quickly returned to the Titans' aid, just as the traitor is revealed to be Bombshell. Ravager manages to save Raven, just as the empathic Titan uses the same spell which resurrected her, to resurrect Rose's dead and previously insane half-brother Jericho. Upon the resurrection of her elder brother, Joseph and Rose begin fraternizing, unaware that Bombshell's betrayal was orchestrated by Deathstroke, and that their teammates had been subdued by [[Titans East|his associates]].

Later, Rose and Joey fly to New York to have lunch with Nightwing, after which they go to the original Titans Island and discover that someone has built a demented version of the original tower there.  Upon entering, they find that their father has kidnapped their teammates, all in order to gain control of them again.  Rose and Joey then aid in rescuing Robin from Slade and Batgirl, during which Rose finally has her rematch with Cassandra Cain.  Rose and Joey both attempt to stop their father, but they are defeated and left at his mercy until Nightwing, Donna Troy, Raven, Cyborg, Duela Dent, Beast Boy, and Flash arrive.

Following the death of her former-teammate, [[Bart Allen]], Rose attends his funeral in ''Countdown #43'' along with the rest of the Teen Titans.
 
In ''Teen Titans'' #50, Rose is present for Bart's wake, although she slips off after a while, bored with the sombre, reminiscient atmosphere, and invites Kid Devil to join her in skinny-dipping in the Titan's swimming pool.

*When the Teen Titans were thrown back in time after teaming up with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], they found that they had arrived 10 years into their own future. Their future selves had turned [[evil]], and a [[Titans East]] team had been formed to stop them. Rose Wilson was a member of the Titans East and was in love with Bart Allen, then the Flash,  who was spying on the evil Titans. Rose and the Flash helped the Teen Titans to return home.
*In ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #41, Kitten, the daughter of [[Killer Moth]], began dressing up as the daughter of other villains, and a newspaper clipping featured a picture of her as Deathstroke's Daughter.
*''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #49 features the Ravager, as she goes on a rampage, determined to inherit her fathers rightful legacy.  She ends up joining the Titans.
