'''Rose Wilson''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC universe|universe]]. She is the [[illegitimate]] daughter of [[Deathstroke the Terminator]] (Slade Wilson), enemy of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]].  

==Character history==
===Birth===
Slade met Rose's mother, Lillian Worth, on a search-and-rescue mission a few years after his divorce with Adeline Kane.  It was his mission to see that she safely escaped war-torn [[Cambodia]] to [[Thailand]].  Wilson and Worth had an on-and-off love affair when their paths crossed along the way.  Lili kept Rose a secret from Slade, believing it was in the child's best interest.

Lili eventually settled down at a [[brothel]] in [[New York City]].  During a time when Slade was injured and a fugitive of the law, Lili took him in and nursed his wounds.  At this time Wintergreen, Slade's butler, discovered now 14-year-old Rose and suspected she was Slade's daughter.

===Revelations===
At a later point, a man assuming the identity of the [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager III]] (who would later be revealed to be Slade's half-brother, Wade DeFarge) was hunting down Slade's connections and loved ones.  Wade discovered Rose, captured her, and told her that Slade was her father.  Wintergreen and Lili launched a rescue attempt.  Lili was presumed dead when she drove a jeep over a cliff trying to run over Ravager.  Wintergreen succesfully rescued Rose and escaped.

Rose tried to reach out to her father, who turned her away, fearing for her safety because he believed he was responsible for the deaths of two of his sons.  He left her in the care of Wintergreen, who intended to adopt her, but Slade had already made plans to leave her in the care of the Titans. During a training excercise, Rose was injured and taken to the hospital.  Her pre-cognitive powers emerged for the first time, and she had an extensive vision of Slade's future.  She was able to enter and see through another's body in this vision, but she woke up before she able to further test her powers.  She left the Titans shortly afterwards, and did not see them again until the [[Technis Imperium conflict]].

===The new Ravager===
Rose found a home with Margaret and Mark Madison in [[Chicago]] when they adopted her, although this was shortly ruined when the Ravager killed her new family. The Ravager claimed to have been offered $100,000 for her death by an anonymous source (though he said he had done it for free, since he hated her father so much). Slade was actually the one who had hired the Ravager, in an attempt to push Rose towards him.

The Titans showed up just in time, having been alerted by Deathstroke anonymously that Rose's life was in danger.  During the fight, all parties involved were all rendered unconscious by an explosion of [[halothane]] gas.  Rose awoke in Slade's lair, where he apologized to Rose for abandoning her and said that she was the only family he had left. Slade suggested she become his apprentice, offering the Ravager as her first kill.  Rose accepted, and became the new Ravager. Slade gave her the same serum that gave him his abilities, which has caused her to suffer from [[psychosis]]. Rose has yet to discover about the serum, or that it was Slade who was responsible for the death of her foster parents.

Slade doubted her readiness to work with him and was going to disown her after she hesitated and was unable to kill his remaining son, her half-brother [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]. To prove her loyalty, she gouged out an eye to match his missing eye.

Currently, she is under the training of [[Nightwing]], who, for his own reasons, has joined up with Deathstroke.
