'''Rose Wilson''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. She is a member of the [[Teen Titans]] and the [[legitimacy (law)|illegitimate]] daughter of [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]].

==Fictional character biography==
Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) meets Lillian Worth on a search-and-rescue mission a few years after his [[divorce]] from Adeline Kane. His mission is to make sure that she escapes war-torn [[Cambodia]] safely. After an intermittent love affair with Wilson, Worth gives birth to a daughter whom she names Rose. Believing it to be in the child's best interest, Worth keeps Rose a secret from Wilson. Worth eventually settles down at a [[brothel]] in [[New York City]], and during a time when Deathstroke is injured and a fugitive from the law, Worth takes him in and nurses his wounds. Deathstroke's butler [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]] discovers 14-year-old Rose and suspects that she is Deathstroke's daughter.

Deathstroke's half-brother Wade DeFarge, using the name [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]], later kills Deathstroke's friends and family. DeFarge discovers Rose, captures her, and tells her that Deathstroke is her father. Wintergreen and Worth launch a rescue attempt, but Worth is presumed dead after she drives a jeep off a cliff while trying to run over DeFarge. Wintergreen successfully rescues Rose and escapes.

Rose tries to reach out to her father, but he turns her away. He fears for her safety because he believes himself to be responsible for the deaths of two of his sons. Deathstroke leaves her in the care of the [[Teen Titans|Titans]] superhero team. During a training exercise, Rose is injured and taken to the hospital, and her precognitive powers emerge for the first time when she has a lengthy vision of Deathstroke's future. She awakens before she can test her powers further. She leaves the Titans shortly after and does not see them again until the Technis Imperative conflict when she allies herself with the Titans to save fellow Titan [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. During this incident she vocally challenges the New God [[Big Barda]], as the Titans and the Justice League had come to blows. Barda seems more amused than concerned over Rose and their potential fight is neutralized by other forces. 

===New Ravager===
The Madison family in [[Chicago]] adopt Rose, but DeFarge kills her new family. The Ravager claims to have been offered $100,000 for her death by an anonymous source, but neither of them know that Deathstroke hired DeFarge, in an attempt to bring Rose closer to him.

Deathstroke anonymously alerts the Titans that Rose's life is in danger, and they fight to defend her. All of the fighters are rendered unconscious by an explosion of [[halothane]] gas, and Rose awakens in Deathstroke's lair. He apologizes to Rose for abandoning her and says that she is the only family he has left. Deathstroke suggests that she become his apprentice, offering DeFarge as her first kill. Rose accepts and takes the name “Ravager” for herself. Deathstroke secretly injects Rose with the same serum that gave him his abilities, and it causes her to suffer from [[psychosis]].

Deathstroke doubts Rose’s readiness to work with him and plans to disown her after she hesitates and is unable to kill Deathstroke’s son [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] (when he possesses the body of [[Beast Boy]]). To prove her loyalty, she gouges out an eye to match his missing eye.

After Rose suffers a defeat at the hands of [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]], Deathstroke places her under the tutelage of [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], who leads Slade to believe he has given up being a hero. Nightwing agrees to train Rose, while surreptitiously teaching her the values of heroism. Although Rose develops a crush on Nightwing as the training progresses, the attraction seemed entirely one-sided. In order to test Grayson's loyalty, Deathstroke replaces Rose's missing eye with one carved from [[Kryptonite]] and pits her and Nightwing against [[Superman]]. Rose attempts to kill Superman, but Nightwing uses Superman's concern for the safety of not only the civilian bystanders, but Rose herself as her final lesson on altruism. Nightwing agrees to stay away from Rose on the condition that [[Blüdhaven]] remained off-limits to the latest incarnation of [[Secret Society of Super Villains#Lex Luthor's Society|The Society]], of which Deathstroke is a charter member. Following the bombing of Blüdhaven on Deathstroke's orders in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Nightwing returns and informs Rose that the Kryptonite Deathstroke had implanted in her eye-socket is not just a danger to Kryptonians, but it is also [[carcinogenic]] and is indeed lethal to humans under extended periods of prolonged exposure. Enraged and heartbroken that her father would endanger her life so dismissively, and emboldened by Nightwing's tutelage, Rose breaks all ties with her father and runs away.

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later|One year after the events]] depicted in the ''Infinite Crisis'' crossover, Rose once again joins the [[Teen Titans]]. She wears the same costume and wields two [[katana]]-style swords. With Deathstroke and his serum's influence gone, Rose appears more balanced than previously depicted. [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the newest [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], admits Rose to the team as a favor to the team founder and ex-leader, her former mentor, Nightwing.

Rose forms a friendship with [[Kid Devil]], the other new Teen Titan. When Kid Devil is injured during a mission, Rose defends him, and on multiple occasions threatens those she deemed a threat to him. After a hostile confrontation with the then ex-Titan [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], Rose begins to question the security of her position on the team. To ensure her continued acceptance and membership on the Teen Titans, she drunkenly attempts to seduce Tim Drake, by waiting for him naked in his bed. Robin not only rejects her, but handcuffs her as well. Responding to an unrelated security alert, Kid Devil enters the room to find a handcuffed Rose pinned to the bed by Tim Drake, exclaiming, "Hot damn!" She later admits to Kid Devil that she is afraid of being kicked out, should the old members return to the team.

Recently, the Teen Titans come to the conclusion that they needed more members. After discovering that [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] believes there was a traitor on the team during the previous year, the team agrees to begin with her. The team travels the world in search of Raven, who is apparently on the run from the traitor. They also meet several other former Titans, such as [[Red Star (comics)|Red Star]], [[Zachary Zatara|Zatara]], and [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]]. During a meeting with Bombshell, Rose is accused of being the latest traitor, working for Deathstroke instead. She denies the accusation, supported by not only Kid Devil, but also Wonder Girl, who believes Rose would never go back to her father. Robin and Cyborg agree that Ravager would return to the Tower. Furious, Rose prepares to quit the team altogether until the team's caretakers, [[Wendy and Marvin]], reveal to her that the traitor had stolen one particular object: the computer disk containing Jericho's essence.

Realizing why Raven is truly on the run, Ravager quickly returns to the Titans' aid, just as the traitor is revealed to be Bombshell. Ravager manages to save Raven, just as the empathic Titan uses the same spell which resurrected her, to resurrect Rose's dead and previously insane half-brother Jericho. Upon the resurrection of her elder brother, Joseph and Rose begin fraternizing, unaware that Bombshell's betrayal was orchestrated by Deathstroke, and that their teammates have been subdued by [[Titans East|his associates]].

Later, Rose and Joseph fly to New York to have lunch with Nightwing, after which they go to the original Titans Island and discover that someone has built a demented version of the original tower there. Upon entering, they find that their father has kidnapped their teammates, all in order to gain control of them again. Rose and Joey then rescue Robin from Slade and Batgirl, during which Rose finally has her rematch with Cassandra Cain. Rose and Joey both attempt to stop their father, but they are defeated and left at his mercy until Nightwing, [[Donna Troy]], Raven, Cyborg, [[Duela Dent]], Beast Boy, and [[Wally West]] arrive.

Following the death of her former-teammate, [[Bart Allen]], Rose attends his funeral in ''Countdown #43'' along with the rest of the Teen Titans.
 
In ''Teen Titans'' #50, Rose is present for Bart's wake, although she slips off after a while, bored with the somber, reminiscent atmosphere, and invites Kid Devil to join her in skinny-dipping in the Titans' swimming pool.

===Titans Tomorrow===
In ''Teen Titans'' #51 (Vol.3), the [[Titans Tomorrow]]- a possible future versions of the current Titans team- arrive in the present to aid the Teen Titans against [[Starro]]-controlled villains. Ravager's future-self is absent from the group and it is revealed that she betrays the team (primarily Bart Allen and Kid Devil) at some point. Kid Devil, his adult version Red Devil, and Rose are then sent to battle against [[Rampage (DC Comics)|Rampage]] & [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]]. Red Devil tries to convince Eddie to let Rose die during the fight, so that she does not manage to betray them in the future. Initially it appears that Eddie intends to do so, before betraying his older self in order to aid Rose. Later, the trio return to the Titan's Lair (home of the original Teen Titans), where they meet with [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]]. There, Red Devil attacks Blue Beetle claiming that he too cannot be trusted.

Eddie, Rose, and Jaime find themselves surrounded by an Army of Titans led by [[Lex Luthor]], before they all battle against an invading army of Starros. Thanks in large part to Blue Beetle's powers and Robin and Wonder Girl managing to supposedly alter Robin's future (and thus alter the future of the Titans as a whole), the Army of Titans is apparently defeated.

===Terror Titans===
In ''Teen Titans'' #57, Rose is attacked by [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Bolt (DC Comics)#Legacy|Dreadbolt]] of the [[Terror Titans]], who had managed to infiltrate [[Titans Tower]]. During the battle, they goad Rose about the fate of Kid Devil, whom they had earlier captured. Despite overwhelming numbers, they are unable to take down Rose. Rose ruptures a gas line with her energy swords, blowing up a section of the tower. Rose is revealed to have survived the explosion by crossing the swords, creating a forcefield. She then follows the Terror Titans back to their base, saving Wonder Girl from [[Disruptor (comics)|Disruptor]] and Persuader. She then battles [[Clock King]], her own precognitive powers matching him. Clock King offers Rose a place on his team, but she refuses. Clock King then ejects the Titans from his base. Back at the tower, Rose overhears Robin and Wonder Girl talking about her almost killing Persuader during battle, and deciding there will be "repercussions". Rose decides to leave the Titans, using one of Clock King's teleportation devices to do it. 

In ''Terror Titans'' #1, Ravager is seen talking with Clock King, negotiating her role within his group. She agrees to take part in one of [[The Dark Side Club]]'s arena battles, fighting against [[Fever (DC Comics)|Fever]]. Rose defeats Fever, but when given the order to finish her, refuses, prompting Clock King to have Fever shot in the head. Although appaled by Fever's death, Rose stays, hoping to find out what Clock King's plan is. Continuing to fight in the tournament, Rose faces off against [[Static (comics)|Static]], and is almost killed.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #4</ref> Rose eventually discover that Clock King intends to use the mind-controlled teen heroes as his own "Martyr Militia" to destroy Los Angeles, entirely for his own amusement. Attempting to get help, Rose is attacked by the Terror Titans, who overwhelm her.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #5</ref> Help comes in the form of [[Miss Martian]], who had been posing as one of the brainwashed teens, and had managed to use her telepathy to free them. Ravager follows the retreating villains back to their base, where she confronts Clock King. Despite their equal precognitive abilities, Ravager is able to defeat him, although she was unable to prevent his escape.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #6</ref>

===Deathtrap===
Ravager returns during the ''Teen Titans/Titans/Vigilante'' crossover "Deathtrap", seeking to save Jericho, who had been targeted by [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. However, the unbalanced Jericho refuses her offer of help, continuing in his plot to kill the Titans, forcing Rose to team up with the heroes to stop him. <ref>''Teen Titans'' #70 (Vol.3)</ref> It is also apparent that she has become addicted to the adrenaline given to her by the [[Clock King]].

===Co-Feature===
Following the "Deathtrap" storyline, Rose briefly tries her hand at being a part of the Titans, but finds that she does not belong with them. After an altercation with Bombshell, staged to ensure her loyalty to the team, Rose leaves to find her own way in life.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #71</ref> From Teen Titans #72 onwards, Ravager is featured in a 10-page, 9 part co-feature written by [[Sean McKeever]].

===Blackest Night===
In the ''Teen Titans'' tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Rose tracks Deathstroke down to his old mentor [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]]'s house and attacks him. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. When Grant attacks Deathstroke, intending to burn him in a fireplace, Rose reluctantly intervenes, saving her hated father. She then attempts to incinerate Wade, but is surprised when Jericho jumps out of his body.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #77 (November 2009)</ref> Jericho, whose eyes had grown back since back since Vigilante's attack, uses his powers to make the Black Lanterns destroy themselves. After the battle, Rose refuses to reconcile with Deathstroke, despite acknowledging her  daughterly love for him. She also realises that her mother may still be alive, as she was not among the attacking Black Lanterns.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (Vol. 3) #78 (December 2009)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Injected with the same serum that enhanced her father Deathstroke, Rose has increased reflexes, stamina, and strength, but is also prone to psychotic episodes, such as when she gouged out her own eye to be more like her father. She has received some training from Nightwing, including the virtues of being a hero. She also possesses a precognitive sense that lets her see into the immediate future. This allows her to react to oncoming attacks against her and to counter them accordingly.

She currently wields twin energy katanas that can cut through anything except flesh, and briefly ''merge'' into an energy shield. She also carries with her a small stash of adrenaline, both because Clock King had briefly managed to make her addicted to the substance, and also because while high on adrenaline her precognitive sense evolves into the ability to glimpse scenes from her immediate future. However, the more she uses adrenaline to enhance her powers, the more her metabolism is unbalanced, straining her health.

==Other versions==
*When the Teen Titans are thrown back in time after teaming up with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], they find that they have arrived 10 years into their own future. Their future selves have turned [[evil]], and a [[Titans East]] team has been formed to stop them. Rose Wilson is a member of the Titans East and is in love with Bart Allen, then the Flash, who is spying on the evil Titans. Rose and the Flash help the Teen Titans to return home. However, when the future Titans travel to the present, the timeline altered since their younger selves returned, Bart Allen was now a clone, and just as unscrupulous as his teammates. It was revealed that Rose's counterpart is dead, as her teammates on Titans East all joined the Titans Army. <ref>''Teen Titans'' #51-54</ref>
*In ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #41, [[Kitten (Teen Titans)|Kitten]], the daughter of [[Killer Moth]], begins [[Duela Dent#Teen Titans Go!|dressing up as the daughter of other villains]], and a newspaper clipping features a picture of her as Deathstroke's Daughter.
*Rose appears in Tiny Titans, although she does not go by Ravager.
*''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #49 features the Ravager as she goes on a rampage, determined to inherit her fathers rightful legacy. She ends up joining the Titans when they offer her family. Although her mask covers one eye, Rose still retains both eyes in this series.
