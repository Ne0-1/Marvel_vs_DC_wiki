'''Rose Wilson''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character, an anti-hero in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. She is a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and the [[illegitimate]] daughter of [[Deathstroke the Terminator]].

==Character history==
Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) met Lillian Worth on a search-and-rescue mission a few years after his divorce from Adeline Kane. His mission was to make sure that she escaped war-torn [[Cambodia]] safely. After an intermittent love affair with Wilson, Worth gave birth to a daughter whom she named Rose. Believing it to be in the child's best interest, Worth kept Rose a secret from Wilson. Worth eventually settled down at a [[brothel]] in [[New York City]], and during a time when Deathstroke is injured and a fugitive from the law, Worth takes him in and nurses his wounds. Deathstroke's butler [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]] discovers 14-year-old Rose and suspects that she is Deathstroke's daughter.

Deathstroke's half-brother Wade DeFarge, using the name [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]], later kills Deathstroke's friends and family. DeFarge discovers Rose, captures her, and tells her that Deathstroke is her father. Wintergreen and Worth launch a rescue attempt, but Worth is presumed dead after she drives a jeep off a cliff while trying to run over DeFarge. Wintergreen successfully rescues Rose and escapes.

Rose tries to reach out to her father, but he turns her away. He fears for her safety because he believes himself to be responsible for the deaths of two of his sons. Deathstroke leaves her in the care of the [[Titans (comics)| Titans]] superhero team. During a training exercise, Rose is injured and taken to the hospital, and her precognitive powers emerge for the first time when she has a lengthy vision of Deathstroke's future. She awakens before she can test her powers further. She leaves the Titans shortly after and does not see them again until the [[Technis Imperium]] conflict when she allies herself with the Titans to save fellow Titan [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].

===New Ravager===
The Madison family in [[Chicago]] adopt Rose, but DeFarge kills her new family. The Ravager claims to have been offered $100,000 for her death by an anonymous source, but neither of them know that Deathstroke hired DeFarge, in an attempt to bring Rose closer to him.

Deathstroke anonymously alerts the Titans that Rose's life is in danger, and they fight to defend her. All of the fighters are rendered unconscious by an explosion of [[halothane]] gas, and Rose awakens in Deathstroke's lair. He apologizes to Rose for abandoning her and says that she is the only family he has left. Deathstroke suggests that she become his apprentice, offering DeFarge as her first kill. Rose, deprived of and desperate for love, accepts his offer and takes the name “Ravager” for herself. Deathstroke secretly injects Rose with the same serum that gave him his abilities, and it causes her to suffer from [[psychosis]]. 

Deathstroke doubts Rose’s readiness to work with him and plans to disown her after she hesitates and is unable to kill Deathstroke’s son [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]. To prove her loyalty, she gouges out an eye to match his missing eye.

After Rose suffers a defeat at the hands of [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]], Deathstroke allows her to be trained by [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], who has apparently given up being a hero. Nightwing agrees to train Rose so that he can teach her to lead a better life. In order to test Grayson's loyalty, Deathstroke replaces Rose's missing eye with a [[kryptonite]] one and pits Nightwing and Rose against [[Superman]]. Rose attempts to kill Superman with the kryptonite, but Nightwing tells her that over time, the kryptonite will slowly kill her and lead to a painful death. Enraged that her father has betrayed her, Rose breaks her ties with Deathstroke and runs away.

====Future Timeline====
When the Teen Titans are thrown back in time after teaming up with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], they find that they have arrived ten years into their own future. Their future selves have turned “evil”, and a [[Titans East]] team has formed to stop them. Rose Wilson is a member of the Titans East and is in love with Kid Flash, who is spying on the evil Titans. Rose helps the Teen Titans to return home.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
{{spoiler}}
One year after the events depicted in the “Infinite Crisis” crossover, Rose is a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. She wears the same costume and wields two [[katana]]-style swords. She calls herself a “good girl” but still exhibits violent behavior and appears to have difficulty reining in her antisocial tendencies. With Deathstroke and his serum's influence gone, Rose appears more balanced than previously depicted. [[Tim Drake|Robin]] admitted Rose to the team as a favor to her former mentor Nightwing.  

Rose also has a friendship with [[Kid Devil]], the other new Teen Titan. When Kid Devil is injured during a recent mission, Rose defends him, and on multiple occasions threatens those she deems a threat to him. Rose has an antagonistic relationship with [[Cassandra Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]], and she tells Kid Devil that she is afraid that if the old Teen Titans rejoin the team, she will be kicked out because nobody wants her as a member. She also says she is afraid that if she does get kicked out, her father will find her and inject her with the serum again, making her psychotic once more. With the recent return of Jericho to the current team, they are beginning to build a relationship.
