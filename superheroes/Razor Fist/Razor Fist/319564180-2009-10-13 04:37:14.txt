'''Razor Fist''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. There have actually been 3 characters, all virtually identical in appearance and ability, to go by this title. The original Razor Fist was killed off in the comic books many years ago.  The next two characters to take the title were brothers. The current Razor Fist is the only surviving brother.

==Fictional character biography==
===William Young===
The first Razor-Fist was an assassin, bodyguard, and enforcer employed by Carlton Velcro, working at Velcro's estate on the coast of the Gulf of Lions, southern France. Velcro surgically replaced this man's hands with steel blades. Razor Fist battled [[Shang-Chi]], and was accidentally shot to death by Carlton Velcro's guards.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #29</ref>

[[Doctor Doom]] later constructed two robot duplicates of Razor Fist, which he pitted against Shang-Chi.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #59-60</ref>

===Douglas Scott===
Called Razor-Fist because of his fast punches, this man and his brother took the same title and pretended to be only one person. Each brother lost one hand in a car accident, which were subsequently replaced by long knife-like stabbing weapons by Carlton Velcro. Velcro employed the brothers at his mansion on an island in the Marquesas. The brothers were assigned by Velcro to hunt down [[Shang-Chi]] and Pavane. This Razor-Fist was accidentally shot to death by Velcro.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #105</ref>

===William Scott===
When the current Razor-Fist and his brother battled [[Shang-Chi]], this one was defeated and captured by Shang-Chi and Pavane.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #105</ref> Sometime after the first brother was killed the other brother (the current Razor Fist) lost his other hand. This happened in the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] mini-series. When he came up against Colleen Wing, she managed to sever his hand.<ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #1-2</ref>

Razor-Fist later appeared with blades on both hands. He teamed with [[Zaran#Zaran (Maximillian Zaran)|Zaran]] and [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] to attack the [[West Coast Avengers]] on behalf of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Deltites. Razor Fist was defeated by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], but he escaped.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #11</ref>

Later, he began working for the crime-lord Roche in [[Madripoor]], was assigned to kill [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. With the assistance of a mutant pseudo-[[vampire]], he overpowered Wolverine and was able to knock the weakened Wolverine off a cliff. The mutant, [[Sapphire Styx]], had drained all of Wolverine's strength with her vampiric powers.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #2-4</ref> When next they fought, Wolverine barely beat him and appeared to kill him.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #9</ref> Razor Fist's recovery from this seemingly fatal encounter has never been explained. 

Fully recovered, Razor Fist fought [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in an attempt to collect a reward for Hawkeye's right arm from [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]. He was defeated by Hawkeye, but joined in Crossfire's mass attack on Hawkeye. He was defeated by Mockingbird again and taken into police custody.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #24-25</ref>

Razor Fist was also apparently killed by [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] when he attempted to claim a bounty that had been put on her head.<ref>''Elektra'' #5-6</ref> As with his previous apparent death his survival has not been explained. When he next appeared, battling [[Spider-Man]], he had a set of [[cybernetic]] prostheses with blades attached. These were severed and broken by another martial artist named [[Shen Kuei|Cat]]. After this encounter Razor Fist was sent to prison.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #81</ref>

In the wake of the great supervillain breakout in the pages of ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'', Razor Fist escaped along with all the other villains.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1-4</ref> He has recently appeared in the ''[[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]'' miniseries. There, he replaced both of his prosthetic hands with actual razors, and attracted a group of young children who are victims of [[self-harm]]. He was then easily defeated by the hero and returned to prison.<ref>''Toxin'' #1-6</ref>

Razor Fist since been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35</ref> He later attacked the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], and [[Mister Fear]]'s other bodyguards. The fight is interrupted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] who takes out [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] and Razor Fist who is also working for the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], unintentionally allowing the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] to escape.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #102</ref> He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Dr. Strange.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2</ref> In [[Secret Invasion]], he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''New Avengers'' #46</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref> [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Living Laser]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and Razor Fist are sent by the Hood to retrieve [[Tigra]] and [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] after they flee from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. They attack the heroes, who are ultimately saved by [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Each Razor Fist has no known superhuman powers.  However, each Razor Fist's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes & reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance are honed to the peak of human conditioning. The first Razor Fist's hands were both surgically replaced with steel blades which he used as weapons, while the latter two Razor Fists initially had only one hand replaced with a steel blade; the last remaining Razor Fist eventually had his other hand replaced by a similar blade as well.

Each Razor Fist is highly skilled in multiple forms of hand to razor fist combat, with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts.
