'''Razor Fist''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. There have actually been 3 characters, all virtually identical in appearance and ability, to go by this title. The original Razor Fist was killed off in the comic books many years ago.  The next two characters to take the title were brothers. The current Razor Fist is the only surviving brother.

==Fictional character biography==
The current Razorfist began as a foe of [[Shang-Chi]]. Called Razor-Fist because of his fast punches, he also had a brother who took the same title and they pretended to be only one person. Both brothers lost one hand in a car accident, which were subsequently replaced by long knife-like stabbing weapons. Sometime after the first brother was killed the other brother (the current Razor Fist) lost his other hand. This happened in the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] mini-series. When he came up against Colleen Wing, she managed to sever his hand.

Later, he fought [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in [[Madripoor]], and with the assistance of a mutant pseudo-[[vampire]], was able to knock the weakened Wolverine off a cliff. The mutant, [[Sapphire Styx]], had drained all of Wolverine's strength with her vampiric powers. When next they fought, Wolverine barely beat him and appeared to kill him. Razor Fist's recovery from this seemingly fatal encounter has never been explained. 

Razor Fist was also apparently killed by [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] when he attempted to claim a bounty that had been put on her head. As with his previous apparent death his survival has not been explained. When he next appeared, battling [[Spider-Man]], he had a set of [[cybernetic]] prostheses with blades attached. These were severed and broken by another martial artist named [[Shen Kuei|Cat]]. After this encounter Razor Fist was sent to prison.

In the wake of the great supervillain breakout in the pages of ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'', Razor Fist escaped along with all the other villains. He has recently appeared in the ''[[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]'' miniseries. There, he replaced both of his prosthetic hands with actual razors, and attracted a group of young children who are victims of [[self-harm]]. He was then easily defeated by the hero and returned to prison.

Razor Fist since been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>New Avengers #35</ref> He later attacked the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], and [[Mister Fear]]'s other bodyguards.<ref>Daredevil vol. 2 #102</ref>The fight is interrupted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] who takes out [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] and Razor Fist who is also working for the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], unintentionally allowing the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] to escape. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Dr. Strange. In [[Secret Invasion]], he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''New Avengers'' #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Razor Fist has no known superhuman powers.  However, Razor Fist's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are honed to the peak of human conditioning.

Razor Fist is highly skilled in multiple forms of hand to razor fist combat.
