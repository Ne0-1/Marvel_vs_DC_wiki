'''Razor Fist''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. There have actually been 3 characters, all virtually identical in appearance and ability, to go by this title. The original Razor Fist was killed off in the comic books many years ago.  The next two characters to take the title were brothers. The current Razor Fist is the only surviving brother.

==Character Biography==

The current Razorfist began as a foe of [[Shang-Chi]]. Called Razor-Fist because of his fast punches, he also had a brother who took the same title (they pretended to be only one person). Both brothers lost one hand in a car accident, which were subsequently replaced by long knife-like stabbing weapons. Sometime after one brother was killed the other brother (the current Razor Fist) lost his other hand. 

Later, he fought Wolverine in Madripoor, and with the assistance of a mutant pseudo-vampire, was able to knock the weakened Wolverine off of a cliff. The mutant, Saphire Styx, had drained all of Wolverine's strength with her vampiric powers. When next they fought, Wolverine easily beat him and appeared to kill him. There was never any explanation for how he healed from his seemingly fatal injuries or why he has no scars from being sliced apart by Wolverine. 

At some point he decided to take on Electra who had a price on her head. This didn't work out so well and he was beaten senseless by the female ninja (yet again seemingly killed). When he next appeared, battling [[Spider-Man]], he had bought a set of cybernetic prostheses with blades attached. These were severed and broken by another martial artist named Cat. Razor Fist went to prison.

In the wake of the great supervillain breakout in the pages of ''New Avengers'', Razor Fist escaped along with all the other villains. He has recently appeared in the [[Toxin]] miniseries. There, he has replaced his prosthetic hands with actual razors, and has attracted a group of young children who are victims of [[self-harm]].

==Powers and abilities==
Razor fist has no superhuman powers.  He is in absolute peak physical condition. He has exceptional physical strength and is quite massive, standing nearly 6 and a half feet tall and wieghing nearly 300 pounds, with little body fat. If he had hands with which to grasp he could lift over 600 pounds, making him among the strongest non-superhuman marvel supervillains. It has never been revealed how he has been able to develop his upper body strength to such a tremendous, although not superhuman degree, without hands. His reflexes and endurance are similarly of the olympic level. 

He has also somehow survived lethal injuries. He has never been described as having superhuman abilities, but it is difficult to explain his tendency to be impaled and then show up a few years later without any scars to show for his injuries (that would have killed an ordinary human). This is more likely the result of inconsistant and lazy writing; the savior of obscure second and third string supervillains.

The blades that extend from his wrists are retractable and composed of a highly dense form of steel. At one time he had his hands replaced with cybernetic implants. These were destroyed. 

He is a master of numerous forms of unarmed combat, with a level of skill nearly reaching that of Iron Fist.
