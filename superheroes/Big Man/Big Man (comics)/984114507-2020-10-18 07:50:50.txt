'''Janice Foswell''' is daughter of the original Big Man (Fredrick Foswell) and sought to follow in her father's footsteps to gain control of the New York underworld. She was soon joined by a new [[Crime Master]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #39</ref>

She and her Enforcers were defeated by [[Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sons of the Tiger]]. Over a dispute about eliminating Spider-Man and the Sons, Janice was killed by the Crime Master who turned out to be her fianc√© and son of the original Crime-Master, Nick Lewis Jr. (both had separately pursued vengeance against Spider-Man without knowledge of each other's identity).<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #40</ref>

=== Frederick Foswell Jr ===
'''Frederick Foswell Jr''' is the son of the original Big Man, and brother of the second Big Man. He took over the role to gain revenge for the death of his father and sister, which, owing to [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s then-hostile attitude towards Spider-Man, he blamed on the webslinger. Piloting a giant robot version of the Big Man, he attacked Spider-Man and Jameson, assuming Jameson would help kill Spider-Man. Spider-Man and the remorseful Jameson quickly defeated Foswell Jr.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13 (2019)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent is named '''Mr. Big''', a mobster and the Enforcers' leader.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #9</ref> Mr. Big was scheming to overthrow [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], using [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] as a secret weapon.
