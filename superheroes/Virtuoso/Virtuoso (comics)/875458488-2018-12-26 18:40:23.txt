'''Virtuoso'''<ref>http://gailsimone.tumblr.com/post/25952729067/revsoncorp-from-secret-six-vol-3-no-18-of</ref> is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]]. Created by [[Gail Simone]] and [[Dale Eaglesham]], she first appeared in ''[[Villains United]]'' #5 (November 2005).

==Fictional character biography==
Virtuoso first appears as part of a group of [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]] members launching an assault of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] and their headquarters called '[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|The House of Secrets]]'. The Secret Six have long opposed the Society.<ref>''Villains United'' #5 (November 2005)</ref>

Among Virtuoso's allies are [[Deathstroke]], [[Giganta]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. During the battle, Virtuoso is stabbed in the shoulder.<ref>''Villains United'' #6 (December 2005)</ref>

Not much is known about her. She seems to have acquired the powers and [[violin]] of the late [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]], who had been executed in a previous Secret Six mission.

She is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

She later joins the [[Suicide Squad]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #67 (March 2010)</ref> She has a Hindu caste mark on her forehead and may be tied in with the background of the original [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]], who gained his abilities in India.

During the events of [[Blackest Night]], Virtuoso is one of the Suicide Squad members sent to ambush the Secret Six at [[Belle Reve]]. She uses her abilities to subdue [[Ragdoll (comics)|Ragdoll]], but is defeated by [[Jeannette (comics)|Jeannette]]'s sonic scream. Before Jeanette can finish Virtuoso, the three are approached by the Fiddler, now resurrected as a [[Black Lantern]]. Virtuoso becomes estatic upon seeing him, claiming that she is a big fan of his and that he inspired her. She offers to give him back his violin, but he simply smiles and tells her that he intends to kill her instead.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 2) #17 (March 2010)</ref> Virtuoso and her comrades are ultimately forced to band together with the Secret Six, and together they are able to destroy the [[Black Lantern]]s.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 2) #18 (April 2010)</ref>
==In other media==
An amalgamation of Virtuoso and [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]] named '''Izzy Bowin''' appears in [[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]], portrayed by Miranda MacDougall. Izzy is a [[Country music|country]] singer and violinist who was abandoned at a young age by her parents. In the first episode of the [[The Flash (season 4)|fourth season]], "The Flash Reborn", while on a bus, Izzy was exposed to dark matter energies that were released when Flash escaped from the Speed Force. This caused Izzy to gain the ability to deliver powerful sonic waves from her fiddle. In the episode "Subject 9", [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Elongated Man]] try to protect her when she is targeted by the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], who is in [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]]'s body. Despite attempts by Flash and Elongated Man to stop him, the Thinker uses a combination of the powers of Hazard, [[Brain Storm (comics)|Brain Storm]], [[Dwarfstar]], and [[Kilg%re]] to counter their attempts. Izzy has her powers and body taken over by the Thinker who then escapes.
