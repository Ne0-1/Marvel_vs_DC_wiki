'''Jigsaw''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] villain and [[archenemy]] of [[Punisher|The Punisher]]. Created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Ross Andru]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #162 (Nov. 1976).

Jigsaw is unique in that he is one of the Punisher's few recurring foes, as the Punisher tends to use lethal force on his adversaries. Why Jigsaw is continually spared and imprisoned is unknown; it seems to be due to Jigsaw being the most notable Punisher villain who is more of a traditional comic book character, instead of the more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistically]] portrayed villains the Punisher usually faces (mainly it is due to the writers not wanting him to be killed).

==Fictional character biography==
Billy Russo was a brutal assassin for the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime family, nicknamed "the Beaut" because of his good looks. He was also a favorite assassin for the Costa crime family. After the [[execution]]-style killings that inadvertently led to the deaths of Frank Castle's family, Russo was hired by Bruno Costa to assassinate another assassin who had failed to kill Frank Castle as well. Russo killed all of his targets but Castle, who narrowly avoided death in an explosion. Hours later, Castle returned and tracked down Russo to one of the Maggia's [[nightclubs]]. Several criminals were killed, and Russo was thrown through a [[glass]] pane head-first. He survives with his face torn to shreds; [[surgeons]] stitch it back together like a [[jigsaw puzzle]]. 

Taking advantage of his now hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster took on the identity of Jigsaw, and initially attempts to frame the Punisher for murder. However, the plan failed due to the intervention of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]; Spider-Man witnesses one of Jigsaw's murders and one of his victims was an old friend of Nightcrawler. <ref> ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #162 </ref>

It is revealed in the first Punisher miniseries that Jigsaw was behind a plan to drug the Punisher, causing his enemy to behave erratically and attack any criminals, even for things as minor as littering.  The Punisher confronts and beats him, and later stops Jigsaw from escaping in a prison riot. Later on in the series, Jigsaw is brainwashed by the Trust into serving as a member of a Punisher-style assassination squad. He manages to remember who he is after encountering Castle once again, and attacks the Punisher, but is once again beaten.

Jigsaw becomes involved with a demon worshipper he refers to as 'the Rev'. Based on healing demonstrations, the Rev convinces Jigsaw to work for him in exchange for healing his face. Jigsaw follows the man on a home invasion/murder spree, and then kills several cops on the way out; Jigsaw would cotinue to work for the Rev for some time, eventually leaving his service after his death at the hands of the Punisher and subsequent resurrection by the Rev and his master, Lucifer (actually [[Belasco]]).<ref>''The Punisher #35''</ref>

Jigsaw has been a persistent foe of the Punisher's for years. While he still works as an [[assassin]] for [[criminal organizations]], his pursuit of the Punisher is relentless, as Jigsaw sees Castle's assassination as an unfinished job. The deranged gangster's vendetta once took a bizarre turn when the Punisher faked his death by appearing to be executed in prison. Furious with rage, Jigsaw briefly became a new Punisher, getting revenge on Castle's apparent killers for denying him the kill he believes to be rightfully his.

In Jigsaw's mid-2000s appearances, he was one of many villains trying to break out of the Raft, a floating [[prison]] for supervillains and other high-risk criminals. Jigsaw has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers #35''</ref>

Jigsaw has also recently appeared in the new Punisher:  War Journal Series; wearing a color-inverted mockup of the Punisher costume.  His plan appears to be to brainwash individuals involved with the Punisher; similar to what the trust did to him during the first Punisher series.

==Other versions==
===2099===

'''Jigsaw 2099''', originally known as '''Multi-Fractor''', is a  fictional villain in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Marvel 2099]]'' imprint. He is an enforcer for the Cyber Nostra, the main crime organisation of 2099 New York. He was a recurring villain in ''[[The Punisher 2099]]'' and was created by [[Pat Mills]] and [[Tony Skinner]].

In one incident, corrupt police officers set Multi-Fractor against Punisher for the enjoyment value. The Punisher believes he has killed the villain. The police officers die under the control of Punisher's ally Axel Stone.

Captured by rogue military officers, his body is augmented with a [[cybernetic]] shell and a [[gorilla]] arm. The arm itself was put on backwards but kept that way on the whim of the soldiers. Fractor escapes, killing most of his tormentors. He was later assaulted by youths with a deliberately malfunctioning [[teleportation]] unit, causing his body to look even more like patchwork.

===Elseworlds===
Jigsaw also appeared in both ''[[Elseworlds]]'' [[Batman]]/Punisher [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] books. In the first crossover, Jigsaw allies with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and they both fight Punisher and 'Batman' (Really [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] during the ''[[KnightFall]]'' saga). In the second crossover, Jigsaw returns to [[Gotham City]] and allies with Joker once again, undergoing facial reconstruction surgery. His facial restoration is relatively short, however, as Punisher disfigures him once more with a fragmentation grenade (notable is that Jigsaw's character is closer to that of [[Two-Face]], though likely paired with Joker instead to avoid such comparisons).

== In other media ==

* A character based upon Jigsaw also appeared in the [[The Punisher (2005 video game)|2005 Punisher video game]], but with an origin that ties directly into the [[The Punisher (2004 film)|2004 Punisher film]]. In this version, Jigsaw is John Saint, the son of Howard Saint, the film's primary antagonist and the man responsible for the death of Frank Castle's family. The explosion at the end of the film did not kill him, but, similar to Marvel Comics' Jigsaw, sends him through a window, disfiguring his face. Using the name Jigsaw, he takes up his father's old business, vowing revenge on the Punisher. He is the final boss of the game.

* In 2006, Jigsaw was announced as one of the figures in the second wave of the Marvel Legends Face Off series. He is paired with the Punisher, and come in two versions, a business suit and a Punisher costume. The two-pack was released in December, 2006. <ref> http://www.oafe.net/monkey/mlfo2_pj.php </ref>

* [[Dominic West]] has been confirmed for the part of Jigsaw in the upcoming Punisher movie,'' [[Punisher: War Zone]]'', though the character's name has slightly been changed to Billy Russoti. <ref> http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib429a97580f60ae29d95ad64fd083514 </ref>

* Jigsaw appears as the final boss of ''[[Punisher computer and video games#Game Boy port|The Punisher]]'' video game for the Game Boy, replacing the Kingpin, who was the last character fought in the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of the game.
