'''Jigsaw''' ('''Billy "The Beaut" Russo''') is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Throughout his many appearances, he has served as one of the [[Punisher]]'s few recurring villains.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
Created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Ross Andru]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #162 (November 1976).

==Fictional character biography==
Billy Russo was a professional criminal and brutal assassin for the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime family, nicknamed "the Beaut" because of his good looks. He was also a favorite assassin for the Costa crime family. After the [[execution]]-style killings that inadvertently led to the deaths of Frank Castle's family, Russo was hired by Bruno Costa to assassinate another assassin who had failed to kill Frank Castle as well. Russo kills all of his targets but Castle, who narrowly avoids death in an explosion. Hours later, Castle returns and tracks down Russo to one of the Maggia's [[nightclubs]]. Several criminals were killed, and Russo was thrown through a [[glass]] pane head-first. He survives with his face torn to shreds; because of the extent of the facial damage, [[surgeon]]s stitch it back together like a [[jigsaw puzzle]].

Taking advantage of his now hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster took on the identity of Jigsaw, and initially attempts to frame the Punisher for murder. However, the plan failed due to the intervention of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]; Spider-Man witnesses one of Jigsaw's murders and one of his victims was an old friend of Nightcrawler.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #162 (November 1976)</ref> Jigsaw later battled Spider-Man again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #188 (January 1979)</ref>

It is revealed in the first ''Punisher'' miniseries that Jigsaw was behind a plan to drug the Punisher, causing his enemy to behave erratically and attack any criminals, even for things as minor as littering. Jigsaw also attempts to kill the Punisher in prison.<ref>''The Punisher'' #1 (January 1986)</ref> The Punisher confronts and defeats him, and later stops Jigsaw from escaping in a prison riot. Later on in the series, Jigsaw is brainwashed by the Trust into serving as a member of a Punisher-style assassination squad. He manages to remember who he is after encountering Castle once again, and attacks the Punisher. He is defeated once more.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Jigsaw becomes involved with a demon worshipper, Reverend Samuel Smith, whom Jigsaw refers to as "[[Rev (comics)|the Rev]]". Based on healing demonstrations, the Rev convinces Jigsaw to work for him in exchange for healing his face.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #35 (July 1990)</ref> Jigsaw follows the man on a home invasion/murder spree, and then kills several cops on the way out; Jigsaw would continue to work for the Rev for some time. When the Rev finally did heal Jigsaw's face, Jigsaw was killed at the hands of the Punisher.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #39 (November 1990)</ref> He was subsequently resurrected by the Rev and his master, Lucifer (actually [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]]). He battled the Punisher and his face was ruined again when the Punisher pushes him face down into an [[aloe]] plant.<ref>''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #40 (December 1990)</ref>

Jigsaw has been a persistent foe of the Punisher's for years. While he still works as an [[assassination|assassin]] for [[criminal organizations]], his pursuit of the Punisher is relentless, as Jigsaw sees Castle's assassination as an unfinished job. The deranged gangster's vendetta once took a bizarre turn when the Punisher faked his death by appearing to be executed in prison. Furious with rage, Jigsaw briefly became a new Punisher, getting revenge on Castle's apparent killers for denying him the kill he believes to be rightfully his.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

After his arrest for attacking [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]]'s home,<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #63-64 (October–November 2004)</ref> Jigsaw was one of many villains to break out of the Raft, a floating [[prison]] for supervillains and other high-risk criminals. He breaks Spider-Man's arm in the escape.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol 1 #2</ref> He was later seen fighting [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 1 #2 (February 2005)</ref> Once freed, Jigsaw fought and was defeated by [[Tigra]]. This humiliating defeat led to his forming an alliance with the self-proclaimed "super-villain Kingpin" the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]; together the two joined forces to brutally torture the super-heroine Tigra, which Jigsaw recorded with a video camera.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (December 2007)</ref> He also takes part in the attack on the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], attempting to murder [[Jessica Jones]]. He was foiled by [[Spider-Man]].{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Jigsaw has resumed his vendetta against the Punisher, in the pages of ''Punisher: War Journal''. Now wearing a color-inverted mockup of the Punisher costume, Jigsaw arranged for the brainwashing of a young auxiliary police officer in the NYPD. Exploiting the naive cop's pathological "hero-worship" complex, Jigsaw and his new psychiatrist girlfriend turn the young man into a new version of the Punisher.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

After a battle on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] where the Punisher once again spares Jigsaw's life, Jigsaw is taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. While imprisoned he is seemingly shot dead by the man that he and his girlfriend (who was actually undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Lynn Michaels]]) had brainwashed.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

In "[[Secret Invasion]]", he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''New Avengers'' #46 (December 2008)</ref>

He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50 (April 2009)</ref> His tech-savvy son, [[Henry Russo|Henry]], aids Punisher in his war on [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] director [[Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - The Punisher'' #1 (December 2009)</ref><ref name="1through5">{{Cite comic | Writer=Remender, Rick | Title=Punisher | Volume=7 | Issue=1-5 | Date=January–May 2009 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jigsaw is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. During his time in prison he was able to hone his physical strength to a level comparable to the Punisher. He has extensive experience with street-fighting techniques, and familiarity with a variety of weapons and criminal techniques. He carries various handguns as needed. He has been known to wear a special exo-skeleton in his outfits.

Though lacking any formal military training, Jigsaw is an exceptional strategist and tactician. His unorthodox pattern of operation makes him more difficult for the Punisher to anticipate than the majority of Punisher's enemies. Before Jigsaw was disfigured he was a highly charismatic leader and criminal organizer; after the accident only the latter trait remained.

==Other versions==
===2099===

In the second crossover, Jigsaw returns to [[Gotham City]] and allies with Joker once again, undergoing facial reconstruction surgery, although his true face is never seen as it is kept concealed under a mass of bandages. His facial restoration is relatively short, however, as Punisher disfigures him once more with a [[fragmentation grenade|frag grenade]]. Interestingly, he is one of the few Marvel characters to be directly referenced in an in-continuity DC book. During the "[[Knightfall|KnightSaga]]", Jean Paul Valley, who replaced Bruce Wayne as Batman, references his battle with Jigsaw during a mental hallucination.<ref>''Batman'' #509 (July 1994)</ref>

During a raid on the cartel's base, Frank and Jigsaw have a fight that results in Jigsaw falling through a broken window and onto a passing freight train.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 6, #61-65 (October 2008 – February 2009)</ref>

==In other media==
===Film===
[[Image:War Zone Jigsaw.jpg|thumb|[[Dominic West]] as Jigsaw, in the 2008 film ''Punisher: War Zone''.]]
* [[Dominic West]] portrays Jigsaw in the film ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'', though the character's real name has been changed slightly to Billy "The Beaut" Russoti.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib429a97580f60ae29d95ad64fd083514 | title=Trio paged for 'Punisher' roles | work=The Hollywood Reporter | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> In this film, while attending a meeting, the Punisher attacks and kills a mob family. Billy escapes and is pursued by the Punisher. Later, Billy accidentally falls into a glass crusher, and the Punisher turns the machine on which grinds him around multiple times against broken glass bottles. Although Russoti does not die, his face is horrifically mutilated, leaving him permanently disfigured. However, his plastic surgeon is unable to restore his face, stating that Billy's facial muscles, tendons and skin were damaged beyond repair, leaving him with his trademark disfigurement. After killing the surgeon, he chooses to remain focused on killing the Punisher, going under the name "Jigsaw". He then breaks his mentally unstable brother, James "LBJ/Looney Bin Jim" Russoti, out of a mental hospital and they plan their revenge on the Punisher. He is eventually impaled on a sharp metal pole by the Punisher before he is thrown into a fire, killing him in the final battle at the Brad Street Hotel.

===Video games===
* Jigsaw appears as the final boss in the [[Game Boy]] port of [[LJN]]'s video game version of ''[[The Punisher (1990 video game)#Game Boy port|The Punisher]]'', replacing the Kingpin, who was the last character fought in the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of the game.

* In [[Capcom]]'s 1993 video game version of ''[[The Punisher (arcade game)|The Punisher]]'', Jigsaw appears as a sub-boss in the game's sixth and final stage, where he is fought inside a moving elevator within the Kingpin's hideout, armed with an [[M-16 rifle]]. The game's rendition of Jigsaw is a [[head swap]] of a generic enemy character named "Gaullee",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadequartermaster.com/capcom/punish_enemies.html |title=The Punisher &#124;&#124; Enemies |publisher=Arcadequartermaster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27}}</ref> and unlike other boss characters in the game, he has no lines of dialogue with the player.

* A character based upon Jigsaw also appeared in the 2005 ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|Punisher]]'' video game (but with an origin that ties directly into 2004's ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'' film), voiced by Darryl Kurylo. In this version, Jigsaw is John Saint, the son of [[Howard Saint (The Punisher)|Howard Saint]] (the film's primary antagonist and the man responsible for the death of Frank Castle's family). The explosion at the end of the film did not kill him, the explosion sends John through a window disfiguring his face. Using the name "Jigsaw", he takes up his father's old business vowing revenge on the Punisher. He is also a lieutenant of a rogue [[Yakuza]] organization called the "Eternal Sun" and the final boss of the game. After defeating Jigsaw, using stolen [[Iron Man's armor|Stark Armor]], a cutscene is shown where the Punisher seemingly kills Jigsaw by throwing him out of a flying [[helicopter]] to deliver him to the cops.

* Jigsaw appears in the [[PlayStation Network]] [[downloadable]] video game ''[[The Punisher: No Mercy]]'' as one of many playable villains.

===Toys===
* In 2006, Jigsaw was one of the figures in the second wave of the [[Marvel Legends]] "Face-Off" series. He was paired with the Punisher and came in two versions, one with a business suit and one with a Punisher costume. The two-pack was released in December 2006.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oafe.net/monkey/mlfo2_pj.php | title=Marvel Legends Face-Off: Punisher/Jigsaw Review | work=OAFE.net}}</ref>
