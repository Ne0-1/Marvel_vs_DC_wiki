'''Jigsaw''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] villain and [[archenemy]] of [[The Punisher]]. Created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Ross Andru]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #162 (Nov. 1976).

==Fictional character biography==

Billy Russo was a brutal assassin for the [[Maggia]] crime family, nicknamed "the Beaut" because of his good looks. He was also a favorite assassin for the Costa crime family. After the [[execution]]-style killings that inadvertenty led to the deaths of Frank Castle's family, Russo was hired by Bruno Costa to assassinate another assassin who had failed to kill Frank Castle as well. Russo killed all of his targets but Castle, who narrowly avoided death in an explosion. Hours later, Castle returned and tracked down Russo to one of the Maggia's [[nightclubs]]. Several criminals were killed, and Russo was thrown through a [[glass]] pane head-first. He survived with his face torn to shreds; [[surgeons]] stitched it back together like a [[jigsaw puzzle]]. Taking advantage of his now hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster took on the identity of Jigsaw, and initially attempted to frame the Punisher for murder. However, the plan failed due to the intervention of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Nightcrawler]]; Spider-Man witnessed one of Jigsaw's murders and one of his victims was an old friend of Nightcrawler's.

Jigsaw has been a persistent foe of the Punisher's for years. While he still works as an [[assassin]] for [[criminal organizations]], his pursuit of the Punisher is relentless, as Jigsaw sees Castle's assassination as an unfinished job. The deranged gangster's vendetta once took a bizarre turn when the Punisher faked his death by appearing to be executed in prison. Furious with rage, Jigsaw briefly became a new Punisher, getting revenge on Castle's apparent killers for denying him the kill he believes to be rightfully his.

In Jigsaw's mid-2000s appearances, he was one of many villains trying to break out of the Raft, a floating [[prison]] for supervillains and other high-risk criminals. Jigsaw was among those who were stopped by the [[New Avengers]] and presumably returned to confinement.

Jigsaw is unique in that he is one of the Punisher's few recurring foes, as the Punisher tends to use lethal force on his adversaries. Why Jigsaw is continually spared and imprisoned is unknown; this seems to be due to the fact that Jigsaw is the most notable Punisher villain who is more of a traditional comic book character, instead of the more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistically]] portrayed villains the Punisher usually faces.

==Elseworlds==
Jigsaw appeared in both ''[[Elseworlds]]'' [[Batman]]/Punisher [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] books. In the first, Jigsaw allies with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and they both fight Punisher and 'Batman' (Really [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] during the ''[[KnightFall]]'' saga). In the second crossover, Jigsaw returns to [[Gotham City]] and allies with Joker once again, undergoing facial reconstruction surgery. His facial restoration is relatively short, however, as Punisher disfigures him once more with a fragmentation grenade (notable is that Jigsaw's character is closer to that of [[Two-Face]], though likely paired with Joker instead to avoid such comparisons).

==Other media==
A character based upon Jigsaw also appeared in the [[The Punisher (2005 video game)|2005 Punisher video game]], but with an origin that ties directly into the [[The Punisher (2004 film)|2004 Punisher film]].

In this version, Jigsaw is John Saint, the son of [[Howard Saint]], the film's primary antagonist and the man responsible for the death of Frank Castle's family. The explosion at the end of the film does not kill him, but, similarly to Marvel Comics' Jigsaw, sends him through a window, disfiguring his face. Using the name Jigsaw, he takes up his father's old business, vowing revenge on the Punisher. He is the final boss of the game.

In 2005, Marvel CEO [[Avi Arad]] confirmed that Jigsaw will be the primary villain in the upcoming [[The Punisher 2|sequel]] to the 2004 Punisher movie.

In 2006, Jigsaw was announced as one of the figures in the second wave of the Marvel Legends Face Off series. He is paired with the Punisher, and come in two versions, a business suit and a Punisher costume. The two-pack was released in December, 2006.

Jigsaw has been announced as the villain for the Punisher sequel[http://movies.ign.com/articles/750/750039p1.html], even if the movie itself is still in the writing phase.
