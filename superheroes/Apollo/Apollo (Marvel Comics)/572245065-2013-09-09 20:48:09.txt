Apollo, Artemis, and Hephaestus appear in a meeting with [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]] and [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]], where Hera reveals her plans to them.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #123''</ref> Athena reached out to Apollo, but he refused to aid her, preferring to "wait and see".<ref>''Assault on New Olympus Prologue''</ref> Apollo later appeared at Herclues' funeral, in the company of [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] (now the leader of the Olympians after the deaths of Zeus and Hera), Pluto, [[Neptune (Marvel Comics)|Neptune]], and [[Hebe (Marvel Comics)|Hebe]].<ref>''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Apollo possesses the typical powers of an [[Olympians (comics)|Olympian]], including superhuman strength, speed, durability, and reflexes, and virtual immortality.

Apollo can also radiate great heat and light at will, and has the power to heal the injuries of others with superhuman rapidity.  

Apollo also has precognitive abilities enabling him to perceive events in alternate futures.

Apollo is a master archer with his bow and arrows, and an extraordinary musician and harp player with his lyre.

Apollo rides about on enchanted chariots built by [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]].  They are drawn by magical horses and are capable of flight and inter-dimensional travel.

==Other versions==
In one alternate future Apollo, by orders of Zeus, lends his chariot and steeds to Hercules, for use on his exile in space. The steeds only need the occasional feeding, which sometimes happens when they consume unwilling humanoids. <ref>''Hercules'' vol. 1 #1-4</ref> In the following four-issue volume, Apollo and the other Olympians exit Olympus, leaving Hercules there to father a new race of gods. Both volumes happen in the 23rd century. <ref>''Hercules'' vol. 2 #1-4</ref>
