==Fictional character biography==
Calendar Man is fascinated by dates and calendars â€“ even his real name is a pun on the [[Julian day|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s. His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Because his crimes are generally petty and often ridiculous in nature, he is notorious among both heroes and villains alike for being something of a joke. Consequently, his post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] appearances have been few and far between. He was once recruited by [[Killer Moth]] to form the villain team known as "The Misfits".

His best-known latter day appearance is in the mini-series ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', where he is portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-like figure, offering insight in Batman's search for [[Holiday (comics)|Holiday]], a [[serial killer]] who uses holidays as his ''modus operandi''. Like Lecter in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', Calendar Man knows who [[Alberto Falcone|the]] [[Gilda Dent|killer]] is and keeps this information to himself, choosing instead to taunt the heroes with cryptic clues. He returns in that story's sequel, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]''. In both stories, he is bitter that the new murderous rogues have taken the attention off him; Day fears that he is being forgotten.  He is seriously harmed by Sofia Falcone near the end of ''Dark Victory'', described as being barely alive and having his jaw broken.

Calendar Man is also known for teaming up with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Killer Moth]] as part of ''The Misfits'', a group of third-rate villains trying to prove themselves, in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7-9 (1992-1993).<ref name="dc-ency"/>  Also, he is among the [[Arkham Asylum]] inmates freed by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'', but he is easily recaptured by [[Power Girl]] shortly after his escape.

He appears in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #14 (Nov '93). He and several other time-based villains, including [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]], fight the title's heroes over a valued hourglass.

Day appears in the third issue of the ''80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition'' (July 2000) entitled "All the Deadly Days". He has acquired a new high-tech costume, and moves up to more grandiose crimes.

Day appears in [[Harley Quinn]]'s series, as an inside informant to the fugitive.

In Week 20 of the weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a radio broadcasts a message saying that Calendar Man was left tied up for the cops in Gotham City, even though there is no Batman. It is revealed the new heroine [[Batwoman]] was responsible for his capture.<ref>"52" Week Twenty</ref>

==Other versions==
*The ''Batman: Brave and the Bold'' version of Calendar Man appears in the story "Last Christmas!" He plans a Christmas crime, only to encounter Batman. When a zeta beam teleports Batman away, he claims it to be a Christmas Miracle, minutes before Earth is destroyed. After Batman and [[Adam Strange]] restore Earth, Batman proceeds to easily defeat Calendar Man.

*An older Calendar Man appears in the ''[[Batman Beyond (2010)|Batman Beyond]]'' comic book arc "Hush Beyond". From his wheelchair, he builds a greeting card rigged to explode, intending to kill [[Barbara Gordon|Commissioner Gordon]]. [[Terry McGinnis|Batman]] arrives to stop him, only to be confronted by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]].<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #3 (July 2010)</ref> Hush mentions that Batman's "true family" is his many enemies, and he plans to destroy it. He then proceeds to kill Calendar Man.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #3 (August 2010)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Calendar Man appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark-Mite" voiced by [[Jim Piddock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8890/tcid/1 |title=Interview |publisher=Collider.com |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> When Bat-Mite was deciding which opponent to fight Batman, he tricks Bat-Mite into summoning Calendar Man. Unaware of [[Bat-Mite]]'s effect, Calendar Man is whispered to by Batman to take a dive. He does so, but Bat-Mite isn't pleased. He upgrades Calendar Man into '''Calendar King''' with the ability to conjure henchmen version of holiday icons (like [[Jack-o'-lantern|Jack O'Lantern]] Monsters, [[Santa Claus]]-themed bikers, uber-patriotic [[Uncle Sam]]s, and Mutant [[Easter Bunny|Easter Bunnies]]). After the henchmen and Calendar King are defeated, Bat-Mite sends Calendar Man back to where he pulled him from. He was later seen in "Mayhem of the Music Meister" shown as inmate of Arkham Asylum and in "A Bat Divided" hanging out with the bad guys at a bar until [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up.

* A female variation of the character named ''[[Calendar Girl (DC animated universe)|Calendar Girl]]'' appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. She wears a mask due to mental scars (in her own mind, at least; physically, she is still perfect) and plans her crimes around the [[Season|Four Seasons]], with a different costume corresponding to each season. She is voiced by [[Sela Ward]].

*In the season 2 premiere of ''[[The Venture Bros]]'', The Monarch has gotten together a rag-tag group of super villains to help him escape from prison. One of the villains is a character by the name Mr.Monday, Monday's design is almost identical to Calendar Man, with the only difference being an obsession with Mondays.

===Video games===
*In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Calendar Man's cell is shown. The wall is covered with calendar pages. Also, a character bio of Calendar Man can be unlocked, but he does not actually physically appear in the game. Calendar Man will appear in the sequel, ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''.
