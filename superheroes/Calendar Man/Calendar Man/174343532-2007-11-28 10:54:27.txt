'''Calendar Man''' (real name: '''Julian Gregory Day''') is a [[DC Comics]] supervillain. His main enemy is [[Batman]]. He first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]] #259'' (September 1958). He was created by [[Bill Finger]].

==Character overview==
Calendar Man is fascinated by dates and calendars â€“ even his real name is a pun on the [[Julian day|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s. His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders.

==Reception==
Because his crimes are generally petty and often ridiculous in nature, he is notorious among both heroes and villains alike for being something of a joke, particularly in the grittier Post-[[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] era. No one really takes him seriously, including the fans themselves. [[IGN]] went so far as to call him the worst Batman villain of all time, noting that his "name, appearance and [[modus operandi]]... command no respect."<ref>Hilary Goldstein, "[http://comics.ign.com/articles/622/622304p1.html The Best & Worst Batman Villains]," [[IGN]], June 3, 2005, URL accessed 12 January 2006.</ref> Consequently, his post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] appearances have been few and far between. He was once recruited by [[Killer Moth]] to form the villain team known as "The Misfits".

==Appearances Post-Crisis==
His best-known latter day appearance is in the mini-series ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', where he is portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-like figure, offering insight in Batman's search for [[Holiday (comics)|Holiday]], a [[serial killer]] who uses holidays as his M.O. Like Lecter in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', Calendar Man knows who the killer is and keeps this information to himself, choosing instead to taunt the heroes with cryptic clues. He returns in that story's sequel, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]''. In both stories, he is bitter that the new murderous rogues has taken the attention from him; Day fears that he is being forgotten.  He is seriously harmed by Sofia Falcone near the end of Dark Victory, described as being barely alive and having his jaw broken.

Calendar Man is also known for teaming up with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Killer Moth]] as part of ''The Misfits'', a group of third-rate villains trying to prove themselves, in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7-9 (1992-1993). Also, he is among the [[Arkham Asylum]] inmates freed by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in "[[Knightfall]]", but he is easily recaptured by [[Power Girl]] shortly after his escape.

He appears in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #14 (Nov '93). He and several other time-based villains, including [[Time Commander]], fight the title's heroes over a valuable hourglass.

==Update==
In recent years, comic book writers have tried to make Calendar Man a greater threat to Batman as told in a story in the third issue of the ''80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition'' (July 2000) entitled "All the Deadly Days". In this story, Day appears in a new high-tech costume, and moves up to more grandiose crimes.

Day appears in [[Harley Quinn]]'s series, as an inside informant to the fugitive.
