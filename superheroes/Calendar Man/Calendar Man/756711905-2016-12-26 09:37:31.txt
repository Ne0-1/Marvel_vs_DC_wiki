'''Calendar Man''' (real name '''Julian Gregory Day''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], as an enemy of [[Batman]]. Calendar Man is known for committing crimes that correspond with [[holidays]] and significant [[Calendar date|dates]]. He often wears costumes to correlate with the date of the designated crime.

==Publication history==
Calendar Man first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]] #259'' (Sept. 1958) and was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last= Wallace|first = Daniel|contribution = Calendar Man|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 65|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place= New York|year= 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Calendar Man is fascinated by dates and calendars. His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He next appears in ''[[Batman]]'' #312 (June 1979), in which his crimes are based on the days of the week, and his costumes reflect the [[Norse Mythology|Norse]] and [[Roman Mythology|Roman]] gods they were named for, e.g. [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. Calendar Man fires a ultrasonic sound weapon at Batman, nearly killing him. While Batman recuperates, Calendar Man commits crimes on Friday and Saturday. He plans to leave [[Gotham City]] on a train called the Western Sun Express on Sunday, knowing that the police would be waiting for him to attempt to steal an artifact of the Egyptian God of the Sun, [[Ra]]. Batman captures him at the train station before he boards.

This issue also marked the first appearance of his most commonly known "calendar cape" costume. His next appearance in ''[[Batman]]'' #384-385 (June–July 1985) and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #551 (June 1985), sees the Calendar Man at the onset of the [[Crisis (DC Comics)|Crisis]] being used as a pawn of the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] in an attempt to find an assassin to eliminate Batman. In this instance, the Calendar Man's theme is holidays, and he attempts to use the young [[Jason Todd]], as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], as the Batman's Achilles' heel, with the promise of his demise on the first day of Spring. Ultimately, however, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] himself captures the villain.

His best-known latter day appearance is in the mini-series ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', where he is portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-like figure, offering insight in Batman's search for [[Holiday (comics)|Holiday]], a [[serial killer]] who uses holidays as his ''modus operandi''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/03/the-best-worst-batman-villains|title=The Best & Worst Batman Villains|work=ign.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/batman-movie-villains-list-discussion-scott-176844/8/|title=15 Batman Villains That Deserve Their Movie Due|work=screenrant.com}}</ref> Like Lecter in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', Calendar Man knows who killer is and keeps this information to himself, choosing instead to taunt the heroes with cryptic clues. He returns in that story's sequel, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', in which he impersonates deceased mobster [[Carmine Falcone]] in an effort to drive his children, [[Alberto Falcone|Alberto]] and [[Mario Falcone|Mario]], insane. When Calendar Man (as Carmine) tries to get Alberto to kill himself, however, the younger Falcone detects the ruse; Alberto knows that his father abhorred suicide, and thus figures out that Calendar Man is manipulating him. At the end of the story arc, Falcone's daughter [[Sofia Gigante]] beats him to a pulp as revenge for his role in her father's death. In both stories, Calendar Man is bitter that the new murderous rogues have taken the attention off him; he fears that he is being forgotten. 

Calendar Man is also known for teaming up with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Killer Moth]] as part of ''The Misfits'', a group of third-rate villains trying to prove themselves, in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7-9 (1992–1993).<ref name="dc-ency"/> Also, he is among the [[Arkham Asylum]] inmates freed by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'', but he is easily recaptured by [[Power Girl]] shortly after his escape.

He appears in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #14 (Nov '93). He and several other time-based villains, including [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]], fight the title's heroes over a valued hourglass.

Calendar Man appears in the third issue of the ''80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition'' (July 2000) entitled "All the Deadly Days". He has acquired a new high-tech costume, and moves up to more grandiose crimes.

He makes an appearance in the alternate reality story ''Superman: Arkham'' (beginning in Superman Vol. 2 #160). As the story begins, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] has recently stolen the reality-altering powers of Superman's enemy [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. In the warped planet Earth created by the Joker, Superman is a prisoner of Arkham Asylum, in the custody of warden [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and his assistant, Calendar Man. The latter's appearance is carried over from his revitalization in ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', which was also written by Jeph Loeb.

Day appears in the spinoff series ''[[Harley Quinn]]'', as an inside informant to the title character.

In Week 20 of the weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a radio broadcasts a message saying that Calendar Man was left tied up for the cops in Gotham City, even though there is no Batman. It is revealed the new heroine, [[Batwoman]], was responsible for his capture.<ref>"52" Week Twenty</ref>

In books of [[The New 52]], a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the DC Comics universe, the character appears as a lifestyle reporter in a series of backup stories called "Channel 52". In one, he claims to have kept up a video diary out of scavenged materials because basic human civilization has fallen.<ref>Phegley, Kiel (January 29, 2013).

In the books of [[DC rebirth]], Calendar Man's body age and rejuvenate according to season. <ref>Batman: Rebirth #1 Published in June 1st 2016. Page 10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Calendar Man is a successful inventor, capable of designing the machinery needed to deploy his various schemes. His talents aid him as he pursues his obsession with quirks of the calendar, carefully planning and theming his crimes around holidays. Calendar Man is also an experienced hand-to-hand combatant, although his main reason for his success is his intelligence. In his latest incarnation, as written by Scott Snyder and Tom King in the pages of the ''Batman Rebirth'' special (June 2016), the Calendar Man now ages with the seasonal weather of Gotham City.  Every spring he is reborn, with his DNA altered, but retained his memories, and then ages rapidly until winter when he dies, only to be reborn again the next spring by crawling from the husk of his own skin.
