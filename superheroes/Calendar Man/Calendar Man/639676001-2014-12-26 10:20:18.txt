==Fictional character biography==
Calendar Man is fascinated by dates and calendars – even his real name is a play on the [[Julian day|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s. His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After his first appearance, in which his crimes were based on the seasons of the year, his next appearance was in ''[[Batman]]'' #312 (June 1979), where his crimes were based on the days of the week, and his costumes reflected the [[Norse Mythology|Norse]] and [[Roman Mythology|Roman]] gods they were named for, i.e. [[Saturn]]. The hunt for him proves dangerous for Batman considering a confrontation on Thursday led to him being hit with Calendar Man's ultrasonic sound weapon and almost killed, forcing him to convalesce in bed for days while the supervillain committed his Friday and Saturday crimes without serious opposition. On Sunday, knowing that the police would be waiting for him to attempt to steal an artifact of the Egyptian God of the Sun, [[Ra]], he planned to leave the city instead on a train called the Western Sun Express. Fortunately, Batman realized this move and captured him at the train station before he boarded.

This issue also marked the first appearance of his most commonly known "calendar cape" costume.  His next appearance in ''[[Batman]]'' #384-385 (June–July 1985), sees the Calendar Man at the onset of the [[Crisis (DC Comics)|Crisis]] being used as a pawn of the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] in an attempt to find someone to potentially eliminate the [[Batman]] for profit.  In this instance, the Calendar Man's theme is holidays, and he attempts to use the young [[Jason Todd]], as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], as the Batman's Achilles' heel with the promise of his demise on the first day of Spring, but it is ultimately [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] who is responsible for his defeat.

Because his crimes are generally petty and often ridiculous in nature with unnecessary flashiness.  For instance, at the conclusion of Day's week spree, he took the time to needlessly change into his calendar cape costume at the train station even while Batman was in hot pursuit. As such, he is notorious among both heroes and villains alike for being something of a joke. Consequently, his post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] appearances have been few and far between. He was once recruited by [[Killer Moth]] to form the villain team known as "The Misfits".

His best-known latter day appearance is in the mini-series ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', where he is portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-like figure, offering insight in Batman's search for [[Holiday (comics)|Holiday]], a [[serial killer]] who uses holidays as his ''modus operandi''. Like Lecter in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', Calendar Man knows who [[Alberto Falcone|the]] [[Gilda Dent|killer]] is and keeps this information to himself, choosing instead to taunt the heroes with cryptic clues. He returns in that story's sequel, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]''. In both stories, he is bitter that the new murderous rogues have taken the attention off him; Day fears that he is being forgotten.  He is seriously harmed by Sofia Falcone near the end of ''Dark Victory'', described as being barely alive and having his jaw broken.

Calendar Man is also known for teaming up with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Killer Moth]] as part of ''The Misfits'', a group of third-rate villains trying to prove themselves, in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7-9 (1992–1993).<ref name="dc-ency"/>  Also, he is among the [[Arkham Asylum]] inmates freed by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'', but he is easily recaptured by [[Power Girl]] shortly after his escape.

He appears in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #14 (Nov '93). He and several other time-based villains, including [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]], fight the title's heroes over a valued hourglass.

Day appears in the third issue of the ''80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition'' (July 2000) entitled "All the Deadly Days". He has acquired a new high-tech costume, and moves up to more grandiose crimes.

Day makes an appearance in the alternate reality story ''Superman: Arkham'' (beginning in Superman Vol. 2 #160). As the story begins, the Joker has recently stolen the reality-altering powers of Superman's enemy Mr. Mxyzptlk. In the warped planet Earth created by the Joker, Superman is a prisoner of Arkham Asylum, in the custody of warden Solomon Grundy and his assistant Calendar Man. Day's appearance is carried over from his revitalization in  ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', which was also written by Jeph Loeb.

Day appears in [[Harley Quinn]]'s series, as an inside informant to the fugitive.

In Week 20 of the weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a radio broadcasts a message saying that Calendar Man was left tied up for the cops in Gotham City, even though there is no Batman. It is revealed the new heroine [[Batwoman]] was responsible for his capture.<ref>"52" Week Twenty</ref>

In books of [[The New 52]], the character appears as a lifestyle reporter in a series of backup stories called "Channel 52". In one he claims to have kept up a video diary out of scavenged materials because basic human civilization has fallen and Day fears nobody else will be recording the day-to-day events.<ref>Phegley, Kiel (January 29, 2013).

==In other media==

===Television===
* A female variation of the character named '''Calendar Girl''' appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' voiced by [[Sela Ward]]. She wears a mask due to mental scars (physically, she is still perfect) and plans her crimes around the [[Season|Four Seasons]], with a different costume corresponding to each season.

* Calendar Man appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark-Mite!" voiced by [[Jim Piddock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8890/tcid/1 |title=Interview |publisher=Collider.com |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> When [[Bat-Mite]] wants to summon a villain for Batman to fight, the Dark Knight tricks him into summoning Calendar Man, then secretly tells the confused villain to play along and pretends to knock him out. Displeased, Bat-Mite uses his reality-warping powers to upgrade the villain into '''Calendar King''', with the power to conjure monsters and henchmen themed after various holidays (including [[Jack-o'-lantern|Jack O'Lantern]] Monsters, [[Santa Claus]]-themed bikers, uber-patriotic [[Uncle Sam]]s, and Mutant [[Easter Bunny|Easter Bunnies]]). After the henchmen and Calendar King are defeated, Bat-Mite restores him to normal and sends him away. He was later seen in "Mayhem of the Music Meister" as an inmate of Arkham Asylum. In "A Bat Divided," Calendar Man is seen hanging out with the bad guys at a bar until [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up.

===Video games===
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Calendar Man's cell is featured. It is covered in calendar pages and the player can scan it to unlock Calendar Man's biography.

* Calendar Man appears in the sequel to ''Arkham Asylum'', ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. This version of Calendar Man is somewhat obese, has a slightly shorter right leg (with a brace and platform shoe), and features the calendar tattoos on his head seen in ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'' (although here they more resemble scars). Calendar Man had been occupying the Solomon Wayne Courthouse trapping anyone who entered and killing them on the next holiday. Just before the game begins, [[Two-Face]] and his minions capture the courthouse and lock Calendar Man in a cell in the basement. Calendar Man is featured in a similar manner as in ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', talking to Batman through a glass cell. If the player speaks with him on certain holidays ([[New Year's Day]], [[Valentine's Day]], [[Saint Patrick's Day]], [[April Fools' Day]], [[Mother's Day]], [[Father's Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], the [[Calendar of saints|Feast Day]] of [[Saint Roch]], [[Labor Day]], [[Halloween]], [[Thanksgiving]], and [[Christmas Day]]), he will relate a story about a crime he committed on that specific day.<ref>http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/27/arkham-city-game-demo/</ref> If the player hears all twelve stories, Calendar Man will have escaped leaving one of Two-Face's minions hanging dead from the ceiling of his cell. If the player visits Calendar Man as [[Catwoman]], he will bring up an incident involving both her and the Falcone family and will imply that [[Carmine Falcone]] might be Catwoman's father.

* Calendar Man makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''. During [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s siege on [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] on [[Christmas Eve]], he is about to be executed for his crimes. The crime lord lets him go, however, appreciating letting him go on a holiday. It is heavily implied that this directly leads to his murder of Judge Harkness, as recounted on ''Arkham City''.

===Musicals===
* Calendar Man was featured in [[StarKid Productions]] ' production of ''[[Holy Musical B@man!]]'', where he showed up at [[T.G.I. Friday's]] trying to steal their memorabilia. He is then defeated by Batman and Robin. He was portrayed by Lauren Lopez.
