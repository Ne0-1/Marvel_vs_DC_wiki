==Fictional character biography==
Calendar Man is fascinated by dates and calendars – even his real name is a play on the [[Julian day|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s. His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After his first appearance, in which his crimes were based on the seasons of the year, his next appearance was in ''[[Batman]]'' #312 (June 1979), where his crimes were based on the days of the week, and his costumes reflected the Norse gods they were named for, along with [[Saturn]]. On Sunday he did not commit any robberies as it is a day of rest and he was planning to leave town.  This issue also marked the first appearance of his most commonly known "calendar cape" costume.  His next appearance in ''[[Batman]]'' #384-385 (June–July 1985), sees the Calendar Man at the onset of the [[Crisis (DC Comics)|Crisis]] being used as a pawn of the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] in an attempt to find someone to potentially eliminate the [[Batman]] for profit.  In this instance, the Calendar Man's theme is holidays, and he attempts to use the young [[Jason Todd]], as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], as the Batman's Achilles' heel with the promise of his demise on the first day of Spring, but it is ultimately [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] who is responsible for his defeat.

Because his crimes are generally petty and often ridiculous in nature, he is notorious among both heroes and villains alike for being something of a joke. Consequently, his post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] appearances have been few and far between. He was once recruited by [[Killer Moth]] to form the villain team known as "The Misfits".

His best-known latter day appearance is in the mini-series ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', where he is portrayed as a [[Hannibal Lecter]]-like figure, offering insight in Batman's search for [[Holiday (comics)|Holiday]], a [[serial killer]] who uses holidays as his ''modus operandi''. Like Lecter in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', Calendar Man knows who [[Alberto Falcone|the]] [[Gilda Dent|killer]] is and keeps this information to himself, choosing instead to taunt the heroes with cryptic clues. He returns in that story's sequel, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]''. In both stories, he is bitter that the new murderous rogues have taken the attention off him; Day fears that he is being forgotten.  He is seriously harmed by Sofia Falcone near the end of ''Dark Victory'', described as being barely alive and having his jaw broken.

Calendar Man is also known for teaming up with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] and [[Killer Moth]] as part of ''The Misfits'', a group of third-rate villains trying to prove themselves, in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7-9 (1992–1993).<ref name="dc-ency"/>  Also, he is among the [[Arkham Asylum]] inmates freed by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'', but he is easily recaptured by [[Power Girl]] shortly after his escape.

He appears in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #14 (Nov '93). He and several other time-based villains, including [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]], fight the title's heroes over a valued hourglass.

Day appears in the third issue of the ''80 Page Giant Batman Special Edition'' (July 2000) entitled "All the Deadly Days". He has acquired a new high-tech costume, and moves up to more grandiose crimes.

Day appears in [[Harley Quinn]]'s series, as an inside informant to the fugitive.

In Week 20 of the weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a radio broadcasts a message saying that Calendar Man was left tied up for the cops in Gotham City, even though there is no Batman. It is revealed the new heroine [[Batwoman]] was responsible for his capture.<ref>"52" Week Twenty</ref>

==Other versions==
*The ''Batman: Brave and the Bold'' version of Calendar Man appears in the story "Last Christmas!" He plans a Christmas crime, only to encounter Batman. When a zeta beam teleports Batman away, he claims it to be a Christmas Miracle, minutes before Earth is destroyed. After Batman and [[Adam Strange]] restore Earth, Batman proceeds to easily defeat Calendar Man.

*An older Calendar Man appears in the ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' comic book arc "Hush Beyond". From his wheelchair, he builds a greeting card rigged to explode, intending to kill [[Barbara Gordon|Commissioner Gordon]]. [[Terry McGinnis|Batman]] arrives to stop him, only to be confronted by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]].<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #3 (July 2010)</ref> Hush mentions that Batman's "true family" is his many enemies, and he plans to destroy it. He then proceeds to kill Calendar Man.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #3 (August 2010)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Calendar Man appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark-Mite!" voiced by [[Jim Piddock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8890/tcid/1 |title=Interview |publisher=Collider.com |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> When Bat-Mite was deciding which opponent to fight Batman, he tricks Bat-Mite into summoning Calendar Man. Unaware of [[Bat-Mite]]'s effect, Calendar Man is whispered to by Batman to take a dive. He does so, but Bat-Mite is not pleased. He upgrades Calendar Man into '''Calendar King''' with the ability to conjure henchmen version of holiday icons (like [[Jack-o'-lantern|Jack O'Lantern]] Monsters, [[Santa Claus]]-themed bikers, uber-patriotic [[Uncle Sam]]s, and Mutant [[Easter Bunny|Easter Bunnies]]). After the henchmen and Calendar King are defeated, Bat-Mite sends Calendar Man back to where he pulled him from. He was later seen in "Mayhem of the Music Meister" shown as inmate of Arkham Asylum and in "A Bat Divided" hanging out with the bad guys at a bar until [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up.

* A female variation of the character named '''[[Calendar Girl (DC animated universe)|Calendar Girl]]''' appears in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' voiced by [[Sela Ward]]. She wears a mask due to mental scars (physically, she is still perfect) and plans her crimes around the [[Season|Four Seasons]], with a different costume corresponding to each season.

===Video games===
* Calendar Man's cell is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''. The wall is covered with calendar pages. Scanning the cell unlocks a character bio of Calendar Man, but he does not actually physically appear in the game.
* Calendar Man appears in the sequel to ''Arkham Asylum'', ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. This version of Calendar Man is somewhat obese, wears a brace on his right leg with a built-up shoe on his foot, and features the calendar tattoos on his head seen in ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]''. If the player visits him on different holidays, they get additional pieces of information regarding crimes he committed on these days.<ref>http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/27/arkham-city-game-demo/</ref> Batman encounters Calendar Man in a cell within the basement of a courthouse that serves as hideout for Two-Face. Before the events of the game, Calendar Man had occupied the Solomon Wayne Courthouse trapping anyone who ventures inside it and killing them on the next holiday. Two-Face arrived with a small army overpowering Day and trapping him in a glass cell. Day is featured in a similar manner as in ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', talking to the Dark Knight through a glass cell. When Batman has visited Day on 12 specific days of the year (all marked on a calendar by his cell), he will be gone and one of Two-Faces henchmen will be hanging from the ceiling of his cell instead the next time Batman visits Calendar Man's cell.
