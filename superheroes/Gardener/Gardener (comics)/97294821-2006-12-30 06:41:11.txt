The '''Gardener''' is a [[fictional character]], one of the known [[Elders of the Universe]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==

Like all the other Elders, he has been in existence since the [[Big Bang]] and thus is nearly immortal, extremely powerful, and absolutely obsessed with what he takes his name after. He cares about only two things: Peace and his garden. His alter ego (although some say he doesn't have one){{cn}} is a doctor called Tom Fowell. His most famous attribute is his amazing height, said to be around 7'1". 

At one time he created an amazing lush garden in the "blue area" of the Moon using his [[Infinity Gem]], the Time Gem. This was eventually brought to a halt when [[Adam Warlock]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] were caught up in a battle on the planet and he used his gem along with the Soul Gem of Warlock and successfully slowed down the Stranger enough to make him leave. After using his gem in battle it was corrupted and he believed he could no longer use it to make things grow; he left it behind in search of a new place for his garden (where it stayed until [[Thanos]] found it).

The Gardener was among the Elders who allied together to restart the universe by killing Galactus.  Like any Elder of the Universe, he was made completely immortal due to the mechanisms of the Grandmaster against the cosmic entity Death.  Even should he lose his obsession, he will not die.

Later, after Thanos' defeat, he retrieved the Time Gem and used it once more until Thanos again came for it, using the Gems he had already recollected to kill the Gardener and take the Time Gem. Due to the pact the Elder known as the Grandmaster has with Death that bans any Elder from dying and as confirmed by the Gardener's later appearances, Thanos did not kill him but merely incapactiated him.
