The '''Gardener''' is a [[fictional character]], one of the known [[Elders of the Universe]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Gardener was once Ord Zyonyz, a being who came into existence in the [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert Galaxy]] M-77. Like all the other Elders, he belongs to one of the first races to develop since the [[Big Bang]] and thus is nearly immortal and extremely powerful. He is absolutely obsessed with peace and quiet, and with his garden. <ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=107}}</ref> 

At one time he created an amazing lush garden in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] using his [[Infinity Gem]], the Time Gem. This was eventually brought to a halt when [[Adam Warlock]], [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] were caught up in a battle on the moon and he used his gem along with the Soul Gem of Warlock and successfully slowed down the Stranger enough to make him leave. After using his gem in battle it was corrupted and he believed he could no longer use it to make things grow; he left it behind in search of a new place for his garden<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #55</ref> (where it stayed until [[Thanos]] found it).

The Gardener was later revealed to possess Adam Warlock's Soul Gem.  He journeyed to [[K'ai]] to create a paradise valley.  There, he battled the Hulk, and lost possession of the gem.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #247-248</ref>

The cosmic entity [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] had, by proxy, lost a contest for the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. Angered, she forbade him and his fellow Elders, including the Gardener, from entering her realm. Thus the Gardener became immortal. 

The Gardener was seen among a group of abstract and near-omnipotent beings (including [[Uatu]] the Watcher, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the [[In-Betweener]], the [[Living Tribunal]], [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]], [[Master Order]], and a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]) confronting the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6</ref>

The Gardener was among the Elders who allied together to restart the universe by killing [[Galactus]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> He used Earth plants to capture [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]]. He battled Galactus and the [[Silver Surfer]], but was converted to energy and consumed by Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #9-10</ref> Along with the other Elders who were devoured by Galactus, he caused Galactus "cosmic indigestion" from within. He escaped from Galactus and took possession of an Infinity Gem. He witnessed a battled between Galactus and the In-Betweener, then aided Silver Surfer, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]], and the other Elders in helping Galactus defeat the In-Betweener.  Ultimately, the Gardener fled to escape the wrath of Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #17-19</ref>

Later, after Thanos was defeated, the Gardener retrieved the Time Gem and used it once more. Thanos confronted him, using the Gems he had already recollected to seemingly kill the Gardener and take the Time Gem, his ultimate goal to create the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1</ref>The Gardener may have survived his battle with Thanos due to Death's banning the Elders from her realm.

The [[Contemplator]] later spotted the Gardener in the Dimension Of Manifestations. This took place during the [[Infinity War]] incident. The Gardener had joined with a group of abstract and near-omnipotent beings to converse with the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Quasar'' #38</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Gardener has the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including virtual immortality, and the ability to increase his physical attributes to unrevealed superhuman levels.  Currently, due to his machinations with the other Elders against Death, he cannot die by any means.

The Gardener created his crooked staff composed of unknown materials through which he can channel cosmic energy.  He has used various of the [[Infinity Gem]]s at one time or another.

The Gardener has accumulated vast knowledge of the botany of countless alien worlds over the millennia.
