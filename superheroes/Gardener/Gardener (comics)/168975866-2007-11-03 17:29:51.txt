The '''Gardener''' is a [[fictional character]], one of the known [[Elders of the Universe]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==

Like all the other Elders, he has been in existence since the [[Big Bang]] and thus is nearly immortal, extremely powerful, and absolutely obsessed with what he takes his name after. He cares about only two things: Peace and his garden.

At one time he created an amazing lush garden in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] using his [[Infinity Gem]], the Time Gem. This was eventually brought to a halt when [[Adam Warlock]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] were caught up in a battle on the planet and he used his gem along with the Soul Gem of Warlock and successfully slowed down the Stranger enough to make him leave. After using his gem in battle it was corrupted and he believed he could no longer use it to make things grow; he left it behind in search of a new place for his garden (where it stayed until [[Thanos]] found it).

The cosmic entity [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] had, by proxy, lost a contest for the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. Angered, she forbade him and his fellow Elders, including the Gardener, from entering her realm. Thus the Gardener became immortal. 

The Gardener was among the Elders who allied together to restart the universe by killing [[Galactus]]. This failed and many of the Elders were incapacitated. 

Later, after Thanos was defeated, he retrieved the Time Gem and used it once more. Thanos confronted him, using the Gems he had already recollected to seemingly kill the Gardener and take the Time Gem, his ultimate goal to create the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]. 

The [[Contemplator]] later spotted the Gardener in the Dimension Of Manifestions. This took place during the [[Infinity War]] incident. The Gardener had joined with a group of near omnipotent beings to converse with the [[Beyonder]]
