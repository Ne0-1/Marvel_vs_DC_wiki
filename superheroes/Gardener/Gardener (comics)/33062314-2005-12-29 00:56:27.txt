The '''Gardener''' is a [[fictional character]], one of the known [[Elders of the Universe]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

Like all the other Elders he has been in existence since the [[Big Bang]] and thus is nearly immortal, extremely powerful, and absolutely obsessed with what he takes his name after. He cares about only two things: His Garden and Peace.

At one time he created an amazing lush garden in the "blue area" of the Moon using his [[Infinity Gem]], the Time Gem. This was eventually brought to a halt when [[Adam Warlock]], [[Spider-Man]], and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] were caught up in a battle on the planet and he used his gem along with the Soul Gem of Warlock and successfully slowed down the Stranger enough to make him leave. After using his gem in battle it was corrupted and he believed he could no longer use it to make things grow; he left it behind in search of a new place for his garden (where it stayed until [[Thanos]] found it).

Later, after Thanos' defeat, he retrieved it and used it once more until Thanos again came for it, using the Gems he had already recollected to kill the Gardener and take the Time Gem.
