'''Bushwacker''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is primarily an enemy of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], although he has had dealings with [[The Punisher]].

===Character Biography===
Originally a priest, Carl Burbank abandoned his vows following the drug-related deaths of young parishioners. He joined the [[C.I.A.]], which outfitted him with a cybernetic arm and make him an assassin under the codename Bushwacker, but ultimately he went freelance.

At some point, an event took place that compelled Bushwacker to begin a war against all mutants. Bushwacker began hunting and murdering mutants, most often those mutants whose abilities Bushwacker perceived as making them especially talented in the arts. (Bushwacker also claimed that he was paid large sums of money to kill mutants, but this has yet to be verified.) Burbank's killing spree brought him into conflict with both [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and Daredevil. Wolverine learned of Bushwacker's activities and began to hunt the killer himself. At the same time, Bushwacker's wife believed her husband was insane and needed to be placed in a hospital. She saught aid from lawyer Matt Murdock (secretly the hero Daredevil). Daredevil found Wolverine fighting Bushwacker, and he would have killed him if Daredevil hadn’t stopped him. Unfortunately, this allowed Bushwacker to escape and continue his rampage. Bushwacker was ultimately tracked down and defeated by the two heroes, which left the right side of his face horribly scarred, and he was placed in police custody.

Later, Bushwacker joined with [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] and other Daredevil-foes in a plan to beat up their common enemy. After the completion of the plan, Mary took Daredevil's body, and Bushwacker was left to his own activities.

Entering the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s employ, Burbank attacked the Punisher but was left for dead. It was during this time that his wife finally left him. He reappeared in the employ of a drug lord who hired Bushwacker to kill reporter [[Ben Urich]] who was about to run a story of his illegal activities. Instead, when Burbank learned the truth, he allowed Urich to live and to complete the exposee. However, it was Bushwacker that was proved right, as the drug lord managed to bribe himself out of jail. Bushwacker shot him, instead.

Subsequent jobs brought him into conflict with Daredevil, [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], the Punisher, [[Deathlok]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. His run-in with Nomad, in particular, was over the life of a young baby that Nomad had taken under his care. The baby was the daughter of Troy Donohue, Burbank’s ex-brother-in-law, and Bushwacker hope was that his wife would have approved of the rescue and welcome him back.

Imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]], Burbank escaped during the mass breakout engineered by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] and was subsequently employed by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] to kill the Punisher, but he was defeated once again by Daredevil.

==Powers and Abilities==
Skin can liquefy to seal wounds; given cybernetic arms that he can transform into a variety of guns.

Bushwacker is a trained military agent specializing in infiltration and assassination.

He employs powerful gadgets and weapons, most notably a flamethrower, all of which can be created by the mechanical prostheses that have replaced his forearms. He manages to load the weapons by swallowing ammo such as bullets or flamethrower fuel.

===In Other Media===
He's also an ordained minister who hunted Marvel Mutants during his early career. Bushwacker played a role in ''[[The Punisher (video game)|The Punisher]]'' video game, working for the Gnucci family. He first appears after having kidnapped Punisher's neighbor, Joan, and threatening to kill her in Central Zoo. After Punisher rescues Joan, Punisher kills off Eddie Gnucci (at his brother's funeral), forcing Ma Gnucci to call Bushwacker to her house to protect her. Bushwacker attacks Punisher in the library, causing a fire that burned down Ma's mansion. Before the fire spread, Punisher yanked off Bushwacker's right arm and shot him with the cannon it contained out of the mansion, into the garden, to ensure that Bushwacker was disarmed, fell to his death (causing severe damage and disabilities if he were revived), bled out (so that he would need a major blood transfusion to survive) and burned down in the garden, destroying a good majority of the electronics in him(to ensure that no one would "patch up" Bushwacker).
