The '''Atom''' is a fictional [[super-hero]] who debuted in publisher [[All-American Comics]]' same-name series ''All-American Comics'' in 1940, and was reimagined by [[DC Comics]] in 1961.

==Main Atoms==
===Golden Age Atom/Atom I===
The original Atom, Al Pratt, was introduced in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (October 1940). He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a [[midget|diminutive]] college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference.

Pratt soon became a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]], appearing in the team's various stories during their original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] appearances. In 1948, the Atom received a redesigned costume and the revelation that he had gained limited superstrength (from, as later comics revealed, a battle with a villain several years earlier). 

Pratt's last Golden Age appearance was in ''[[All-Star Comics]]'' #57 in 1951, also the last Golden Age Justice Society story. Pratt was revived with the rest of the team in 1963 in ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 1) #137, and continued to make various appearances in the years that followed.

In the 1980s, Al Pratt's godson Al Rothstein was introduced; Rothstein was known as the superhero Nuklon (later changing his name to [[Atom Smasher]]), first appearing in the pages of ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]''.

In the 1990s, it was revealed that Pratt had a son named Grant Emerson, who was kidnapped and genetically altered into a superbeing by the villain [[Vandal Savage]]; he soon became the superhero [[Damage (comics)|Damage]]. Damage later appeared in two incarnations of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], eventually joined the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] and became a reserve member of the Justice Society of America.

Al Pratt was murdered by the villain [[Extant (comics)|Extant]] in 1994's ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries.

===Silver Age Atom/Atom II===
The current version, introduced during the [[Silver Age of comic books]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #34 (Sept.-Oct. 1961), is physicist and university professor Raymond "Ray" Palmer (named for real-life [[science-fiction]] writer [[Ray Palmer]], who was himself quite short).  Using a mass of white [[dwarf star]] matter, he fashioned a [[lens]] that enabled him to shrink any object to any degree he wished.  However, any object so treated soon exploded as a side effect, which obviously precluded any practical use of the lens.  

During a [[spelunking]] expedition, Palmer and his friends found themselves trapped in the cave when the entrance collapsed.  In desperation, Palmer secretly used the lens he carried with him to shrink himself down in order to be able to climb to a small hole high in the wall that led to the outside, knowing full well he would likely explode himself being so treated.   Using a [[diamond]] [[engagement ring]], he enlarged the hole sufficiently and descended to the floor to try alert the others of the escape route before dying.  However, upon entering the lens' beam, he found himself returned to normal size.  As the lens was covered with cave moisture, Palmer thought it altered the beam to allow this strange effect.  When subesquent experiments showed no change with the explosions, Palmer concluded that there must be some mysterious force in his own body that allowed him to be shrunk safely and later returned to normal.  He decided to use this effect to become a superhero.

Ray Palmer created a costume from what was initially depicted as white [[dwarf star]] matter, which allows him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from  mechanisms in his belt with a back up device in his gloves. He carried out the bulk of his early superheroic adventures in his home of Ivytown. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers with his own body.  He has been a member of several incarnations of the [[Justice League]].

Neither character appears regularly in comics, and even in their heyday were mostly supporting characters, although Palmer has had several short-lived series (including ''Sword of the Atom'', in which he abandoned civilization and became a [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]-like figure, hero of a tribe of microscopic yellow-skinned humanoid aliens in the jungles of [[Central America]]).  He was later rejuvenated to a teenage state, and became a mentor of the [[Titans (comics)|Titans]]; he subsequently regained his original age and memories.

The most recent appearance of the Atom was in the mini-series ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]''(checking it out might spoil the end of the story), which had trascendental effects for him and especially for Jean, as well as for the rest of the DC characters.

==Other Atoms==
===Atom III===
[[Image:SuicideSquad46.jpg|thumb|193px|right|Adam Cray on the cover of Suicide Squad #46.]]
A third Atom, Adam Cray (son of the murdered Senator Cray), would appear in the pages of ''[[Suicide Squad]]''; At first Cray was widely believed to be Palmer in disguise (by both the fans and the characters). In actuality, Cray had been recruited by Ray Palmer himself, who faked his death in order to apprehend the [[Micro/Force]] (a group of villains that had been shrunk down) as well as uncover information about a shadowy government Cabal, who were interested in Ray Palmer's knowledge of the other heroes' secret identities (his own identity no longer a secret). While Ray would infiltrate the Micro/Force, Adam Cray would gather the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom, so that no one would notice Ray assuming the identity of a fallen Micro/Force member. 

Adam Cray ran with the Squad only for a short while, serving as a secret weapon most of the time,  and his excistence was for a while even unknown to others of the Squad. At one point, Adam approached Deadshot about the fact that Deadshot had murdered his father, and Deadshot told him that Adam would get one free shot at him, and that was it. Nothing came of the conflict, as Adam was killed shortly after by one of the Micro/Force, who believed him to be the real deal.

After the murder of Cray (a move Ray had not foreseen), Ray Palmer revealed himself and defeated the Micro/Force and Adam's murderer. The ruse had now ended, and Ray explained himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him, after hearing rumors of a new Atom.

===Atom IV===
A fourth version of the Atom has been featured in stories set eighty-three thousand years in the future, in the 853rd century, as seen in ''[[DC One Million]]''.

==Other Media==
Besides making an appearance on one of the ''[[Super Friends]]'' shows, the Atom (Ray Palmer) appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' to help [[Lex Luthor]] defend himself against [[Amazo]] and disable an alien weapon known as the Dark Heart. Both of the devices utilized [[nanotechnology]], a field in which he is an expert. He is voiced by [[John C. McGinley]].
