'''The Atom''' is a [[superhero]] created in [[1941]] for [[All-American Comics]], and recreated in [[1962]] in a self-named title, a part of [[DC Comics]]' [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. 

===Golden Age Atom===
The original Atom, Al Pratt, had no super powers; instead, he was initially a physically diminutive college student and later became a physicist. He was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference. He would become a member of the [[Justice Society of America]], and, after the [[atomic age]] began, would get a new costume. 

===The Modern Atom===

The current version is physicist and university professor Raymond "Ray" Palmer (named for science-fiction writer [[Ray Palmer]], who was himself quite short). Ray Palmer created a costume from what was initially depicted as white [[dwarf star]] matter, which allows him to shrink down to subatomic size. He has been a member of several incarnations of the [[Justice League]].

Neither character appears regularly in comics, and even in their heyday were mostly supporting characters, although Palmer has had several short-lived series (including ''Sword of the Atom'', in which he abandoned civilization and became a [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]-like figure, hero of a tribe of microscopic yellow-skinned humanoid aliens in the jungles of Central America).  He was later rejuvenated to a teenager, and  became a mentor of the [[Teen Titans|Titans]]; he subsequently regained his original age and memories.

{{spoiler}}
Palmer was suspected of murdering Sue Dibny, the wife of [[Elongated Man]], during [[Identity Crisis]]. However, his ex-wife Jean Loring had used his costume to hurt her, unintentionally killing her, to win him back. Loring was also responsible for the deaths of Captain Boomerang and the third [[Robin]]'s father. Palmer had her imprisoned at [[Arkham Asylum]] and, as of this writing, had quit the Justice League.

A third Atom, Adam Cray, appeared in the pages of ''[[Suicide Squad]]''; Cray was widely believed to be Palmer in disguise, and was murdered for that reason.

Al Pratt was murdered in 1994's ''[[Zero Hour]]'' miniseries.

A fourth version of the Atom has been featured in stories set eighty-three thousand years in the future, in the 853rd century, as seen in ''[[DC One Million]]''.
