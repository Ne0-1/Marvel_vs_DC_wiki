The '''Atom''' is a name shared by three [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

The original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], was created by writer [[Bill O'Connor (comics)|Bill O'Connor]] and artist [[Ben Flinton]] and first appeared in [[All-American Publications]]' ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (Oct. 1940). The second Atom was the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], who first appeared in 1961.

The Atom has been the star of multiple solo series, and four of the five have appeared as members of various superhero teams, such as the [[Justice Society of America]], the [[Justice League]], the [[Suicide Squad]], and the [[Justice Legion Alpha]].

==Fictional character biographies==

===Al Pratt===
{{Main|Atom (Al Pratt)}}

The original Atom, '''Al Pratt''', [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (Oct. 1940). He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a [[midget|diminutive]] college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference. Pratt was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]], later gaining limited super-strength, and an energy charged 'atomic punch'. He died in the charge against [[Hank Hall|Extant]] during the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Beatty, Scott | first = Wallace, Dan | author-link = | contribution = Atom I, II and III | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 30 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

===Ray Palmer===
{{Main|Atom (Ray Palmer)}}
The Atom introduced during the [[Silver Age of comic books]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #34 (1961) is physicist and university professor '''Raymond Palmer, Ph.D.''' (He was named for real-life [[science fiction]] writer [[Raymond A. Palmer]], who was himself quite short.) After stumbling onto a mass of [[white dwarf star]] matter that had fallen to Earth, he fashioned a [[lens (optics)|lens]] which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume, controlled by mechanisms in his belt, and later by controls in the palms of his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body. After the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]],'' Ray shrank himself to microscopic size and disappeared. Finding him became a major theme of the '''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]''' year-long series and crossover event.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Paul Hoben===
Prior to Ray Palmer's trip to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]], he learns his wife [[Jean Loring]] has had an affair with her colleague, Paul Hoben; Palmer and Loring divorce. Later, Palmer offers his blessing to the couple when they marry, and he offers Hoben his size-changing belt so that Hoben can protect [[Ivy Town]] after Ray returns to the [[List of hidden races in DC Comics#M|Morlaidhans]]. Adam Cray would later steal this belt; Hoben never uses the costume or name of the Atom.

===Adam Cray===
<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->
[[File:SuicideSquad46.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Adam Cray, ''Suicide Squad'' #46.]]

'''Adam Cray''', son of the murdered Senator Joseph Cray, first appeared as the Atom in the pages of ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #44 by [[John Ostrander]] (August 1990). Cray was initially believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise by members of the team. Cray had been recruited by Palmer (who faked his own death) to apprehend the Micro Squad, a group of villains that had been reduced in size. Palmer intended to use Cray to uncover a shadowy government cabal who were using Palmer to discover the secret identities of other costumed heroes (Palmer's own identity no longer being secret). While Palmer infiltrated the Micro Squad, Cray would attract the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom, so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Squad member.

Adam Cray remained with the Suicide Squad briefly, serving as a secret weapon whose existence was unknown to others of the Squad. Cray saves Amanda Waller from a group of assassins. At one point, Cray approaches [[Deadshot]] about his role in Senator Cray's murder. Later, Cray is impaled through the chest by Blacksnake, a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer.

After the unanticipated murder of Cray, Palmer reveals himself and defeats Cray's murderer. The ruse ended, Palmer explains himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him, after hearing rumors of a new Atom.

During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Adam's corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #67 (January 2010)</ref> Following his reanimation, Adam and the other Black Lanterns travel to [[Belle Reve]] and attack [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]].<ref>''Secret Six'' #17 (January 2010)</ref> Adam is apparently destroyed by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunter]]'s self-destruct mechanism, unleashing an explosion of [[Green Lantern]] energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #18 (February 2010)</ref>

In [[DC Rebirth]], Adam Cray is the son of Senator Cray and Ryan Choi's roommate at Ivy University. Senator Cray also attended Ivy and expected Adam to attend Ivy as well. He first meets Ryan when he walks into their dorm with heavy luggage and kindly introduces himself. Adam teaches Ryan how to play rugby and video games.

===Ryan Choi===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->
{{Main|Atom (Ryan Choi)}}
'''Ryan Choi''', as described by DC solicitations, is "a young hotshot professor who's filling the extra spot on Ivy University's teaching staff. .. and who inadvertently ends up filling the old Atom's super-heroic shoes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5536 |title=DC Comics |publisher=DC Comics |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> This new Atom is based on a redesign by [[Grant Morrison]]. He debuted in the ''Brave New World'' one-shot, a preview of projects, and then appeared in the series, ''The All-New Atom'', written by [[Gail Simone]]. He is later murdered by [[Deathstroke]] and his Titans.

==={{anchor|Rhonda Pineda|Atomica}} Rhonda Pineda/Atomica===
{{redirect|Atomica|comic book series|Atomika (books)|the film|Atomica (film)}}
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new, female Atom is introduced, '''Rhonda Pineda''', a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] college student from Ivy Town.<ref>''Justice League'' #18</ref> She is revealed to be working as a reluctant spy for [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Steve Trevor]], gathering intel on the new Justice League recruits. She is noted to be "the most important member of the Justice League of America" by Steve Trevor.<ref>''Justice League'' #20 (July 2013)</ref> At the conclusion of the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, she is revealed to in fact be betraying both teams; she hails from the alternate universe of [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]], where she is a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America#The New 52|Crime Syndicate]], operating under the name Atomica. She also reveals that by placing a sliver of Green Kryptonite in Superman's optic nerve, she caused him to accidentally kill [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time.<ref>''Justice League'' #23</ref>

Atomica originally worked on Earth-3 with [[Johnny Quick]] as a thief and killer. One night after killing two cops, they are cornered on the roof of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] during a storm. Lightning hits a satellite, electrocuting Johnny and granting him speed powers. Rhonda falls inside the building and lands near Ray Palmer's Atomico work, gaining size and density changing powers.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=Reis, Ivan|inker=Prado, Joe, Eber Ferreira, Rob Hunter, Andy Lanning|colorist=Reis, Rod, Tomeu Morey, Tony Avina|letterer=Napolitano, Nick J.|story=Forever Numb|title=Justice League|volume=2|issue=26|date=February 2013|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> During the final battle with the Crime Syndicate, Atomica reduces her size and is killed when [[Lex Luthor]] steps on her.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref>

===Atom One Million===
An unnamed scientist in the [[DC One Million|853rd Century]] performed experiments in [[superstring theory]] that creates a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] and whose radiation alters his physical make-up. When the singularity threatened to expand and destroy his universe, he enters it in an attempt to save the universe but instead finds himself on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|interdimensional bridge]] to another universe as his own is wiped out, unable to stop it. At the end of the bridge, he finds [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Superman Prime]] who came to help but was too late. Stranded, he searches this universe for remnants of the one he lost, in time taking the name the Atom and joining the [[Justice Legion Alpha]] when he helped them defeat the Bizarro-Legion. This Atom's powers differ from his predecessors in that he doesn't shrink but breaks up into several smaller duplicates of himself divided amongst his mass. At atomic size, these duplicates can mimic [[Chemical element|elements]] such as gold and oxygen.

==Other versions==

[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] portrayed Ray Palmer as a major player in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. He was taken prisoner by Lex Luthor and made to live in one of his own petri dishes for a period of months until his rescue by [[List of alternate versions of Robin#Carrie Kelley|Catgirl]]. He was then instrumental in the liberation of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]].

===Tangent Comics===
{{Main|Tangent Comics}}
In the Tangent Comics imprint, The Atom is "Arthur Harrison Thompson", a subject of radiation testing on human beings. The first hero in the Tangent timeline, he inadvertently caused the [[Cuban missile crisis]] to escalate into a limited nuclear exchange that obliterated [[Florida]] and [[Cuba]] in 1962, unknown to his fellow Americans. Thompson was succeeded by his son, who was killed by the Tangent Comics version of the [[Fatal Five]], and a grandson named Adam, who, in ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'', is being held captive by Superman.

It is suggested in the Tangent series that The Atom's name was at least in part chosen because of the abbreviation of his full name "Arthur Harrison Thompson" on his barracks door to simply "A. Thom."

Also in the Tangent series The Atom's presence as America's first superhero during the 1960s has led to a huge cultural impact, and in this world many significant points in pop culture have been effected by his presence; for instance [[The Beatles]] choose to be called "The Atomiks", further more TV shows such as [[The Beverly Hillbillies]] became "The Superman Hillbillies", [[The Dick Van Dyke Show]] became "The Dick Van Hero Show" and [[Get Smart]] became "Get Powers".

===Elseworlds===
{{Main|Elseworlds}}
*Some other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in ''League of Justice'', a story portraying the Justice League in a ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called "Atomus The Palmer".
*Al Pratt as the Atom was one of the three heroes who chose to work at the side of Senator Thompson in ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]''. When Al discovers that Thompson is really the Ultra-Humanite, he joins the other heroes against the villain and Dyna-Man.
*The Al Pratt Atom appeared in ''[[JSA: The Unholy Three]]'' as a post-WW2 intelligence agent with transparent atomic flesh and a visible skeleton.
*''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' where Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose numbers at one point included [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]].
*''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', after Ray Palmer is killed in the cosmic storm that nearly wipes out the rest of the male population on Earth, a graduate student named '''Jill Athron''' is given a research grant to study Palmer's white-dwarf-star-belt. She becomes the Atom and joins the Justice League.
* Atom evolved from a hawkman that had evolved from [[Just Imagine Stan Lee's Robin|Robin]] in the ''[[Just Imagine...]]'' comic book.<ref>''Just Imagine Stan Lee creating Crisis'' (January 2002)</ref>

===52 Multiverse===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]] among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Atom is visually similar to the Al Pratt Atom.<ref>{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=13 | panel=3 }}</ref> Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.<ref>{{cite web

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #30, the Challengers from Beyond encountered Earth-15, a world where the sidekicks had taken their mentor's places. On this Earth, the Atom is Jessica Palmer, a genius who graduated from [[MIT]] at age eight. ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Spin-offs|The Search for Ray Palmer - Red Son]]'' features the Ray Palmer of Earth-30, an American captured by the Superman of a communist Russia. ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' also depicts the Ray Palmer of Earth-6, who through unknown circumstances now has the powers and title of the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]]. ''The Search For Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman'' briefly features a female version of The Atom.
On the newly introduced Earth-52, Atomarsupial is one of the metasimian Primate Legion <ref>http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/16/dc-comics-unveils-earth-53-in-dark-knights-rising-the-wild-hunt/</ref>

He is a super hero in the 1970s and a physics professor at Calvin College, who was arrested during a student protest and framed for the crime of fraud by the government in a mission to take down the JSA. However, he was never convicted of any crime. As the law was now aware of his superhero identity, Pratt retired from heroics. As [[Doctor Fate]] later stated, "The Atom split".

====Arrowverse====
{{main|Arrowverse}}
The [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] and [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] versions appear in the [[Arrowverse]] portrayed by [[Brandon Routh]] and [[Osric Chau]]. 

=====Ray Palmer=====
* Ray Palmer first appears as a recurring character in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.
** In season 3 Ray is a brilliant scientist (with a 140 I.Q. and 4 PhDs) and the CEO of Palmer Technologies (formerly Queen Consolidated, rebranded after Ray purchases it from receivership). His fiancee, Anna Loring, was murdered by [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson/Deathstroke]]'s Mirakuru men (which takes place during the second season), and he vows to never let anything like Slade's attack happen again. To achieve this, he devotes much of his efforts to building a high tech suit of armour with built-in weapons and flight capability, acquiring the necessary resources from various businessmen. He also has an ambition to rebuild Starling City and rechristen it "Star City". He hires [[Felicity Smoak]] to work for him and becomes romantically attracted to her. He eventually starts dating her, much to the jealousy of [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]]. After succeeding in building his suit, the "Arrow" (in reality, Maseo Yamashiro framing Oliver on behalf of Ra's al Ghul) begins killing people. Ray uses his suit's x-ray vision feature to discover the real Arrow's identity as Oliver Queen. On learning of Felicity's affection towards Oliver, Ray becomes jealous and tries to apprehend him. However, Oliver defeats Ray and tells him to trust Felicity, and Ray accepts that Oliver is being framed. When Maseo tries to kill Felicity, Ray saves her, but at the cost of his being shot in the chest. He is able to survive by secretly using a new micro-technology to heal himself. Ray later realizes that Felicity is indeed in love with Oliver, and the pair have a civil break-up and decide to resume being friends. In the season finale, Ray assists Team Arrow in their attempt to stop Ra's destroying Starling City with a bio-weapon and partakes in their initial attack on the League's men in Nanda Parbat. After this fails he accompanies them back to Starling City and succeeds in dispersing the antidote, saving hundreds of lives. At the end of the episode, Ray works on a new technology to give his suit the ability to shrink, but is seemingly killed in an explosion that destroys the entire top floor of Palmer Technologies. 
** In season 4, it's revealed that the explosion, in conjunction with the micro-tech injected into him several weeks before, actually shrunk Ray and his suit to miniature sizes. For months, Ray sent distress calls to Felicity with no response, as she had left the city to be with Oliver. One of these messages is eventually intercepted by Damien Darhk, leader of H.I.V.E., who captures Ray and keeps him in a miniaturized state to use his suit's powers for Darhk's own agenda. Meanwhile, the city is re-branded "Star City" in Ray's honor, and Felicity inherits Palmer Technologies as part of Ray's will. Felicity begins getting encrypted messages on her phone with him calling her name. After tearfully listening to Ray's last message, Felicity discovers Ray is alive. Team Arrow locates and rescues him and, with the help of Curtis Holt, are able to restore Ray to normal size. However, seeing that Star City has not gotten any better, believing that nobody really cared that he "died", and that Palmer Technologies is teetering on bankruptcy, Ray concludes that his past life has amounted to nothing. He elects to remain officially dead until he can figure out where he wants his new life to go, but still assists Team Arrow whenever they need help.
* Routh portrays Ray during Season 1 of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in the episode "All-Star Team-Up". Here, he helps Barry Allen/The Flash deal with [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|a villain using a swarm of cybernetic bees]] to attack those who ruined her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/arrow-without-oliver-producers-preview-the-rise-of-black-canary-atom-and-brick-120140918/ |title='Arrow' Without Oliver?

Ray also shares Cisco's love for naming super-villains; he and Cisco both come up with "Bug-Eyed Bandit", and Cisco approves of Ray's naming another metahuman "[[Deathbolt]]" (''Arrow'', "Broken Arrow"). Ray is briefly mentioned in the season's penultimate episode, "Rogue Air"; when [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]] helps Barry fight [[Eobard Thawne|Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash]], he shoots him with an arrow that delivers "nanites... courtesy of Ray Palmer" which temporarily disables Eobard's speed.
* Routh reprises his role as Ray in the spin-off series ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' as part of the main cast. 
** In the first season he is recruited by time-traveler [[Rip Hunter]] to help him defeat [[Vandal Savage]] across the timeline. Ray accepts the offer as he is attracted by the thought of giving his current life meaning after seeing the waste he believes his former life to have been, although his enthusiasm and optimism still occasionally overrides his lack of practical experience. Ray/Atom's suit now has the ability to shrink,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/cw-looking-to-expand-dc-comics-universe-with-atom-tca-1201347223/|title=CW Eyeing ‘Atom’ As Next DC Series – TCA|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=January 11, 2015|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2015/01/exclusive-arrow-executive-producer-marc-guggenheim-talks-brandon-routh-atom-spin-off-show/|title=EXCLUSIVE: ARROW EXECUTIVE PRODUCER MARC GUGGENHEIM TALKS BRANDON ROUTH ATOM SPIN-OFF SHOW!|publisher=Nerdist|date=January 11, 2015|accessdate=January 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113202347/http://www.nerdist.com/2015/01/exclusive-arrow-executive-producer-marc-guggenheim-talks-brandon-routh-atom-spin-off-show/|archive-date=January 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/arrow-flash-spin-off-cw-new-superhero-series-1201382466/|title=Arrow/Flash Superhero Team-Up Spinoff In Works At CW; Brandon Routh, Victor Garber, Wentworth Miller, Caity Lotz Star|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 26, 2015|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> and he later uses the suit's technology to grow to gigantic size to defeat a similarly gigantic robot ("Leviathan"). He also begins a flirtatious friendship with Kendra Saunders, which develops into a romantic relationship and ultimately an engagement. However, when another reincarnation of Carter Hall is located, Ray ends the relationship amicably, knowing that Kendra is meant to be with Carter. Ray also forms something of a bond with Mick Rory/Heat Wave, who nicknames Ray "haircut", despite being polar opposites in personality. Mick denies any connection between them, but he has protected Ray on occasion and the two work well together, as when they take out the 1958 version of Savage and destroy his meteor before its effects can destroy time. 
** Ray returns in the second season, still acting as a member of the Legends. During time in 1942, Ray modifies a Super-Serum provided to the Nazis by [[Eobard Thawne]] to save the team's new ally Nate Heywood from his [[hemophilia]], giving Nate the ability to turn into a metallic skinned state. His suit is destroyed during a trip to feudal Japan when it is stolen by a ruthless local warrior, but Mick Rory gives Ray the cold gun that used to belong to the now-deceased Leonard Snart so that he can still act as a hero. When the team travel to Colorado in 1874, Ray revealed to the team that his suit was powered with dwarf stars, Ray got some of it to rebuild his suit. In the crossover episode "[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]", Ray notes that [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] looks a lot like his cousin, which is a reference to Routh's portrayal of [[Superman]]. In the episode Moonshot he walks on the moon.<ref>http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Moonshot</ref>

Ray begins an ambiguous relationship with Damian Dahrk's daughter Nora who is played by Routh's real life wife [[Courtney Ford]].<ref>http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Nora_Darhk</ref>

* In ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', Ray Palmer appeared in his own episodes and in the [[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure#Justice League of America|Justice League of America]] segments along with [[Superman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], and [[Hawkman]]. He was voiced by [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]], who would be better known a decade later for his role as Dwayne F. Schneider on the sitcom ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]''.
* Ray also made occasional appearances on ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' voiced by [[Wally Burr]].
* A futuristic version of Atom named '''Micron''' voiced by [[Wayne Brady]] appears in [[Batman Beyond]] two part episode  "The Call", he is a member of [[Justice League Unlimited]]. After a rather intense but successful training session, Micron got a distress call from an unknown source about a monorail gone haywire. After saving the only person on board ― its driver ― he tried to prevent the monorail from colliding with another coming in the opposite direction. Micron disengaged the train from its track, and then derailed it. Right when he tried to get out of the plummeting train, the door suddenly closed and a force-field barricaded Micron inside. The train crashed into a building, leaving Micron badly injured. Little did he know that the person responsible for the wreck was Superman, who was under the control of Starro. Micron was placed in a stasis field, where he slowly recovered. Sometime later, Starro/Superman tried to sabotage the field and finish Micron off. However, this attempt was promptly interrupted by the other Leaguers. A battle ensued, and Micron mustered enough strength to get out of the tank, and snatched Superman with his magnified hand. However, he was still feeble, so Superman easily knocked him unconscious. Micron was then returned to the stasis field, where he most likely recovered in short time.
* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter Pt. 2" [[Vandal Savage]] mentions his attempted theft of one of Ray Palmer's inventions resulted in the death of everyone except Savage.

When it fails, Atom shrinks himself and Lex Luthor only for Amazo to follow them. In "Dark Heart" (written by [[Warren Ellis]]), Atom helps the Justice League disable a [[grey goo]]-like alien weapon known as the Dark Heart which uses nanotechnology to replicate its forces. He manages to disable it, which also deactivated its forces. The Atom's final vocalized appearance was in "Clash," when he examined a device built by Lex Luthor which [[Superman]] had mistaken for a bomb. In "Panic in the Sky," Atom was shown in his small form unconscious before Supergirl's fight with [[Galatea (Justice League Unlimited)|Galatea]].
