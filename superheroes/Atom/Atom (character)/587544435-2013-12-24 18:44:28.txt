'''The Atom''' is a name shared by several [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

There have been a number characters who have shared the Atom codename. The original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], was created by [[Ben Flinton]] and [[Bill O'Connor (comics)|Bill O'Connor]] and first appeared in [[All-American Publications]]' ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (Oct. 1940). The second Atom was the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], who first appeared in 1961. The third Atom, Adam Cray, was a minor character present in [[Suicide Squad]] stories. The fourth Atom, [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]], debuted in a new ''Atom'' series in August 2006. Another Atom from the [[DC One Million|853rd Century]] first appeared as part of [[Justice Legion Alpha]] in August 1999.

The Atom has been the star of multiple solo series, and four of the five have appeared as members of various superhero teams, such as the [[Justice Society of America]], the [[Justice League]], the [[Suicide Squad]], and the [[Justice Legion Alpha]].

==Fictional character biographies==

===Al Pratt===
{{Main|Atom (Al Pratt)}}

The original Atom, '''Al Pratt''', [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (Oct. 1940). He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a [[midget|diminutive]] college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference.  Pratt was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]], later gaining limited super-strength, and an energy charged 'atomic punch'. He died in the charge against [[Hank Hall|Extant]] during the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book  | last = Beatty, Scott  | first = Wallace, Dan | author-link = | contribution = Atom I, II and III | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 30  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

===Ray Palmer===
{{Main|Atom (Ray Palmer)}}
The Atom introduced during the [[Silver Age of comic books]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #34 (1961) is physicist and university professor '''Dr. Raymond Palmer, Ph.D.''' (He was named for real-life [[science fiction]] writer [[Raymond A. Palmer]], who was himself quite short.) After stumbling onto a mass of [[white dwarf star]] matter that had fallen to Earth, he fashioned a [[lens (optics)|lens]] which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume, controlled by mechanisms in his belt, and later by controls in the palms of his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body. After the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]],'' Ray shrank himself to microscopic size and disappeared. Finding him became a major theme of the '''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]''' year long series and crossover event.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Paul Hoben===
Prior to Ray Palmer's fateful trip to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]], he learns his wife [[Jean Loring]] had an affair with fellow lawyer Paul Hoben and the two divorce. Later, Palmer would offer his blessing to the couple who marry and offers Hoben his size-changing belt in order to protect [[Ivy Town]] (as Ray wished to remain with the [[List of hidden races in DC Comics#M|Morlaidhans]]) which he accepts. Adam Cray would later steal his belt; it should be noted that Hoben never takes up the costume or name of the Atom.

===Adam Cray===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->
[[File:SuicideSquad46.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Adam Cray, ''Suicide Squad'' #46.]]

'''Adam Cray''', son of the murdered Senator Cray, first appeared as the Atom in the pages of ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #44 by [[John Ostrander]] (August 1990). At first Cray was widely believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise (by both the fans and the characters). Actually Cray had been recruited by Palmer himself, who faked his death, in order to apprehend the Micro Squad (a group of villains that had been shrunk down) as well as uncover information about a shadowy government cabal, who were interested in Palmer's knowledge of the other heroes' secret identities (his own identity being no longer a secret).

While Palmer would infiltrate the Micro Squad, Cray would gather the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom, so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Squad member.

Adam Cray ran with the Suicide Squad only for a short while, serving as a secret weapon most of the time, and his existence was for a while even unknown to others of the Squad. Cray even saves a wounded Amanda Waller from a group of assassins. At one point, Cray approaches [[Deadshot]] about the fact that Deadshot had murdered his father. Deadshot tells Cray that he would get one free shot at him. Soon after, on a mission, Cray is impaled through the chest by Blacksnake, a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer.

After the murder of Cray (a move Palmer had not foreseen), Palmer reveals himself and defeats Cray's murderer. The ruse ended, Palmer explains himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him, after hearing rumors of a new Atom.

During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Adam's corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #67 (January 2010)</ref> Following his reanimation, Adam and the other Black Lanterns travel to [[Belle Reve]] and attack [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]].<ref>''Secret Six'' #17 (January 2010)</ref> Adam is apparently destroyed by the [[Manhunters|Manhunter]]'s self-destruct mechanism to unleashing an explosion of [[Green Lantern]] energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #18 (February 2010)</ref>

===Ryan Choi===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->
{{Main|Atom (Ryan Choi)}}
'''Ryan Choi''', as described by DC solicitations, is "a young hotshot professor who's filling the extra spot on Ivy University's teaching staff. .. and who inadvertently ends up filling the old Atom's super-heroic shoes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5536 |title=DC Comics |publisher=DC Comics |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref>  This new Atom is based on a redesign by [[Grant Morrison]]. He debuted in the ''Brave New World'' one-shot, a preview of projects, and then appeared in the series, ''The All-New Atom'', written by [[Gail Simone]]. He is later murdered by [[Deathstroke]] and his Titans.

==={{anchor|Rhonda Pineda|Atomica}} Rhonda Pineda/Atomica===
{{redirect|Atomica|comic book series|Atomika}}
In [[The New 52]] continuity, a new, female Atom is introduced, '''Rhonda Pineda''', a [[Latino American]] college student from Ivy Town.<ref>''Justice League'' #18</ref> She is revealed to be working as a reluctant spy for [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Steve Trevor]], gathering intel on the new Justice League recruits. She is noted to be "the most important member of the Justice League of America" by Steve Trevor.<ref>''Justice League'' #20 (July 2013)</ref> At the conclusion of the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, she is revealed to in fact be betraying both teams; she hails from the alternate universe of [[Earth-Three#The New 52|Earth-3]], where she is a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America#The New 52|Crime Syndicate]], operating under the name Atomica. She also reveals that by placing a sliver of green kryptonite in Superman's optic nerve, she caused him to accidentally kill [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time.<ref>''Justice League'' #23</ref>

Atomica, known as Rhonda Pineda on Earth-3, works with [[Johnny Quick]] as thieves and killers. One night after killing two cops, "Johnny and Rhonnie", as they are known, end up cornered on the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs during a storm. Lightning hits a satellite, electrocuting Johnny, causing him to gain his powers, while Rhonda falls into the labs and lands near Ray Palmer's Atomico work, gaining her powers.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=Reis, Ivan|inker=Prado, Joe, Eber Ferreira, Rob Hunter, Andy Lanning|colorist=Reis, Rod, Tomeu Morey, Tony Avina|letterer=Napolitano, Nick J.|story=Forever Numb|title=Justice League|volume=2|issue=26|date=February 2013|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

===Atom One Million===
An unnamed scientist in the [[DC One Million|853rd Century]] performed experiments in [[superstring theory]] that creates a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] and whose radiation alters his physical make-up. When the singularity threatened to expand and destroy his universe, he enters it in an attempt to save the universe but instead finds himself on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|interdimensional bridge]] to another universe as his own is wiped out, unable to stop it. At the end of the bridge, he finds [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Superman Prime]] who came to help but was too late. Stranded, he searches this universe for remnants of the one he lost, in time taking the name the Atom and joining the [[Justice Legion Alpha]] when he helped them defeat the Bizarro-Legion. This Atom's powers differ from his predecessors in that he doesn't shrink but breaks up into several smaller duplicates of himself divided amongst his mass. At atomic size, these duplicates can mimic [[Chemical element|elements]] such as gold and oxygen.

==Other versions==

[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] portrayed Ray Palmer as a major player in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. He was taken prisoner by Lex Luthor and made to live in one of his own petri dishes for a period of months until his rescue by [[List of alternate versions of Robin#Carrie Kelley|Catgirl]]. He was then instrumental in the liberation of [[Kandor]].

===Tangent Comics===
{{Main|Tangent Comics}}
In the Tangent Comics print, The Atom is "Arthur Harrison Thompson", a subject of radiation testing on human beings. The first hero in the Tangent timeline, he was succeeded by his son, who was killed by the Tangent Comics version of the [[Fatal Five]], and a grandson named Adam, who, in ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'', is being held captive by Superman.

It is suggested in the Tangent series that The Atom's name was at least in part chosen because of the abbreviation of his full name "Arthur Harrison Thompson" on his barracks door to simply "A. Thom."

Also in the Tangent series The Atom's presence as America's first superhero during the 1960s has led to a huge cultural impact, and in this world many significant points in pop culture have been effected by his presence for instance [[The Beatles]] choose to be called "The Atomiks", further more TV shows such as [[The Beverly Hillbillies]] became "The Superman Hillbillies", [[The Dick Van Dyke Show]] became "The Dick Van Hero Show" and [[Get Smart]] became "Get Powers".

===Elseworlds===
{{Main|Elseworlds}}
*Some other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in ''League of Justice'', a story portraying the Justice League in a ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called "Atomus The Palmer".

*Al Pratt as the Atom was one of the three heroes who chose to work at the side of Senator Thompson in ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]''. When Al discovers that Thompson is really the Ultra-Humanite, he joins the other heroes against the villain and Dyna-Man.

*The Al Pratt Atom appeared in ''[[JSA: The Unholy Three]]'' as a post-WW2 intelligence agent with transparent atomic flesh and a visible skeleton.

*''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' where Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose numbers at one point included [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]].

*''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', after Ray Palmer is killed in the cosmic storm that nearly wipes out the rest of the male population on Earth, a graduate student named '''Jill Athron''' is given a research grant to study Palmer's white-dwarf-star-belt. She becomes the Atom and joins the Justice League.

* Atom evolved from a hawkman that had evolved from [[Just Imagine Stan Lee's Robin|Robin]] in the ''[[Just Imagine...]]'' comic book.<ref>''Just Imagine Stan Lee creating Crisis'' (January 2002)</ref>

===52 Multiverse===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]] among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Atom is visually similar to the Al Pratt Atom.<ref>{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=13 | panel=3 }}</ref> Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #30, the Challengers from Beyond encountered Earth-15, a world where the sidekicks had taken their mentor's places. On this Earth, the Atom is Jessica Palmer, a genius who graduated from [[MIT]] at age eight. ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Spin-offs|The Search for Ray Palmer - Red Son]]'' features the Ray Palmer of Earth-30, an American captured by the Superman of a communist Russia. ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' also depicts the Ray Palmer of Earth-6, who through unknown circumstances now has the powers and title of [[Ray (comics)|the Ray]]. ''The Search For Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman'' briefly features a female version of The Atom.

In the first issue of the 2010 ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' limited series, a future African-American version of the Atom known as '''Micron''' appears as one of the heroes of Earth-12.
