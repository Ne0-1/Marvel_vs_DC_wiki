'''The Atom''' is a [[fictional]] [[comicbook]] [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]].

There have been four characters who have shared the Atom codename. The original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], was created by [[Ben Flinton]] and [[Bill O'Connor]] and first appeared in [[All-American Publications]]' ''[[All-American Comics]]'' # 19 (Oct. 1940). The second and most famous Atom was the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Atom, [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], who first appeared in 1961. The third Atom, Adam Cray, was a minor character present in [[Suicide Squad]] stories. The fourth Atom, Ryan Choi, debuted a new ''Atom'' series on Aug. 2006.

The Atom has been the star of multiple solo series, and three of the four have appeared as members of various superhero teams, such as the [[Justice Society of America]], the [[Justice League]] and the [[Suicide Squad]].

==Fictional character biographies==
===Al Pratt===
{{main|Atom (Al Pratt)}}

The original Atom, '''Al Pratt''', [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #19 (Oct. 1940). He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a [[midget|diminutive]] college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference.  Pratt was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]], later gaining limited superstrength, and an energy charged 'atomic punch'.

===Ray Palmer===
{{main|Atom (Ray Palmer)}}

The Atom introduced during the [[Silver Age of comic books]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #34 (1961) is physicist and university professor '''Ray Palmer''' (named for real-life [[science fiction]] writer [[Raymond A. Palmer]], who was himself quite short). Using a mass of [[white dwarf star]] matter, he fashioned a [[lens (optics)|lens]] which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from mechanisms in his belt with a back up device in his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers with his own body.  After the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', Ray shrunk himself to microscopic size and disappeared.

===Adam Cray===

A third Atom, '''Adam Cray''' (son of the murdered Senator Cray), would appear in the pages of ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' # 44 by [[John Ostrander]] (August 1990). At first Cray was widely believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise (by both the fans and the characters). Actually Cray had been recruited by Palmer himself, who faked his death, in order to apprehend the Micro Force (a group of villains that had been shrunk down) as well as uncover information about a shadowy government Cabal, who were interested in Palmer's knowledge of the other heroes' secret identities (his own identity no longer a secret).

While Palmer would infiltrate the Micro Force, Cray would gather the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom, so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Force member. 

Adam Cray ran with the Suicide Squad only for a short while, serving as a secret weapon most of the time, and his existence was for a while even unknown to others of the Squad. At one point, Cray approached [[Deadshot]] about the fact that Deadshot had murdered his father. Deadshot told Cray that he would get one free shot at him. But nothing came of the conflict, as Cray was killed shortly after by Blacksnake, a Micro Force member, who believed him to be the real deal.

After the murder of Cray (a move Palmer had not foreseen), Palmer revealed himself and defeated the Micro Force and Cray's murderer. The ruse had now ended, and Palmer explained himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him, after hearing rumors of a new Atom.

===Ryan Choi===
The new Atom is '''Ryan Choi''', described by DC solitations as "a young hotshot professor who's filling the extra spot on Ivy University's teaching staff... and who inadvertently ends up filling the old Atom's super-heroic shoes".<ref>http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5536</ref>  This new Atom is based on a redesign by [[Grant Morrison]]. He debuted in the ''Brave New World'' one-shot, a preview of upcoming projects, and now appears in the ongoing series, ''The All-New Atom'', written by [[Gail Simone]].

Born in [[Hong Kong]], Ryan was a longtime protege of Ray Palmer who had been corresponding with him through letters. After Palmer's disappearance, Ryan moved to Ivy Town in America to assume his mentor's place on the staff of Ivy University. Following clues left by Palmer, Ryan discovered a "bio-belt," the size and density-manipulating device used by his predecessor, and became the new Atom with Palmer's apparent blessing. Though taken with the superhero lifestyle, Ryan is a scientist first and foremost and approaches many of his adventures from the perspective of scientific discovery and investigation.

Since taking his mentor's place, Ryan has found himself at the center of a conflict between the forces of science and magic. It has been claimed that the impossible feats performed by Ray Palmer during his superheroic career caused the very fabric of reality to warp in Ivy Town's vicinity, making it a nexus of paranormal activity. Many parties, including the ancient "Cancer God" [[Great Old One|M'Nagalah]] and the microscopic aliens known as "The Waiting," consider Ryan a key player in the war and have made attempts to recruit, capture, or kill him.

As The Atom, Ryan has faced numerous challenges, including his opposite number, the shrinking serial killer [[Dwarfstar]], his own strict and disapproving father, and being seduced, kidnapped, and even swallowed alive by the size-changing villainess, [[Giganta]]. Through it all, his ingenuity and keen deductive mind have served him in good stead.

==Other versions==
*Another version of the Atom has been featured in stories set eighty-three thousand years in the future, in the 853rd century, as seen in ''[[DC One Million]]''. Portrayed as the sole survivor of a micro-world, he is taken in by [[Justice Legion Alpha]], and has the ability to divide himself into multiple beings. The more he divides himself, the smaller he gets.

*[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] portrayed Ray Palmer as a major player in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. He was taken prisoner by Lex Luthor and made to live in one of his own petri dishes for a period of months until his rescue by [[Robin (comics)#Carrie Kelley|Catgirl]]. He was then instrumental in the liberation of [[Kandor]].

*Some other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in ''League of Justice'', an [[Elseworlds]] story portraying the Justice League in a ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called "Atomus The Palmer". 

*Another was an appearance in ''JLA: Age of Wonder'' where Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose numbers at one point included [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. 

*Yet another was a re-imagining of the Al Pratt Atom in ''[[JSA: The Unholy Three]]'' as a post-WW2 intelligence agent with transparent atomic flesh and a visible skeleton.

*Al Pratt as the Atom was one of the three heroes who chose to work at the side of Senator Thompson in ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]''. When Al discovers that Thompson is really the Ultra-Humanite, he joins the other heroes against him and Dyna-Man.

==Appearances in other media==

*Besides making an appearance on one of the ''[[Super Friends]]'' shows, the Atom (Ray Palmer) appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' to help [[Lex Luthor]] defend himself against [[Amazo]] and disable an alien weapon known as the Dark Heart (in an episode written by [[Warren Ellis]]). Both of the devices utilized [[nanotechnology]], a field in which he is an expert. He is voiced by [[John C. McGinley]]. In the second episode, [[Wonder Woman]] allows the Atom to ride in her bustier, one of the most well-remembered scenes from ''JLU''.
*In an early ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode, "Legends", the League team up with the Justice Guild Of America.  JGA member Tom Turbine is a cross between [[Al Pratt (comics)|Golden Age Atom]] and the [[Kal-L|Golden Age Superman/Kal-L.]]
*The Atom also appeared in the 1997 live action made-for-TV movie pilot, ''[[Justice League of America]]''. He was played by [[John Kassir]]
*Ray Palmer was mentioned in the ''Justice League'' season 2 episode "Hereafter Part 2". Some technology of his was stolen by [[Vandal Savage|Vandal Savage.]]This was used to control the force of gravity. With this Savage destroyed the Justice League. The side effects of his gravity manipulation shifted the Earth's orbit, killing all human life. Savage told Superman about this whilst he was stranded in the future. When Superman got back to his present time, he and the Justice League went to stop him from getting the technology.
