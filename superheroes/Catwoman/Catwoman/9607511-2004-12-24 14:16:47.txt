'''Catwoman''' (Selina Kyle) is a [[DC Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], associated with the [[Batman]] franchise. Created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]], she first appeared in ''Batman'' #1 ([[1940]]).

Originally, Catwoman was a [[catsuit]]-garbed burglar and adversary of Batman, but as Batman grew darker and Catwoman sexier, the two shared an attraction and Catwoman has been written, quite seriously, as a romantic interest of her one-time foe. 

Catwoman’s sexy mystique has meant an easy transition to live action adaptations of Batman. Several actresses, most notably [[Julie Newmar]], portrayed her in the [[1960s]] [[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman television series]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] played her in [[1992]]’s ''[[Batman Returns]]''.

In [[2004]], [[Halle Berry]] stared in a woefully unsuccessful Catwoman [[film]] that had little to do with the [[comic book]] character (see [[Catwoman (movie)]]).

==Comic Book History==
Although originally introduced as an opponent for Batman, Catwoman's status as hero or villain is ambiguous; she has her own moral code (she abhors killing) and has occasionally teamed up with Batman against greater threats.

She is often considered a potential romantic interest for Batman; in the 1970s DC Comics even ran an ongoing series set in a [[parallel universe]] in which Catwoman and Batman had married and had a daughter who fought crime as the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]. 

Her costume at first appearance in the comics (at which time she known merely as 'The Cat') had a theatrically face-covering cat-mask. Later she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later a bodysuit with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask. In the 1960s, the bodysuit was green in color, which was typical of villains.

Occasional attempts have been made to feature Catwoman in her own comic book series.
The most recent such series, written by [[Ed Brubaker]], was launched in [[2001]] and as of [[as of 2004|2004]] is still running to great acclaim.

==Adaptations in Other Media==
Catwoman was at various times played by [[Julie Newmar]], [[Lee Meriwether]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] in the ''[[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman]]'' television series of the 1960s, by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the 1992 movie ''[[Batman Returns]]'', and by [[Adrienne Barbeau]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. The character also appeared very briefly (and was actually killed off) in the first episode of the television series, ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'', which featured Catwoman's daughter, Huntress.

[[Catwoman (movie)|A ''Catwoman'' movie]] that was only very loosely based on the comic book character was released in summer 2004. It starred [[Halle Berry]] as a Catwoman - not Selina Kyle - with supernatural cat-like powers, and was heavily criticized by fans of the character.
