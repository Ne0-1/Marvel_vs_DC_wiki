'''Catwoman''' is a [[fictional character]] associated with [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]] franchise and created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]].

The original and most widely known Catwoman, '''Selina Kyle''', first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] #1'' (Spring 1940) in which she was known as '''The Cat'''. As an adversary of Batman, she was a [[whip]]-carrying [[burglary|burglar]] with a taste for high stake thefts. [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern]] writers have attributed her activities and costumed identity as a response to a history of abuse.

Since the [[1990s]], Catwoman has been featured in an eponymous series that cast her as an [[anti-hero]] rather than a [[supervillainess]]. The character has been one of Batman's most enduring love interests, and has occasionally been depicted as his one true love.

A popular figure, Catwoman has been featured in most [[Mass media|media]] adaptations related to Batman. Actresses [[Julie Newmar]], [[Lee Meriwether]], and [[Eartha Kitt]] introduced her to a large audience on the [[1960s]] [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series]].  [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] portrayed the character in 1992's popular film ''[[Batman Returns]]''. [[Halle Berry]] starred in a stand-alone [[Catwoman (film)|''Catwoman'' film]] in 2004, though the film features a title character bearing little resemblance to the comic book character. Catwoman is #51 on [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]]'s "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>''Wizard'' #177 (July 2006), p. 88.</ref>

==Character and publication history==

There have been many versions of Catwoman's origins and backstory seen in the comic books over the decades.

===Golden and Silver Age versions===
[[Image:Catwoman-batman01.jpg|200px|Selina Kyle's first appearance as ''The Cat'' in ''Batman #1'' (Spring 1940).|thumb|left]]
In ''Batman #62'', it is revealed that Catwoman (after a blow to the head jogged her memory) is an [[amnesiac]] [[flight attendant]] who had turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived (although in the final issue of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'', she admits that she made up the [[amnesia]] story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime). She winds up reforming and stays on the straight and narrow for several years, helping out Batman in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] #65 and #69'', until Selina decides to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]] #203''. Selina appears again as a criminal in ''Batman #84'' and ''Detective Comics #211'', her final appearance for many years (until 1966).

In the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters) reveal that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (after the events of ''Batman #69'') and had married Bruce Wayne; soon afterwards, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]). In ''[[The Brave and the Bold]] #197'', the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman #62'' is elaborated on, after Selina revealed that she never actually had amnesia. It was revealed that Selina Kyle had been the wife of an abusive man, and eventually decided to leave her husband. However, her husband had kept her jewelry in his private vault, and she had to break into it to retrieve the jewelry. Selina enjoyed this experience so much she decided to become a professional costumed [[burglary|cat burglar]], and thus began a career that would repeatedly lead to her encountering the Batman.

The Earth-Two/Golden Age Selena Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being blackmailed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman (as shown in ''DC Super-Stars #17'').

Catwoman's first Silver Age appearance was in ''[[Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane]] #70'' (November 1966); afterwards, she continued to make appearances across the various Batman comics.

Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing [[murder]], something that neither the Earth-One or Earth-Two versions of her would ever do; this version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-B|Earth-B]], an alternate Earth that included stories that couldn't be considered canonical on Earth-One or Earth-Two.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

===Modern Age version===
====Tangled origins====
A revision in Catwoman's origin, and the introduction of the modern version of the character, came in 1986 when writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] published ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman’s origin. In the course of the story, the origin of Catwoman was also re-envisioned. Selina Kyle is reintroduced as a cat-loving [[prostitution|prostitute]]/[[dominatrix]] who is inspired to become a costumed cat burglar when she sees Batman in action. In this story, [[Holly Robinson]] is introduced as Selina's roommate, a young runaway and prostitute Kyle has taken in.

The [[1989 in comics|1989]] ''Catwoman'' limited series (collected in trade paperback form as ''Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper'') by writer [[Mindy Newell]] and artist J.J. Birch expanded on Miller's ''Year One'' origin. ''Her Sister's Keeper'' explores Selina's early life as a prostitute and the start of her career as Catwoman.  This is a dark and tragic period which culminates with Selina's former [[pimp]] Stan abducting and violently abusing her sister Maggie.  Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and is able to do so with [[impunity]].

Catwoman also appears in the [[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]] saga, where she is approached by Bane's henchmen while robbing a house. Bane asks her to work for him, but she refuses, giving as her reason that Bane broke Batman. Later in the story, she boards a plane with Bruce Wayne to fly to Santa Prisca. She next appears in the KnightQuest saga.

''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implies that Catwoman suspects she is the long-lost illegitimate daughter of [[Carmine Falcone]], although she finds no definitive proof of this. Selina's connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]''. Though more circumstantial evidence is added to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, no definitive proof is provided.

Portions of ''Her Sister's Keeper'' and the ''Year One'' origin conceived by Frank Miller remain [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to Catwoman’s origin, while other portions have been dropped over the years.  It has been implied that ''Her Sister's Keeper'' was rendered non-canonical by the events of ''Zero Hour'', and subsequent writers have rejected Miller's choice to make the post-''Crisis'' Catwoman a prostitute.  In an attempt to harmonize the various versions, some writers have posited that Catwoman, early in her career, pretended to be a prostitute in order to scam lonely men and rob them. However, characters associated with Catwoman's past as a prostitute have remained a part of her supporting cast.  Holly, from ''Batman: Year One,'' and her sister Maggie (from ''Her Sister's Keeper'') have appeared regularly in the ''Catwoman'' series. 

Selina is the older of two sisters (Maggie being the younger) born to Brian and Maria Kyle.  ''Catwoman'' v.1 #0, which provides details about Selina's childhood, neglects Maggie's existence. Maria Kyle was a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats, and committed suicide when Selina was very young.  Brian Kyle, a drunken layabout angry at his wife for killing herself, disliked Selina for resembling her mother and eventually drank himself to death.

Selina took to the streets for a time before being caught and sent first to an orphanage, then Juvenile Hall (''Catwoman'' v.1 #0), "where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be" (''Catwoman Secret Files and Origins''). Maggie's fate at this point in the time-line is not alluded to.  However, when [[Ed Brubaker]] re-introduced her into the comic, he implied that Maggie may have directly entered an orphanage and promptly been adopted.

When she was thirteen, Selina discovered that the Hall's administrator was embezzling funds and confronted her.  In an attempt to cover up the illegal activities, the administrator put Selina in a bag and dropped her in a river to drown (like a cat).  Selina was able to escape (''Catwoman v.1 #0'') and return to the orphanage where she stole documents exposing the administrator's corruption and sent them to the authorities. She also took the opportunity to steal enough money to live on before going back to the streets.

When the money she stole from the corrupt orphanage administrator ran out, Selina found herself in "Alleytown - a network of cobblestone streets that form a small borough between the East End and Old Gotham" (''Catwoman v.2 #12''). Selina was taken in by "Mama Fortuna", the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and was taught how to steal.  Fortuna treated her students like slaves, keeping their earnings for herself.  Selina eventually ran away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia.  However, the two had difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation tried to support themselves by working as child prostitutes.  Sylvia attracted at least one client; Selina apparently never did.  The two drifted apart afterwards, with Sylvia blaming Selina for her negative experiences; she hated Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.  

In the ''Catwoman: Year One'' story (''Catwoman Annual #2'', 1998), Selina (now an adult) achieved some success as a thief.  Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepted an offer to "lay low" by posing as a dominatrix in the employ of a pimp named Stan.  Their plan was to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes.  According to this storyline, Selina trained under the [[Armless Master]] of [[Gotham City|Gotham]], receiving education in [[martial arts]] and culture. During this time, Catwoman was given her trademark cat-o-nine tails whip by a client, which Selina kept as a trophy of her time posing as a hooker.

====Catwoman, the series====
In 1993, following the success of ''Batman Returns'' and Selina Kyle’s prominent role in that film, Catwoman was given her first ongoing comic book series. This series, written by an assortment of writers but primarily penciled by [[Jim Balent]], generally depicted the character as an international thief (and occasional [[bounty hunter]]) with an ambiguous moral code.

Storylines included her [[adoption]] of teenage [[runaway youth|runaway]], and erstwhile sidekick, Arizona; aiding the criminal [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] whom she later betrayed to [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]; and a stint as a reluctant government operative. The series also fleshed out more of her origin, revealing her beginnings as a young thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and the training she received from superhero [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted (Wildcat) Grant]].

Moving to [[New York]], Selina becomes corporate vice president then [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Randolf Industries, a [[mafia]]-influenced company, through [[blackmail]]. Her plans to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]] are ruined when the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] inadvertently connected Kyle to her Catwoman [[alter ego]].

Selina then returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline. As Catwoman, she assists Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city. After being arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], she escapes from prison. Later that year during the ''Officer Down'' storyline in the Batman titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect. Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story. Soon afterwards she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at #94.

Catwoman then appears in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics #759 - #762''. In a backup storyline ''Trail of the Catwoman'', by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke, private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle. This storyline leads in to the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]). In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and [[Slam Bradley]] (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham’s East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar. This series met with critical and fan acclaim, especially for its first 25 issues {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

During the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline (''Batman #608-#619''), Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and had a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her. At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. In the ''[[Justice League|JLA]]'' story arc ''Crisis of Conscience,'' Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the League against the old [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.

Catwoman appears in [[Gail Simone]]'s "Sensei and Student" story-arc in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|''Birds of Prey'']]''.  She is part of a group sent to rescue a U.S. senator from the [[Eurasian]] assassin [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]; during the mission, she saves [[Lady Shiva]], who was bound and gagged in the trunk of a car wired with explosives by Chesire.

====Mindwiping revelations====

Catwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman true (although brash and unpredictable). However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a mindwipe by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims. Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and Batman. Catwoman's response to this revelation is unequivocal: she pitched Zatanna out a window (Zatanna survives the fall). Afterwards, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.

Still unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52 (the last issue before the jump to One Year Later), Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain. The [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], in an attempt to "improve himself," threatens the most important people in Selina's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly. The criminal had learned Selina's identity through his earlier alliance with Selina's childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbored a grudge against Selina.  Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict ''no-kill rule,'' Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head.

====One Year Later====
{{main|One Year Later}}
[[Image:Catwomanbaby.PNG|Selina Kyle with her child, Helena (2006). Pencils by David Lopez.|180px|thumb|left]]Following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the DC Universe jumps forward in time. "One Year Later" Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena (whose father is initially unknown).  [[Holly Robinson]] takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter (Selina's alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'').

Though she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena's birth. Having understandably gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now a tighter fit. In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal. Although the situation is defused through Holly's opportune arrival, the sight of two Catwomen active simultaneously in the city is caught on video. Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado [[Film Freak]] has deduced her alias, joined with [[Angle Man]], and grabbed Helena.

After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces [[Zatanna]] to mind-wipe Film Freak and Angle Man (whom she had bound and gagged with duct tape after beating them brutally) in order to preserve her secret identity.  Following the procedure, Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage.  [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted Grant]] informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask; Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly.  Finally defeating Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that [[Slam Bradley]] has deduced that Helena is the daughter of his son Sam Bradley Jr., and therefore his granddaughter.

Batman asks Catwoman to infiltrate the violent tribe of [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana]] Amazons during the ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' crossover.  Posing as a criminal, Selina gains the Bana's trust and thwarts a terror attack aimed at causing mass casualties in Gotham City. 

Selina questions whether she should be raising a daughter when her life as Catwoman has already proven to be such a danger to the child.  After enlisting Batman's help in faking the death of both herself and her daughter, Selina puts Helena up for adoption.  A month after Helena is placed with a new family, Catwoman asks Zatanna to erase her memories of Helena and change her mind back to a criminal mentality.  Zatanna refuses, judging that such an act would be cruel to both mother and daughter.  She tells Selina that she could never reverse Selina's mindset, since she was on the path to becoming a hero on her own. Believing she can no longer function as a criminal, Selina has since decided to become one of Batman's [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].  She quickly quit however and was replaced by Batgirl.

In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #2, Catwoman was sent to the Prison Planet.

==Skills, resources, and abilities==
Selina is a gifted and accomplished athlete, with heightened acrobatic prowess. She was trained by the Armless Master in martial arts and by Wildcat in boxing and street-fighting.  She is a clever and resourceful fighter, known for precise, agile attacks and speedy getaways.  Her formidable hand-to-hand combat skills are augmented by her cat-like speed, reflexes, balance, and flexibility.  

Fittingly, Catwoman is a master thief possessed of unsurpassed stealth and cunning.  An expert at both low- and high-tech heists, she is Gotham City's finest cat-burglar.

===Costume===
Catwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all, and it was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a [[bodysuit]] with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask. In the 1960s, Catwoman's bodysuit was green in color, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a skintight purple bodysuit, before switching to a black leather outfit that recalls [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s costume in ''Batman Returns''.
In recent years, artists' depictions have usually alternated between these two costumes. Ed Brubaker, the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic [[catsuit]] <ref>{{cite web
  | title =The Man Behind The Cat - Exclusive Interview w/ Ed Brubaker
  | url =http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html
  | accessdate =}}[[2007]]-[[June 10|6-10]]</ref>. It has a more [[high tech]] look, with domino-shaped [[infrared]] goggles on her cowl. Many of her costumes have been shown to incorporate retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and toes of her boots.

Holly currently uses the same costume Selina used prior to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

===Weapons and equipment===
During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Catwoman, like most Batman villains, used a  variety of themed weapons, vehicles, and equipment, such as a custom cat-themed car called the "cat-illac". This usage also appeared in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series. In her post-''Crisis'' appearances, Catwoman's favored weapon is a whip.  She wields both a standard bullwhip and the cat-o-nine-tails with expert proficiency. In addition, Catwoman has been shown to have various items to restrain her victims, (as she does not believe in killing), such as a set of plastic ties for binding hands and feet, and a roll of [[duct tape]] used to gag her targets, (like she did with Angle Man, Film Freak, and various others during her robberies over the years.)

==Trade paperbacks==<!--needs converting into a table-->
''Catwoman'' Volume 4 has been collected as a number of trade paperbacks by DC Comics. In chronological order, they include:

#''The Dark End of the Street'' (#1-4 & "Trail of the Catwoman"): Ed Brubaker
#''Crooked Little Town'' (#5-10 & material from Catwoman Secret Files and Origins #1): Brubaker 
#''Relentless'' (#12-19 & material from Catwoman Secret Files and Origins #1): Brubaker
#''Wild Ride'' (#20-24): Brubaker 
#''The Replacements'' (#53-58): Will Pfeifer
#''It's Only A Movie'' (#59-65): Will Pfeifer
#"When In Rome"(#1-6)

==Non-canon appearances==
Selina Kyle appears as an aging and somewhat overweight [[madam]]e in Frank Miller's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' four times; all are brief. First, in a phone message to Bruce ("Selina. Bruce, I'm lonely"). Next, she was attacked by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who used a [[mind control]] drug to convince her to send one of her prostitutes to use the same substance on the Governor. The Joker then beats her, ties her up, gags her, and dresses her in a [[Wonder Woman]] outfit, leaving her for Batman to find (with a clear clue as to where he intends to go). Selina's final appearance in the book is at Bruce Wayne's funeral (because in truth, Bruce Wayne died, not Batman), where she yells at [[Superman]], telling him that she knows who killed Bruce. She does not appear in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Miller's follow-up story, although she is referred to in the prologue written for the trade paperback version.

Two 1990s prose novels feature Catwoman: ''The Further Adventures of Batman: Volume 3, Featuring Catwoman'', a short story collection by various authors (publs. 1993, edited by Martin H. Greenberg), and ''Catwoman: Tiger Hunt'', by Lynn Abbey and Robert Asprin, publs. date 1992. Both novels portray a ''Batman: Year One''- influenced Catwoman who wears a gray cat costume and was once a prostitute.

Catwoman also made a small cameo in ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', mostly accompanying the [[Riddler]]; she is predominantly seen, but not much heard in the series. She is not dressed in costume, but appears in the very dress she first wore in ''Batman #1'' as 'The Cat'. According to the novelization by [[Elliot S! Maggin]], she ran a multibillion dollar cosmetics company.

In the all-digital graphic novel ''[[Batman: Digital Justice]]'', which is set some time in the future long after the original Batman has died, Sheila Romero, a.k.a. the hit [[pop music]] star '''Gata''' (the Spanish female noun for "cat") and daughter of the mayor of Gotham City, is jealous of the new Batman, James Gordon, because media coverage of his activities have been cutting into her airtime. Setting out to learn as much about Batman and his enemies as she can, Gata becomes the new Catwoman. Near the end of the story, Gata and her followers face off against Batman, but the two later fall in love, and Maria Romero, a.k.a. '''Madame X''', tells Sheila that she is really a clone of Maria. Maria confesses that she had planned to transfer her brain into Gata's body, but she couldn't bring herself to do it because she loved her "daughter" too much. Maria then dies in Sheila's arms.

In the ''Elseworlds'' title ''Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham'', Selina Kyle is the daughter of millionaires Thomas and Martha Kyle. Walking home after seeing the film ''Cat People'', Selina, a young girl, chases after an alley cat and watches in horror as her parents are gunned down by a robber.  Selina learns that the crook has stolen a ring she found in a Crackerjack box and had given to her mother. Years later she becomes Catwoman, the defender of Gotham City, operating out of a Catcave beneath Kyle Manor, aided by a young maid named Brooks.  Her major enemy is a psychopathic criminal named Batman, who murders her entire rogues gallery to get rid of the competition.

In [[All Star Batman and Robin]] she is shown to be planning something with the Joker.

==In other media==
===1966 ''Batman'' series===

{{main|Batman (TV series)}}

[[Image:Jnewmarcat.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Julie Newmar as Catwoman in the ''Batman'' television series.]]

Catwoman was at various times portrayed by [[Julie Newmar]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] in the live-action ''Batman'' television series of the 1960s, her first other-media portrayal. [[Lee Meriwether]] was cast in the 1966 ''Batman'' motion picture based on the television series, after discovering Newmar was unavailable<ref>{{cite web

===Animation===
Catwoman has been a major character in almost all of Batman's animated series. 

Her first animated appearance was with Batman in segments of the [[1968 in television|1968]] series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' wearing her green costume of that time period. In this series she was voiced by Jane Webb. She also appeared in four episodes of ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' cartoon in the 1970s, in which she was voiced by [[Melendy Britt]]. 

====''Batman: The Animated Series''====
{{main|Batman: The Animated Series}}

Catwoman appeared on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' wearing an all gray outfit that has never been seen outside that series. Voiced by [[Adrienne Barbeau]] in both 1992's ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and its revamp in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' (as well as the 2000s online animated series ''[[Gotham Girls]]''), Catwoman is shown to be a socialite and animal rights activist, which attracts the attention of Bruce Wayne when he's not contending with her as [[Batman]]. 

Initially Selina had blonde hair, coinciding with the release of ''Batman Returns'', in which she was portrayed by blonde actress [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]. In the revamp, she appears to have shorter black hair. Whether her hair was dyed or her natural color was never made clear in the series itself, however in the episode "Tyger, Tyger", Selina became a cat/woman [[parahuman|hybrid]] and her hair (or rather fur) was blonde. After learning that her hair dye was tested on animals, she dropped the brand and tried, unsuccessfully, to change the views of the manager of the company.<ref>Batman Gotham Adventures #4</ref> 

In her first appearance, Catwoman steals a valuable necklace to fund the purchase of land for a mountain lion preserve, encounters Batman in the process, and finds herself undeniably attracted to him. In this moment, they develop an attraction that affects the nature of their cat and mouse relationship during the series. Afterward, by chance, Bruce Wayne dates Selina Kyle with similar results. In the midst of these budding romances, Selina learns that the land she wants has been snatched up by a suspicious cartel, lead by terrorist [[Red Claw]], who will be using the land for their staging area. Batman learns that Catwoman is getting in over her head, and together they fight and defeat the cartel, but Catwoman is arrested.

[[Image:Catwoman BTAS.jpg‎|thumb|180px|left|Catwoman, and Isis, as seen in Batman: The Animated Series]]Put on probation in lieu of serving time, Catwoman joins forces with Batman again, fighting the corrupt Industrialist, [[Roland Daggett]] and [[Professor Milo]]'s plans to spread a disease among the street animals. In "Almost Got 'Im", Catwoman rescues Batman from [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] only to be kidnapped herself by [[Harley Quinn]], which forces Batman to disguise himself as [[Killer Croc]] in order to save her. Harley gags Selina and ties her to a conveyor belt, where she is nearly killed by the grinders at the end. She is saved when Batman turns off the power to the conveyor belt.

Catwoman eventually returns to thievery when [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Scarface]] hires her to steal a rare extinct tiger.  When [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] returns, Catwoman initially helps her investigate a stolen cat statue, but betrays Batgirl to attempt to steal the statue for herself. She is again a full time thief when she tries to seduce a fully-grown [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] into being her accomplice to steal merchandise from Enrique “El Gancho”. Later, in "The Cult of the Cat", a strange criminal cult attempts to kill her after she steals from them, bringing her to enlist Batman's aid once more.

In [[Batman Beyond]], Bruce mentions Selina to [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] after his first encounter with [[Royal Flush Gang#Batman Beyond|Ten]] from the [[Royal Flush Gang]].  Terry also mentions her in Epilogue when he tells Bruce that she loved him but he gave up on her, due to his persistent care in "the mission" more than the people.

There were plans for a second Batman Beyond DTV Movie that would have featured Catwoman, but was rejected.<ref>http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm</ref>

Finally, in a 7-minute short film called ''[[Chase Me]]'' (written by [[Paul Dini]] and released with the ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' [[DVD]]), Batman catches her stealing from one of Bruce Wayne’s buildings and apprehends her.

Like all other characters, Catwoman would have a new design during The New Batman Adventures. Her new in-costume animated appearance also changed when the show's animation style did, becoming more like the Michelle Pfeiffer version, with a black costume, slimmer build, and white face makeup.  Details on her change are explored in Batman Gotham Adventures #4.<ref>http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/tnba/guides/ga</ref>/

One addition to the mythos was giving Catwoman a personal black cat called [[Krypto the Superdog#Villains|Isis]]. She was her chief pet and appeared in the fist series and in ''The New Batman Adventures''. As Catwoman's cat, she fought the dogs of [[Krypto|Superman]] and [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Batman]] on ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', a cartoon made by the same people who made the DCAU.

==== ''The Batman'' ====

Catwoman has also appeared on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Gina Gershon]]. Her design is slightly altered, having large, almost mouse-like ears and large orange goggles that resemble cat's eyes.  Another modification is her hood, which can be pulled up to hide the lower half of her face.  Catwoman is also given exaggerated claws on her gloves. The rest of her suit is black, with the exception of her red "paws".  She carries her whip around her waist that hangs like a tail.  In her civilian identity of Selina Kyle, she has long black hair and blue eyes, instead of her more traditional green eyes.  She flirts heavily with Batman, and in her first appearance stole his utility belt, accidentally gaining control of a giant bat-robot and wrecking the [[Batcave]]. Notable events involving her have been her team-up with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] (even flirting with him lightly), her fight against [[Rag Doll (comics)|Ragdoll]], and her attempt to help Batman against the Joker. She was later caught by Rumor but got away.

=== ''Batman Returns'' ===
{{main|Batman Returns}}
Catwoman was portrayed by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the 1992 movie ''Batman Returns''.  As recreated by [[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]] and [[Tim Burton]], Selina Kyle is depicted as a lonely, frustrated woman pushed over the edge into obsession and crime after her boss, tycoon [[Max Shreck (Batman Returns)|Max Shreck]], tries to kill her to keep her from revealing his plot to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity.

Mysteriously revived by alley cats after Shreck pushes her out a window, Selina Kyle's repressed rage allows her to transform into Catwoman.  As a masked figure operating under the guise of a theatrical public identity, Catwoman finds a reflection of herself in Batman.

===''Catwoman''===
[[Image:Catwoman poster.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Halle Berry as Catwoman in the 2004 film.]]{{main|Catwoman (film)}} 
In 2004, ''Catwoman'', a movie starring Halle Berry, was released. This film's Catwoman bore little resemblance to the comic book version. Berry portrayed Patience Phillips, a woman who eventually became Catwoman after a near-death experience. Patience gained the powers from the Egyptian cat goddess [[Bast (mythology)|Bastet]] through a gathering of cats led by an [[Egyptian Mau]]. The movie alludes to other women in the past who have been granted such cat-like abilities, particularly in a scene in which Phillips finds herself amongst a series of images of prior catwomen, including Pfeiffer's ''Batman Returns'' version of Selina Kyle. The film's story has nothing to do with Batman or Gotham City. 

Berry won the 2005 [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie]] award for worst actress in a film for her role as Catwoman, and accepted the prize in person. She was only the third Razzie winner (following director [[Paul Verhoeven]], director of ''[[Showgirls]]''; and [[Tom Green]], star of ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'') ever to do so. She brought her [[Monster's Ball]] [[Academy Award|Oscar]] with her for her acceptance speech.<ref>[http://www.razzies.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=355&PN=1&TPN=1 Razzies]</ref>

===''Return to the Batcave''===

In the TV movie ''[[Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt]]'', [[Julia Rose]] appeared as Catwoman and the young [[Julie Newmar]]. Both Julie Newmar and [[Lee Meriwether]] appeared in the TV movie as well.<ref>{{cite news

===''Birds of Prey''===
Selina Kyle appears, through flashbacks depicting her death, in the pilot episode of the 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.  The show featured Catwoman's daughter by Batman, the Huntress.  Maggie Baird portrayed Catwoman; in contrast to the comic book version, she is a [[metahuman]].

===Video games===
Catwoman appears as a playable character in ''Catwoman'' for the [[Game Boy Color]] (1999) and in the video game adaptation of Halle Berry's ''[[Catwoman (video game)|Catwoman]]'' movie.  Catwoman is also a boss in the video game adaptations of ''[[Batman Returns (video game)|Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series (video game)|Batman: The Animated Series]],'' and ''[[The Adventures of Batman & Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].

===Toys===
Kenner's 1992 Batman Returns toyline included a figure of Catwoman, sporting her costume from the film.  The toy came with a rubber whip, and a spring-action arm which would fly forward in a whipping motion.

Catwoman was also featured in the first wave of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' action figures. She came with the same rubber whip and spring-action arm as her ''Batman Returns'' counterpart, but also came with an over-sized claw that attached to her arm and a figure of Isis designed to rest upon her neck.

After a number of repaints of the original animated Catwoman figure, a new sculpt that truly reflected on the character's redesign appeared in a 2003 two-pack released by Mattel. This figure came with no accessories or special features, except for a whip.

The D.C. Direct line of action figures has included four incarnations of Catwoman over the years.  These versions are her appearance in the Silver Age of D.C. Comics, the Batman "Knightfall" storyline, the Batman "Hush" storyline, and the Batman "Long Halloween" storyline.

Catwoman also made an appearance in the eighth (and final) wave of [[Mattel]]'s [[DC Superheroes (toy)|DCSH]] toy line. She was in her Jim Lee inspired costume, and featured a backpack, cat Isis, whip, stolen necklace, and diorama of a bank vault.
