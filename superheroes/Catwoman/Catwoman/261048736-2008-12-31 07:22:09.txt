'''Catwoman''' is a [[fictional character]] associated with [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Batman]]'' [[media franchise|franchise]].  The [[supervillainess]] was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]], partially inspired by Kane's second cousin by marriage, Ruth Steel.<ref>"Batman and Me" by Bob Kane (November, 1989)</ref>

The original and most widely known Catwoman, '''Selina Kyle''', first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #1 (Spring 1940) in which she was known as '''The Cat'''.  As an adversary of Batman, she was a [[whip]]-carrying [[burglary|burglar]] with a taste for high-stake thefts.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Catwoman | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 74-75  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>  [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern]] writers have attributed her activities and costumed identity as a response to a history of abuse.

Since the 1990s, Catwoman has been featured in an eponymous series that cast her as an [[anti-hero]]ine rather than a supervillainess.  The character has been one of Batman's most enduring love interests, and has occasionally been depicted as his one true love.

A popular figure, Catwoman has been featured in most [[Mass media|media]] adaptations related to Batman.  Actresses [[Julie Newmar]], [[Lee Meriwether]], and [[Eartha Kitt]] introduced her to a large audience on the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series]] and the [[Batman (1966 film)|1966 ''Batman'' motion picture]].  [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] portrayed the character in 1992's popular film ''[[Batman Returns]]''.  [[Halle Berry]] starred in a stand-alone [[Catwoman (film)|''Catwoman'' film]] in 2004, although only loosely based on the ''Batman'' character.  Catwoman is #51 on [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]]'s "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>''Wizard'' #177 (July 2006), p. 88.</ref>

==Character and publication history==

There have been many versions of Catwoman's origins and backstory seen in the comic books over the decades.

===Golden and Silver Age versions===
[[Image:Catwoman-batman01.jpg|200px|Selina Kyle's first appearance as ''The Cat'' in ''Batman'' #1 (Spring 1940).|thumb|left]]
''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #62 revealed that Catwoman (after a blow to the head jogged her memory) is an [[amnesiac]] [[flight attendant]], who had turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived (although in the final issue of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'', she admits that she made up the [[amnesia]] story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime).  She reforms for several years, helping out Batman in ''Batman'' #65 and #69, until she decides to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #203.  Selina appears again as a criminal in ''Batman'' #84 and ''Detective Comics'' #211, her final appearance for many years (until 1966).

In the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters) reveal that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (after the events of ''Batman'' #69) and had married Bruce Wayne; soon afterwards, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]).  In ''The Brave and the Bold'' #197, the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman'' #62 is elaborated on, after Selina revealed that she never actually had amnesia.  It was revealed that Selina Kyle had been the wife of an abusive man, and eventually decided to leave her husband.  However, her husband had kept her jewelry in his private vault, and she had to break into it to retrieve the jewelry.  Selina enjoyed this experience so much she decided to become a professional costumed [[burglary|cat burglar]], and thus began a career that would repeatedly lead to her encountering the Batman.

The Earth-Two/Golden Age Selina Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being [[blackmail]]ed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman (as shown in ''DC Super-Stars'' #17).

Catwoman made her first Silver Age appearance in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #70 (November 1966); afterwards, she continued to make appearances across the various Batman comics.

Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing [[murder]], something that neither the Earth-One nor Earth-Two versions of her would ever do; this version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-B]], an alternate Earth that included stories that couldn't be considered [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] on Earth-One or Earth-Two.<ref>Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Index (March, 1986)</ref><ref>Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Cross-Over Index (July, 1986)</ref><ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/04/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-171/  Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #171], [[Comic Book Resources]],  September 4, 2008</ref>

===Modern Age version===
====Tangled origins====
A revision in Catwoman's [[origin story|origin]], and the introduction of the modern version of the character, came in 1986 when writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] published ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman's origin.  In the course of the story, the origin of Catwoman was also re-envisioned.  Selina Kyle is reintroduced as a cat-loving [[prostitution|prostitute]]/[[dominatrix]] who is inspired to become a costumed cat burglar when she sees Batman in action.  In this story, [[Holly Robinson]] is introduced as a young runaway and prostitute Kyle has taken in.

The 1989 ''Catwoman'' limited series (collected in trade paperback form as ''Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper'') by writer [[Mindy Newell]] and artist J.J. Birch expanded on Miller's ''Year One'' origin.  ''Her Sister's Keeper'' explores Selina's early life as a prostitute and the start of her career as Catwoman.  This is a dark and tragic period which culminates with Selina's former [[pimp]] Stan abducting and violently abusing her sister Maggie.  Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and is able to do so with [[impunity]].

Portions of ''Her Sister's Keeper'' and the ''Year One'' origin conceived by Frank Miller remain [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to Catwoman’s origin, while other portions have been dropped over the years.  It has been implied that ''Her Sister's Keeper'' was rendered non-canonical by the events of ''Zero Hour'', and subsequent writers have rejected Miller's choice to make the post-''Crisis'' Catwoman a prostitute.  In an attempt to harmonize the various versions, some writers have posited that Catwoman, early in her career, pretended to be a prostitute in order to scam lonely men and rob them.  However, characters associated with Catwoman's past as a prostitute have remained a part of her supporting cast.  Holly, from ''Batman: Year One,'' and her sister Maggie (from ''Her Sister's Keeper'') have appeared regularly in the ''Catwoman'' series.  Some elements of ''Her Sister's Keeper'' remain clearly noncanonical, however, such as references to her father only recently dying.

''Catwoman'' (vol. 1) #0, which provides details about Selina's childhood, neglects Maggie's existence.  Maria Kyle is a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats, and commits [[suicide]] when Selina is very young.  Brian Kyle, an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], is cold to Selina for resembling her mother (whom he resented for dying), and eventually drinks himself to death.

Selina takes to the streets for a time before being caught and sent first to an [[orphanage]], then Juvenile Hall (''Catwoman'' (vol. 1) #0), "where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be" (''Catwoman Secret Files and Origins'').  Maggie's fate at this point in the time-line is not alluded to.  However, when [[Ed Brubaker]] reintroduces her into the comic, he implies that Maggie may have directly entered an orphanage and promptly been [[adoption|adopted]].

When she is 13, Selina discovers that the Hall's administrator has been [[embezzlement|embezzling]] funds and confronts her.  In an attempt to cover up the illegal activities, the administrator puts Selina in a bag and drops her in a river to drown (like a cat).  Selina escapes and returns to the orphanage, where she steals documents exposing the administrator's corruption.  She uses this information to blackmail the administrator into erasing "Selina Kyle" from the city's records, then steals the administrator's diamond necklace, and escapes the orphanage (''Catwoman'' (vol. 1) #0).

Selina eventually finds herself in "Alleytown - a network of cobblestone streets that form a small between the East End and Old Gotham" (''Catwoman'' (vol. 2) #12).  Selina is taken in by "Mama Fortuna", the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and is taught how to steal.  Fortuna treats her students like [[slavery|slaves]], keeping their earnings for herself.  Selina eventually runs away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia.  However, the two have difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation try to support themselves by working as [[prostitution of children|child prostitute]]s.  Sylvia attracts at least one client; Selina apparently never does.  The two drift apart afterward, with Sylvia coming to resent Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.

In the ''Catwoman: Year One'' story (''Catwoman Annual'' #2, 1998), Selina (now an adult) achieved some success as a thief.  Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepted an offer to "lay low" by posing as a dominatrix in the employ of a pimp named Stan.  Their plan was to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes.  According to this storyline, Selina trained under the [[Armless Master]] of [[Gotham City]], receiving education in [[martial arts]] and culture.  During this time, Catwoman was given her trademark cat-o-nine tails whip by a client, which Selina kept as a trophy of her time posing as a hooker.

''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implies that Catwoman suspects she is the long-lost illegitimate daughter of [[Mafia]] boss [[Carmine Falcone]], although she finds no definitive proof of this.  Selina's connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]''.  Though more circumstantial evidence is added to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, no definitive proof is provided.

Catwoman also appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' saga, where she is approached by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s henchmen while robbing a house.  Bane asks her to work for him, but she refuses, as she is repulsed by the criminal who broke Batman.  Later in the story, she boards a plane with Bruce Wayne to fly to Santa Prisca.  She next appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall#Knightquest|Knightquest]]'' saga.

====Catwoman, the series====
In 1993, following the success of ''[[Batman Returns]]'', Catwoman was given her first ongoing comic book series.  This series, written by an assortment of writers but primarily penciled by [[Jim Balent]], generally depicted the character as an international thief (and occasional [[bounty hunter]]) with an ambiguous [[morality#moral codes|moral code]].

Storylines included her [[adoption]] of teenage [[runaway youth|runaway]], and erstwhile sidekick, Arizona; aiding the criminal [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] whom she later betrayed to [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]; and a stint as a reluctant government operative.  The series also fleshed out more of her origin, revealing her beginnings as a young thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and the training she received from superhero [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted (Wildcat) Grant]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Moving to [[New York]], Selina becomes corporate vice president then [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Randolf Industries, a [[mafia]]-influenced company, through [[blackmail]].  Her plans to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]] are ruined when the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] inadvertently connects Kyle to her Catwoman [[alter ego]].

Selina then returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline.  As Catwoman, she assists Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city.  After being arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], she escapes from prison.  Later that year during the ''Officer Down'' storyline in the Batman titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect.  Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story.  Soon afterwards she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at #94.

Catwoman then appears in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics'' #759-#762.  In a backup storyline ''Trail of the Catwoman'', by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke, private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle.  This storyline leads in to the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]).  In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and [[Slam Bradley]] (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham's East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar.

During the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline (''Batman'' #608-#619), Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and have a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her.  At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the [[Riddler]] and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]].  This was the second time that Batman's true identity was shown to be known to her.  In an early '80s story line, Selina and Bruce had developed a relationship.  The concluding story featured a closing panel in which she refers to Batman as "Bruce."  A change in editorial team at that point, however, brought a swift end to that story line and, apparently, all that transpired during the arc.  When Catwoman appeared again, no mention whatsoever was ever made of the notion that she had apparently figured out who Batman actually is.

In the ''[[Justice League]]'' story arc ''Crisis of Conscience,'' Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the League against the old [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.

Catwoman appears in [[Gail Simone]]'s "Sensei and Student" story arc in ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']]''.  She is part of a group sent to rescue a U.S. senator from the [[Eurasia]]n assassin [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]; during the mission, she saves [[Lady Shiva]], who was bound and gagged in the trunk of a car wired with explosives by Chesire.

====Mindwiping revelations====
Catwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman true (although brash and unpredictable).  However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a mindwipe by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims.  Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback, it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and Batman.  Catwoman's response to this revelation is unequivocal: she duct-tapes Zatanna's mouth shut and pitches her out a window (Zatanna survives the fall).  Afterwards, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.

Still unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52, Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain.  The [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], in an attempt to "improve himself," threatens the most important people in Selina's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly.  The villain had also previously tortured Selina's sister Maggie into a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state and murdered Maggie's husband, earning Catwoman's ire.  Black Mask had learned Selina's identity through his earlier alliance with Selina's childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbored a grudge against Selina.  Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  This action continues to haunt her throughout the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, and it is suggested that this might have been the first time she had ever directly taken a life.

====One Year Later====
{{main|One Year Later}}
[[Image:Catwomanbaby.PNG|Selina Kyle with her child, Helena (2006). Pencils by David Lopez.|180px|thumb|left]]Following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the DC Universe jumps forward in time. "One Year Later" Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena (whose father is initially unknown).  [[Holly Robinson]] takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter (Selina's alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'').<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Though she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena's birth.  Having understandably gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now a tighter fit.  In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal.  Although the situation is defused through Holly's opportune arrival, the sight of two Catwomen active simultaneously in the city is caught on video.  Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado [[Film Freak]] has deduced her alias, joined with [[Angle Man]], and grabbed Helena.

After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces [[Zatanna]] to mind-wipe Film Freak and Angle Man in order to preserve her secret identity.  Following the procedure, Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage.  [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted Grant]] informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask; Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly.  Finally defeating Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that [[Slam Bradley]] has deduced that Helena is the daughter of his son Sam Bradley Jr., and therefore his granddaughter.

Batman asks Catwoman to infiltrate the violent tribe of [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana Amazons]] during the ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' crossover.  Posing as a criminal, Selina gains the Bana's trust and thwarts a terror attack aimed at causing mass casualties in Gotham City. 

Selina questions whether she should be raising a daughter when her life as Catwoman has already proven to be such a danger to the child.  After enlisting Batman's help in faking the death of both herself and her daughter, Selina puts Helena up for adoption.  A month after Helena is placed with a new family, Catwoman asks Zatanna to erase her memories of Helena and change her mind back to a criminal mentality.  Zatanna refuses, judging that such an act would be cruel to both mother and daughter.  She tells Selina that she could never reverse Selina's mindset, since she was on the path to becoming a hero on her own.  Believing she can no longer function as a criminal, Selina decided to become one of Batman's [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>  She quickly quit, however, and was replaced by [[Batgirl (Cassandra Cain)|Batgirl]].

In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #2, Catwoman is sent to the Prison Planet.  She allies herself with [[Lex Luthor]] in an attempt to return to [[Earth]], and mistakenly ends up on an [[alternate universe]]-Earth where Catwoman is a notorious villain.  It is later revealed that this Earth is a creation of her own mind, and she has not left Prison Planet.  When accused of being a traitor by Luthor, she reveals [[Martian Manhunter]] is posing as [[Blockbuster (comics)| Blockbuster]], which would soon lead to the hero's death.

Using the trust she regained in Luthor's eyes, she's able to earn a passage to the "real" Earth, in a jury-rigged teleport machine built by Luthor for letting the villains escape.  On Earth, she resumed being a hero, with occasional lapses into thievery by commission, for the thrill of it and limiting the damages.

Uncertain if she should pursue her "relationship" with Batman, she talks with Bruce about Jezebel Jet, his current girlfriend, and then has a pep talk with [[Zatanna]], who she believes is also courting Bruce.  Zatanna confirms and admits her feelings, adding that she has since chosen to forgo them, but encourages Selina to open her heart to Bruce before Jet is able to "seal the deal".  [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] eavesdrops the conversation, targeting both women as a way to hurt his enemy, Bruce Wayne.

The current volume of ''Catwoman'' concluded with issue #82, and details a cat-and-mouse chase between Batman and Catwoman across Gotham city rooftops, ending with Selina stealing the Batmobile, and apparently returning to a life as thief.<ref>[http://xrayspex.blogspot.com/2008/04/well-heh-heh-this-is-little.html X-Ray Spex: Well, heh heh... this is a little embarrassing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

In ''Detective Comics'' #848, Hush attacks Selina, surgically removing her heart.  She is delivered anonymously to a Gotham hospital.  Batman receives word of her situation, and while he goes in search of Hush, he leaves Selina in the care of [[Doctor Mid-nite]], who is considered the super-hero community's chief doctor.

Batman is able to recover her heart and Dr Mid-nite restores it to her body; however, the doctor also makes a prognosis on whether she can still return to her former life swinging through rooftops. While Selina is still in a coma, she encounters Zatanna who apologizes for not warning her about Hush. She tells Selina that she was so rooting for her and Bruce that she ignored the other warnings in the cards. Zatanna gives her a little bottle supposedly containing aloe vera for her post-op scars. It is hinted that there is a little magic in there to help Selina with her recovery. Selina is sad that she might end up alone again. In the meantime, Bruce enters the recovery room and, believing her unconscious, launches into a soliloquy. He goes as far as declaring that she was the only woman who has ever held his heart. He ends by telling a sleeping Selina that he will always love her.

As for the events told in [[Batman R.I.P.]], for reasons still unknown, their romance lasts only for a night. While still recuperating, Selina manages to pull off one more heist and exact her revenge on Hush. With the help of a few allies on both sides [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Slam Bradley]], she taps into Tommy Elliot's assets, leaving him broken and penniless, suffering from the wounds suffered at Batman's hand, alone and unable to provide for himself anymore. She shares the loot with her allies, keeps a lion's share for herself, but also gives a large chunk of the stolen money to several abused women shelters in Gotham.

Despite her bodily damages and Doctor Mid-Nite nefarious prognosis, in ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Selina is seen alongside [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batwoman]] and [[Giganta]], brainwashed by [[Darkseid]] and preparing to attack both Flashes, [[Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]]. Eventually, the Flashes manage to escape her ambush, revealing how Catwoman was remade into a misshapen, animalistic assassin equipped with sensory abilities to track down speedsters, perceived as menaces to Darkseid's masterplan.

==Skills, resources, and abilities==
Selina is a gifted and accomplished athlete, with heightened acrobatic prowess.  She was trained by the Armless Master in martial arts and by Wildcat in boxing and street-fighting.  She is a clever and resourceful fighter, known for precise, agile attacks and speedy getaways.  Her formidable [[hand to hand combat]] skills are augmented by her cat-like speed, reflexes, balance, and flexibility.

Fittingly, Catwoman is a master thief possessed of unsurpassed stealth and cunning.  An expert at both low- and high-tech heists, she is the best  cat-burglar Gotham City has ever seen.

===Costume===
Catwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all, and it was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations.  Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a [[catsuit]] with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask.  In the 1960s, Catwoman's catsuit was green in color, which was typical of villains of that era.  In the 1990s, she usually wore a skintight purple catsuit, before switching to a black PVC catsuit that recalls [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s costume in ''Batman Returns''.  In recent years, artists' depictions have usually alternated between those two costumes. Ed Brubaker, the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic leather [[catsuit]] in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' TV series.<ref>{{cite web

  | url =http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html
  | accessdate =}}2007-[[June 10|6-10]]</ref>  It has a more [[high tech]] look, with domino-shaped [[infrared]] goggles on her cowl. 

Many of her costumes have incorporated retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and sometimes on the toes of her boots.  On rare occasions, she has also sported a cat's tail.

Holly Robinson uses the same costume Selina used prior to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

===Weapons and equipment===
During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Catwoman, like most ''Batman'' villains, used a variety of themed weapons, vehicles, and equipment, such as a custom cat-themed car called the "Cat-illac".  This usage also appeared in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series.  In her post-''Crisis'' appearances, Catwoman's favored weapon is a whip.  She wields both a standard bullwhip and the cat-o-nine-tails with expert proficiency.  In addition, Catwoman has been shown to have various items to restrain her victims, such as a set of plastic ties for binding hands and feet, and a roll of [[duct tape]] used to [[gag]] her targets, like she did with Angle Man, Film Freak, Zatanna, and various others during her robberies over the years.

==Alternate versions==
Selina Kyle appears as an aging and somewhat overweight [[madam]]e in Frank Miller's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' four times; all are brief.  First, in a phone message to Bruce ("Selina.  Bruce, I'm lonely").  Next, she is attacked by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who uses a [[mind control]] drug to convince her to send one of her prostitutes to use the same substance on the Governor.  The Joker then beats her, ties her up, gags her, and dresses her in a [[Wonder Woman]] outfit, leaving her for Batman to find.  Selina's final appearance in the book is at Bruce Wayne's funeral (because in truth, Bruce Wayne died, not Batman), where she yells at [[Superman]], telling him that she knows who killed Bruce.  She does not appear in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Miller's follow-up story, although she is referred to in the prologue written for the trade paperback version.

Two 1990s prose novels feature Catwoman: ''The Further Adventures of Batman: Volume 3, Featuring Catwoman'', a short story collection by various authors (publs. 1993, edited by Martin H. Greenberg), and ''Catwoman: Tiger Hunt'', by Lynn Abbey and Robert Asprin, publs. date 1992.  Both novels portray a ''Batman: Year One''-influenced Catwoman who wears a gray cat costume and was once a prostitute.

Catwoman also made a small cameo in ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', mostly accompanying the [[Riddler]]; she is predominantly seen, but not much heard in the series.  She is not dressed in costume, but appears in the very dress she first wore in ''Batman'' #1 as 'The Cat'.  According to the novelization by [[Elliot S! Maggin]], she ran a multibillion dollar cosmetics company.

In the all-digital graphic novel ''[[Batman: Digital Justice]]'', which is set some time in the future long after the original Batman has died, Sheila Romero, a.k.a. the hit [[pop music]] star '''Gata''' (the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] female [[noun]] for "cat") and daughter of the mayor of Gotham City, is jealous of the new Batman, James Gordon, because media coverage of his activities have been cutting into her airtime.  Setting out to learn as much about Batman and his enemies as she can, Gata becomes the new Catwoman.  Near the end of the story, Gata and her followers face off against Batman, but the two later fall in love, and Maria Romero, a.k.a. '''Madame X''', tells Sheila that she is really a [[cloning|clone]] of Maria.  Maria confesses that she had planned to transfer her brain into Gata's body, but she couldn't bring herself to do it because she loved her "daughter" too much.  Maria then dies in Sheila's arms.

In the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' title ''Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham'', Selina Kyle is the daughter of millionaires Thomas and Martha Kyle.  Walking home after seeing the film ''Cat People'', Selina, a young girl, chases after an alley cat and watches in horror as her parents are gunned down by a robber.  Selina learns that the crook has stolen a ring she found in a Crackerjack box and had given to her mother.  Years later she becomes Catwoman, the defender of Gotham City, operating out of a Catcave beneath Kyle Manor, aided by a young maid named Brooks.  Her major enemy is a [[psychopathy|psycopathic]] criminal named Batman, who murders her entire rogues gallery to get rid of the competition.

In ''Batman: Bloodstorm''- the sequel to ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', where Batman was forced to become a [[vampire]] to save Gotham from an attack by [[Dracula]] - Selina is turned into a were-cat after being bitten by one of the remaining vampires while the vampire was in a wolf form.  Hunting for the monster that transformed her, Selina encounters Batman as he hunts for the remaining vampires, the two subsequently joining forces to eliminate the vampire horde.  As they fight together, Batman finds that Selina's selfless love for him allows him to control his thirst for blood that had begun to consume him, but she sacrifices herself to save him from the Joker- who had become the leader of the remaining vampires after Dracula's death - taking a crossbow bolt to the heart that the Joker had fired at Batman.

In [[Howard Chaykin]]'s ''Thrillkiller'', Selina Kyle is a stripper in a cat-themed strip club.  She acts as an informant for [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] Detective Bruce Wayne.

In [[Dean Motter]]'s ''[[Batman: Nine Lives]]'', Selina Kyle is a cat-loving [[African American]] night club owner.  Her death sets in motion the events of the story.

In [[Howard Chaykin]]'s ''Dark Allegiances'', Selina Kyle becomes a film star under the stage name of Kitty Grimalkin.  Prior to becoming a star, she was an alcoholic whose actions during one of her "blackouts" were recorded into an underground [[pornography|porn]] film.  The stills from the film are used to blackmail her into stealing information from [[Wayne Enterprises]].

In ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' Annual #2, [[Vicki Vale|Vikki Vale]], a reporter for Wayne Media, is Catwoman.  She is hired by [[Anarky]] to steal information, but she gets caught and is tortured by [[Scarecrow (comics)|Jonathan Crane]], whom she calls a "demented scarecrow".

In Frank Miller's ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'', Catwoman expresses an interest in the Joker's unrevealed plans.  She also appears to be involved in prostitution, as she advises the Joker that "...even I don't play ''that'' rough".

===Television===
====1966 ''Batman'' series====
{{main|Batman (TV series)}}
[[Image:Jnewmarcat.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Julie Newmar as Catwoman in the ''Batman'' television series.]]
Catwoman was at various times portrayed by [[Julie Newmar]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] in the live-action ''Batman'' television series of the 1960s, her first portrayal in a medium outside comic books.  [[Lee Meriwether]] was cast in the [[Batman (1966 film)|1966 motion picture spinoff]] that was produced after the series' first season after producers learned that Newmar was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web

In the Australian sketch comedy series ''[[Fast Forward]]'', Batman was one of the many television series parodied. Newmar's portrayal of Catwoman was parodied by [[Gina Riley]], now famous for ''[[Kath and Kim]]''.

====''Birds of Prey''====
Selina Kyle appears, through flashbacks depicting her death, in the pilot episode of the 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.  The show featured Batman and Catwoman's daughter, the Huntress, also known as Helena Kyle.  [[Maggie Baird]] portrayed Catwoman; in contrast to the comic book version, she is a [[metahuman]].  It is also mentioned that her sudden death sent Batman into self-imposed isolation.

===Film===
====''Batman Returns''====
{{main|Batman Returns}}
Catwoman was portrayed by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the [[1992 in film|1992]] movie ''Batman Returns''.  As recreated by [[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]] and [[Tim Burton]], Selina Kyle is depicted as a lonely, frustrated woman pushed over the edge (literally) into obsession and crime after her boss, tycoon [[Max Shreck]], tries to kill her to keep her from revealing his plot to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity.

[[Image:Batmanreturnspostercatwoman.png|left|Movie poster for ''Batman Returns'' (1992) featuring [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Catwoman.|180px|thumb]] 

Mysteriously revived by alley cats after Shreck pushes her out a window, Selina Kyle's repressed rage allows her to transform into the clever [[supervillainess]] Catwoman.  Shortly following her transformation, she joins forces with [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]].  As a masked vigilante operating under the guise of a theatrical public identity, Catwoman finds a reflection of herself in Batman.  In the ballroom scene, to [[Siouxsie & the Banshees]]' "Face to Face," the two masked crimefighters, Batman and Catwoman, dressed as their alter-egos, Bruce and Selina, discover their dual personalities, thus exposing one of Burton's main themes &mdash; duality &mdash; in the film.  In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], she electrocutes Shreck by kissing him with a Taser in her mouth; Batman never finds her body.  She is seen one last time at the end of the film, looking at the Batsignal in the sky.

When [[Tim Burton]] was set to direct ''[[Batman Forever]]'', his intention was to use The [[Riddler]] as the main villain and possibly have Catwoman return.  As Burton was replaced by [[Joel Schumacher]], this never came to pass.  She was briefly mentioned by [[Dr. Chase Meridian]], stating she has done her homework on Batman, that he likes tough girls, and asks if she needs skin-tight leather and a whip.

====''Catwoman''====
[[Image:Catwoman poster.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Halle Berry]] as Catwoman in the 2004 film.]]{{main|Catwoman (film)}} 
In [[2004 in film|2004]], ''Catwoman'', a movie starring [[Halle Berry]], was released.  This film's Catwoman bore little resemblance to the comic book version.  Berry portrayed Patience Phillips, a woman who eventually became Catwoman after a near-death experience.  Patience gained the powers from the Egyptian cat goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]] through a gathering of cats led by an [[Egyptian Mau]].  The movie alludes to other women in the past who have been granted such cat-like abilities, particularly in a scene in which Patience finds herself amongst a series of images of prior Catwomen, including Pfeiffer's ''Batman Returns'' version of Selina Kyle.  The film's story has nothing to do with Batman or Gotham City. 

Berry won the 2005 [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie]] award for worst actress in a film for her role as Catwoman, and accepted the prize in person.  She was only the third Razzie winner (following director [[Paul Verhoeven]], director of ''[[Showgirls]]''; and [[Tom Green]], star of ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'') ever to do so.  She brought her ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' [[Academy Award|Oscar]] with her for her acceptance speech.<ref>[http://www.razzies.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=355&PN=1&TPN=1 Razzie Forum]</ref>

====Nolan series====
Catwoman is rumored to be a character in the proposed third Batman movie directed by [[Christopher Nolan]], after ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.

===Animation===
Catwoman has been a major character in almost all of Batman's animated series. 

Her first animated appearance was with Batman in segments of the 1968 series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' wearing her green costume of that time period.  In this series, she was voiced by [[Jane Webb]].  She also appeared in four episodes of ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' cartoon in the 1970s, in which she was voiced by [[Melendy Britt]]. 

====''Batman: The Animated Series''====
{{main|Batman: The Animated Series}}
[[Image:Catwoman BTAS.jpg‎|thumb|180px|left|Catwoman, and Isis, as seen in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.]]
Catwoman appeared on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' wearing an all gray outfit that has never been seen outside that series (although it was seen on a comic book based on the series).  Voiced by [[Adrienne Barbeau]] in both 1992's ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and its revamp in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' (as well as the 2000s online animated series ''[[Gotham Girls]]''), Catwoman is shown to be a socialite and [[animal rights]] activist, which attracts the attention of Bruce Wayne when he's not contending with her as Batman.  Catwoman also flirts with [[Dick Grayson| Nightwing]] in "You Scratch My Back".  However, at the end of the episode, it's revealed that she was just using Nightwing in order to steal an artifact.  In many of the episodes featuring Selina, she is accompanied by her assistant named Maven, who aids both of Selina's identities.  She also is shown to keep many cats, among those is her favorite cat Isis.

Initially Selina had blonde hair, coinciding with the release of ''Batman Returns'', in which she was portrayed by blonde actress [[Michelle Pfeiffer]].  In the revamp, she appears to have shorter black hair.  Whether her hair was dyed or her natural color was never made clear in the series itself, however in the episode "Tyger, Tyger", Selina becomes a cat/woman [[parahuman|hybrid]] and her hair (or rather fur) is blonde.  In the related comic book series, it is explained that after learning that her hair dye was tested on animals, she drops the brand and tries, unsuccessfully, to change the views of the manager of the company.<ref>''Batman Gotham Adventures'' #4</ref>

=====''Batman Beyond''=====
In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Bruce mentions Selina to [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] after his first encounter with [[Royal Flush Gang#Batman Beyond|Ten]] from the [[Royal Flush Gang]].  Terry also mentions her in "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]" when he tells Bruce that she loved him, but he gave up on her, due to his persistent devotion to "the mission" rather than people.

There were plans for a second ''Batman Beyond'' [[DTV]] movie that would have featured Catwoman, but it was rejected.<ref>[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm Epilogue<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Finally, in a seven-minute short film called ''[[Chase Me]]'' (written by [[Paul Dini]] and released with the ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' [[DVD]]), Batman catches her stealing from one of Bruce Wayne's buildings and apprehends her.

Like all other characters, Catwoman would have a new design during ''The New Batman Adventures''.  Her new in-costume animated appearance also changed when the show's animation style did, becoming more like the Michelle Pfeiffer version, with a black costume, slimmer build, and white face makeup.  Details on her change are explored in ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' #4.<ref>[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/tnba/guides/ga The World's Finest - The New Batman Adventures<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=====''Batman Adventures''=====
In the comic series ''[[Batman Adventures]]'', Selina is featured in issue #10, in the back up story she breaks into a vault at the Wayne Manor during Bruce's New Year's Ball.  After she has left the scene, Bruce states to Robin and Alfred that he felt betrayed by her for doing so; stating that after Selina was unmasked, he was the only one of Gotham's high society not to shun her.  But he is reassured of her friendship when he finds she has stolen nothing and has left him a card stating her New Year's resolution is to stay on the right side of the law.  After Robin questions her sincerity, Bruce states that he believes she will keep her vow.

One addition to the mythos was giving Catwoman a personal black cat named [[Krypto the Superdog#Villains|Isis]], who appears in the first series and in ''The New Batman Adventures''.  As Catwoman's cat, she fights the dogs of [[Krypto|Superman]] and [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Batman]], as well as [[Streaky the Supercat]], on ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', a cartoon made by the same people who made the DCAU.

====''The Batman''====
[[Image:TBCatwoman.png|thumb|100px|right|Catwoman, as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Catwoman has also appeared on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Gina Gershon]].  Her design is slightly altered, having large, almost mouse-like ears and large orange goggles that resemble cat's eyes.  Another modification is her hood, which can be pulled up to hide the lower half of her face.  Catwoman is also given exaggerated claws on her gloves. The rest of her suit is black, with the exception of her red "paws".  She carries her whip around her waist that hangs like a tail.  In her civilian identity of Selina Kyle, she has long black hair and blue eyes, instead of her more traditional green eyes. Selina's day job is as a charity fund raiser which is how she meets [[Bruce Wayne]].  She flirts heavily with Batman, and in her first appearance stole his utility belt, accidentally gaining control of a giant bat-robot and wrecking the [[Batcave]].  Notable events involving her have been her team-up with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] (even flirting with him lightly), her fight against [[Rag Doll (comics)|Rag Doll]], and her attempt to help Batman against the Joker.  She is later caught by [[List of The Batman villains#Rumor|Rumor]], but gets away. A notable fact about this version of Catwoman is that she has never ever been caught by the Gotham Police, due to her large amount of resources.

====''Krypto the Superdog''====
In the animated cartoon series called ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', Catwoman's pet cat Isis is a recurring foe of [[Krypto]], [[Streaky the Supercat]] and [[Ace the Bat-Hound]].  Although Catwoman is referenced in the series, she never made an appearance on the show.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold====
Catwoman will appear in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. She will be voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. [http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0812/23/index.htm]

===Video games===
====''LEGO Batman''====
Selina Kyle as Catwoman appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game|LEGO Batman]]'' for the [[Playstation 2]], [[Playstation 3]], [[Wii]], and [[Xbox 360]] as an enemy of [[Batman]] and a follower of [[the Penguin]].<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph.  See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref>  Her allegiance to Penguin is a possible reference to [[Batman Returns]]. She steals a jewel from a museum together with the Penguin, but is soon captured by Batman and Robin. However, she manages to throw away the jewel, which is collected by a cat, which then brings it to her while she is in jail. She is freed by Penguin and [[Killer Croc]]. Catwoman has tha ability to [[double jump]] and to use her feminine wiles to unlock certain doors. She can use a [[bullwhip]] as a weapon and has an alternate suit which is purple with black legs. Ben of ''Gamer Informer'' writes that "this game is filled with cool playable characters...Nightwing, Joker, Killer Croc, Bane, Catwoman, and Man-bat only scratch the surface of the game's catalog of great characters."<ref>Ben, "''LEGO Batman'': Time to build something new," ''Game Informer'' 187 (November 2008): 116.</ref>

====''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe''====
Catwoman appears as a fighter in the crossover fighting game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''. She is classified as a villain in the game. Her first fatality has her wrapping her whip around her opponent's throat and dragging them to the ground where she then jumps on their back and pulls back on the whip breaking their neck, whilst her second fatality has her claw out her victims eyes before hurling them to the ground. Though her role in the game is small, her story begins as she is approached by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] after stealing from the Gotham Museum. Though he defeats her in combat, she reclaims her purloined jewel after an intervention from [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], and whilst she makes her escape she gets pulled into a portal that teleports her to The Special Forces base in the Mortal Kombat universe. Here, she finds [[Sonya (Mortal Kombat)|Sonya Blade]], and requests to use the bases portal to return to Gotham. Sonya defeats her in battle however, and locks her away in a cell. She is eventually set free when [[Lex Luthor]] is also captured, and they aid each other in escaping. The two form an alliance, approaching both [[Deathstroke]] and [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and recruiting them for the battle against the invading warriors. With their help, she assists Batman and his allies in the battle against Dark Khan. Her Game Ending features her returning to her Gotham City and discovering that due to the magical essence of the worlds merging, she now has the ability to transform into a Black Panther at will, enhancing her speed and strength. She uses these newfound powers to ensure she will never again be caged.
