'''Catwoman''' is a [[fictional character]] associated with [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]] franchise and created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]].

The original and most widely known Catwoman, '''Selina Kyle,''' first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] #1'' (Spring 1940), where she was initially known as '''The Cat'''. She was an adversary of Batman, a [[whip]]-carrying [[burglar]] with a taste for high stake thefts. [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern]] writers have attributed her activities and costumed identity as a response to a history of abuse. 

Since the [[1990s]], Catwoman has been featured in an eponymous series that cast her as an [[anti-hero]] rather than a [[supervillain|villain]]. The character has also been written as one of Batman's possible love-interests, even helping him on occasion.
{{spoiler}}
Recently, Selina Kyle has stepped out of the role of Catwoman, and her confidante, aide and protégé [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] has taken up the mantle. How long before Selina resumes the role, if ever, remains to be seen. 

One of the most popular Batman characters, Catwoman has been featured in most other [[Mass media|media]] adaptations of the character. Actresses [[Julie Newmar]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] introduced her to a large audience on the [[1960s]] [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series]]. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s rage and sexuality-driven portrayal of the character in 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' was both popular and controversial {{fact}}. 

In 2004, [[Halle Berry]] starred in a critically panned and financially disastrous [[Catwoman (film)|''Catwoman'' film]], featuring a character resembling her comic book counterpart in no more than name.

==Selina Kyle==
Her name "Selina" derives from the ancient [[lunar deity]] [[Selene]].

There have been many versions of Catwoman's origins and backstory seen in the comic books over the decades.

[[Image:Catwoman-batman01.jpg|160px|Selina Kyle's first appearance as ''The Cat'' in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] #1'' (Spring 1940).|thumb|left]]
===Golden and Silver Age versions===

In ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] #62'', it is revealed that Catwoman (after a blow to the head jogged her memory) is an [[amnesiac]] [[flight attendant]] who had turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived (although in the final issue of ''The Brave and the Bold,'' she admits that she made up the amnesia story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime). She winds up reforming and stays on the straight and narrow for several years, helping out Batman in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] #65 and #69'', until Selina decides to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]] #203''. Selina appears again as a criminal in ''Batman #84'' and ''Detective Comics #211'', her final appearance for many years (until 1966).

In the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] characters) reveal that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (after the events of ''Batman #69'') and had married Bruce Wayne; soon afterwards, the couple gave birth to their only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]). In ''[[Brave and the Bold]] #197'', the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman #62'' is elaborated on, after Selina revealed that she never actually had amnesia. It was revealed that Selina Kyle had been the wife of an abusive man, and eventually decided to leave her husband. However, her husband had kept her jewelry in his private vault, and she had to break into it to retrieve the jewelry. Selina enjoyed this experience so much she decided to become a professional costumed [[cat burglar]], and thus began a career that would repeatedly lead to her encountering the Batman.

The Earth-Two/Golden Age Selena Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being blackmailed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman (as shown in ''[[DC Super-Stars]] #17'').

Catwoman's first Silver Age appearance was in ''[[Lois Lane|Superman's Girl Friend Lois Lane]] #70'' (November 1966); afterwards, she continued to make appearances across the various Batman comics.

Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing [[murder]], something that neither the Earth-One or Earth-Two versions of her would ever do; this version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-B|Earth-B]], an alternate Earth that included stories that couldn't be considered canonical on Earth-One or Earth-Two.

===Modern Age version===
====Tangled origins====
[[Image:Catmini.png|160px|Cover to ''Catwoman v.1 #1'' (February 1989), her first miniseries. Pencils by [[J.J. Birch]].|thumb]]

A revision in Catwoman's origin, and the introduction of the modern version of the character, came in 1986 when writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] published ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman’s origin. In the course of the story, the origin of Catwoman was also re-envisioned. A 5'7" Selina Kyle is reintroduced as a cat-loving [[prostitute]]/[[dominatrix]] who is inspired to become a costumed cat burglar when she sees Batman in action.

The 1989 ''Catwoman'' limited series (collected in trade paperback form as ''[[Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper]]'') by writer [[Mindy Newell]] and artist [[J.J. Birch]] expanded on Miller's ''Year One'' origin. ''Her Sister's Keeper'' explores Selina's early life as a prostitute and the start of her career as Catwoman.  This is a dark and tragic period which culminates with Selina's former [[pimp]] Stan abducting and violently abusing her sister Maggie.  Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and is able to do so with impunity.

''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implies that Catwoman suspects she is the long-lost illegitimate daughter of [[Carmine Falcone]], although she finds no definitive proof of this. Selina's connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]''. Though more circumstantial evidence is added to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, no definitive proof is provided.

Portions of ''Her Sister's Keeper'' and the "Year One" origin conceived by Frank Miller remain [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to Catwoman’s origin, while other portions of this revised origin have been dropped over the years. In particular, aside from "Her Sister's Keeper" story (which was declared non-canon after the events of "Zero Hour", DC Comics has taken the stance post-"Year One" to outright reject Miller's decision to make the Post-Crisis Catwoman a prostitute, though various writers have attempted to circumvent this editorial mandate by establishing a retcon where Catwoman, early in her career, made her living scamming lonely men by pretending to be a prostitute only to rob them. In spite of this, characters associated with Catwoman's past as a hooker have remained a part of her character's supporting cast over the years, most notably Holly from ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and her sister Maggie (from ''Her Sister's Keeper'') appear regularly in the ''Catwoman'' series, though the details of their relationships with Catwoman have been subsequently altered to fit with the editorial mandate (most notably with regards to Maggie, who was retconned out of canon during the 1990s only to be reintroduced in the most recent Catwoman series). 

Selina is the older of two sisters (Maggie being the younger) born to Brian and Maria Kyle.  (''Catwoman v.1 #0'', which provided details about Selina's childhood, neglected Maggie's existence as the character was at the time, considered not to be part of the character's canonical past)  Maria Kyle was a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats and committed suicide when Selina was very young.  Brian Kyle, a drunken layabout angry at his wife for killing herself, disliked Selina for resembling her mother and eventually drank himself to death.

Selina took to the streets for a time (Maggie's fate at this point is not mentioned, due to the character being retconned out of existence at the time, though when writer Ed Brubaker reintroduced the character back into canon, implied that Maggie may have gone directly into an orphanage and promptly adopted), before being caught and sent first to an orphanage then later a Juvenile Hall (''Catwoman v.1 #0''), "where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be." (''Catwoman Secret Files and Origins.'')  When she was thirteen Selina discovered that the Hall's administrator was embezzling funds and confronted her.  In an attempt to cover up the illegal activities, the administrator put Selina in a bag and dropped her in a river to drown (like a cat).  Selina was able to escape (''Catwoman v.1 #0'') and returned to the orphanage, where she stole documents that were sent to the authorities to expose the administrator's corruption as well as steal money on which Selina would use to live on now that she was back onto the streets.

When the money she stole from the corrupt orphanage administrator ran out, Selina found herself in "Alleytown - a network of cobblestone streets that form a small borough between the East end and Old Gotham." (''Catwoman v.2 #12''). Selina was taken in by "Mama Fortuna", the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and was taught how to steal.  Fortuna treated her students like slaves, keeping their earnings for herself.  Selina eventually ran away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia.  However, the two had difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation tried to support themselves by working as child prostitutes.  Sylvia attracted at least one client; Selina apparently never did.  The two drifted apart afterwards, with Sylvia blaming Selina for her negative experiences; she hated Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.  

In the ''Catwoman: Year One'' story (''Catwoman Annual #2'', 1998), Selina (now an adult) achieved some success as a thief.  Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepted an offer to "lay low" by posing as a dominatrix in the employ of a pimp named Stan.  Their plan was to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes.  According to this storyline, Selina trained under the [[Armless Master]] of [[Gotham City|Gotham]], receiving education in [[martial arts]] and culture. During this time, Catwoman was given her trademark cat-o-nine tails whip by a client, which Selina kept as a trophy of her time posing as a hooker.

====Catwoman, the series====

In 1993, following the success of ''[[Batman Returns]]'' and Selina Kyle’s prominent role in that film, Catwoman was given her first ongoing series. This series, written by an assortment of writers but primarily penciled by [[Jim Balent]], generally depicted the character as an international thief (and occasional [[bounty hunter]]) with an ambiguous moral code.

Storylines included her [[adoption]] of a teenage [[runaway child|runaway]] named Arizona, whom she briefly takes on as a sidekick; aiding the criminal [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], followed by helping [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to defeat him; and Selina Kyle as a reluctant government operative. The series also fleshed out more of her origin, revealing her beginnings as an underage thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and the training she received from superhero [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted (Wildcat) Grant]].

Moving to [[New York]], Selina becomes corporate vice president then [[CEO]] of Randolf Industries, a [[mafia]]-influenced company, through [[blackmail]]. Her plans to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]] are ruined when the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] inadvertently connected Kyle to her Catwoman [[alter ego]].

[[Image:catwoman_1.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Cover to ''Catwoman v.2 #1'' (November 2001), the first issue of her current ongoing series. Pencils by [[Darwyn Cooke]].]]

Selina then returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline. As Catwoman, she assists Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city. After being arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], she escapes from prison. Later that year during the ''Officer Down'' storyline in the Batman titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect. Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story. Soon afterwards she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at #94.

Catwoman then appears in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics #759 - #762''. In a backup storyline ''Trail of the Catwoman'', by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Darwyn Cooke]], private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle. This storyline leads in to the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]). In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and [[Slam Bradley]] (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham’s East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar. This series met with critical and fan acclaim, especially for its first 25 issues {{fact}}.

During the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline (''Batman #608-#619''), Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and had a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her. At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. In the ''[[JLA]]'' story arc ''Crisis of Conscience,'' Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the League against the old [[Secret Society of Super-Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.

====Mindwiping revelations====
Catwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman true (although brash and unpredictable). However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a mindwipe by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims. Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] and Batman. Catwoman's response to this revelation is unequivocal: she pitched Zatanna out a window. (Zatanna survives the fall.) Afterwards, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.

Still unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52 (the last issue before the jump to One Year Later), Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain. The [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], in an attempt to "improve himself," threatens the most important people in Selina's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly.  (The criminal had learned Selina's identity through his earlier alliance with Selina's childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbored a grudge against Selina).  Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict ''no-kill rule,'' Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head. The issue's "teaser" for #53 implied that this may have been Selina Kyle's last act as Catwoman.

====One Year Later====
{{main|One Year Later}}
{{spoilerabout|[[52 (comics)|52]]}}
[[Image:Catwomanbaby.PNG|Selina Kyle with her child, Helena (2006). Pencils by David Lopez.|thumb|left]]

Following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the DC Universe jumps forward in time. "One Year Later" Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena (whose father is initially unknown).  Holly takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter.  (Selina's alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]''.)

Though she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena's birth. Having understandably gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now a tighter fit. In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal. Although the situation is defused through Holly's opportune arrival, the fact that there are two Catwomen active in the city is caught on video. Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado [[Film Freak]] has deduced her alias, joined with [[Angle Man]], and grabbed Helena.

After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces Zatanna to mind-wipe Film Freak and Angle Man in order to preserve her secret identity.  Following the procedure, Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage.  [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted Grant]] informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask; Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly.  Finally defeating Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that Slam Bradley has deduced that Helena is Sam Bradly's child, and therefore his granddaughter.

==Holly Robinson==
{{main|Holly Robinson (comics)}}
During the [[One Year Later]] storyline, Holly Robinson was trained by Wildcat and Selina Kyle and became the new Catwoman.

==Skills, resources and abilities==
Selina is an accomplished and gifted athlete. She was trained by the Armless Master in martial arts.

===Costume===
Catwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all, and it was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a [[bodysuit]] with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask. In the 1960s, Catwoman's bodysuit was green in color, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a skintight purple bodysuit, before switching to a black leather outfit that recalls [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s costume in ''[[Batman Returns]]''. 

In recent years, she has usually alternated between these two costumes. [[Ed Brubaker]], the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic catsuit [http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html]. It has a more [[high tech]] look, with domino-shaped [[infrared]] goggles on her cowl.

Holly currently uses the same costume Selina used prior to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

==Trade paperbacks==
''Catwoman'' Volume 4 has been collected as a number of trade paperbacks by DC Comics. In chronological order, they include:

#''The Dark End of the Street'' (#1-4 & "Trail of the Catwoman"): [[Ed Brubaker]]
#''Crooked Little Town'' (#5-10 & material from Catwoman Secret Files and Origins #1): Brubaker 
#''Relentless'' (#12-16 & material from Catwoman Secret Files and Origins #1): Brubaker
#''Wild Ride'' (#20-24): Brubaker 
#''The Replacements'': Will Pfeifer

==Non-canon appearances==
Selina Kyle appears in Frank Miller's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' four times; all are brief. First, in a phone message to Bruce ("Selina. Bruce I'm lonely"). Next, she was attacked by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who used a [[mind control]] drug to convince her to send one of her prostitutes to use the same substance on the Governor. The Joker then beats her, ties her up, gags her and dresses her in a [[Wonder Woman]] outfit, leaving her for Batman to find (with a clear clue as to where he intends to go). Selina's final appearance in the book is at Batman's funeral, where she yells at [[Superman]], telling him that she knows who killed Batman. She does not appear in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Miller's follow-up story, although she is referred to in the prologue written for the trade paperback version.

Two 1990s prose novels feature Catwoman: ''The Further Adventures of Batman: Volume 3, Featuring Catwoman'', a short story collection by various authors (publs. 1993, edited by Martin H. Greenberg), and ''Catwoman: Tiger Hunt'', by Lynn Abbey and Robert Asprin, publs. date 1992. Both novels portray a ''Batman:Year One''- influenced Catwoman who wears a gray cat costume and was once a prostitute.

Catwoman also made a small cameo in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', mostly accompanying the [[Riddler]]; she is predominantly seen, but not heard in the series. She is not dressed in costume, but appears in the very dress she first wore in ''[[Batman (comic)|Batman]] #1'' as 'The Cat'. According to the novelization by [[Elliot S! Maggin]], she ran a multibillion dollar cosmetics company.

==Adaptations in other media==
===Television: 1966 ''Batman'' series===

{{main|Batman (TV series)}}

[[Image:Jnewmarcat.jpg|thumb|right|Julie Newmar as Catwoman in the 1960s ''Batman'' television series.]]

Catwoman was at various times played by [[Julie Newmar]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] in the live-action ''Batman'' television series of the 1960s, her first other-media portrayal. [[Lee Meriwether]] portrayed her in the 1966 ''[[Batman]]'' motion picture based on the television series, when Newmar was unavailable. An uncredited fourth woman played Catwoman as part of a villain team-up in "The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra," the next to last episode of the series.

===Animation===
Catwoman has been a major character in almost all of Batman's animated series. 

Her first animated appearance was with Batman in segments of the [[1968 in television|1968]] series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' wearing her green costume of that time period. She also appeared on ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' cartoon in the 1970s. 

====Batman: The Animated Series====
{{main|Batman:The Animated Series}}

Catwoman appeared on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' wearing an all gray outfit that has never been seen outside that series. Voiced by [[Adrienne Barbeau]] in both 1992's ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and its revamp in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' (as well as the 2000s online animated series ''[[Gotham Girls]]''), Catwoman is shown to be a socialite and animal rights activist, which attracts the attention of [[Bruce Wayne]] when he's not contending with her as [[Batman]]. 

Initially Selina had blonde hair, coinciding with the release of ''[[Batman Returns]]'', in which she was played by blonde actress [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]. In the revamp, she appears to have shorter black hair. Whether her hair was dyed or her natural color was never made clear in the series itself, however in the episode "Tyger, Tyger", Selina became a cat/woman [[hybrid]] and her hair (or rather fur) was blonde. Some episodes have stated that her original color was blonde, that she dyed it black, and abandoned the regular products she used (due to animal testing) until she found some that didn't use animal testing.

In her first appearance, Catwoman steals a valuable necklace to fund the purchase of land for a mountain lion preserve, encounters Batman in the process, and finds herself undeniably attracted to him. In this moment, they develop an attraction that affects the nature of their cat and mouse relationship during the series. Afterward, by chance, Bruce Wayne dates Selina Kyle with similar results. In the midst of these budding romances, Selina learns that the land she wants has been snatched up by a suspicious cartel, lead by terrorist [[Red Claw]], who will be using the land for their staging area. Batman learns that Catwoman is getting in over her head, and together they fight and defeat the cartel, but Catwoman is arrested.

Put on probation in lieu of serving time, Catwoman joins forces with Batman again, fighting the corrupt Industrialist, [[Roland Daggett]] and [[Doctor Achilles Milo|Doctor Milo]]'s plans to spread a disease among the street animals. In [[Almost Got 'Im]], Catwoman rescues Batman from [[The Joker]] only to be kidnapped herself by [[Harley Quinn]], which forces [[Batman]] to disguise himself as [[Killer Croc]] in order to save her.

Catwoman eventually returns to thievery when [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Scarface]] hires her to steal a rare dissected tiger.  When Batgirl returns, Catwoman initially helps her investigate a stolen cat statue, but betrays Batgirl to attempt to steal the statue for herself. She is again a full time thief when she tries to seduce a fully-grown Nightwing into being her accomplice to steal merchandise from [[Enrique “El Gancho”]]. Later, in ''[[The Cult of the Cat]]'', a strange criminal cult attempts to kill her after she steals from them, bringing her to enlist Batman's aid once more.

There were plans for a second [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilogue_%28Justice_League_Unlimited_episode%29#Batman_Beyond:_Catwoman_Movie Batman Beyond DTV Movie] that would have featured Catwoman, but was rejected.[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm]

Finally, in a 7-minute short film called ''[[Chase Me]]'' (written by [[Paul Dini]] and released with the ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' [[DVD]]) [[Batman]] catches her stealing from one of [[Bruce Wayne]]’s building and apprehends her.
*Like all other characters, Catwoman would have a new design during The New Batman Adventures.  Details on her change are explored in Batman Gotham Adventures #4.[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/tnba/guides/ga/]

====The Batman====
[[Image:TBCatwoman.gif|thumb|100px|right|Catwoman, as seen in [[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]].]]
Catwoman has also appeared on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Gina Gershon]]. Her design is slightly altered, having large, almost mouse-like ears and large orange goggles that resemble cat's eyes. Another modification is her hood, which can be pulled up to hide the lower half of her face. Catwoman is also given exaggerated claws on her gloves. The rest of her suit is black, with the exception of her red "paws". She carries her whip around her waist that hangs like a tail. In her civilian identity of Selina Kyle, she has long black hair and blue eyes, instead of her more traditional green eyes. She flirts heavily with Batman, and in her first appearance stole his utility belt, accidentally gaining control of a giant bat-robot and wrecking the [[Batcave]]. Notable events involving her have been her team-up with the Penguin (even flirting with him lightly), her fight against [[Ragdoll (comics)|Ragdoll]], and her attempt to help Batman against the Joker.

===Movie: ''Batman Returns''===
{{main|Batman Returns}}
Catwoman was played by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the 1992 movie ''Batman Returns''. As recreated by [[Daniel Waters]] and [[Tim Burton]], Selina Kyle is portrayed as a lonely, frustrated woman who is (literally) pushed over the edge into obsession and crime after her boss, tycoon [[Max Shreck (Batman Returns)|Max Shreck]], tries to kill her by throwing her out of a window to keep her from revealing his plot to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity.

[[Image:Batmanreturnspostercatwoman.png|left|Movie poster for ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) featuring Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.|160px|thumb]] 

Mysteriously revived by alley cats (in a memorable Burton-esque scene) after her corrupt boss apparently kills her, her repressed rage and [[Female sexuality|sexuality]] create Catwoman, an extreme version of everything she was never allowed - by both society and herself - to be: a loveable rogue, a sexual predator and a powerful woman. She is at the same time a [[feminist]] version of Batman, defending meek "damsels in distress," but looking down on them for being helpless. She is also a [[terrorist]] of sorts, blowing up an entire floor of Shreck's department store and ultimately seeking to kill him. Accordingly with the film's interest in the [[schizophrenic]] aspects of its characters, Catwoman finds a reflection of herself in Batman. This relationship seems to be Selina's only grip on sanity as her mental state seems to deteriorate (along with her costume) throughout the movie. 

While many viewers and critics enjoyed the richness and complexity of the character, not to mention Pfeiffer's [[sex appeal]] in heavy makeup and the shiny black costume, some fans of the comic books disliked the alterations and considered not only the character but the entire film to be more Tim Burton than Batman, due to the [[macabre]] scenes depicting Catwoman. <ref>[http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_jett_returnsreview.html]</ref>

Either way, the "look" of this Catwoman was so popular that [[Warner Bros.]] had to constantly submit new Catwoman posters for various cities as many of the bus stop ads were being stolen. It soon got so bad that police officers had to patrol bus stops in order to catch perpetrators before they could break the Plexiglas containers. Today the large scale Catwoman bus ads are worth a great deal of money. <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/trivia]</ref>

===Movie: ''Catwoman''===
[[Image:Catwoman poster.jpg|thumb|right|Halle Berry as Catwoman in the 2004 film.]]{{main|Catwoman (film)}} 
In 2004, ''Catwoman'', a movie starring [[Halle Berry]], was released. This film's Catwoman bore nearly no resemblance to the comic version, other than sharing the name. In the film, Berry played Patience Phillips, a woman who eventually became Catwoman, a hero with supernatural cat-like powers, after a near-death experience. Patience had gained the powers from the goddess [[Bastet]] through a gathering of cats led by an [[Egyptian Mau]]. The movie alludes to other women in the past who have been granted such cat-like abilities. Though Phillips has the same skills as the villain version of Catwoman, the film's story has nothing to do with Batman, or Gotham City (neither of which are mentioned in the film). The film was heavily criticized by both film critics and fans of the comic book character and was a failure at the box office, losing the producers far more money than it earned. One particularly bad review came in the New York ''[[Daily News]]'', which carried the headline, "BAD KITTY!"

In the scene where Patience is told of the history of the Catwomen, she is pushed off the balcony and lands on the living room floor. Ophelia Powers then throws photos of previous catwomen down to her, and one can clearly see a picture of Pfeiffer's ''Batman Returns'' version of the character, which hints that either there is some link between Patience Phillips and Selina Kyle, or that it was done as a means of paying homage to the original character. (When that scene is described in the novelization, Selina Kyle is mentioned briefly, thus showing that there is a link.) In addition, the original "Catwoman" outfit that Patience wears when she robs a jewelry store is patterned after the "Catwoman" outfit worn by Eartha Kitt in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series. 

Berry won the 2005 [[Razzie]] award for worst actress in a film for her role as Catwoman, and collected it in person. She was only the third Razzie winner (following director [[Paul Verhoeven]], director of ''[[Showgirls]]''; and [[Tom Green]], star of ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'') ever to do so. In her speech, she apologized to the fans of the character, calling the film a "piece of shit. God-awful movie," though later she stated she would have liked to do another "Catwoman."

===Television: ''Return to the Batcave''===

In the TV movie ''[[Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt]]'', [[Julia Rose]] appeared as Catwoman and the young [[Julie Newmar]]. Both Julie Newmar and [[Lee Meriwether]] appeared in the TV movie as well.

===Television: ''Birds of Prey''===
Selina Kyle appeared briefly (and was killed off) in the first episode of the short-lived 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'', which featured Catwoman's daughter by Batman, the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]. Catwoman was portrayed by [[Maggie Baird]]. Another blond Catwoman, her costume and history appeared to be based on the ''Batman Returns'' version of the character. However, in contrast to the ''Batman Returns'' version and every Catwoman preceding her, this version was stated to be a superpowered [[metahuman]], not entirely unlike the unpopular Halle Berry incarnation that followed.

===Video Games===
Catwoman has starred in a few [[video games]] as a playable character. First she starred in 1999's ''Catwoman'' for the [[Game Boy Color]] and later in the video game adaptation of Halle Berry's ''[[Catwoman (video game)|Catwoman]]'' movie. Catwoman has also appeared as a boss in the video game adaptations of ''[[Batman Returns (video game)|Batman Returns]]'', ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[Adventures of Batman & Robin|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super NES]].

==Catwoman parodies and homages==

* One of the recurring villains in the cartoon ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' was called "Kat-nappe," and was similar to Catwoman in appearance.

* [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], is also a feline-themed thief initially seen in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and is often mistaken to be a homage or knock off of DC's Catwoman. However, comics writer [[Marv Wolfman]] originally created the character to be a female villain for the Spider-Woman series and based the character on a 1949 Tex Avery cartoon called "Bad Luck Blackie" in which a bull dog is hampered by a black cat's bad luck. The Black Cat eventually reformed (but still commits the occasional theft) and became [[Spider-Man]]'s partner and lover for a time.

* [[Mink (comics)|Mink]], appearing as a member of Marvel Comics [[Squadron Supreme]], appears to be based loosely on Catwoman. She is a part of Nighthawk's ''[[Squadron Supreme#Nighthawk's America Redeemers|America Redeemers]]''. She was an [[heiress]] who turned to life of crime for excitement.

== Trivia==
* After the events in [[52 (comics)|52]], Selina gave birth to a daughter named Helena. That name is the same as Catwoman and Batman's daughter on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth 2]] (that universe's [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]). The name is also the same as Catwoman and Batman's daughter in the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]] live-action television series as Huntress.

* In the 60s ''Batman'' television series it is revealed that Catwoman's favorite car is a ''catillac'' ([[Cadillac]]), and that she is allergic to [[dogwood]].

* In 2006, Danish toymakers [[Lego]], released a Batman Lego set featuring Catwoman ([[Lego Batman|7779 The Batman™ Dragster: Catwoman™ Pursuit]]).
