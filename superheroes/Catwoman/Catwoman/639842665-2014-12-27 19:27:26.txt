'''Catwoman''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] associated with [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]] [[media franchise|franchise]]. Historically a [[supervillainess]] and often an [[antiheroine]], the character was created by [[Bob Kane]] and [[Bill Finger]], partially inspired by Kane's cousin, Ruth Steel,<ref>{{Cite book | title=Batman and Me | last=Kane | first=Bob | authorlink=Bob Kane | date=November 1989 | location=Foestfille, [[California]] | publisher=Eclipse Books | isbn=978-1-56060-016-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Steel|first=Ruth|title=Ruth Steel Interview (Age 96)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HfIuUKpTPU#t=7m55s|work=Video|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref> as well as actress [[Jean Harlow]]. The original and most widely known Catwoman, '''Selina Kyle''', first appears in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #1 (Spring [[1940 in comics|1940]]) in which she is known as '''The Cat'''. She is usually depicted as an adversary of Batman, known for having a complex love-hate relationship with him. In her first appearance, she was a [[whip]]-carrying [[burglary|burglar]] with a taste for high-stake thefts.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | authorlink=Scott Beatty | contribution=Catwoman | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=74–75 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> For many years Catwoman thrived, but from September 1954 to November 1966 she took an extended hiatus due to the newly developing [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954. These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code. Since the 1990s, Catwoman has been featured in an eponymous series that cast her as an antiheroine rather than a traditional villain. The character has been one of Batman's most enduring love interests.

A popular figure, Catwoman has been featured in most [[Mass media|media]] adaptations related to Batman. Actresses [[Julie Newmar]], [[Lee Meriwether]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] introduced her to a large audience on the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and the 1966 ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' motion picture. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] portrayed the character in 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]''. [[Halle Berry]] starred in a stand-alone Catwoman film, 2004's ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'', which was a box-office flop, and bears little to no resemblance to the Batman character. [[Anne Hathaway]] portrayed Selina Kyle in the 2012 film ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' and, most recently, a young version of Kyle is played by [[Camren Bicondova]] on the 2014 television series, ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''.

Catwoman was ranked 11th on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time" list,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/11.html| title=Catwoman is Number 11 | work=[[IGN]] | year=2009}}</ref> and 51st on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>''Wizard'' #177 (July 2006). p. 88.</ref> Conversely, she was ranked 20th on IGN's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time" list,<ref>{{cite web|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/20|publisher=IGN}}</ref> as well as 23rd in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 23| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==Character and publication history==

===Creation===
Batman's creator, Bob Kane, was a great movie fan and his love for film provided the impetus for several Batman characters, among them, Catwoman. She was partially inspired by 1930s film star [[Jean Harlow]] who at Kane's then-early and "impressionable age&nbsp;... seemed to personify feminine pulchritude at its most sensuous." Kane and Finger wanted to give their comic book [[sex appeal]], as well as a character who could appeal to female readers; they thus created a "friendly foe who committed crimes but was also a romantic interest in Batman's rather sterile life."<ref>Kane 1989, pp. 107.</ref> Catwoman was meant to be a love interest and to engage Batman in a chess game, with him trying to reform her. At the same time, this character was meant to be different from other Batman villains like the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in that she was never a killer or evil.

As for using cat imagery with their Catwoman, Kane states he and Finger saw cats as "kind of the antithesis of bats."<ref>Kane 1989, pp. 108.</ref>

{{
centered pull quote|I felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are cool, detached, and unreliable. I felt much warmer with dogs around me—cats are as hard to understand as women are. Men feel more sure of themselves with a male friend than a woman. You always need to keep women at arm's length. We don't want anyone taking over our souls, and women have a habit of doing that. So there's a love-resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I'm being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel that I've had better relationships with male friends than women. With women, once the romance is over, somehow they never remain my friends.

===Golden and Silver Age versions===
[[File:Catwoman-batman01.jpg|Selina Kyle's first appearance as The Cat in ''Batman'' #1 (Spring 1940).|thumb|right]]
Catwoman, then called "the Cat", first appeared in ''Batman'' #1<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 31|quote = The first issue of Batman's self-titled comic written by Bill Finger and drawn by Bob Kane, represented a milestone in more ways than one.

Although the story does not have her wearing her [[icon]]ic cat-suit, it establishes her core personality as a [[femme fatale]] who both antagonizes and attracts Batman. It is implied Batman may have deliberately let her get away, by blocking Robin as he tried to leap after her. She next appears in ''Batman'' #2 in a story also involving the Joker but escapes Batman in the end. In ''Batman'' #3 she wears a fur mask and again succeeds in escaping Batman.

''Batman'' #62 (December/January 1950) revealed that Catwoman is an [[amnesiac]] [[flight attendant]] who had turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived. She reveals this after being hit on the head by a piece of rubble while saving Batman while he was chasing her. Although, in issue 197 of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'', she admits that she made up the amnesia story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime. She reforms for several years, helping out Batman in ''Batman'' #65 (June/July 1951) and #69 (February/March 1952), until she decides to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #203 (January 1954), after a newspaper decides to publish stories of Batman's past adventures, and some crooks mock her about it. However in this story when Batman prevents a robbery and is knocked out by sleeping gas, Catwoman prevents her thugs from murdering him, though quickly claims she wants him as a hostage. Catwoman appears again as a criminal in ''Batman'' #84 (June 1954) and ''Detective Comics'' #211 (September 1954) for her final appearance until 1966. This was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing [[Comics Code Authority]]'s rules for portrayal of female characters that started in 1954.

In the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters) reveal that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (after the events of ''Batman'' #69) and had married Bruce Wayne; soon afterward, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]]). ''The Brave and the Bold'' #197 (April 1983) elaborates upon the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman'' #62, after Selina reveals that she never suffered from amnesia. It is revealed that Selina Kyle had been in an [[domestic violence|abusive]] marriage, and eventually decides to leave her husband. However, her husband keeps her jewelry in his private vault, and she has to break into it to retrieve it. Selina enjoys this experience so much she decides to become a professional costumed [[burglary|cat burglar]], and thus begins a career that repeatedly leads to her encountering Batman.

The Earth-Two/Golden Age Selina Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being [[blackmail]]ed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman, as shown in ''DC Super-Stars'' #17 (November/December 1977).

Catwoman made her first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] appearance in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #70 (November 1966); afterward, she continued to make appearances across the various ''Batman'' comics.

Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing [[murder]], something that neither the Earth-One nor Earth-Two versions of her would ever do. This version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-B]], an alternate [[Earth]] that included stories that could not be considered [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] on Earth-One or Earth-Two.<ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Index'' (March 1986)</ref><ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Cross-Over Index'' (July 1986)</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/04/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-171/ | last=Cronin | first=Brian | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #171 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 4, 2008}}</ref>

===Modern Age version===

====Tangled origins====
Catwoman's origin—and, to an extent, her character—was revised in 1987 when writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] published ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman's origin. She works as a [[dominatrix]] in order to survive and wants to break away from her abusive [[pimp]] (and former boyfriend). She witnesses his crimes and, because of an event that occurs to her sister, fears for her sister's life and begins to study self-defense and [[martial arts]]. Her teacher inspires Selina to become more than what she has been and she realizes that prostitution is no life for her, or for Holly.

[[Holly Robinson (fictional character)|Holly Robinson]] is a young runaway who idolizes Selina, but is much too young to be on the streets as far as Selina is concerned. Selina shares her home with Holly after she takes her in. As the story progresses Selina is led to a bit of burglary, she dons a catsuit costume that her now former pimp gave to her the day that she told him she was out of the business. After costuming herself so as not to be revealed, she gets a taste for burglary and begins to do it in more of a Robin Hood way than an actual thief. This is, however, how she runs into Batman. After a small confrontation, she begins to be inspired to stay in her costume and become the "Catwoman" after seeing Batman in action with others. Selina gets the idea that, if there is a "bat", why can there not be a "cat"?

The 1989 ''Catwoman'' limited series, written by [[Mindy Newell]] and with art by J.J. Birch, expanded upon Miller's ''Year One'' origin. This storyline, known as "Her Sister's Keeper", explores Selina's early life as a dominatrix and the start of her career as Catwoman. The story culminates with Selina's former pimp, Stan, abducting and violently abusing her sister Maggie, who, in contrast to Selina, is a [[nun]]. Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and gets away with it. Most of this is revealed in the former series, but is expanded upon in "Her Sister's Keeper".

''Catwoman'' (vol. 2) #69, which provides details about Selina's childhood, neglects Maggie's existence. Maria Kyle is a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats, and commits [[suicide]] when Selina is very young. Her [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] father, Brian, is cold to Selina for resembling her mother (whom he resents for dying), and eventually drinks himself to death. To survive, Selina takes to the streets for a time before getting caught and sent first to an [[orphanage]], then [[youth detention center|juvenile hall]],<ref name="Catwoman v1 0">''Catwoman'' (vol. 1) #0</ref> "where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be."<ref>''Catwoman: Secret Files and Origins''</ref> Maggie's fate at this point in the time-line is not alluded to. However, when [[Ed Brubaker]] reintroduces her into the comic, he implies that Maggie may have directly entered an orphanage and promptly been [[adoption|adopted]].

When she is 13, Selina discovers that the hall's administrator has been [[embezzlement|embezzling]] funds, and she confronts her. In an attempt to cover up her crime, the administrator puts Selina in a bag and drops her in a river to drown (like a cat). She escapes and returns to the orphanage, where she steals documents exposing the administrator's corruption. She uses these to blackmail the administrator into erasing "Selina Kyle" from the city's records, then steals the administrator's diamond necklace and escapes the orphanage.<ref name="Catwoman v1 0"/> Selina eventually finds herself in "Alleytown - a network of cobblestone streets that form a small borough between the East End and Old [[Gotham City|Gotham]]."<ref>''Catwoman'' (vol. 2) #12</ref> Selina is taken in by Mama Fortuna, the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and is taught how to steal. Fortuna treats her students like [[slavery|slaves]], keeping their earnings for herself. Selina eventually runs away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia. However, the two have difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation try to support themselves by working as prostitutes. The two drift apart afterward, with Sylvia coming to resent Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.

In the ''Catwoman: Year One'' story,<ref>''Catwoman'' Annual #2 (1995)</ref> Selina (now an adult) achieves some success as a thief. Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepts an offer to "lie low" as a dominatrix in the employ of a pimp named Stan. They plan to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes. According to this storyline, Selina trains under the Armless Master of Gotham City, receiving education in martial arts and culture. During this time, a client gives her a [[cat o' nine tails]], which Selina kept as a trophy.

''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implies that Catwoman suspects she is the illegitimate daughter of [[mafia]] boss [[Carmine Falcone]], although she finds no definitive proof. Selina's connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]''. Though the story adds more [[circumstantial evidence]] to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, establishing that the Falcones' secondborn daughter was put up for adoption in America, it also supplies no definitive proof. During ''The Long Halloween'', Selina (out of costume) develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne, even leading her to save Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, this relationship appears to end on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. She leaves him for good and also leaves Gotham for a while in ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', after he stands her up on two holidays. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina.

Catwoman also appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' saga, where she is approached by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s henchmen while robbing a house. Bane asks her to work for him, but she refuses, as she is repulsed by the criminal who "broke" Batman. Later in the story, she boards a plane with [[Bruce Wayne]] to fly to [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]]. She next appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall#"Knightquest"|Batman: Knightquest]]'' saga, where [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] is masquerading as Batman. She is one of the few to recognize that Batman is an impostor, later being present when the true Batman returns to the fold as he struggles against his successor, his willingness to save even criminals confirming his true identity for Selina.

====''Catwoman'', the series====
In 1993, Catwoman was given her first ongoing comic book series. This series, written by an assortment of writers, but primarily penciled by [[Jim Balent]],<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Dolan, p. 260: "Selina Kyle finally stole the spotlight in her first ongoing series by writer Jo Duffy and artist Jim Balent."</ref> generally depicted the character as an international thief (and occasional [[bounty hunter]]) with an ambiguous [[Moral core|moral code]].

Story-lines include her adoption of teenage [[runaway youth|runaway]], and erstwhile sidekick, Arizona; aiding Bane, whom she later betrays to [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]; and a stint as a reluctant government operative. The series also fleshes out more of her origin, revealing her beginnings as a young thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and her training with [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted "Wildcat" Grant]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Moving to [[New York]], Selina becomes corporate vice president then [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Randolf Industries, a mafia-influenced company, through blackmail. She plans to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City]], but her hopes are dashed when the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] inadvertently connects her to her criminal [[alter ego]].

Selina then returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline. As Catwoman, she assists Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city. After being arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], she escapes from prison. Later that year, during the "Officer Down" storyline in the ''Batman'' titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect. Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story. Soon afterward, she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at issue #94.

Catwoman then appears in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics'' #759-762 (August – November 2001). In the backup storyline "Trail of the Catwoman", by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke, private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle. This storyline leads in to the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]). In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and Slam Bradley (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham's East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar.

During the ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' storyline, Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and have a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her. At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the [[Riddler]] and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. This is the second story to establish that she knows Batman's true identity. In an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship. The concluding story features a closing panel in which she refers to Batman as "Bruce". A change in the editorial team at that point, however, brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.

In the ''[[Justice League]]'' story arc "Crisis of Conscience", Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the Justice League against the old [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.

====Mindwiping revelations====
Catwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman true (although brash and unpredictable). However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a [[mindwipe]] by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims. Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback, it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and Batman. Catwoman's response to this revelation is unequivocal: she duct-tapes Zatanna's mouth shut and pitches her out a window (Zatanna survives the fall). Afterward, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.

Still unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52, Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain. The [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], in an attempt to "improve himself," threatens the most important people in Selina's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly. The villain had also previously [[torture]]d Selina's sister Maggie by drilling out her husband's eyeballs and feeding them to Maggie, which drove her insane. Black Mask learns Selina's identity through his earlier alliance with Selina's childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbors a grudge against Selina. Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head.<ref name="dc-ency"/> This action continues to haunt her throughout the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, and it is suggested that this might have been the first time she had ever directly taken a life.

====As a mother====
Following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the [[DC Universe]] jumps forward in time. After ''One Year later'', Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, she has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena. The father of her new daughter is initially unrevealed; however, Batman demonstrates great concern for the child and at one point asks to have Helena stay at his mansion. Selina attempts to live a safe and somewhat normal life, and gives up her more dangerous ways of living as Catwoman. Holly Robinson takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter (Selina's alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'').<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Though she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena's birth. Having understandably gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now tighter. In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal. Although the situation is defused through Holly's opportune arrival, the sight of two Catwomen active simultaneously in the city is caught on video. Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado [[Film Freak]] has deduced her alias, joined with [[Angle Man]], and grabbed Helena. After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces [[Zatanna]] to mind-wipe Film Freak and Angle Man in order to preserve her secret identity. Following the procedure, Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage.

A twist occurs when Wildcat informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask. Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly. Finally defeating Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that Bradley has deduced that Helena is the daughter of his son Sam Bradley, Jr., and therefore his granddaughter (although it is still strongly hinted that Bruce Wayne may be the father).

Batman asks Catwoman to infiltrate the violent tribe of the [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana Amazons]] during the ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' crossover. Posing as a criminal, Selina gains the Bana's trust and thwarts a terror attack aimed at causing mass casualties in Gotham City.

Selina questions whether she should be raising a daughter when her life as Catwoman has already proven to be such a danger to the child. After enlisting Batman's help in faking the death of both herself and her daughter, Selina puts Helena up for adoption. A month after Helena is placed with a new family, Catwoman asks Zatanna to erase her memories of Helena and change her mind back to a criminal mentality. Zatanna refuses, judging that such an act would be cruel to both mother and daughter. She tells Selina that she could never reverse Selina's mindset, since she was on the path to becoming a hero on her own. Believing she can no longer function as a criminal, Selina decided to become one of Batman's [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> She quickly quits, however, and was replaced by [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]].

====''Salvation Run''====
In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #2, Catwoman is sent to the Prison Planet. She allies herself with [[Lex Luthor]] in an attempt to return to Earth, and mistakenly ends up on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]-Earth where Catwoman is a notorious villain. It is later revealed that this Earth is a creation of her own mind, and she has not left Prison Planet. When accused of being a traitor by Luthor, she reveals [[Martian Manhunter]] is posing as [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], which would soon lead to the hero's death.

Using the trust she regained in Luthor's eyes, she earns a passage to the "real" Earth, in a jerry-rigged teleport machine built by Luthor for letting the villains escape. On Earth, she resumes being a hero, with occasional lapses into thievery by commission, simply for the thrill of it.

The current volume of ''Catwoman'' concluded with issue #82, and details a cat-and-mouse chase between Batman and Catwoman across Gotham City rooftops, ending with Selina stealing the [[Batmobile]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xrayspex.blogspot.com/2008/04/well-heh-heh-this-is-little.html | last=Pfeifer | first=Will | title=Well, heh heh&nbsp;... this is a little embarrassing | work=X-Ray Spex | date=April 15, 2008}}</ref>

====Heart of Hush====
Later, as in ''Detective Comics'', she is quite uncertain if she should pursue her "relationship" with Batman, Selina talks with Bruce about [[List of Batman supporting characters#Bruce Wayne's love interests|Jezebel Jet]], his current girlfriend, and then has a quick pep talk with Zatanna, whom she believes is also courting Bruce. Zatanna confirms and admits her feelings, adding that she has since chosen to forget them, but extremely encourages Selina to open her heart to Bruce Wayne before Jet is able to "seal the deal." [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] eavesdrops on the conversation, targeting both women as a way to hurt his enemy, Bruce Wayne.

In ''Detective Comics'' #848 (November 2008), Hush attacks Selina as she is in her apartment, kidnapping her and surgically removing her heart. She is delivered anonymously to a Gotham hospital. Batman receives word of her situation, and while he goes in search of Hush, he leaves Selina in the care of [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], who is considered the superhero community's chief doctor.

Batman recovers her heart, and Dr. Mid-Nite restores it to her body; however, the doctor also makes a prognosis on whether she can still return to her former life swinging through rooftops. While Selina is still in a [[coma]], she encounters Zatanna, who apologizes for not warning her about Hush. She tells Selina that she was so happy about her relationship with Bruce that she ignored the other warnings in the cards. Zatanna gives her a little bottle supposedly containing [[aloe vera]] for her post-op scars. It is hinted that there is a little magic in there to help Selina with her recovery. Selina is sad that she might end up alone again. In the meantime, Bruce enters the recovery room and, believing her unconscious, launches into a soliloquy. He ends by telling Selina that he will always love her, when she opens her eyes and reveals to him that she was awake all the time and heard his confession.

====''Batman R.I.P.''====
During the events of ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', Selina and Bruce's romance lasts only for a night because Bruce must continue to pose as Jezebel's lover to bring down the Black Glove. While still recuperating, she pulls off one more heist and exacts her revenge on Hush. With the help of a few allies on both sides; [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], Holly Robinson, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], and Slam Bradley, Selina taps into Hush's assets, leaving him penniless and suffering from wounds inflicted by Batman.

====''Battle for the Cowl''====
In ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Selina is seen as one of the members of [[Nightwing]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s contingency team known as "The Network", where she is seen taking down a gang of thugs before seeing [[Tim Drake]] dressed in a Batman uniform and is initially taken by surprise.

====''Batman: Reborn'' and ''Gotham City Sirens''====
In the first issue of ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'', Selina runs into Bonebuster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, and is saved by Poison Ivy. Selina, fearing the many dangers of a post-Batman Gotham, proposes that she, Ivy, and Harley Quinn team up, living together at a single base in an abandoned animal shelter. Ivy agrees under one condition: using home-grown drugs to weaken Selina's resistance, Ivy demands the identity of the true Batman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #1 (June 2009)</ref> Selina flashes back three years to when [[Talia al Ghul]] requested her presence in [[Tibet]]. There, Talia made it so that Selina would not relinquish the true identity of Batman under any circumstances. After the interrogation is over, Selina sees Harley with Bruce Wayne on TV. Selina tells Ivy that she knows it is Hush in disguise.

====''Blackest Night''====
During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Selina is attacked by Black Mask after he has been reborn as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. After he tells her that he plans on getting an emotional response before killing her, Selina steals a car and heads to the mental institution where Maggie is held, believing Black Mask is coming for her. Black Mask attacks the institution, and somehow awakens Maggie from her coma. Selina arrives in time to help her sister flee into the sewers. While on the run, Maggie angrily tells Selina that she ruined both of their lives the day she decided to become Catwoman. Devastated by her sister's statement, Selina fails to realize they have both been heading for a trap. Just as Black Mask is about to gouge Maggie's eyes out and shove them down Selina's throat, Harley and Ivy arrive and defeat the Black Lantern by trapping him in the stomach of a man-eating plant. Selina is helped to her feet by her friends, who tell her that Maggie has fled the scene. The next day, the staff members of the mental institution are shown discussing Maggie's escape, also mentioning that a nun that works at the hospital had been found beaten and stripped of her uniform. Maggie is then shown in the depths of the Gotham City sewers clad in the bloodied nun robes, muttering about her plan to kill Catwoman in order to free Selina's soul.<ref>''Catwoman'' #83 (March 2010)</ref> Now calling herself Sister Zero, Maggie attempts to kill Selina, but ultimately flees after being defeated by the Sirens. She is last seen going over her options, now realizing that she cannot murder her own sister, and therefore must personally exorcise the "cat demon" from within Selina's body.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #12-13 (July – August 2010)</ref>

====''The Return of Bruce Wayne''====
[[File:Catwoman&Catgirl.jpg|thumb|Selina with her then-sidekick, Catgirl (2010). Pencils by Tony Daniel.]]
In the build-up to ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne|The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'', the Sirens help Zatanna put out a massive fire at a local park near their home, only for them to be ambushed by a creature made of mud. After being dragged underneath the soil by the creature, Catwoman awakens tied up and gagged on the floor of a dark room, and is quickly forced into an illusion by her unseen captors. Back in reality, Talia reveals to the Sirens that just a few hours prior, an unknown benefactor had offered up a massive reward to whoever could kidnap and deliver Catwoman to him, with the hopes that he could penetrate her mind and learn Batman's secret identity.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #16 (November 2010)</ref> Before the knowledge can be ripped from her mind, Selina's captors (revealed to be [[Shrike (comics)|Shrike]] and a new villain named Sempai), are eventually defeated by the other Sirens. Once Selina is freed, Talia orders Zatanna to wipe Bruce's identity from her memory, reasoning that her kidnapping has proved that the knowledge is too dangerous for her to handle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #17 (December 2010)</ref> The two women initially restrain Selina and attempt to remove the knowledge from her, but Zatanna refuses at the last moment and ends up fighting Talia in order to protect Selina.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #18</ref> Talia tries to kill Selina before vanishing, but she survives and ultimately reunites with Bruce, who had recently returned to the present.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #19</ref>

After stealing the contents of a safe belonging to the Falcone crime family, Selina returns home to find [[Kitrina Falcone|Kitrina]], a teenaged escape artist and Carmine Falcone's long lost daughter, breaking into her room. She attacks and subdues Kirtrina, who tells Selina that she had unknowingly stolen a map that details the location of the new Black Mask's underground bunker. Realizing that she could use the map to capture Black Mask and claim the 50 million dollar bounty on his head, Selina leaves Kitrina bound in a locked room so that she can keep the map for herself.<ref>''Batman'' #695</ref> She later calls Batman to her house in order to turn the would-be thief over to the police, but discovers that Kitrina had managed to free herself and steal back the map. This impresses Selina, who mentions that she had tied up the child using an "inescapable" knot that Bruce had shown her years earlier.<ref>''Batman'' #696</ref> Following a massive battle with Black Mask and his henchmen (which ends with neither woman being able to claim the bounty), Selina agrees to take on Kitrina as her new sidekick, [[Kitrina Falcone|Catgirl]].<ref>''Batman'' #697</ref><ref>''Batman'' #704</ref> Once Bruce Wayne returns from his time in the past, he establishes [[Batman Incorporated]], a global team of Batmen.

After defeating Harley and the Joker, Catwoman tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, this after Ivy drugged her in an attempt to uncover Batman's identity.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011)</ref> Shortly after this, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn have escaped and set off to pursue revenge on Catwoman for leaving them behind.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011)</ref> The two of them found Catwoman and fought her.

[[File:CatwomanNew52.jpg|thumb|Catwoman as she appears on the cover of ''Catwoman'' #1 (September 2011). Art by Guillem March.]]
===The New 52===

In September 2011, DC Comics relaunched all titles, deemed [[The New 52]], which rebooted the DC Universe continuity. Catwoman's monthly title now focused on Selina's earlier days as Catwoman, but not her origins. The series begins with Selina frantically escaping from unknown masked men who are invading her apartment. After flitting from rooftop to rooftop, Selina looks back just in time to see her apartment blown apart by explosives. She turns to her informant, Lola, who often supplies Catwoman with information and various jobs. In this instance, Lola tips Selina off to an unoccupied penthouse where Selina can lay low for a few weeks, as well as a job stealing a painting from Russian mobsters. For this job, Selina infiltrates a Russian club by posing as the bartender. There, she recognizes a man from her past, who murdered her friend as a teenager, and Selina quickly takes her revenge. Once her cover is blown, Selina dons her Catwoman outfit and fights her way out of the club, making quick work of the Russians. Back at the penthouse, Batman visits concerned about Selina's well being. It is revealed through Selina's inner monologue that she and Batman have had sexual encounters with one another before, and the premiere issue ends with yet another of these encounters, the first explicit sex scene between Catwoman and Batman.<ref>''Catwoman'' #1 (September 2011)</ref> Her revised origin in ''Catwoman'' #0 draws from ''[[Batman Returns]]''.

Catwoman is later confronted by [[Steve Trevor]], who offers her a spot on [[Amanda Waller]]'s new [[Justice League of America]]. Selina initially refuses, but accepts the offer after Trevor promises to help her track down a woman who has apparently been posing as Selina.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> It is later revealed that Catwoman was chosen specifically to take down Batman should the JLA ever need to defeat the original Justice League.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 3 #2</ref> The teams eventually come into conflict in the publisher's "[[Trinity War]]" crossover.

In the alternate universe [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]] continuity, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne have married, and their daughter, Helena Wayne, is that universe's [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. There is initial animosity between her parents over Helena's forays, but either Selina has reformed or was never a supervillain in Earth 2's universe. It is revealed in issue #0 of ''[[Worlds' Finest]]'' that this Selina was killed while trying to stop what she believed was a human-trafficking ring, thus showing she had become a hero.

==Relationship with Batman==
[[File:Catwoman1-page.jpg|thumb|Catwoman and Batman are shown having a sexual encounter in ''Catwoman'' #1 (2011). Art by Guillem March.]]
While Catwoman has been historically portrayed as a supervillainess, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic relationship. Batman has had many romantic relationships with female characters throughout the years, but while these relationships tend to be short, Batman's attraction to Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear.

After the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211). They have a daughter named [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]]) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.

In an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as "Bruce". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.

Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (out of costume) develop a relationship during ''The Long Halloween''. The story sees Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while.

When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, ''Hush'' sees Batman and Catwoman teaming up against as allies against the entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]] and rekindling their romantic relationship. In ''Hush'', Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.

Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop in ''Catwoman'' #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have had an ongoing sexual relationship.<ref>''Catwoman'' #1 (September 2011)</ref>

==Equipment==

===Weapons===
During the Silver Age, Catwoman, like most ''Batman'' villains, used a variety of themed weapons, vehicles, and equipment, such as a custom cat-themed car called the "Cat-illac". This usage also appeared in the 1960s ''Batman'' television series. In her post-''Crisis'' appearances, Catwoman's favored weapon is a whip. She wields both a standard bullwhip and the cat o' nine tails with expert proficiency. She uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use, and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation. She can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her. She uses [[caltrop]]s as an anti-personnel weapon and [[bolas]] to entangle opponents at a distance. In addition, Catwoman has been shown to have various items to restrain her victims, such rope for binding hands and feet, and a roll of [[duct tape]] used to [[gag]] her targets, like she did with Robin, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and various victims during her robberies over the years. . Although, eventually Wonder Woman heard his muffled cries of help and rescued him.  Often, especially in the TV series, she uses sleeping gas or knockout darts to subdue victims. Catwoman's attractiveness and feminine wiles have also allowed her to take advantage of male opponents.

===Costume===
Catwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all. It was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a [[catsuit]] with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask.

In the 1960s, Catwoman's catsuit was green in color, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a skintight purple catsuit, before switching to a black PVC catsuit that recalls [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s costume in ''Batman Returns'' (except not stitched together).

In recent years, artists' depictions have usually alternated between those two costumes. Ed Brubaker, the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic leather catsuit in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' television series.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Man Behind The Cat - Exclusive Interview with Ed Brubaker | url=http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html | accessdate=June 10, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050528170818/http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html|archivedate=May 28, 2005}}</ref> It has a more [[high tech]] look, with domino-shaped [[Thermography|infrared goggles]] on her cowl.

Many of her costumes have incorporated retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and sometimes on the toes of her boots. On rare occasions, she has also sported a cat's tail.

Holly Robinson uses the same costume Selina used prior to ''Infinite Crisis''.

==Other versions==

===''The Dark Knight Returns''===
Selina Kyle appears as an aging and somewhat overweight [[madam]]e in Frank Miller's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' four times; all are brief. First, in a phone message to Bruce ("Selina. Bruce, I'm lonely"). Next, she is attacked by the Joker, who uses a [[mind control]] drug to convince her to send one of her prostitutes to use the same substance on a Governor.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'' #4</ref> The Joker then beats her, ties her up, gags her, and dresses her in a [[Wonder Woman]] outfit, leaving her for Batman to find. Selina's final appearance in the book is at Bruce Wayne's funeral, where she yells at [[Superman]], telling him that she knows who killed Bruce.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> She does not appear in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Miller's follow-up story, although she is referred to in the prologue written for the trade paperback version, although in the book, [[Carrie Kelly]]'s moniker of "Catgirl" is a homage to Catwoman.

===Prose novels===
Two 1990s prose novels feature Catwoman: ''The Further Adventures of Batman: Volume 3, Featuring Catwoman'',<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Further Adventures of Batman: Vol. 3, Featuring Catwoman | editor-last=Greenberg | editor-first=Martin H. | publisher=[[Bantam Books]] | date=February 1993 | isbn=978-0-553-56069-5}}</ref> a short story collection by various authors, and ''Catwoman: Tiger Hunt''.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Catwoman: Tiger Hunt | publisher=[[Warner Books]] | date=September 1992 | isbn=978-0-446-36043-2 | last1=Abbey | first1=Lynn | last2=Asprin | first2=Robert}}</ref> Both novels portray a ''Batman: Year One''-influenced Catwoman who wears a gray cat costume and was once a prostitute.

===''Kingdom Come''===
Catwoman also made a small cameo in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', mostly accompanying the Riddler; she is predominantly seen, but not much heard in the series. She is not dressed in costume, but appears in the very dress she first wore in ''Batman'' #1 as The Cat. According to the novelization by [[Elliot S. Maggin]], she runs a multibillion dollar cosmetics company. An armored, metahuman successor called "Catwoman II" is also featured in the story as one of the "new heroes" who follow the new "[[Man of tomorrow]]" [[Magog (comics)|Magog]]'s anti-heroic, violent example.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #3</ref>

Setting out to learn as much about Batman and his enemies as she can, Gata becomes the new Catwoman. Near the end of the story, Gata and her followers face off against Batman, but the two later fall in love, and Maria Romero, also known as Madame X, tells Sheila that she is really a [[cloning|clone]] of Maria. Maria confesses that she had planned to transfer her brain into Gata's body, but she could not bring herself to do it because she loved her "daughter" too much. Maria then dies in Sheila's arms.

As they fight together, Batman finds that Selina's selfless love for him allows him to control his thirst for blood that had begun to consume him. She sacrifices herself to save him from the Joker, who had become the leader of the remaining vampires after Dracula's death, taking a crossbow bolt to the heart that the Joker had fired at Batman. Batman's grief and rage over her death causes him to finally lose control of his bloodlust as he drinks the Joker's blood.

====''Birds of Prey''====
The 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' included an adaptation of the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] as one of its main characters. Catwoman was also adapted for the series as she is an integral component of the back story for Huntress. That adaptation was limited to the alter ego, a costume design similar to the one used in the 1992 film ''[[Batman Returns]]'', and adding the aspect of the character being a "[[metahuman]]". Catwoman was portrayed by actress Maggie Baird and her appearances were limited to a flashback of her death which was edited into the series title sequence and the rare in-episode flashback.

====''Gotham''====
[[File:Camren Bicondova Catwoman Gotham.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Camren Bicondova]] as Selina Kyle in the FOX TV show ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''.]]
Selina Kyle is featured in the TV series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by [[Camren Bicondova]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/what-we-learned-from-the-script-for-gothams-first-epi-1530515272|title=What We Learned from the Script for Gotham's First Episode|last=Bricken|first=Rob|work=io9|date=February 25, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Selina Kyle is depicted as a 14-year-old thief, nicknamed "Cat", who lives on the streets of Gotham City. In the series' pilot episode, she witnesses the murders of [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]]. Throughout the series, she forms a tenuous alliance with [[Gotham City Police Department]] Detective [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], promising to help him solve the Wayne murders if he helps her get out of trouble with the law. Gordon arranges for her to stay at [[Wayne Manor]], where she befriends the young Bruce Wayne. She saves him from a gang of hired killers, and gives him his first kiss.

===Television (animated)===
====Filmation series====
Catwoman was first adapted to television animation by [[Filmation]], for the 1968 series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]''. The character design and aspects adapted were similar to those used in the previous live-action television series — a focus on the character in costume, lack of a backstory and use of the then-current green catsuit. Like the live action TV series, Catwoman behaved like many of her villainous counterparts (Joker, Riddler), by speaking in puns and hiring henchmen who wore outfits similar to hers. [[Jane Webb]] was cast to provide the voice for the character.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Filmation returned to the character in 1977 for the animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', where [[Melendy Britt]] was cast to voice the character in four episodes.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Again, no backstory or alter ego were presented within the episodes. The yellow and orange costume design used was unique to the series.

====DC animated universe====
[[File:Catwoman BTAS.jpg|thumb|upright|Catwoman and Isis, as seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
Catwoman was adapted for animated series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and would also appear in the series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' and the short featurette ''[[Chase Me]]'', set in the same continuity from the [[DC Animated Universe]]. In the two animated series, the character was voiced by [[Adrienne Barbeau]].<ref>Based on the credits of the episodes featuring Catwoman's appearances since they specifically list Adrienne Barbeau as the actor providing the character's voice.</ref> The character design for ''Batman: The Animated Series'' was as a long-haired blonde look (based on [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s appearance when she played Selina in [[Batman Returns]]) when Selina wasn't wearing her costume, and the costume itself was a predominately gray catsuit based on the costume used in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' as well, and with long black gloves and high-heeled boots. When ''The New Batman Adventures'' went into development, the characters were redesigned. In the case of Catwoman this resulted in an all-black catsuit, blue-white face make-up and short black hair. The first series establishes Catwoman as a socialite and [[animal rights]] activist in addition to a costumed thief in the early appearances. Beyond this, no backstory or actual origin is provided within the series. The series does play somewhat on the relation between Batman and Catwoman. She had a crush on Batman, but tried to keep her distance between her and Bruce Wayne, who had asked her out (as Selina Kyle).

====''The Batman''====
[[File:TBCatwoman.png|thumb|left|upright|Catwoman, as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Catwoman was adapted along with a number of other Batman related characters for the 2004 animated series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Gina Gershon]]. The character design used was based loosely on the then-current costume used in the comic books. This resulted in a black/dark grey catsuit with a pull-up collar mask, dark red, claw-tipped gloves, a black cowl with exaggerated cat ears, and large amber goggles. The initial episode featuring Catwoman establishes her as working as a charity fund raiser in her identity of Selina Kyle. With the remaining appearances focusing on her activities only as Catwoman, an origin for the character is never provided.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
For the 2008 animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', Catwoman was among the many DC Comics characters adapted for the series voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]. Keeping with the tone of the show, the character design used for most of her appearances was drawn from the 1950s through mid-1960s and again from the late 1970 to the mid-1980s. This being the purple long sleeved dress with green cloak and purple headdress/mask with cat-ears.

====''DC Nation''====
Catwoman appeared in the ''Batman of Shanghai'' shorts on the [[DC Nation Shorts|DC Nation]] block voiced by [[Stephanie Sheh]]. In a departure from the comics, she was portrayed as a Chinese thief active in [[Shanghai]] during the 1930s.

===Film (live-action)===

====''Batman'' (1966)====
[[File:Catwoman.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lee Meriweather]] in ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966).]]
The first feature film to include an adaptation of Catwoman was ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'', produced immediately after production of the first season of the [[Batman (TV series)|1966 television series of the same name]]. When the producers realized that Julie Newmar would be unavailable due to prior commitments, they cast [[Lee Meriwether]] to portray the character.<ref name=1966Cast/>

''[[Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt]]'', a television film which aired in 2003, was a semi-documentary of the production of the 1966 television series and film. It featured dramatizations one of which included [[Julia Rose]] portraying a young Julie Newmar on set in character as Catwoman. Newmar and Meriwether also appeared in the film.<ref>{{cite news

====''Batman Returns'' (1992)====
[[File:PfeifferCatwoman.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Catwoman in ''[[Batman Returns]]''.]]
Catwoman is portrayed by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the 1992 feature film ''[[Batman Returns]]''. Re-created by [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]], the character is based on the Selina Kyle from "''Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper''". [[Annette Bening]] was originally cast in the role but dropped out due to pregnancy;<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul|title=Pfeiffer on Returns & Hathaway|url=http://www.batman-online.com/news/2012/4/24/pfeiffer-on-returns-hathaway|publisher=Batman Online.com}}</ref> then [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Demi Moore]] both got offered the role but both turned it down. Then, when Pfeiffer expressed an interest, something clicked to the producers thinking "She's perfect. She also could be both Selina Kyle and Catwoman.".<ref>Shadows of the Bat: Cinematic Saga of the Dark Side of the Knight</ref>This version of Selina Kyle is depicted as the lonely, frustrated, yet dutiful and efficient secretary of corrupt tycoon [[Max Shreck|Maximillian "Max" Shreck]]. After she accidentally discovers his plot to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity, Shreck attempts to murder her by [[Defenestration|pushing her out the window]] of his top-story office. Though her fall is partly broken by several canvas [[awning]]s, Selina lies motionless on the snow-covered ground seemingly dead. She is then mysteriously revived by a group of alley cats that flock around her and begin gnawing at her fingers. Making her way home in a daze, Selina's repressed rage transforms her into the clever [[supervillain]] Catwoman. After Batman thwarts her schemes, she joins forces with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] to destroy Batman. They frame him for the murder of the Ice Princess and Catwoman rejects the Penguin's advances, prompting him to hook an ascending umbrella to her neck. She breaks free but crashes in a [[greenhouse]] but does not die as she has developed nine lives during her transformation. Later, while she and Bruce dance in a ballroom, they recite lines said to one another earlier as Batman and Catwoman, revealing their identities. At the climax of the film, Selina uses a [[taser]] from a thug who tried to kill her to kiss Shreck, electrocuting him to death after he shoots her four times. Batman finds Shreck's body but doesn't find Selina's corpse. Right at the end of the film, Bruce Wayne spots her silhouette on a wall and when he leaves, she is seen gazing at the [[Batsignal]], confirming her survival. Pfeiffer's Catwoman derives heavily from the [[Pre-Crisis]] Catwoman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.batman-online.com/features/2012/5/29/comic-analysis-michelle-pfeiffer-catwoman |title=From Comic To Pfeiffer's Cat |work=Batman Online |date=May 29, 2012 |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref>  Michelle Pfeiffer creates distinctly different voices for Catwoman, with the voice of Selina being softer while the Catwoman voice is deeper and sultry.

Catwoman is briefly mentioned by [[Chase Meridian|Dr. Chase Meridian]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'', the screenplay of which was originally written as a direct sequel of ''Batman Returns''. She states that she has done her homework on Batman, that he likes "strong women", and asks teasingly if "she needs skin-tight vinyl and a whip". Catwoman was to get her own film, where Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, but the film lingered in development limbo for years, with [[Ashley Judd]] snatching the lead role and eventually becoming 2004's critically panned ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' starring [[Halle Berry]] and is non-canonical to the series and not in the [[DC Universe]].

====''Catwoman'' (2004)====
In 2004, the feature film ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' was released. Starring Halle Berry, this film's Catwoman bears little resemblance to the comic book version. Berry portrays Patience Phillips an artist and graphics designer, who works for a cosmetics company called Hedare Beauty, which is ready to ship a new skin cream called Beau-Line, that is able to reverse the effects of aging. However, as Patience visits the factory where it is being manufactured, she overhears a discussion between the scientist Dr. Ivan Slavicky ([[Peter Wingfield]]) and Laurel Hedare ([[Sharon Stone]]), the wife of company owner George Hedare ([[Lambert Wilson]]), speaking about the dangerous side effects from continued use of the product. Laurel's minions discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush Patience out of it, drowning her. Lying washed up on the shore and lifeless, Patience is mysteriously brought back to life by an [[Egyptian Mau]] cat, and from that point on develops cat-like abilities and an insatiable desire for vengeance. With the help of a researcher named Ophelia Powers ([[Frances Conroy]]), who tells her that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bast]], Patience understands that she is becoming a "catwoman" reborn with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. Wearing a mask to disguise her identity, Patience stalks the night as Catwoman seeking the answers to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search leads her to Laurel Hedare, who murders her husband for his infidelity and frames Catwoman for it, causing her to be taken into custody by the police. Yet, Patience slips out of confinement and confronts Laurel in her office, revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for Patience's death. During the fight, Patience scratches Laurel's face, and Laurel nearly plummets to her death when she falls out of a window, grabbing onto a pipe for dear life. Laurel sees her face in a reflection and horrified, fails to grab hold of Patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death. Though Patience was cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of the Hedares, she chooses to continue living outside the law enjoying her newfound freedom as the mysterious Catwoman.

The movie alludes to other women in the past who have been granted such cat-like abilities, particularly in a scene in which Patience is introduced to a series of photos of prior Catwomen, including Pfeiffer's ''Batman Returns'' version of Selina Kyle.

The film's story has nothing to do with Batman or Gotham City, and is considered "Catwoman in name only". It was poorly received by critics and audiences and is commonly listed as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]].

====''The Dark Knight Rises'' (2012)====
[[File:TDKR Catwoman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne Hathaway]] as Selina Kyle in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''.]]
[[Anne Hathaway]] portrays Selina Kyle in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=73379 | title='Anne Hathaway to Play Selina Kyle in The Dark Knight Rises' | work=ComingSoon.net | date=January 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jensen|first=Jeff|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/01/19/batman-hathaway-catwoman-hardy-bane-dark-knight-rises/ |title='The Dark Knight Rises' scoop: Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy join cast |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' describes Selina as an enigma, a wily and witty con artist, as well as a high society grifter. Selina is depicted as a [[femme fatale]] [[antiheroine]] whose actions often [[Moral ambiguity|blur ethical lines]], similar to her portrayal in the comics.

In the film, Selina is hired by corrupt businessman [[Roland Daggett|John Daggett]] to steal Bruce Wayne's fingerprints in exchange for her criminal record to be expunged via a "Clean Slate" computer program, but Daggett tricks her into believing he has it. These prints are subsequently used by Bane to attack the city stock exchange and bankrupt Bruce with bogus stock trades. She also steals the pearl necklace belonging to Bruce's [[Martha Wayne|deceased mother]] from his safe and leaves having taking a departing congressman hostage. When meeting with John Daggett's assistant Philip Stryver, Selena has the congressman with her as she demands the "Clean Slate" that John Daggett promised her, she is betrayed by Philip Stryver and the police raid the meeting. Selena escapes while the wounded congressman is rescued. After leading Batman, Wayne's alter ego, to [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s trap without realizing that they are the same person, she attempts to flee Gotham, fearing that Bane and his men will eventually kill her. She is arrested by [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]] who interrogates her on where Bruce Wayne is and mentions that the rescued congressman is pressing charges. and taken to [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate Prison]] to await trial. She is subsequently released during Bane's [[coup d'etat]]. Although she hoped for the ensuing chaos, she later regrets it. When Bruce returns to Gotham and offers her the "Clean Slate" after she saved a kid from two thugs, she aids Batman and his allies in liberating Gotham City from the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]]. With Selena's help, Bruce was able to rescue Lucius Fox. Using the Bat-Cycle, Selena destroys the blockade at the tunnel leading out of Gotham City. During the battle, Selena manages to use the Bat-Cycle to shoot Bane and helped Batman destroy [[Talia al Ghul]]'s convoy. At the end of the movie, Bruce leaves the mantle of Batman behind and enters a relationship with Selina. She is never referred to as "Catwoman" in the film, although she does receive the moniker in related ''The Dark Knight Rises'' collectibles and books. Instead, emphasis is made upon her profession as a "cat" burglar in headlines shown in the film; also, her safecracking goggles resemble cat ears when not in use.

Once the players obtain the Cat's Eye Diamonds from the Cat Avatars Tiger Eye, Cheetah Claw, [[Lion-Mane]], and Panther Fang, Catwoman activates the relics causing the spirits of the Cat Avatars to take control Catwoman into attacking the players when they did not want to end up under her control.
