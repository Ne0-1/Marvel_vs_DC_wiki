'''Catwoman''' (real name '''Selina Kyle''') is a [[DC Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], associated with the [[Batman]] franchise.  Created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]], she first appeared in ''Batman'' #1 (Spring, 1940), where she was initially known as "The Cat".  Her real name "Selina" derives from the ancient [[lunar deity]] [[Selene]].

Although originally introduced as an opponent for Batman, Catwoman's status as hero or villain is ambiguous; she has her own moral code (she abhors killing, though has resorted to it at times) and has occasionally teamed up with Batman and other heroes against greater threats, even saving the lives of the entire [[Justice League]] on one occasion.  She represents a gray area in Batman's otherwise black and white life where the line between good and evil blurs, and his attraction to her stems from this perception that, in her way, she's kind of a female version of himself: another dark, beautiful creature that prowls the night.

Catwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all, and it was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations.  Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a bodysuit with attached boots and either a [[domino]] or glasses-mask.  In the 1960s, Catwoman's bodysuit was green in color, which was typical of villains of that era.  In the 1990s, she usually wore a skintight purple bodysuit, before switching to a black leather outfit that recalls [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s Catwoman costume in ''[[Batman Returns]]''.  In recent years, she has usually alternated between these two costumes.  Ed Brubaker, the master-mind behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic catsuit [http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html].  It has a more high tech look, with domino-shaped infrared goggles on her cowl.

==Comic Book History==
There have been many versions of Catwoman's origins and backstory seen in the comic books over the decades.

===Golden and Silver Age versions===
[[Image:Catwoman-batman01.jpg|Selina Kyle's first appearance as ''the Cat'' in ''Batman'' #1, published in the spring of 1940.|thumb|left]]
In ''Batman'' #62, it was revealed that Catwoman (after a blow to the head jogged her memory) was an [[amnesiac]] [[flight attendant]] who had turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived.  She wound up reforming and stayed on the straight and narrow for several years, helping out Batman in ''Batman'' #65 and #69, until Selina decided to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #203.  Selina appeared again as a criminal in ''Batman'' #84 and ''Detective Comics'' #211, her final appearance for many years (until 1966).

In the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] characters) revealed that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (presumably after the events of ''Batman'' #69) and had married Bruce Wayne; soon afterwards, the couple gave birth to their only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]). In ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #197, the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman'' #62 was elaborated on, after Selina revealed that she never actually had amnesia.  It was revealed that Selina Kyle had been the wife of an abusive man, and eventually decided to leave her husband.  However, her husband had kept her jewelry in his private vault, and she had to break into it to retrieve the jewelry.  Selina enjoyed this experience so much she decided to become a professional costumed [[cat burglar]], and thus began a career that would repeatedly lead to her encountering the Batman.

The Earth-Two/Golden Age Selena Kyle eventually died in the late 1970s after being blackmailed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman (as shown in ''[[DC Super-Stars]]'' #17).

Catwoman's first Silver Age appearance was in ''[[Lois Lane|Superman's Girl Friend Lois Lane]]'' #70 (November 1966); afterwards, she continued to make appearances across the various Batman comics.

Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing [[murder]], something that neither the Earth-One or Earth-Two versions of her would ever do; this version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-B|Earth-B]], an alternate Earth that included stories that couldn't be considered canonical on Earth-One or Earth-Two.

===Modern Age version===
[[Image:Catmini.png|Cover to ''Catwoman'' #1, her first miniseries. Art by J.J. Birch.|thumb]]
A revision in Catwoman's origin, and the introduction of the modern version of her, came in 1986 when writer [[Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] produced ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman’s origin.  In the course of the story, the origin of Catwoman was also re-envisioned, as a 5'7" Selina Kyle was reintroduced as a cat-loving [[prostitute]]/[[dominatrix]] who was inspired to become a costumed cat burglar when she saw Batman in action.

This origin was expanded on in the 1989 ''Catwoman'' limited series (collected in trade paperback form as ''Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper'') by writer [[Mindy Newell]] and artist [[J.J. Birch]].  This series showed how Catwoman’s early career was tinged with tragedy as her former [[pimp]] Stan abducted Selina's sister Maggie and violently abused her.  This led Selina to kill Stan, leaving Selina in an unbalanced mental state.

Further, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implied that Catwoman suspected she was the long-lost illegitimate daughter of [[Carmine Falcone]], although she found no definitive proof of this. Selina's connection to the Falcone family was further explored in the recent miniseries ''Catwoman: When in Rome'' (2004-5).  Though more circumstantial evidence was added to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, no definitive proof was provided.

It is currently unclear how much of these stories remain [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to Catwoman’s current origin, as various stories and editors' statements over the years since then have stated that Selina was never a prostitute and that other events depicted in those stories never happened.  However, characters introduced in these stories (such as Selina’s young friend Holly from ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and her sister Maggie from the 1989 miniseries) continue to appear regularly in the ''Catwoman'' series, and aspects of those plots are occasionally referenced, including recent issues that show Hollie remembering her days as a prostitute with Catwoman.

In 1993, following the success of ''[[Batman Returns]]'' and Selina Kyle’s prominent role in that film, Catwoman was given her first ongoing series.  This series, written by an assortment of writers but primarily penciled by [[Jim Balent]], generally depicted the character as an international thief with an ambiguous moral code.

Storylines included her adoption of a teenage [[runaway]] named Arizona, whom she briefly took on as a sidekick; aiding the criminal [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], followed by helping [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to defeat him; and Selina Kyle as a reluctant government operative.  The series also fleshed out more of her origin, revealing her beginnings as an underage thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and the training she received from superhero [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted (Wildcat) Grant]].

As the series neared its end, Selina moved to [[New York]] and through blackmail, became first corporate vice president, then [[CEO]] of Randolf Industries, a [[mafia]]-influenced company.  She intended to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]].  However, her plans were ruined when the supervillain [[Trickster (comics)|the Trickster]] inadvertently connected Kyle to her Catwoman alter ego.
[[Image:catwoman_1.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''Catwoman'' (2nd series) #1, the first issue of her new ongoing series.  Art by [[Darwyn Cooke]].]]
Selina then returned to Gotham, which at this time was in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline.  As Catwoman, Kyle assisted Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city.  However immediately following that, she was arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] and put on trial, followed by being sentenced to imprisonment.  While in prison, she escaped, and under the influence of Dr. Harleen Quinzel (the supervillain [[Harley Quinn]]), became mentally unbalanced. 

When later that year during the ''Officer Down'' storyline in the Batman titles, Catwoman was initially the chief suspect.  Although later cleared, she displayed increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story.  Soon afterwards she disappeared and was thought killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at #94.

Catwoman then appeared in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics'' #759 to #762.  In a backup storyline ''Trail of the Catwoman'', by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Darwyn Cooke]], the reader followed private detective [[Slam Bradley]]'s attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle.

This storyline led in to the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]).  In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and [[Slam Bradley]] (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), became protector of the residents of Gotham’s East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar.  This series met with critical and fan acclaim, especially for its first 25 issues.

During the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline in ''Batman'' #608-#619, Batman and Catwoman briefly worked together and had a short affair, during the course of which Batman revealed his true identity to her.  At the end, Catwoman broke off their relationship when Batman believed that it had been influenced by the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]].

{{spoilerabout|"The One You Love"}}

Recently in the [[JLA]] story arc ''Crisis of Conscience,'' Catwoman further proved herself an ally when she fought alongside Batman and the League against the old [[Secret Society of Super-Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.  Wounded, she was taken to the Batcave to recover.  When [[Despero]] and a faction of brainwashed League members infiltrated the cave and succeeded in brainwashing Batman, Catwoman was able to send a distress call out to the unaffected [[Justice League|League]] members.  After a fierce struggle, Despero was subdued.  However, this was something of a hollow victory, since all recognized that Despero was able to pit the JLA members against one another by drawing upon pre-existing animosities and distrust.  In response to Batman's inquiry about her wounds, Selina departed the Batcave after curtly informing Batman that he had already "done enough."
[[Image:CatwomanCv50.jpg|Cover to ''Catwoman'' #50.  Art by [[Adam Hughes]].|thumb]]
Catwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman true (although brash and unpredictable).  However, it is now unclear if her reformation was the result of a mindwipe by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims.  Selina had no inkling that any villains had been mindwiped until Batman informed her of the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', and he now worries that her reformation may be due to mental manipulation. 

At the start of the recent storyline ("The One You Love"), an influx of [[supervillain|supervillains]] seized control of the East End, leaving Selina with no choice but to join the new incarnation of the Secret Society.  While her initial intentions were unclear, Selina shared her plans to infiltrate and destroy the cadre of East End villains with Batman. 

Selina made a deal with a former criminal who had powers similar to [[Clayface]]'s, who had promised to help her in exchange for his freedom.  The man impersonated her, and allowed several villains to shoot and dismember him, giving the impression to the underworld that Catwoman was really dead (like Clayface, the man was able to survive what would otherwise be fatal wounds).  Capitalizing upon the advantage which her "resurrection" provided her (the villains believing she had somehow managed to cheat death), Catwoman dismantled the new East End cadre of criminals, one villain at time.  After she was done, Zatanna appeared at her side, informing her that she had some "bad news", hinting at an important revelation about her past.

{{spoilerabout|[[Infinite Crisis]] and [[52 (comics)|52]]}}

After ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #5, the DC Universe will will jump forward one year in time.  In the new year, Selina Kyle has been forced to leave the East End and is no longer Catwoman, and someone new has replaced her.  Writer [[Will Pfeifer]] has stated on the new Catwoman, "Without revealing any identities, the new Catwoman is someone with less experience than Selina Kyle -- though she's not completely inexperienced, and she's been part of that shadowy world Catwoman inhabits for years.  She's had training, and she's been on the mean streets, but she's going to make some mistakes.  She's also going to handle her duties of protecting the East End in a completely different way than Selina, which so far has been very interesting to write.  Selina is so smooth and polished; it's fun to write about someone who's a little rougher, a little sloppier." [http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=2ba67129104007086c101d2795fa2902&threadid=52812]

The writer then revealed that the reason for Selina's retirement is that she's pregnant.

==Adaptations in other media==
===1966 ''Batman'' series===
Catwoman was at various times played by [[Julie Newmar]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] in the live-action ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series of the 1960s, her first other-media portrayal.  [[Lee Meriwether]] portrayed her in the 1966 "[[Batman]]" motion picture, based on the television series, when Newmar was unavailable.

===Animated series===
[[Image:GothamGirlsCvr1.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The [[The New Batman Adventures]] version of Catwoman. Cover to ''[[Gotham Girls#Comic|Gotham Girls]]'' #1.  Art by [[Shane Glines]].]] 
Catwoman has been a major character in almost all of Batman's animated series.  

She appeared in the Batman cartoon of the 1960s (on the "[[Superman/Aquaman Hour]]") wearing the green costume she wore during that time.  She appeared on the Batman cartoon of the 1970s ("[[The New Adventures of Batman]]") wearing an all-new outfit that has never been seen outside that series. She was voiced by [[Adrienne Barbeau]] in 1992's ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and its revamp in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. [[Adrienne Barbeau|Barbeau]] also voiced Catwoman in the 2000s online animated series ''[[Gotham Girls]]''.  In the first animated series Selina/Catwoman had blonde hair, coinciding with the release of [[Batman Returns]], in which she was played by blonde actress [[Michelle Pfeiffer]].  In the second series, however, she appears to have cut it, and dyed it black.

Catwoman was voiced by a different actress, [[Gina Gershon]], in the 2000s series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.

===Movies===
Catwoman was played by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the 1992 movie ''[[Batman Returns]]''.  As recreated by [[Daniel Waters]] and [[Tim Burton]], Selina Kyle is a beautiful but shy and clumsy young woman who always says the wrong thing, thinks aloud, frequently insults herself and works as the harrassed secretary of evil tycoon [[Max Shreck]].  Behind this cartoonish and rather stereotypical character, however, lies a shattered soul filled with frustration and self-loathing who only needs - and quite literally gets - a little push to break into insanity. [[Image:Batmanreturnspostercatwoman.png|right|Movie poster for ''Batman Returns'' featuring Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.|180px|thumb]]  Mysteriously given new life by alley cats (in a memorable Burton-esque scene) after her corrupt boss apparently kills her, her repressed rage and sexuality - and, as one could argue, some sort of mystic feline influence as well - create Catwoman, an extreme version of everything she was never allowed - by both society and herself - to be: a loveable rogue, a sexual predator and a powerful woman.  She is at the same time a feminist version of Batman, defending meek ''damsels in distress'' - exactly what she was at the beginning of the film, and probably during most of her life - but insulting them for being so, and a terrorist of sorts, blowing up an entire floor of Shreck's department store and ultimately seeking to kill him.  Accordingly with the film's interest in the schizophrenic aspects of its characters, Catwoman finds a reflection of herself in Batman ("Who are you?", she asks him, "Who's the man behind the Bat? Maybe you can help me find... the woman... behind the Cat"), just as Bruce Wayne finds a reflection of himself in Selina ("You... you've kind of a dark side, don't you?", to which she answers, "Not darker than yours, Bruce"), and this relationship seems to be Selina's only grip on sanity as her mental state seems to deteriorate (along with her costume, which is actually a metaphor of her) throughout the movie - now unrepressed thanks to her nightly alter-ego, the rage and resentment of her dark side are actually starting to destroy her.  While many viewers and critics enjoyed the richness and complexity of the character, not to mention the way Pfeiffer looked and acted in the heavy makeup and the shiny black costume, fans of the original comic books disliked the notorious alterations and considered not only the character but the entire film to be more Tim Burton than Batman.

In 2004, ''[[Catwoman (movie)|Catwoman]]'', a movie, starring [[Halle Berry]] as Catwoman.  This film's Catwoman bore nearly no resemblance to the comic version, besides sharing the name "Catwoman."  In the film, Berry played Patience Phillips, a woman who eventually became Catwoman, a hero with supernatural cat-like powers, after a near death experience.  Patience had gained the powers from the goddess [[Bastet]], through a gathering of cats lead by an [[Egyptian Mau]].  The movie alludes to other women in the past who have been granted such cat- like abilities.  Though Phillips has the same skills as the villain version of Catwoman, the film's story has nothing to do with Batman (who isn't mentioned during the film).  The film was heavily criticized by both film critics and fans of the comic book character and was a failure in the box office, losing the producers far more money than it earned.

In the scene where Patience is told of the history of the Catwomen, she is pushed off the balcony and lands in the living room floor.  Ophelia Powers then throws photos of previous catwomen down to her, and one can clearly see a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer's "Batman Returns" version of the character, which hints that either there is some link between Patience Phillips and Selina Kyle, or that it was done as a means of paying homage to the original character.  In addition, the original "Catwoman" outfit that Patience wears when she robs a jewelry store is patterned after the "Catwoman" outfit worn by Eartha Kitt in the 1960s "[[Batman]]" tv series. 

The movie became a box-office failure, and was panned by critics & fans alike.  [[Halle Berry]] won the 2005 [[Razzie]] award for worst actress in a film.

===''Birds of Prey''===
Selina Kyle appeared very briefly (and was killed off) in the first episode of the short-lived 2000s television series ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'', which featured Catwoman's daughter by Batman, the Huntress.  Catwoman was portrayed by [[Maggie Baird]].

==Cultural references==
One of the recurring villains in the cartoon ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' was called "Kat-nappe," and was similar to Catwoman in appearance.

[[Marvel Comics]]' [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], as initially seen in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', was originally intended to be a homage to Catwoman, although she eventually developed in a much different direction.  The Black Cat is also a feline-themed thief, although she eventually reformed (but still commits the occasional theft) and became [[Spider-Man]]'s partner and lover for a time.
