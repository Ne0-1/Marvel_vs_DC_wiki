'''Catwoman''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] associated with [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]] [[media franchise|franchise]]. Historically a [[supervillain]], the character was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]], partially inspired by Kane's second cousin by marriage, Ruth Steel.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Batman and Me | last=Kane | first=Bob | authorlink=Bob Kane | date=November 1989 | location=Foestfille, [[California]] | publisher=Eclipse Books | isbn=978-1560600169}}</ref>

The original and most widely known Catwoman, '''Selina Kyle''', first appears in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #1 (Spring [[1940 in comics|1940]]) in which she is known as '''The Cat'''. She is a sometimes-adversary of Batman, known for having a complex love-hate (often romantic) relationship with him. In her first appearance, she was a [[whip]]-carrying [[burglary|burglar]] with a taste for high-stake thefts.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | authorlink=Scott Beatty | contribution=Catwoman | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=74–75 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> For many years Catwoman thrived, but from September 1954 to November 1966 she took an extended hiatus due to the newly developing [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954. These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation with the Comic Code.

Since the 1990s, Catwoman has been featured in an eponymous series that cast her as an [[antihero]] rather than a supervillain. The character has been one of Batman's most enduring [[Linda Page|love interests]]. Many [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] writers have also interpreted her activities and costumed identity as a response to a history of [[abuse]].

A popular figure, Catwoman has been featured in most [[Mass media|media]] adaptations related to Batman. Actresses [[Julie Newmar]], [[Lee Meriwether]], and [[Eartha Kitt]] introduced her to a large audience on the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and the 1966 ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' motion picture. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] portrayed the character in 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]''. [[Halle Berry]] starred in a stand-alone ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' film in 2004, which was a complete box-office flop, although only loosely based on the ''Batman'' character.

Catwoman was ranked #11 on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time" list.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/11.html | title=Catwoman is Number 11 | work=[[IGN]] | year=2009}}</ref> She was also ranked #51 on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>''Wizard'' #177 (July 2006). p. 88.</ref>

==Character and publication history==
There have been many versions of Catwoman's [[origin story|origins]] and [[back-story]] seen in the comic books over the decades. Overall, Catwoman or Selina Kyle still remains as the most popular female character in the Batman Universe.

===Creation===
Batman's creator, Bob Kane, was a great movie fan and his love for film provided the impetus for several Batman characters, among them, Catwoman. She was partially inspired by 1930's film star [[Jean Harlow]] who at Kane's then-early and "impressionable age... seemed to personify feminine pulchritude at its most sensuous." Wanting to give his ''Batman'' comic books [[sex appeal]] and someone who could appeal to female readers as a female Batman, Kane and writer Bill Finger created a "friendly foe who committed crimes but was also a romantic interest in Batman's rather sterile life." She was meant to be a love interest and to engage Batman in a chess game with him trying to reform her. At the same time, this character was meant to be different from other Batman villains like the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in that she was never a killer or evil.

As for using cat imagery with their Catwoman, Kane states he and Finger saw cats as "kind of the antithesis of bats."

{{Cquote2|I felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are cool, detached, and unreliable. I felt much warmer with dogs around me—cats are as hard to understand as women are. Men feel more sure of themselves with a male friend than a woman. You always need to keep women at arm's length. We don't want anyone taking over our souls, and women have a habit of doing that. So there's a love-resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I'm being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel that I've had better relationships with male friends than women. With women, once the romance is over, somehow they never remain my friends.<ref>Kane 1989, pp. 107-108.</ref>}}

===Golden and Silver Age versions===
[[File:Catwoman-batman01.jpg|200px|Selina Kyle's first appearance as The Cat in ''Batman'' #1 (Spring 1940).|thumb|left]]
Catwoman, then called "The Cat", first appeared in ''Batman'' #1 as a mysterious burglar and jewel thief, revealed at the end of the story to be a young, attractive woman (unnamed in the first story). Although the story does not have her wearing her [[icon]]ic cat-suit, it establishes her core personality as a [[femme fatale]] who both antagonizes and attracts Batman.

''Batman'' #62 (December/January 1950) revealed that Catwoman (after a blow to the head jogged her memory) is an [[amnesia]]c [[flight attendant]] who had turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived. Although, in one of the last issues of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'',{{Issue|date=September 2010}} she admits that she made up the amnesia story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime. She reforms for several years, helping out Batman in ''Batman'' #65 (June/July 1951) and #69 (February/March 1952), until she decides to return to a life of crime in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #203 (January 1954). Catwoman appears again as a criminal in ''Batman'' #84 (June 1954) and ''Detective Comics'' #211 (September 1954) for her final appearance until 1966. This was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing Comics Code Authority's rules for portrayal of female characters that started in 1954.

In the 1970s comics, a series of stories taking place on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Two|Earth-Two]] (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters) reveal that on that world, Selina reformed in the 1950s (after the events of ''Batman'' #69) and had married Bruce Wayne; soon afterward, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Helena Wayne (the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]]). ''The Brave and the Bold'' #197 (April 1983) elaborates upon the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in ''Batman'' #62, after Selina reveals that she never actually had amnesia. It is revealed that Selina Kyle had been in an [[domestic violence|abusive]] marriage, and eventually decides to leave her husband. However, her husband keeps her jewelry in his private vault, and she has to break into it to retrieve it. Selina enjoys this experience so much she decides to become a professional costumed [[burglary|cat burglar]], and thus begins a career that repeatedly leads to her encountering Batman.

The Earth-Two/Golden Age Selina Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being [[blackmail]]ed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman, as shown in ''DC Super-Stars'' #17 (November/December 1977).

Catwoman made her first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] appearance in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #70 (November 1966); afterward, she continued to make appearances across the various ''Batman'' comics.

Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing [[murder]], something that neither the Earth-One nor Earth-Two versions of her would ever do. This version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-B]], an alternate [[Earth]] that included stories that could not be considered [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] on Earth-One or Earth-Two.<ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Index'' (March 1986)</ref><ref>''The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Cross-Over Index'' (July 1986)</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/04/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-171/ | last=Cronin | first=Brian | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #171 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 4, 2008}}</ref>

===Modern Age version===
====Tangled origins====
Catwoman's origin—and, to an extent, her character—was revised in 1986 when writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] published ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', a revision of Batman's origin. In this version, Selina Kyle is reintroduced as an independent and more modern minded woman. She works as a [[prostitution|prostitute]] in order to survive and wants to break away from her abusive [[pimp]] (and former boyfriend). She witnesses his crimes and, because of an event that occurs to her sister, fears for her sister's life and begins to study self-defense and [[martial arts]]. Her teacher inspires Selina to become more than what she has been and she realizes that prostitution is no life for her, or for "Holly".

[[Holly Robinson]] is a young runaway who idolizes Selina, but is much too young to be on the streets as far as Selina is concerned. Selina shares her home with Holly after she takes her in. As the story progresses Selina is led to a bit of burglary, she dons a catsuit costume that her now former pimp gave to her the day that she told him she was out of the business. After costuming herself so as not to be revealed, she gets a taste for burglary and begins to do it in more of a Robin Hood way than an actual thief. This is, however, how she runs into Batman. After a small confrontation, she begins to be inspired to stay in her costume and become the "Catwoman" after seeing Batman in action with others. Selina gets the idea that, if there is a "bat", why can there not be a "cat"?

The 1989 ''Catwoman'' limited series, written by [[Mindy Newell]] and with art J.J. Birch, expanded upon Miller's ''Year One'' origin. This storyline, known as "Her Sister's Keeper", explores Selina's early life as a prostitute and the start of her career as Catwoman. The story culminates with Selina's former pimp, Stan, abducting and violently abusing her sister Maggie, who, in contrast to Selina, is a [[nun]]. Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and gets away with it. Most of this is revealed in the former series, but is expanded upon in "Her Sister's Keeper".

Portions of "Her Sister's Keeper" and the ''Year One'' origin conceived by Miller remain [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to Catwoman’s origin, while other portions have been dropped over the years. It has been implied{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} that "Her Sister's Keeper" was rendered non-canonical by the events of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', and subsequent writers have rejected Miller's choice to make the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|''Crisis'']] Catwoman a prostitute. In an attempt to harmonize the various versions, some writers have posited that Catwoman, early in her career, pretended to be a prostitute in order to scam lonely men and rob them. 

However, characters associated with Catwoman's past as a prostitute have remained a part of her supporting cast. Holly, from ''Batman: Year One'', and her sister Maggie, from "Her Sister's Keeper", have appeared regularly in the ''Catwoman'' series. Some elements of "Her Sister's Keeper" remain clearly non-canonical, however, such as references to her father only recently dying.

In this version, she has [[gymnastic]] and martial arts training, which is perfect when it comes to leaping roof to roof, or taking down whoever stands in her way. With her gymnastic background, Selina quickly learns martial arts under the instruction of the [[Armless Master]], who clearly inspires her greatly. Her mother, Maria, shows great interest and approval, as well as support, in the gymnastic phase of Selina's life.

''Catwoman'' (vol. 2) #0, which provides details about Selina's childhood, neglects Maggie's existence. Maria Kyle is a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats, and commits [[suicide]] when Selina is very young. Her [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] father, Brian, is cold to Selina for resembling her mother (whom he resents for dying), and eventually drinks himself to death.

To survive, Selina takes to the streets for a time before being caught and sent first to an [[orphanage]], then [[youth detention center|juvenile hall]],<ref name="Catwoman v1 0">''Catwoman'' (vol. 1) #0</ref> "where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be."<ref>''Catwoman: Secret Files and Origins''</ref> Maggie's fate at this point in the time-line is not alluded to. However, when [[Ed Brubaker]] reintroduces her into the comic, he implies that Maggie may have directly entered an orphanage and promptly been [[adoption|adopted]].

When she is 13, Selina discovers that the hall's administrator has been [[embezzlement|embezzling]] funds, and he confronts her. In an attempt to cover up his crime, the administrator puts Selina in a bag and drops her in a river to drown (like a cat). Selina escapes and returns to the orphanage, where she steals documents exposing the administrator's corruption. She uses this information to blackmail the administrator into erasing "Selina Kyle" from the city's records, then steals the administrator's diamond necklace and escapes the orphanage.<ref name="Catwoman v1 0"/>

Selina eventually finds herself in "Alleytown - a network of cobblestone streets that form a small borough between the East End and Old [[Gotham City|Gotham]]."<ref>''Catwoman'' (vol. 2) #12</ref> Selina is taken in by Mama Fortuna, the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and is taught how to steal. Fortuna treats her students like [[slavery|slaves]], keeping their earnings for herself. Selina eventually runs away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia. However, the two have difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation try to support themselves by working as prostitutes. Sylvia attracts at least one client; Selina apparently never does. The two drift apart afterward, with Sylvia coming to resent Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.

In the ''Catwoman: Year One'' story,<ref>''Catwoman'' Annual #2 (1995)</ref> Selina (now an adult) achieves some success as a thief. Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepts an offer to "lay low" by posing as a dominatrix in the employ of a pimp named Stan. They plan to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes. According to this storyline, Selina trains under the Armless Master of Gotham City, receiving education in martial arts and culture. During this time, a client gives her a [[cat o' nine tails]], which Selina kept as a trophy of her time posing as a prostitute.

''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the sequel to ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', implies that Catwoman suspects she is the illegitimate daughter of [[mafia]] boss [[Carmine Falcone]], although she finds no definitive proof. Selina's connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries ''[[Catwoman: When in Rome]]''. Though the story adds more [[circumstantial evidence]] to the theory of Selina's Falcone heritage, it also supplies no definitive proof. During ''The Long Halloween'', Selina (out of costume) develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne, even leading her to save Bruce from Poison Ivy, who hypnotized him. However, this relationship appears to end on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice—once as Bruce, and once as Batman. She leaves him for good and also leaves Gotham for a while in ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', after he stands her up on two holidays. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina.

Catwoman also appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' saga, where she is approached by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s henchmen while robbing a house. Bane asks her to work for him, but she refuses, as she is repulsed by the criminal who "broke" Batman. Later in the story, she boards a plane with [[Bruce Wayne]] to fly to [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]].

She next appears in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall#Knightquest|Batman: Knightquest]]'' saga.

====''Catwoman'', the series====
In 1993, Catwoman was given her first ongoing comic book series. This series, written by an assortment of writers, but primarily penciled by [[Jim Balent]], generally depicted the character as an international thief (and occasional [[bounty hunter]]) with an ambiguous [[Morality#Moral codes|moral code]].

Storylines include her adoption of teenage [[runaway youth|runaway]], and erstwhile sidekick, Arizona; aiding Bane, whom she later betrays to [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]; and a stint as a reluctant government operative. The series also fleshes out more of her origin, revealing her beginnings as a young thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and her training with [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted "Wildcat" Grant]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Moving to [[New York]], Selina becomes corporate vice president then [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Randolf Industries, a mafia-influenced company, through blackmail. She plans to use this position to run for [[Mayor of New York City]], but her hopes are dashed when the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] inadvertently connects her to her criminal [[alter ego]].

Selina then returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline. As Catwoman, she assists Batman against [[Lex Luthor]] in the reconstruction of the city. After being arrested by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], she escapes from prison. Later that year, during the "Officer Down" storyline in the ''Batman'' titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect. Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story. Soon afterward, she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]], ending her series at issue #94.

Catwoman then appears in a series of backup stories in ''Detective Comics'' #759-762 (August – November 2001). In the backup storyline "Trail of the Catwoman", by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke, private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle. This storyline leads in to the newest ''Catwoman'' series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist [[Cameron Stewart]]). In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and Slam Bradley (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham's East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar.

During the ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' storyline, Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and have a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her. At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the [[Riddler]] and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. This is the second story to establish that she knows Batman's true identity. In an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship. The concluding story features a closing panel in which she refers to Batman as "Bruce". A change in the editorial team at that point, however, brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. When Catwoman appears again, no mention whatsoever is made of the notion that she knows Batman's identity.

In the ''[[Justice League]]'' story arc "Crisis of Conscience", Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the Justice League against the old [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], of which she had once briefly been a member.

====Mindwiping revelations====
Catwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman true (although brash and unpredictable). However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a [[mindwipe]] by [[Zatanna]], a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims. Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback, it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and Batman. Catwoman's response to this revelation is unequivocal: she duct-tapes Zatanna's mouth shut and pitches her out a window (Zatanna survives the fall). Afterward, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.

Still unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52, Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain. The [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], in an attempt to "improve himself," threatens the most important people in Selina's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly. The villain had also previously [[torture]]d Selina's sister Maggie by drilling out her husband's eyeballs and feeding them to Maggie, which drove her insane. Black Mask learns Selina's identity through his earlier alliance with Selina's childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbors a grudge against Selina. Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head.<ref name="dc-ency"/> This action continues to haunt her throughout the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, and it is suggested that this might have been the first time she had ever directly taken a life.

====As a mother====
[[File:Catwomanbaby.PNG|Selina Kyle with her child, [[Helena Wayne|Helena]] (2006). Pencils by David Lopez.|180px|thumb|left]]
Following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the [[DC Universe]] jumps forward in time. After ''One Year Later'', Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena. The father of her new daughter is initially unrevealed, however Batman demonstrates great concern for the child and at one point asks to have Helena stay at his mansion. Selina attempts to live a safe and somewhat normal life, and gives up her more dangerous ways of living as Catwoman. Holly Robinson takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter (Selina's alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'').<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Though she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena's birth. Having understandably gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now a tighter fit. In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal. Although the situation is defused through Holly's opportune arrival, the sight of two Catwomen active simultaneously in the city is caught on video. Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado [[Film Freak]] has deduced her alias, joined with [[Angle Man]], and grabbed Helena. After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces [[Zatanna]] to mind-wipe Film Freak and Angle Man in order to preserve her secret identity. Following the procedure, Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage. 

A twist occurs when Wildcat informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask. Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly. Finally defeating Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that Bradley has deduced that Helena is the daughter of his son Sam Bradley, Jr., and therefore his granddaughter.

Batman asks Catwoman to infiltrate the violent tribe of the [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana Amazons]] during the ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' crossover. Posing as a criminal, Selina gains the Bana's trust and thwarts a terror attack aimed at causing mass casualties in Gotham City.

Selina questions whether she should be raising a daughter when her life as Catwoman has already proven to be such a danger to the child. After enlisting Batman's help in faking the death of both herself and her daughter, Selina puts Helena up for adoption. A month after Helena is placed with a new family, Catwoman asks Zatanna to erase her memories of Helena and change her mind back to a criminal mentality. Zatanna refuses, judging that such an act would be cruel to both mother and daughter. She tells Selina that she could never reverse Selina's mindset, since she was on the path to becoming a hero on her own. Believing she can no longer function as a criminal, Selina decided to become one of Batman's [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> She quickly quits, however, and was replaced by [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]].

====''Salvation Run''====
In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #2, Catwoman is sent to the Prison Planet. She allies herself with [[Lex Luthor]] in an attempt to return to Earth, and mistakenly ends up on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]-Earth where Catwoman is a notorious villain. It is later revealed that this Earth is a creation of her own mind, and she has not left Prison Planet. When accused of being a traitor by Luthor, she reveals [[Martian Manhunter]] is posing as [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]], which would soon lead to the hero's death.

Using the trust she regained in Luthor's eyes, she earns a passage to the "real" Earth, in a jury-rigged teleport machine built by Luthor for letting the villains escape. On Earth, she resumes being a hero, with occasional lapses into thievery by commission, simply for the thrill of it.

The current volume of ''Catwoman'' concluded with issue #82, and details a cat-and-mouse chase between Batman and Catwoman across Gotham City rooftops, ending with Selina stealing the [[Batmobile]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xrayspex.blogspot.com/2008/04/well-heh-heh-this-is-little.html | last=Pfeifer | first=Will | title=Well, heh heh... this is a little embarrassing | work=X-Ray Spex | date=April 15, 2008}}</ref>

====Heart of Hush====
Later, in ''Detective Comics'', uncertain if she should pursue her "relationship" with Batman, Selina talks with Bruce about Jezebel Jet, his current girlfriend, and then has a pep talk with Zatanna, whom she believes is also courting Bruce. Zatanna confirms and admits her feelings, adding that she has since chosen to forgo them, but encourages Selina to open her heart to Bruce before Jet is able to "seal the deal." [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] eavesdrops on the conversation, targeting both women as a way to hurt his enemy, Bruce Wayne.

In ''Detective Comics'' #848 (November 2008), Hush attacks Selina, surgically removing her heart. She is delivered anonymously to a Gotham hospital. Batman receives word of her situation, and while he goes in search of Hush, he leaves Selina in the care of [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], who is considered the superhero community's chief doctor.

Batman recovers her heart, and Dr. Mid-Nite restores it to her body; however, the doctor also makes a prognosis on whether she can still return to her former life swinging through rooftops. While Selina is still in a [[coma]], she encounters Zatanna, who apologizes for not warning her about Hush. She tells Selina that she was so happy about her relationship with Bruce that she ignored the other warnings in the cards. Zatanna gives her a little bottle supposedly containing [[aloe vera]] for her post-op scars. It is hinted that there is a little magic in there to help Selina with her recovery. Selina is sad that she might end up alone again. In the meantime, Bruce enters the recovery room and, believing her unconscious, launches into a soliloquy. He ends by telling Selina that he will always love her, when she opens her eyes and reveals to him that she was awake all the time and heard his confession.

====''Batman R.I.P.''====
During the events of ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', Selina and Bruce's romance lasts only for a night because Bruce must continue to pose as Jezebel's lover to bring down the Black Glove. While still recuperating, she pulls off one more heist and exacts her revenge on Hush. With the help of a few allies on both sides; [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], and Slam Bradley, Selina taps into Hush's assets, leaving him penniless and suffering from wounds inflicted by Batman.

====''Battle for the Cowl''====
In ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Selina is seen as one of the members of [[Nightwing]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s contingency team known as "The Network", where she is seen taking down a gang of thugs before seeing [[Tim Drake]] dressed in a Batman uniform and is initially taken by surprise.

====''Batman: Reborn'' and ''Gotham City Sirens''====
In the first issue of ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'', Selina runs into Bonebuster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, and is saved by Poison Ivy. Selina, fearing the many dangers of a post-Batman Gotham, proposes that she, Ivy, and Harley Quinn team up, living together at a single base in an abandoned animal shelter. Ivy agrees under one condition: using home-grown drugs to weaken Selina's resistance, Ivy demands the identity of the true Batman. Selina flashes back three years to when [[Talia al Ghul]] requested her presence in [[Tibet]]. There, Talia made it so that Selina would not relinquish the true identity of Batman under any circumstances. After the interrogation is over, Selina sees Harley with Bruce Wayne on TV. Selina tells Ivy that she knows it is Hush in disguise.

====''Blackest Night''====
During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Selina is attacked by Black Mask after he has been reborn as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. After he tells her that he plans on getting an emotional response before killing her, Selina steals a car and heads to the mental institution where Maggie is held, believing Black Mask is coming for her. Black Mask attacks the institution, and somehow awakens Maggie from her coma. Selina arrives in time to help her sister flee into the sewers. While on the run, Maggie angrily tells Selina that she ruined both of their lives the day she decided to become Catwoman. Devastated by her sister's statement, Selina fails to realize they have both been heading for a trap. Just as Black Mask is about to gouge Maggie's eyes out and shove them down Selina's throat, Harley and Ivy arrive and defeat the Black Lantern by trapping him in the stomach of a man-eating plant. Selina is helped to her feet by her friends, who tell her that Maggie has fled the scene. The next day, the staff members of the mental institution are shown discussing Maggie's escape, also mentioning that a nun that works at the hospital had been found beaten and stripped of her uniform. Maggie is then shown in the depths of the Gotham City sewers clad in the bloodied nun robes, muttering about her plan to kill Catwoman in order to free Selina's soul.<ref>''Catwoman'' #83 (March 2010)</ref> Now calling herself Sister Zero, Maggie attempts to kill Selina, but ultimately flees after being defeated by the Sirens. She is last seen going over her options, now realizing that she cannot murder her own sister, and therefore must personally exorcise the "cat demon" from within Selina's body.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #12-13 (July – August 2010)</ref>

====''The Return of Bruce Wayne''====
[[File:Catwoman&Catgirl.jpg|Selina with her new partner, Catgirl (2010). Pencils by Tony Daniel.|180px|thumb|right]]
In the build-up to ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne|The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'', the Sirens help Zatanna put out a massive fire at a local park near their home, only for them to be ambushed by a creature made of mud. After being dragged underneath the soil by the creature, Catwoman awakens tied up and gagged on the floor of a dark room, and is quickly forced into an illusion by her unseen captors. Back in reality, Talia reveals to the Sirens that just a few hours prior, an unknown benefactor had offered up a massive reward to whoever could kidnap and deliver Catwoman to him, with the hopes that he could penetrate her mind and learn Batman's secret identity.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #16 (November 2010)</ref> Before the knowledge can be ripped from her mind, Selina's captors (revealed to be [[Shrike (comics)|Shrike]] and a new villain named Sempai), are eventually defeated by the other Sirens. Once Selina is freed, Talia orders Zatanna to wipe Bruce's identity from her memory, reasoning that her kidnapping has proved that the knowledge is too dangerous for her to handle.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #17 (December 2010)</ref>

After stealing the contents of a safe belonging to the Falcone crime family, Selina returns home to find Kitrina, a teenaged escape artist and Carmine Falcone's long lost daughter, breaking into her room. She attacks and subdues Kirtrina, who tells Selina that she had unknowingly stolen a map that details the location of the new Black Mask's underground bunker. Realizing that she could use the map to capture Black Mask and claim the 50 million dollar bounty on his head, Selina leaves Kitrina bound and gagged in a locked room so that she can keep the map for hersef.<ref>''Batman'' #695</ref> She later calls Batman to her house in order to turn the would-be thief over to the police, but discovers that Kitrina had managed to free herself and steal back the map. This impresses Selina, who mentions that she had tied up the child using an "inescapable" knot that Bruce had shown her years earlier.<ref>''Batman'' #696</ref> Following a massive battle with Black Mask and his henchmen (which ends with neither woman being able to claim the bounty), Selina agrees to take on Kitrina as her new sidekick, Catgirl.<ref>''Batman'' #697</ref>

<ref>''Batman'' #704</ref> Once Bruce Wayne returns from his time in the past, he establishes [[Batman Incorporated]], a global team of Batmen. Selina accompanies him on a mission to break into [[Doctor Sivana]]'s armory, and later travels with him to Tokyo in order to recruit a Japanese representative for Batman Inc.<ref>''Batman Inc'' #1</ref>

==Equipment==
===Weapons===
During the Silver Age, Catwoman, like most ''Batman'' villains, used a variety of themed weapons, vehicles, and equipment, such as a custom cat-themed car called the "Cat-illac". This usage also appeared in the 1960s ''Batman'' television series. In her post-''Crisis'' appearances, Catwoman's favored weapon is a whip. She wields both a standard bullwhip and the cat o' nine tails with expert proficiency. She uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use, and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation. She can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her. In addition, Catwoman has been shown to have various items to restrain her victims, such as a set of plastic ties for binding hands and feet, and a roll of [[duct tape]] used to [[gag]] her targets, like she did with Angle Man, Film Freak, Zatanna, and various others during her robberies over the years.

===Costume===
Catwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all. It was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a catsuit with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask. In the 1960s, Catwoman's catsuit was green in color, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a skintight purple catsuit, before switching to a black PVC catsuit that recalls [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s costume in ''Batman Returns'' (except not stitched together). In recent years, artists' depictions have usually alternated between those two costumes. Ed Brubaker, the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina's current costume was inspired by [[Emma Peel]]'s iconic leather catsuit in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' television series.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Man Behind The Cat - Exclusive Interview with Ed Brubaker | url=http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html | accessdate=June 10, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050528170818/http://www.geocities.com/selina_revamped/webpages/interview.html|archivedate=2005-05-28}}</ref> It has a more [[high tech]] look, with domino-shaped [[Thermography|infrared goggles]] on her cowl.

Many of her costumes have incorporated retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and sometimes on the toes of her boots. On rare occasions, she has also sported a cat's tail.

Holly Robinson uses the same costume Selina used prior to ''Infinite Crisis''.

==Other versions==
*Selina Kyle appears as an aging and somewhat overweight [[madam]]e in Frank Miller's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' four times; all are brief. First, in a phone message to Bruce ("Selina. Bruce, I'm lonely"). Next, she is attacked by the Joker, who uses a [[mind control]] drug to convince her to send one of her prostitutes to use the same substance on the Governor. The Joker then beats her, ties her up, gags her, and dresses her in a [[Wonder Woman]] outfit, leaving her for Batman to find. Selina's final appearance in the book is at Bruce Wayne's funeral, where she yells at [[Superman]], telling him that she knows who killed Bruce. She does not appear in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Miller's follow-up story, although she is referred to in the prologue written for the trade paperback version.

*Two 1990s prose novels feature Catwoman: ''The Further Adventures of Batman: Volume 3, Featuring Catwoman'',<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Further Adventures of Batman: Vol. 3, Featuring Catwoman | editor-last=Greenberg | editor-first=Martin H. | publisher=[[Bantam Books]] | date=February 1993 | isbn=978-0553560695}}</ref> a short story collection by various authors, and ''Catwoman: Tiger Hunt''.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Catwoman: Tiger Hunt | publisher=[[Warner Books]] | date=September 1992 | isbn=978-0446360432 | last1=Abbey | first1=Lynn | last2=Asprin | first2=Robert}}</ref> Both novels portray a ''Batman: Year One''-influenced Catwoman who wears a gray cat costume and was once a prostitute.

*Catwoman also made a small cameo in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', mostly accompanying the Riddler; she is predominantly seen, but not much heard in the series. She is not dressed in costume, but appears in the very dress she first wore in ''Batman'' #1 as The Cat. According to the novelization by [[Elliot S. Maggin]], she runs a multibillion dollar cosmetics company.

*In the all-digital graphic novel ''[[Batman: Digital Justice]]'', which is set some time in the future long after the original Batman has died, Sheila Romero, also known as the hit [[pop music]] star Gata (the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] female noun for "cat") and daughter of the Mayor of Gotham City, is jealous of the new Batman, James Gordon, because media coverage of his activities have been cutting into her airtime. Setting out to learn as much about Batman and his enemies as she can, Gata becomes the new Catwoman. Near the end of the story, Gata and her followers face off against Batman, but the two later fall in love, and Maria Romero, also known as Madame X, tells Sheila that she is really a [[cloning|clone]] of Maria. Maria confesses that she had planned to transfer her brain into Gata's body, but she could not bring herself to do it because she loved her "daughter" too much. Maria then dies in Sheila's arms.

*In the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' title ''[[Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham]]'', Selina Kyle is the daughter of millionaires Thomas and Martha Kyle. Walking home after seeing the film ''Cat People'', the young Selina chases after an alley cat and watches in horror as her parents are gunned down by a robber. Selina learns that the crook has stolen a ring she found in a [[Cracker Jack]] box and had given to her mother. Years later she becomes Catwoman, the defender of Gotham City, operating out of a Catcave beneath Kyle Manor, aided by a young maid named Brooks. Her major enemy is a [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] criminal named Batman, who beats her entire rogues gallery half-to-death to get rid of the competition.

*In the ''Elseworlds'' tale ''[[Batman: Claws of the Catwoman]]'', set in the 1930s, explorer and adventurer Finnegan Dent is revealed to be stealing the sacred artifacts of an African tribe. During an encounter with Batman and [[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]], a female thief, dressed as a cat, is revealed to be the princess of the tribe, as well as priestess of its cat-cult, trying to reclaim the artifacts.

*In ''Batman: Bloodstorm'', the sequel to ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', where Batman was forced to become a [[vampire]] to save Gotham from an attack by [[Dracula]], Selina is turned into a [[werecat]] after being bitten by one of the remaining vampires. Hunting for the monster that transformed her, Selina encounters Batman as he hunts for the remaining vampires, the two subsequently joining forces to eliminate the vampire horde. As they fight together, Batman finds that Selina's selfless love for him allows him to control his thirst for blood that had begun to consume him. She sacrifices herself to save him from the Joker, who had become the leader of the remaining vampires after Dracula's death, taking a crossbow bolt to the heart that the Joker had fired at Batman. Batman's grief and rage over her death causes him to finally lose control of his bloodlust as he drinks the Joker's blood. In ''Crimson Mist'' (''Bloodstorm''{{'}}s sequel), the corrupted Batman reflects grimly that he can no longer understand Selina's noble sacrifice after his psyche has become increasingly corrupted by his surrender to his vampire side.

*In [[Howard Chaykin]]'s ''[[Thrillkiller]]'', Selina Kyle is a stripper in a cat-themed strip club. She acts as an informant for [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] detective Bruce Wayne.

*In [[Dean Motter]]'s ''[[Batman: Nine Lives]]'', Selina Kyle is a cat-loving [[African American]] night club owner. Her death sets in motion the events of the story.

*In Howard Chaykin's ''[[Dark Allegiances]]'', Selina Kyle becomes a film star under the stage name of Kitty Grimalkin. Prior to becoming a star, she was an alcoholic whose actions during one of her "blackouts" were recorded into an underground [[pornography|porn]] film. The stills from the film are used to blackmail her into stealing information from [[Wayne Enterprises]].

*In [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]'s ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' Annual #2, [[Vicki Vale|Vikki Vale]], a reporter for Wayne Media, is Catwoman. She is hired by [[Anarky]] to steal information, but she gets caught and is tortured by [[Scarecrow (comics)|Jonathan Crane]], whom she calls a "demented scarecrow."

*In Frank Miller's ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'', Catwoman expresses an interest in the Joker's unrevealed plans. She also appears to be involved in [[sadomasochism]], as she advises the Joker that "even I don't play ''that'' rough."

*In [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]'s ''[[Batman: Two Faces]]'', Selina Kyle is a madame in 19th century Gotham, who defends streetwalkers in a mask, [[bustier]], and [[fishnet (material)|fishnets]] and occasionally works with amateur detective Bruce Wayne. Her costumed identity is unnamed, but resembles [[Black Canary]] more than Catwoman. She is attacked by the Joker and paralyzed, much like Barbara Gordon in the mainstream DC continuity.

*In ''Detective Comics'' Annual #7 (''[[Batman: Leatherwing]]'') by [[Chuck Dixon]], set in the 18th century Caribbean, Capitana Felina is a Spanish Contessa turned pirate, who rails against the chauvinism of her own crew. She initially teams up with the Laughing Man (Joker) against the English freebooter Captain Leatherwing (Batman), before turning to Leatherwing's side, and eventually marrying him.

*In ''[[Batman: In Darkest Knight]]'', in which Bruce Wayne becomes Earth's [[Green Lantern]], Selina Kyle takes on the role of [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]].

*In the ''Elseworlds'' story ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', featuring a world where costumed heroes have no symbol of inspiration as [[Superman]] was never recovered by the Kents, Catwoman is diagnosed by the head warden of Arkham Asylum as not being a true "criminal", but simply enjoying playing a "cat-and-mouse" game with Batman, donning her costume simply to attract his attention. During her time in Arkham, the Joker attacks the asylum armed with Kryptonian gauntlets provided by the story's secret villain, forcing the inmates to fight each other—Catwoman being the last one standing—before Batman arrives. Although the Joker uses his gauntlets to brutally murder Robin and Batgirl while forcing Batman to watch, Catwoman distracts him long enough for Batman to escape Joker's hold and destroy the gauntlets. He then proceeds to kill Joker in a trauma-induced rage, taking the gauntlets and Catwoman back to the Batcave. With Selina and Alfred having broken through Batman's grief, Selina becomes Batwoman and joins Batman in rescuing the JLA from captivity. Although Batman resigns from the League after he is cleared of the Joker's murder, even Catwoman's support cannot help him past his grief until the events of ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', where the two briefly travel into the afterlife to investigate recent supernatural disturbances with the aid of [[Deadman]], Batgirl, and Robin's spirits appearing to forgive their mentor for his failure to save them before he returns to life.

*A futuristic Catwoman appears in the new ''[[Batman Beyond (2010)|Batman Beyond]]'' comic series. Like the current Batman, [[Terry McGinnis]], the new Catwoman sports a high-tech costume complete with advanced gadgetry; although she claims to have had no real interest in Batman when she chose to go into action as Catwoman, stating that her reasons for assuming this identity are her own.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #2 (July 2010)</ref> She is subsequently hired by the new [[Hush (comics)#Batman Beyond|Hush]] to plant a tracking device on Batman, only for Hush to begin strangling her after "paying" her with a box full of playing cards, regarding her death as a continuation of his efforts to destroy Batman's "family" by killing his rogue's gallery,<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #3 (August 2010)</ref> only to be saved by Bruce Wayne's use of the 'Bat-Wraith' robots.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #4 (September 2010)</ref> She is revealed to be the daughter of the villain [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]], possessing her father's ability to create duplicates of herself, but limited to a maximum of 9 copies, explaining her adoption of the Catwoman moniker.<ref>''Batman Beyond'' #5 (October 2010)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
====1966 ''Batman'' series====
{{Main|Batman (TV series)}}
Catwoman was portrayed by [[Julie Newmar]] in 12 episodes of the live-action ''Batman'' television series of the 1960s, her first portrayal in a medium outside comic books. [[Eartha Kitt]] replaced her in Catwoman's final three episodes, with [[Lee Meriwether]] substituting for her in the 1966 motion picture, after producers learned that Newmar was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web | last=Smith | first=Ronald L. | title=Julie Newmar: The Very Last How to Book - Biography | year=2004 | url=http://www.julienewmar.com/biography.html | accessdate=June 22, 2007}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> An uncredited fourth actress played Catwoman as part of a cameo villain team-up in "The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra", the penultimate episode of the series.

In the [[Australia]]n sketch comedy series ''[[Fast Forward (TV series)|Fast Forward]]'', Batman was one of the many television series parodied. Lee Meriwether's portrayal of Catwoman was parodied by [[Gina Riley]], now famous for ''[[Kath & Kim]]''.

====''Birds of Prey''====
Selina Kyle appears, through flashbacks depicting her death, in the pilot episode of the 2002 television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''. The show featured Batman and Catwoman's daughter, the Huntress, also known as Helena Kyle. Maggie Baird portrayed Catwoman; in contrast to the comic book version, she is a [[metahuman]]. It is also mentioned that her sudden death (along with the paralyzing of Barbara Gordon at the hands of the Joker) sent Batman into self-imposed isolation.

===Film===
====''Batman Returns''====
{{Main|Batman Returns}}
Catwoman was portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer in the 1992 film ''Batman Returns''. As recreated by [[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]] and [[Tim Burton]], the Catwoman origin story is something of a variation on the original ''Catwoman'' miniseries. Here, Selina Kyle is depicted as the lonely, frustrated, yet dutiful and efficient secretary of corrupt tycoon [[Max Shreck]]. After she accidentally discovers his plot to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity, Shreck pushes her out the window of his top story office.  

[[File:Batmanreturnspostercatwoman.png|left|Movie poster for ''Batman Returns'' (1992) featuring [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Catwoman.|180px|thumb]] 

Mysteriously resuscitated by a group of alley cats after Shreck pushes her out a window, Selina Kyle's repressed rage allows her to transform into the clever [[supervillain]] Catwoman. She supposedly gains a super-natural power based on the superstition of cats having nine lives, saving her from death eight times throughout the film. Shortly following her transformation, she joins forces with the Penguin. As a masked vigilante operating under the guise of a theatrical public identity, Catwoman finds a reflection of herself in Batman, and around the same time, as Selina, falls in love and begins a romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne. In the ballroom scene, to [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' "Face to Face", the two masked crimefighters, Batman and Catwoman, dressed as their alter egos Bruce and Selina, discover each other's secret identities. In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], she electrocutes Shreck by kissing him with a taser in her mouth, after being shot multiple times and vanishes in the ensuing explosion after stating that she would still have one more life left for "next Christmas." Batman is unable to find her body, and she is presumed dead. She is seen one last time at the end of the film, however, looking at the [[Bat-Signal]] in the sky, confirming that she did indeed survive.

Catwoman is briefly mentioned by [[Chase Meridian|Dr. Chase Meridian]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'', stating she has done her homework on Batman, that he likes "strong women", and asks teasingly if "she needs skin-tight vinyl and a whip." Catwoman was to get her own film, where Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, but the film lingered in development limbo for years and then became 2004's ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' starring [[Halle Berry]]. A reference of Pfeiffer is seen in the Halle Berry film in the scene where Ophelia Powers shows Patience the many "Catwomen" and throws pictures on the floor, Pfeiffer as Catwoman being one of them.

====''Catwoman''====
[[File:Catwoman poster.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Halle Berry]] as Catwoman in the 2004 film.]]
{{Main|Catwoman (film)}}
In 2004, ''Catwoman'', a movie starring Halle Berry, was released. This film's Catwoman bore little resemblance to the comic book version, serving as the only protagonist in the film. Berry portrayed Patience Phillips, a woman who eventually became Catwoman after a near-death experience. Patience gained powers (which she does not have in the comics) from the [[Egypt]]ian cat goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]] through a gathering of cats led by an [[Egyptian Mau]]. The movie alludes to other women in the past who have been granted such cat-like abilities, particularly in a scene in which Patience finds herself amongst a series of images of prior Catwomen, including Pfeiffer's ''Batman Returns'' version of Selina Kyle. The film's story has nothing to do with Batman or Gotham City.

Berry won the 2005 [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie]] award for worst actress in a film for her role as Catwoman, and accepted the prize in person. She was only the third Razzie winner (following director [[Paul Verhoeven]], director of ''[[Showgirls]]''; and [[Tom Green]], star of ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'') ever to do so. She brought her ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' [[Academy Award|Oscar]] with her for her acceptance speech.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.razzies.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=355&PN=1&TPN=1 | title=Halle Berry at the 25th Razzies | work=Razzie Awards | date=December 5, 2005}}</ref>

===Animation===
Catwoman has been a major character in almost all of Batman's animated series. Her first animated appearance was with Batman in segments of the 1968 series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' wearing her green costume of that time period. In this series, she was voiced by Jane Webb. She also appeared in four episodes of the animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' in the 1970s, in which she was voiced by [[Melendy Britt]].

====DC Animated Universe====
=====''Batman: The Animated Series''=====
{{Main|Batman: The Animated Series}}
[[File:Catwoman BTAS.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Catwoman, and Isis, as seen in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.]]
Catwoman appeared on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' wearing an all gray outfit. Voiced by [[Adrienne Barbeau]] in both 1992's ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and its revamp in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' (as well as the 2000s online animated series ''[[Gotham Girls]]''), Selina Kyle is shown to be a socialite and [[animal rights]] activist, which attracts the attention of Bruce Wayne when he's not contending with her as Batman.  Catwoman also flirts with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] in "You Scratch My Back".  However, at the end of the episode, it is revealed that she was just using Nightwing in order to steal an artifact. In many of the episodes featuring Kyle, she is accompanied by her assistant named Maven, who aids both of Kyle's identities. She also is shown to keep many cats, among those is her favorite cat Isis who would appear there and in later series such as ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. As Catwoman's cat, she even fought the dogs of [[Krypto|Superman]] and [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Batman]], as well as [[Streaky the Supercat]], on ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', a cartoon made by the same people who made the [[DC animated universe]].

Initially, Kyle had blonde hair, coinciding with the release of ''Batman Returns'', in which she was portrayed by blonde actress Michelle Pfeiffer. In the revamp, she appears to have shorter black hair. Whether her hair was dyed or her natural color was never made clear in the series itself, however in the episode "Tyger, Tyger", Kyle becomes a cat/woman [[parahuman|hybrid]] and her hair (or rather fur) is blonde, thanks to [[genetic engineering]] by [[Emile Dorian|Dr. Emile Dorian]]. In the related comic book series, it is explained that after learning that her hair dye was tested on animals, she drops the brand and tries, unsuccessfully, to change the views of the manager of the company.<ref>''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' #4</ref>

Finally, in a seven-minute short film called ''[[Chase Me]]'' (written by [[Paul Dini]] and released with the ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' [[DVD]]), Batman catches her stealing from one of Bruce Wayne's buildings and apprehends her.

Like all other characters, Catwoman would have a new design during ''The New Batman Adventures''. Her new in-costume animated appearance also changed when the show's animation style did, becoming more like the Michelle Pfeiffer version, with a black costume, slimmer build, and white face makeup (despite her hair now black). Details on her change are explored in ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' #4.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/tnba/guides/ga | title=Comic Guide - ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' | work=The World's Finest}}</ref>

=====''Batman Beyond''=====
In 1999, Selina Kyle was wistfully mentioned in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' episode "[[wikiasite:DCanimated:Dead Man's Hand|Dead Man's Hand]]" by Bruce Wayne to Terry McGinnis when Terry asks Bruce if he ever fell in love with a female criminal as he did with [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)#Melanie Walker/Ten|Ten]] of the [[Royal Flush Gang]].

=====''Justice League Unlimited''=====
In 2005, Selina Kyle comes up again in a conversation between Terry McGinnis and Bruce Wayne in the television series, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' within a dream sequence. In "[[wikiasite:DCanimated:Epilogue|Epilogue]]", Terry McGinnis tells Bruce Wayne that Selina loved him, but that Bruce gave up on her, due to his persistent devotion to "the mission." Bruce claims it was because she did not have "the heart" to stick to the mission, which can be interpreted as that at some point Selina had reformed and joined the Bat family. As McGinnis referred to Selina by her first name, it can be assumed that he met her at some point after the final episode of ''Batman Beyond'' offscreen.

=====''The Batman Adventures''=====
In the comic series ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'', Selina is featured in issue #10; in the back up story she breaks into a vault at the Wayne Manor during Bruce's New Year's Ball. After she has left the scene, Bruce tells [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] that he felt betrayed, stating that he was the only one of Gotham's high society not to shun her after she was unmasked. He is reassured of her friendship, however, when he finds she has stolen nothing and has left him a card stating her New Year's resolution is to stay on the right side of the law. After Robin questions her sincerity, Bruce states that he believes she will keep her promise.

====''The Batman''====
[[File:TBCatwoman.png|thumb|100px|left|Catwoman, as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Catwoman has also appeared on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Gina Gershon]]. Her design is slightly altered, having large ears and orange goggles that resemble cat's eyes. Another modification is her hood, which can be pulled up to hide the lower half of her face. Catwoman is also given exaggerated claws on her gloves. The rest of her suit is black, with the exception of her red "paws." She carries her whip around her waist that hangs like a tail. In her civilian identity of Selina Kyle, she has long black hair and blue eyes, instead of her more traditional green eyes. Selina's day job is as a charity fund raiser, in which capacity she meets Bruce Wayne. She flirts with Batman, and in her first appearance steals his utility belt, accidentally gaining control of a giant bat-robot and wrecking the [[Batcave]]. In later episodes, she teams up with the Penguin, fights [[Rag Doll (comics)|Rag Doll]], and tries to help Batman against the Joker. In her final appearance, she is kidnapped by [[List of villains in The Batman#Rumor|Rumor]], but gets away.

====''Krypto the Superdog''====
As stated above, in the animated cartoon series ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', Catwoman's pet cat [[List of characters in Krypto the Superdog#Villains|Isis]] is a recurring foe of [[Krypto (comics)|Krypto]], [[Streaky the Supercat]], and [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. However, unlike her DCAU counterpart, Isis is portrayed as a siamese cat rather than a black cat.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold====
[[File:CatwomanB&B.jpg|Catwoman, as she appears in ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''.|160px|thumb|right]]
Catwoman appears in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]. In "Legends of the Dark Mite!", she makes a cameo as one of the villains in [[Bat-Mite]]'s imagination. In "Hail the Tornado Tyrant!", she makes a silent appearance in the teaser after Batman and [[Green Arrow]] chase the Joker, and robs a museum while escaping in a panther airplane. Prior to the sequel teaser, they get knocked out. The episode "Inside the Outsiders!" is a sequel to this teaser, where Batman and Green Arrow are trapped by Catwoman and her henchmen. Catwoman flirts with Batman, while he hopes to rehabilitate her, and Green Arrow watches in disgust. They both escape and defeat her and the henchmen; but Catwoman escapes and leaves her number with Batman, telling him to "call her." She reappears in "Death Race to Oblivion!" as one of the heroes and villains kidnapped by [[Mongul]] and forced into his race across the desert. Utilizing a high-tech "Catmobile" equipped with various weapons and gadgets, Catwoman attempts to knock the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] out of the race by destroying her motorcycle. Unfortunately for her, Huntress outsmarts her and Catwoman ends up being taken out herself when her car is forced off a cliff. At the end of the episode, she and the rest of the villains are shown captured in a sphere created by [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]'s power ring. She appears in "The Mask of Matches Malone!" along with [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] and [[Black Canary]]. She also appears in "The Knights of Tomorrow!" in a 'what if?' story by Alfred Pennyworth, in which she and Batman fall in love and marry.

She tried to get the Penguin to steal a jewel and was defeated by Batman, but not before sharing a kiss with him, which Robin found disgusting. She later escaped jail and told Penguin to build a machine, but they were again defeated. She then kissed Batman again, flipped backwards, and went home to Arkham. She is shown as being very cat-like and proficient with a whip, as demonstrated when she snatches a fish from the Penguin's plate.

====''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe''====

Though her role in the game is small, her story begins as she is approached by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] after stealing from the Gotham Museum. Though he defeats her in combat, she reclaims her purloined jewel after an intervention from [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], and whilst she makes her escape she gets pulled into a portal that teleports her to The Special Forces base in the Mortal Kombat universe. Here, she finds [[Sonya (Mortal Kombat)|Sonya Blade]], and requests to use the base's portal to return to Gotham. Sonya defeats her in battle however, and locks her away in a cell. She is eventually set free when [[Lex Luthor]] is also captured, and they aid each other in escaping. The two form an alliance, approaching both [[Deathstroke]] and the Joker and recruiting them for the battle against the invading warriors. With their help, she assists Batman and his allies in the battle against Dark Khan.
