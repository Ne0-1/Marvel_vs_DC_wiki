'''''Batroc the Leaper''''' is a [[fiction]]al [[villain]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''Tales of Suspense'' #75.


==Character biography==

Georges Batroc is a [[French people|French]] costumed [[mercenary]] who specializes in [[Savate]], a form of [[kickboxing]]. Usually considered an enemy of [[Captain America]], he has also faced up against the [[Punisher]], [[Deadpool]], [[Hawkeye]], [[Iron Fist]], and [[Gambit]]. He was beaten by all of them in less than 5 minutes. Captain America once laid Batroc out with one single punch.

His stereotypical accent (''"Batroc ze Leapair"''), funny name (Batroc resembles "Batrachia", the animal order to which [[frog]]s belong to), clumsy vocabulary with the tendency to insert whole French words (which are sometimes erroneous, such as ''"mon capitan"''), [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]]-like moustache, lack of superpowers, and inability to win a fight have made him into more of a [[comedy]] character than anything else. However, he has functioned as a member of [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] (one of the stronger recurring villain teams that plague the heroes of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]). Batroc was also a member of the ersatz '''Defenders''', who should not be confused with the actual [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] they were mimicking.

In more recent years some writers have attempted in casting Batroc in different light. In an issue of [[Mark Waid]]’s run on [[Captain America]] he was portrayed as a comical, but super talented martial artist capable of holding his own against [[Hawkeye]] and the good captain at the same time. Years later during [[George Pérez]] and [[Kurt Busiek]]’s long awaited JLA/Avengers crossover Batroc actually managed to briefly get the drop on [[Batman]]. Most recently Ze Leaper showed up as member of a small army of villains organized by [[Klaw]] to invade [[Wakanda]] which included [[Rhino]], Radioactive Man, the Cannibal, and the villainous [[Black Knight]] Sporting a very stylish new costume designed by [[John Romita, Jr.]] Batroc served as [[Klaw]]’s top lieutenant, however he was still ultimately defeated by [[Black Panther]]’s royal bodyguards.  [[Batroc’s Brigade]] also appeared in Marvel’s recent [[Great Lakes Avengers]] mini-series.

Batroc has a daughter who is teamed in villainy with the daughter of similar B-list supervillain [[Tarantula (comics)|Tarantula]]. Both daughters take their fathers' respective costumes and titles. In the [[Agent X]] series by Marvel Comics, the [[Taskmaster]] expresses his shock that Tarantula and Batroc are heterosexual before soundly beating the two female villains (this is, of course, a joke about the likelihood of Batroc fathering children in light of his over-the-top flamboyance).

==Powers and abilities==
Batroc has no superhuman abilities, but is in peak physical condition in every respect. He is an olympic level weight lifter capable of pressing at least 500 pounds and has extraordinary agility and reflexes. His leg muscles are particularly well developed enabling him to leap great distances with the aquity of an olympic athlete. He is ''allegedly'' an expert hand-to-hand combatant and specializes in savate (french kick boxing). He is also a highly skilled military tactician. Batroc is also known to be highly proficient in the art of interior design.

==Quotes==
Batroc uses many French terms which may strike even the American reader who makes up most of Marvel's audience as stereotypical; a native speaker of French may find Batroc's dialogue not only stereotypical but hilariously badly translated:
*''"Zut alors!"'' (Batroc uses this term even in a totally inappropriate context)
*''"Sacre Bleu!"''
*''"Alas, you are too sensitive, mon cher! But, c'est la vie!"''
*''"Nom du chien! Your insolence is insupportable-- insufferable!! For zat you shall pay un mille fois!"'' (Batroc should say "Nom d'un chien" and he shouldn't use the "un" for "mille fois")
*''"Is it not très formidable!"'' (Batroc shouldn't use the "très")
*''"Ah, mon pauvre petit!"''

Batroc inserts so much French words/terms in his speaking that Captain America even told him once: ''"Who gave you your English lessons? [[Doctor Doom]]?"''
