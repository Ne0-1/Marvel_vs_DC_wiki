'''Batroc the Leaper''' ('''Georges Batroc''') is a [[fiction]]al [[villain]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''Tales of Suspense''  #75.

==Publication history==
Batroc's stereotypical accent (''"Batroc ze Leapair"''), and funny name (Batroc resembles "Batrachia", the animal order to which [[frog]]s belong), along with his clumsy vocabulary which has the tendency to insert whole French words (which are sometimes erroneous, ex.  ''"mon capitan"''), [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]]-like moustache, lack of superpowers, and an apparent inability to win a fight have made him a very comedic character.{{Or|date=September 2008}}

In more recent years, some writers have attempted casting Batroc in different light. In an issue of [[Mark Waid]]’s run on [[Captain America]] he was portrayed as a comical but highly talented martial artist capable of holding his own against [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the Captain at the same time. 

Sporting a new costume designed by [[John Romita, Jr.]], Batroc served as [[Klaw]]'s top lieutenant in the first arc of the 2005 re-launch of ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Georges Batroc was born in [[Marseille]], [[France]], and served in the [[French Foreign Legion]].  He is a [[French people|French]] costumed [[mercenary]] who specializes in [[savate]] (also known as "[[La Boxe Française]]"), a form of [[kickboxing]]. Although he has primarily appeared in the pages of ''[[Captain America]]'', he has also faced off against the [[Punisher]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. Batroc has occasionally led his own team, "Batroc's Brigade", whose membership has changed over time. The group has primarily fought Captain America.

He has functioned as a member of [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] (one of the stronger recurring villain teams that plague the heroes of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]).{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In Batroc's first appearance, he was hired by [[HYDRA|THEM]] to steal the Inferno-42 cylinder.  He first battled [[Captain America]] during this mission.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #75-76</ref> He was again hired by HYDRA and abducted [[Sharon Carter]] for them.  He lured Captain America into a rematch, and again lost.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #85</ref>

Batroc was then hired by a foreign power to locate a "seismo-bomb" with the original Batroc's Brigade (consisting of the original [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and the [[Living Laser]]). Batroc battled Captain America again.<ref>''Captain America'' #105</ref> The [[Machinesmith]]'s [[Baron Strucker]] android known as "the Hood" then hired a new Batroc's Brigade (consisting of [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]) to battle Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #130</ref>

Batroc then formed a third Batroc's Brigade, which consisted of various unnamed henchmen rather than known supervillains. [[Jakar (comics)|Jakar]] hired this group to abduct children from New York and to battle Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].  Batroc later turned against Jakar, and aided Captain America and the Falcon against him.<ref>''Captain America'' #149-150</ref> [[Ward Meachum]] then hired Batroc's Brigade, who battled [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and a ninja warrior.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #20</ref>

For a while after that, Batroc operated without the Batroc's Brigade. Alongside an extra-dimensional [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] ally, Batroc attempted a theft of [[transuranium]], but was stopped by Captain America and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #52</ref> Batroc was also a member of the ersatz "Defenders", a group of villains who were impersonating the actual [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. They committed robberies while posing as members of the Defenders, until stopped by a Defenders contingent.<ref>''Defenders'' #63-64</ref> Alongside [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], Batroc attempted an extortion scheme.  He battled Captain America, but then turned against Mister Hyde and aided Captain America against him.<ref>''Captain America'' #251-252</ref>

Batroc then formed a new, longer-lasting lineup of Batroc's Brigade - this one consisting of [[Zaran#Zaran (Maximillian Zaran)|Zaran the Weapons Master]] and [[Machete (comics)|Machete]]. This team was first seen when [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] contracted them to steal [[Captain America's shield]].<ref>''Captain America'' #302-303</ref> [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to battle [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3</ref> [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to acquire the fragments of the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]].  They battled Captain America and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' #357-362</ref> Alongside [[Snakebite (comics)|Snakebite]], Batroc also battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' #67</ref>

Later, the Leaper showed up as member of a small army of villains organized by [[Klaw]] to invade [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], which included [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], the [[Cannibal (comics)|Cannibal]], and the villainous [[Black Knight (comics)#Vatican Black Knight|Black Knight]].  However, he was still ultimately defeated by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s royal bodyguards.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Batroc was next seen as an inmate of the extremely high-security prison The Cage. The prison sports a field that mentally suppresses inmates' abilities to use their superpowers. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] states: "It doesn't matter how big you were on the outside. In here, combat experience is everything. Thugs like [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] and [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]] might throw their weight around, but they'd never even dream of touching the big shots. Guys like Batroc and [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]]. Yeah, I know."{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Batroc has a daughter who is teamed in villainy with the daughter of similar B-list supervillain [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. Both daughters take their fathers' respective costumes and titles. The [[Taskmaster]] expresses his shock that Tarantula and Batroc are heterosexual before soundly beating the two villains' offspring, tossing them effortlessly off of a building, noting that he also "hates ethnic stereotypes."<ref>''Agent X'' #6</ref>

Batroc is mentioned to have faced the Runaways when he came to Los Angeles looking to take over after the deaths of the supervillain group known as the Pride. He was apparently defeated quickly, as he is referred to as "Batroc the Loser."{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Batroc briefly served among the group of villains forcibly drafted into [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] army. However after returning to federal custody, Batroc registered with the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]]<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1.</ref><ref>http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map</ref> and was sent to a superhuman training facility located at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in [[Virginia]] to train recruits in [[martial art]]s<ref>''Iron Man'' #14</ref> before being transferred over to [[Camp Hammond]]<ref name="battledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & Ronald Byrd | Penciller =  | Inker =  | Story =  | Title = [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War Battle Damage Report]] | Issue = one-shot |date= March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>.

Batroc later returned to his mercenary life, confronting the [[Bucky|new Captain America]] while on a job to steal an item from the [[United Nations]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #43</ref> Also, he was working with [[The Man with No Face]], a mysterious being from Captain America's past.<ref>''Captain America'' vol 5 #44</ref> It is soon revealed that Batroc was stealing the remains of the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] for reverse engineering.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #45</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Batroc has no superhuman abilities, but is in peak physical condition in every respect. He is an Olympic-level [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]] and has extraordinary agility and reflexes. His leg muscles are particularly well developed enabling him to leap great distances with the equity of an Olympic athlete. He is an expert hand-to-hand combatant and specializes in [[savate]] (French-style kickboxing). He is also a skilled military tactician, having formerly been in the French Foreign Legion.

Batroc is also an experienced thief and smuggler, and can speak both French and English.
