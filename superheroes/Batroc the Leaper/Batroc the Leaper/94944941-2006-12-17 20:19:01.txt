'''Batroc the Leaper''' ('''Georges Batroc''') is a [[fiction]]al [[villain]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 2 #75.

==Fictional character biography==
Batroc was born in [[Marseille]], [[France]], and served in the [[French Foreign Legion]].  He is a [[French people|French]] costumed [[mercenary]] who specializes in [[Savate]], a form of [[kickboxing]]. Although he has primarily appeared in the pages of ''[[Captain America]]'', he has also faced off against the [[Punisher]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Iron Fist]], and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].

His stereotypical accent (''"Batroc ze Leapair"''), funny name (Batroc resembles "Bat-Rock" or "Batrachia", the animal order to which [[frog]]s belong to), clumsy vocabulary with the tendency to insert whole French words (which are sometimes erroneous, such as ''"mon capitan"''), [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]]-like moustache, lack of superpowers, and inability to win a fight have made him into more of a comedic character than anything else. However, he has functioned as a member of [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] (one of the stronger recurring villain teams that plague the heroes of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]). Batroc was also a member of the ersatz "Defenders", a group of villains who were impersonating the actual [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

Batroc has occasionally led his own team, "Batroc's Brigade", whose membership has changed over time. The group has included the original [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[Zaran|Zaran the Weapons Master]], [[Machete (comics)|Machete]], and various unnamed henchmen. The group has primarily fought Captain America<ref>[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]]'' #1</ref>

In more recent years, some writers have attempted in casting Batroc in different light. In an issue of [[Mark Waid]]’s run on [[Captain America]] he was portrayed as a comical but highly talented martial artist capable of holding his own against [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the Captain at the same time. Years later, during [[George Pérez]] and [[Kurt Busiek]]’s long awaited ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' crossover, Batroc actually managed to briefly get the drop on [[Batman]]. Most recently, the Leaper showed up as member of a small army of villains organized by [[Klaw]] to invade [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], which included [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], the [[Cannibal (comics)|Cannibal]], and the villainous [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]].  Sporting a new costume designed by [[John Romita, Jr.]], Batroc served as Klaw’s top lieutenant. However, he was still ultimately defeated by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]’s royal bodyguards.

Batroc also appeared briefly in a Wolverine story as an inmate of the extremely high-security prison The Cage. The prison sports a field that mentally suppresses inmates' abilities to use their superpowers. Narrating, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] explains that: "It doesn't matter how big you were on the outside. In here, combat experience is everything. Thugs like [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] and [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]] might throw their weight around, but they'd never even dream of touching the big shots. Guys like Batroc and [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]]. Yeah, I know."

Batroc has a daughter who is teamed in villainy with the daughter of similar B-list supervillain [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. Both daughters take their fathers' respective costumes and titles. In the ''[[Agent X]]'' series, the [[Taskmaster]] expresses his shock that Tarantula and Batroc are heterosexual before soundly beating two villains' offspring.

Recently, Batroc was shown to be among the group of villains forcibly drafted into [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team.

==Powers and abilities==
Batroc has no superhuman abilities, but is in peak physical condition in every respect. He is an Olympic-level weight lifter capable of pressing at least 500 pounds and has extraordinary agility and reflexes. His leg muscles are particularly well developed enabling him to leap great distances with the equity of an Olympic athlete. He is an expert hand-to-hand combatant and specializes in savate (french kick boxing). He is also a highly skilled military tactician, having formerly been in the French Foreign Legion.

==Quotes==
Batroc uses many French terms which may strike even the American reader who makes up most of Marvel's audience as stereotypical; a native speaker of French may find Batroc's dialogue not only stereotypical but hilariously badly translated:
*''"Zut alors!"'' (Batroc uses this term even in a totally inappropriate context)
*''"Sacre Bleu!"''
*''"Alas, you are too sensitive, mon cher! But, c'est la vie!"''
*''"Nom du chien! Your insolence is insupportable-- insufferable!! For zat you shall pay un mille fois!"'' (Batroc should say "Nom d'un chien" and he shouldn't use the "un" for "mille fois")
*''"Is it not très formidable!"'' (Batroc shouldn't use the "très")
*''"Ah, mon pauvre petit!"''

Batroc inserts so much mangled French terminology into his speech, that Captain America once asked him: ''"Who gave you your English lessons? [[Doctor Doom]]?"''
