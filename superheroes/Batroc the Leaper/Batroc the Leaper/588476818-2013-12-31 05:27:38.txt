==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Batroc, created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #75 in March 1966. He has reappeared in various Marvel titles ever since. <ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #75</ref>

Sporting a new costume designed by [[John Romita, Jr.]], Batroc served as [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]]'s top lieutenant in the first arc of the 2005 re-launch of [[Reginald Hudlin]]'s ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]''. <ref>''Black Panther'' #1</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Georges Batroc was born in [[Marseille]], [[France]], and served in the [[French Foreign Legion]].  He is a [[French people|French]] costumed [[mercenary]] who specializes in [[savate]] (also known as "[[La Boxe Française]]"), a form of [[kickboxing]]. Although he has primarily appeared in the pages of ''[[Captain America]]'', he has also faced off against the [[Punisher]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. Batroc has occasionally led his own team "Batroc's Brigade" although membership has changed over time. The group has primarily fought Captain America.

In the character's first appearance, he was hired by [[HYDRA|THEM]] to steal the Inferno-42 cylinder. He first battled [[Captain America]] during this mission. When Batroc introduced himself with typical bluster, Cap revealed, to Batroc's delight, that he had already heard of the mercenary: "Batroc the Leaper, eh? A master of la savate, the French art of boxing with the feet!"<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #75-76</ref> Later, he was again hired by HYDRA and abducted [[Sharon Carter]] for them. He lured Captain America into a rematch, in which he insisted Hydra not intervene, and again lost; however, when Hydra agents prepared to kill both Cap and himself, Batroc, incensed at such "men wizout honair," switched sides to help Cap against Hydra.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #85</ref> In both of these stories, Batroc was regarded as a deadly combatant, his skill respected by enemies and employers alike.

Batroc was then hired by a foreign power to locate a "seismo-bomb" with the first known Batroc's Brigade (consisting of the original [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and the [[Living Laser]]). Batroc battled Captain America again.<ref>''Captain America'' #105</ref> The [[Machinesmith]]'s [[Baron Strucker]] android known as "the Hood" then hired a new Batroc's Brigade (consisting of [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]) to battle Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #130</ref>

Batroc then formed a third Batroc's Brigade, which consisted of various unnamed henchmen rather than known supervillains since supervillains had failed Batroc in the past. The alien [[Jakar (comics)|Jakar]], concealing his true nature and intent, hired this group to abduct children from New York and to battle Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. Although Batroc felt no compunction about abducting children, upon learning Jakar's true nature and his intent to use the children's souls to revive his comatose race, he felt his "sense of honair" had been violated by the deception, and he again switched sides, aiding Captain America and the Falcon to rescue the children.<ref>''Captain America'' #149-150</ref> [[Ward Meachum]] then hired Batroc's Brigade, who battled [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and a ninja warrior, several Brigade members dying in the process.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #20</ref>

For a while after that, Batroc operated without a Brigade. Alongside an extra-dimensional [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] ally, Batroc attempted a theft of [[transuranium]], but was stopped by Captain America and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #52</ref> Batroc was also a member of the ersatz "Defenders", a group of villains who were impersonating the actual [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. They committed robberies while posing as members of the Defenders, until stopped by a Defenders contingent.<ref>''Defenders'' #63-64</ref> Alongside [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], Batroc attempted an extortion scheme against Manhattan.  He battled Captain America, but when Mister Hyde decided to carry out the threat, which would kill thousands, Batroc, again showing that there were some lines he would not cross, aided Captain America against Hyde, saving the city.<ref>''Captain America'' #251-252</ref>

Batroc then formed a new, longer-lasting lineup of Batroc's Brigade - this one consisting of [[Zaran#Zaran|Zaran the Weapons Master]] and [[Machete (comics)|Machete]]. This team was first seen when [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] contracted them to steal Captain America's [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and Batroc finally succeeded.<ref>''Captain America'' #302-303</ref> [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to battle [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3</ref> [[Baron Helmut Zemo]] then hired Batroc's Brigade to acquire the fragments of the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]. They battled Captain America and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' #357-362</ref> Alongside [[Snakebite (comics)|Snakebite]], Batroc also battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' #67</ref>

Later, the Leaper showed up as member of a small army of villains organized by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] to invade [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], which included [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], the [[Cannibal (comics)|Cannibal]], and the villainous [[Black Knight (comics)#Vatican Black Knight|Black Knight]].  He was defeated by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s royal bodyguards.<ref>''Black Panther'' #1-6 (2005)</ref>

During the crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Batroc briefly confronted [[Batman]] when he was one of the villains recruited by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] for his army. The Dark Knight defeated him (off-panel) with great difficulty.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

Batroc has a daughter who is teamed in villainy with the daughter of similar B-list supervillain [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. Both daughters take their fathers' respective costumes and titles. [[Taskmaster]] expresses his shock that Tarantula and Batroc are heterosexual before soundly beating the two villains' offspring, tossing them effortlessly off of a building, noting that he also "hates ethnic stereotypes."<ref>''Agent X'' #6</ref>

Batroc briefly served among the group of villains forcibly drafted into [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] army. But after returning to federal custody, Batroc registered with the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]],<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |title=Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> and was sent to a superhuman training facility located at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in [[Virginia]] to train recruits in [[martial art]]s<ref>''Iron Man'' #14</ref> before being transferred over to [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref name="battledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & Ronald Byrd | Penciller =  | Inker =  | Story =  | Title = [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War Battle Damage Report]] | Issue = one-shot |date= March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Ultimately, however, Batroc found government work unsatisfactory and returned to his mercenary life, confronting the new [[Bucky|Captain America]] while on a job to steal an item from the [[United Nations]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #43</ref> Also, he was working with [[The Man with No Face]], a mysterious being from Captain America's past.<ref>''Captain America'' vol 5 #44</ref> It is soon revealed that Batroc was stealing the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]'s remains for reverse engineering.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #45</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Batroc the Leaper has no superhuman abilities, but is in peak physical condition in every respect. He is an Olympic-level [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]] and has extraordinary agility and reflexes. His leg muscles are particularly well developed enabling him to leap great distances equal to an Olympic athlete. He is an expert hand-to-hand combatant and specializes in [[savate]] (French-style kickboxing). He is also a skilled military tactician, having formerly been in the French Foreign Legion.

Batroc is also an experienced thief and smuggler, and can speak both French and English. Although, as a mercenary, he does not hesitate to perform any number of criminal acts for his clients, Batroc has, by his own rights, a strong sense of honor, and he will turn against any client whom he feels has unfairly deceived him into committing crimes to which he might not otherwise have agreed.
