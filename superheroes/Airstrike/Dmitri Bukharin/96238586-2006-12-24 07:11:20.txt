'''Dmitri Bukharin''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Dmitri was born in [[Kuibyshev]], Russia.  He became the fifth [[Crimson Dynamo]] when KGB stripped the previous Crimson Dynamo of his armor and gave it to Dmitri. Dmitri joined the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]], but was expelled when his teammates learned of his loyalty to the government that had betrayed them. He later joined the [[Supreme Soviets]], a group of superhumans who were loyal to the Soviet government; the group became the People's Protectorate after the USSR dissolved. 

Colonel-General Valentin Shatalov used his rank to obtain the Crimson Dynamo from Dmitri Bukharin for his own use. When the government confiscated his armor, Dmitri designed a new suit of armor and adopted the codename Airstrike.
