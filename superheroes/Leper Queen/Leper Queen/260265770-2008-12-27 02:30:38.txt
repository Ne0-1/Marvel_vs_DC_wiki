'''The Leper Queen''' is a fictional villain of the [[Marvel Universe]]. She's the leader of the [[Sapien League]], an extremist anti-mutant organization similar to the [[Friends of Humanity]].

== History ==
=== The Mutant Daughter ===
The Leper Queen was five months pregnant with her daughter Lucia Page when a [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] passed by and her daughter started to move.  When she was a few months old, Lucia could already create sparks. At two years old of age, she set fire to their house which resulted in her dying and the face of her mother being burned. It was then that the Leper Queen decided to kill all mutants.

=== Decimation ===
The day after [[Decimation|M-Day]], the Leper Queen attacked the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] with the [[Sapien League]]. She was first seen attacking [[Mammomax]], [[Erg (comics)|Erg]], and [[Peepers]] who were racing to Xavier's mansion for sanctuary. The Sapien League attempted to burn them to death by tying them to [[St. Andrew's cross]]es. They were stopped by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] who had seen the smoke from their attacks. After this failure, she led an attack on the mansion itself. It was only by the combined efforts of the [[X-Men]] and the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E| O*N*E*]] that the Sapien League were stopped. During the fight, [[Iceman (comics)| Iceman]] was captured. When the Leper Queen tried to execute him, his sudden regaining of his powers causes her arm to freeze. This caused her to flee, attacking both [[Outlaw (comics)| Outlaw]] and Peepers in her escape.

After tracking [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] and [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]] (who have left the institute in search of Lorna's powers) to [[Puerto Rico]], members of the Sapien League were attacked by Havok who stopped their assault on an old man. They then called the Leper Queen, who was visiting the grave of her daughter. She arrived to kill Havok and Polaris, but was stopped by Havok who had just killed Daap, an alien who had crash landed which bore a striking resemblance to former [[X-Statix]] member [[Doop (comics)|Doop]].

=== Post- Messiah Complex ===

Previews to X-Force #3 reveal that the Leper Queen, alongside other prominent anti-mutant leaders, have been forcibly recruited into the ranks of the [[Purifiers]]. She's saved before being executed in the [[electric chair]] for the murder of two girls in [[Guatemala]] and infected with the [[Transmode Virus]] by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]].

===Personality===
During the Sapien League's attack on the mansion, it is said that she completely hates mutants and has been on many mutant hunts. Her mission in life is to kill all mutants in reparation for her daughter's death. It is also stated that she hides her burnt face with a mask and that if anyone sees it she will kill them.

== Powers and Abilities ==
The Leper Queen has a competent ability with weapons. She is also a skilled fighter.
