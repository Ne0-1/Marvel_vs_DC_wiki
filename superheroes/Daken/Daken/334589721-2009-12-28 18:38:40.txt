'''Daken''' ('''Akihiro''') is a [[fictional character]] within the {{Marvel Universe}}. Daken is the [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] son of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and his deceased wife [[Itsu (comics)|Itsu]]. He possesses a power set similar to his father (e.g., healing factor, retractable claws), and is currently a member of the [[Dark Avengers]] under the name '''Wolverine'''.

==Publication history==
Daken first appeared in ''Wolverine Origins #10''. He becomes a member of the [[Dark Avengers]], as part of ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'', taking the role of his father.<ref name=osbsupda>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19654 "The Osborn Supremacy: Dark Avengers]", [[Comic Book Resources]], January 22, 2008</ref> The character also becomes the lead in the ''Wolverine'' series, which becomes ''Dark Wolverine'' in issue #75.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19880 NYCC: Way and Liu Talk ''Dark Wolverine''], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 6, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020907-Dark-WOlverine.html NYCC '09 - Way & Liu on 'Dark Wolverine'], [[Newsarama]], February 7, 2009</ref> [[Brian Bendis]], writer of ''Dark Avengers'' has said:

{{cquote|Daken is one of the best things to come out of 'Origins,' and what better way to piss off his father? He's an iconic and legacy character attached to a number of cool things in the Marvel Universe, but he really hasn't had a lot of face time with it. So we can really roll up our sleeves and see what we've got there and help create a character.<ref name=osbsupda />}}

As part of the team he is also a part of the crossover ''[[Dark X-Men|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia]]''.<ref name=cbr21488>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21488 |title=IRON PATRIOTISM: Daken |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|date=June 2009}}

After Itsu's death, a mysterious man wearing a trench coat that conceals his identity cuts baby Daken from his mother's womb and leaves her body lying on the floor. Many years later, it is revealed that Daken survived the horrible incident due to inheriting his father's healing factor.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #6</ref> After being cut from his mother's womb, sometime in the year 1946, he's placed at the doorstep of Akihira and Natsumi, a wealthy young and traditional Japanese couple. They take his presence as an answer to their prayers and raise him as their own. Though he is named Akihiro by his father, the servants and other families of the province secretly refer to the boy as Daken ({{lang|ja|駄犬}}, "bastard dog" or "mongrel"), a slur on his obvious mixed heritage. As Akihiro grows, he is often teased by the other boys of the village. His harsh treatment over the years causes Akihiro to develop a very cold personality, directed at everyone except his father. One night, Natsumi confesses to Akihira that she doesn't love their adopted son and that, after long years of trying, she's pregnant. Akihiro overhears the talk and begins plotting. Within a year, after the birth of the baby, Akihiro confronts his mother and tells her that he has killed her son. Upon learning this, Akihira is furious and disowns Akihiro, who angrily responds that "Akihiro" isn't his true name anyway. Natsumi suddenly appears and tries to run him through, triggering the unsheathing of his mutant claws. He waves his arm, accidentally slashing Natsumi. Akihira, unable to force himself to harm his son, commits suicide. [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] then appears to the boy for the first time and tells him that he is what the boy will someday become.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #26 (Aug. 2008)</ref>

At some point, he does adopt the name Daken though his subsequent activities aren't known. Daken's personal motives are unclear at this time. Disguised as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, he brutally stabs [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and confronts his incarcerated father for the first time. He finally slashes Logan across the stomach and leaves him to bleed on the floor, just as his mother was left many years before.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #10</ref> Daken is revealed to have "aided" his father's escape, though not for benevolent reasons.

He is next seen in Berlin at the home of a woman with whom he has been cruelly, and romantically, toying. He allowed her to witness him kissing another man on a date, although unbeknownst to her, he later murdered the man to acquire a passport. Knowing that she would drink an entire bottle of burgundy, he secretly poisons it, resulting in her death. He had to end the relationship and her life so that no loose ends could be left to tie him to his crimes.<ref name=W:O#11/> 

While walking through the streets of Potsdam, Germany, Daken is then contacted by an anonymous messenger who reminds him of his displeased master's "ultimate goal". Daken then dispatches the messenger to again make sure no trace of his presence is left. Later he appears on a train to Brussels, watching his father in a nearby stolen car. He then receives a phone call from an unknown "friend" (who is actually the resurrected [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]]), confirming his father's destination.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #12</ref> 

Shadowing his father into a bank vault in Brussels that contains the [[carbonadium synthesizer]], Daken engages Wolverine in a bloody battle with Daken demonstrating great fighting prowess and similar speed and agility as his father. As Wolverine is hampered in the feud by his lack of desire to kill his son and his fading belief that Daken can be redeemed, he quickly loses the upper hand despite his greater experience and training. Their fight is interrupted when Cyber breaks into the vault and challenges Daken.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #13</ref> It is then revealed that Daken trained under Cyber in the past. Cyber mentions that Daken is a better and faster fighter than him, and was his finest student. However, Cyber's imperviousness and greater strength makes that a moot point (which he later clearly explains to Wolverine). Daken refuses to lead Cyber to his masters and flees the fight, leaving his father and his mentor to deal with each other.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #14</ref>

Daken is then seen in the presence of [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and a scarred, expressionless torturer who whips him with a gasoline soaked length of rope. He pleads for mercy, but receives only a warning from his "master" to stay away from his father.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #15</ref>

Daken had spent the last couple of months being tortured under observation by Wild Child, who is acting on orders from their mutual master, [[Romulus (Marvel Comics)|Romulus]].<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #21 (cameo)</ref>

Daken returned and cut off [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'s hand before letting Wolverine fall into a water tank while Deadpool was off guard. Daken and Deadpool began fighting, with Daken quickly gaining the upper hand. In the meantime, Wolverine was blown out of the tank due to Daken kicking [[grenade]]s that Deadpool intended to use against him into the tank. Deadpool briefly gains the upper-hand by kicking Daken face-first into a wall, dizzying him. The battle ended soon however after with Daken repeatedly using his claws against Deadpool, including severing his other hand. The trauma and blood loss caused Deadpool to lose consciousness. Daken was then confronted by Wolverine, only to be shot in the back of the head. Wolverine explained that he set up the entire scenario. He explained how he called in a favor from [[Bucky]] to pose as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to hire Deadpool for the job. Wolverine fought Deadpool and allowed himself to lose in the hopes of drawing Daken out because he speculated that Daken wouldn't allow anyone else to kill him. The plan worked as the bullet Daken was shot with was composed of [[carbonadium]], one of several that Wolverine had the [[Terrible Tinkerer|Tinkerer]] make for him. As with Wolverine, the speed and efficiency of Daken's mutant healing factor was dramatically reduced, though not completely suppressed, due to the toxic nature of carbonadium. As Wolverine left with the unconscious Daken, he told Deadpool, who was drifting in and out of consciousness, not to take the entire scheme personally and that if Deadpool chose to come after him, Wolverine would cut him up and eat him, a threat Deadpool takes no heed to.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

In the ''[[X-Men: Manifest Destiny|Manifest Destiny]]'' storyline, Daken has been tracked down by [[Sebastian Shaw]] and [[Mister Sinister|Mister Sinister]] to help Daken regain his memories. In the finale of the ''[[X-Men: Original Sin|Original Sin]]'' storyline, Daken finally learns the truth behind Itsu's death and has joined Wolverine in seeking revenge against Romulus.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #30</ref> However, Daken seemingly betrayed Wolverine to Cyber. It was later revealed it was all a plan to get to Cyber's secrets. After learning them, Daken apparently killed Cyber, leaving his body to Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #32</ref>. During a conversation between Wolverine and [[Nick Fury]], Fury reveals that he believes Daken is going after the Muramasa Blade that Wolverine left in [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' care. The sword has various mystical properties, including disabling superhuman regenerative powers <ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #55 (Sept. 2007)</ref>. Fury believes that Daken intends to take the sword and have the metal bonded to his bone claws after stating that the Tinkerer would know how to do such a thing and had last been spotted in New York City. Also featured in the same issue is a long lost cousin of Logan.

===Dark Reign===
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
In the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] puts together a new group of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] (in the comic book titled ''[[Dark Avengers]]'') of which Daken is a member, wears a version of his father's brown and tan Wolverine costume, and takes the Wolverine name for himself. Cyclops then sees him as a liability and plans to kill him with the Muramasa blade to protect the image of the [[X-Men]]. It is revealed, however, that he agreed to join the Dark Avengers as a way to draw out Cyclops to take the [[Muramasa|Muramasa blade]] from his possession. He eventually attracts the X-men and Wolverine who are holding the blade. After a brief battle, he takes a piece of the blade and brings it to the [[Tinkerer]], who then bonds the "metal" to the claws on his wrists. Daken is seen alongside the other Dark Avengers fighting [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morganna le Fay's]] demons.

However, Daken's loyalty to Osborn and true motives for joining Osborn are questionable, as Daken constantly mentions in his monologues as well as to others "Osborn thinks i'm working for him". This questionable loyalty put him at odds with [[Bullseye_(comics)|Bullseye]], and [[Ares_(Marvel_Comics)|Ares]]. In Wolverine #75-77, he secretly assists the [[Fantastic Four]] in helping them break into Avengers Tower to steal incriminating evidence against Osborn while trying to clear their name against Osborn, but was foiled by Bullseye.<ref>Wolverine #77</ref>

When [[Spider-Man]] entered the Avenger Tower, pretending to be [[Mac Gargan]], he is first ambushed by Daken who knew he was not Mac via scent. However, he is eventually incapacitated by Spider-Man after he pummeled him and threw him into an electric generator.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

In ''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'', Daken and Bullseye are sent by Norman Osborn to kill Mac Gargan. However, he is beaten badly by Gargan, when Mac threw him through a building.

In ''[[Punisher (2009 series)#Dark Reign: The List - Punisher #1|Dark Reign: The List - Punisher]]'', after repeated failed attempts to kill Frank Castle, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] sends Daken and a [[platoon]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#H.A.M.M.E.R.|H.A.M.M.E.R]] troops to complete this mission. After a bloody round of [[hand-to-hand]] combat, Daken [[dismember]]s and [[decapitate]]s Castle, before kicking his remains from a rooftop. Castle's body parts are collected and spirited away by [[Moloids]], seemingly operating under the protection of [[Man-Thing]]<ref>"Dark Reign - The List - The Punisher #1"</ref>.

In ''Incredible Hulk'' #603, [[Bruce Banner]] lures his son [[Skaar]] into a fight between him and Daken. Daken and Skaar battle it out and Daken nearly defeats Skaar, but Wolverine and Banner intervene. The two father-son teams battle, but the fight is stopped when Banner says that Skaar has learned his lesson and Daken abruptly leaves Wolverine behind.

Daken is a member of [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.8207.Dark_X-Men_Dossiers~colon~_Daken|title=Dark X-Men Dossiers: Daken|date=2009-05-29|publisher=Marvel: The Official Site|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> He will also remain on the Dark Avengers team, though, in <i>Dark Avengers</i> #7, he takes the Dark X-Men's side in their quarrel with the Dark Avengers when Bullseye asks him which side he's on, in which he replies that he "always did like playing for both teams."

==Powers and abilities==
Like Wolverine, Daken's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing factor that allows him to rapidly regenerate damaged bodily tissue much faster and more extensively than a normal human is capable of. The full limits of his healing factor aren't known, though he is able to fully recover from intense electric shock within a short span of time. Daken's healing factor also grants him an extended lifespan by dramatically slowing his natural aging process. Although he is over 60 years old, he has the appearance of a man in his physical prime.

Daken's physical stamina and reflexes are also heightened to superhuman levels as a by-product of his accelerated healing factor. As with most of his powers, the full limits of these powers are unknown.

Daken also has three retractable bone claws housed within each forearm, though their configuration and appearance is somewhat different from those of Wolverine. Two claws extend between his knuckles, while a third extends from the underside of his wrist. The texture of the claws in his knuckles appears to be porous and dark in color, unlike the claws Wolverine possesses in their natural bone state, as seen in Wolverine: Origin<ref>''Wolverine: Origin'' #2</ref>. It was recently revealed in the pages of Dark Reign: Hawkeye<ref>''Dark Reign: Hawkeye'' #1</ref> that his claws have a naturally ferrous or metallic composition, allowing him to penetrate materials such as metal; he was able to penetrate stolen Iron-Man armor being used by a thief. Recently, the claws which extend from the underside of each wrist have been bonded with a piece of the blade taken from the Muramasa blade. The mystic properties of the blade enables it to inflict wounds greatly nulifying superhuman healing factors, allowing Daken to kill those even with very strong healing factors.

Daken's mind is naturally resistant to [[telepathy|telepathic]] probes and assaults. As a result of Romulus' conditioning, Daken's mind contains a certain, un-described "trap" for most telepaths that attempt to push too far into his mind.<ref>''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' #217 (Dec. 2008)</ref>

He also possesses [[pheromone]] manipulation that suppresses his scent and alters emotions and sensory perception of others, e.g. sexual attraction, psychotic rage, rational thinking, etc..<ref name="Dark Wolverine #75">''Dark Wolverine'' #75</ref> However certain individuals have proven immune to Daken's pheromones, most notably Hulkling, a Skrull/Kree hybrid and The Hulk's son, Skaar, a Human/Oldstrong hybrid.

==Skills and personality==
{{Original research|date=August 2009}}
Unlike Wolverine, Daken has no moral compunction about killing, which he has done in a professional capacity for quite some time. In his appearances he is seen murdering several people. However, like the Winter Soldier, the majority of Daken's personality had been artificially erased, rendering him little more than a living weapon capable of tactical and strategic forethought in order to carry out assassinations.

Daken has formidable hand to hand combat skills, though the extent of his exact training has yet to be revealed. However, he has proven capable of defeating his father, Deadpool, and [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] (who at one point was Daken's instructor and has acknowledged that Daken is a better fighter than himself. Cyber, however, does not consider Daken a worthy opponent due to his lack of an [[adamantium]] skeleton. His ability to appear outside his opponent's field of vision is a direct result of his training since he has no superhuman speed.<ref>''Wolverine: Origin'' #25</ref>

According to [[Emma Frost]], Daken has been heavily and irreversibly brainwashed, though [[Professor Xavier]] does not share her view that it is irreversible. Daken acknowledges that Wolverine is his biological father and yet harbored an animosity toward him for being responsible for the death of his mother, which he later learned is not true. Daken once showed loyalty to a mysterious figure known as [[Romulus (Marvel Comics)|Romulus]], who has been a powerful influence in the lives of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and Cyber. However, thanks to Xavier's help, Daken has recovered some of his original mind and now seeks revenge against Romulus.

===Sexual orientation===
Daken has been portrayed engaging in [[homosexual]] behavior in a few instances, however no indication is given whether this is due to [[sexual orientation|orientation]] (and thus confirming the character as being [[bisexual]]) or simply Daken using these situations to his advantage. Daken kissed a man in ''Wolverine: Origins #11'', however the encounter also served to further toy with a woman he had been romantically seeing and later, Daken killed the man in question.<ref name=W:O#11>''Wolverine: Origin'' #11</ref> In ''Dark Wolverine #75'' it is shown Daken has had a sexual encounter with a male employee of Norman Osborn, but this was also shown as a means to access top-secret files.<ref name="waytalks">{{cite news|url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22141|title=Daniel Way Talks Wolverine(s)|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=2009-07-22|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> Later in the same issue, Daken makes a pass at [[Mac Gargan]] however the context is ambiguous, possibly facetious.<ref name="Dark Wolverine #75"/> In ''Dark Avengers #7'', Daken humorously states how he "...always did like playing for both teams," a [[double-entendre]] referencing bisexuality and his membership in both the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men.<ref>''Dark X-Men #7''</ref> In ''Dark Wolverine #76'', Daken uses his pheromones in order to manipulate the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], goading him with homoerotic remarks.<ref>''Dark Wolverine #76''</ref> 

Daken has been shown on numerous occasions engaging in [[heterosexual]] behavior and sleeping with female characters.<ref name=W:O#11/><ref name="Dark Wolverine #75"/>

At the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], [[Marjorie Liu]] commented (on Daken's sexuality) that "[Daken] will do anyone and anything [to achieve his goals and he's] past that kind of identification. He's beyond it." [[Daniel Way]] added that Daken's sexuality will be addressed later on, but it's more about his personality. "He's no more homosexual than he is heterosexual. It's about control."<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22198</ref>
