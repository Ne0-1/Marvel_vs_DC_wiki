'''Daken''' is a [[fictional character]] who exists in the {{Marvel Universe}}, and was born a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]].  Daken is the son of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and Itsu, Wolverine's Japanese wife before he was abducted by [[Muramasa]] and eventually forcefully inducted into the [[Weapon X]] Program.

==Fictional character biography==
Itsu, while in the last stages of her pregnancy, is murdered by [[Bucky (comics) |Winter Soldier]] in an attempt to draw Wolverine out and return him to custody in [[Madripoor]].<ref>''Wolverine(vol.3) #40</ref> [[Emma Frost]] would eventually, many years later, encounter his shadowed visage in a precognative dream.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #4</ref> She promptly informs Logan that his son, whom he believed died along with his expecting mother, lives.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #5</ref> After Itsu's death, a mysterious man wearing a trenchcoat that conceals his identity, cuts the baby (Daken) from his mother's womb and leaves her body lying on the floor. Daken is, many years later, revealed to have survived the horrible incident due to inheriting his father's healing factor.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #6</ref>

Daken's personal motives are unclear at this time. Disguised as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, he brutally stabs [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and confronts his incarcerated father for the first time, before slashing him across the stomach and leaving him to bleed on the floor, as his mother was left, many years before.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #10</ref> Daken is revealed to have "aided" his father's escape, though not for benevolent reasons.

He is next seen in Berlin at the home of a woman he has been cruelly toying with. He allowed her to witness him kissing a man on a date, although unbeknownst to her he later murdered the man to acquire his passport. Knowing that she would drink an entire bottle of burgundy he secretly poisons it, resulting in her death. He had to end the relationship and her life so that no loose ends could be left to tie him to his crimes and he simply picked an unusually sadistic fashion to dispatch her.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #11</ref> 

While walking through the streets of Potsdam, Germany, Daken is then contacted by an anonymous messenger who reminds him of his displeased master's "ultimate goal". Daken then dispatches the messenger to yet again make sure to leave absolutely no trace of his presence. Later he appears on a train to Brussels, watching his father in a nearby stolen car. He then receives a phone call from an unknown "friend" (who is actually the recently resurrected [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]]), confirming his father's destination.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #12</ref> 

Shadowing his father into the bank vault in Brussels that contains the carbonadium synthesizer, Daken and Wolverine engage in a bloody battle, with Daken demonstrating great fighting prowess and similar speed and agility to his father. As Wolverine is hampered in the feud by his lack of desire to kill his son and his fading belief that Daken can be redeemed, he quickly loses the upper hand despite his greater experience and training. Their fight is interrupted when Cyber breaks into the vault and challenges Daken.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #13</ref> It is then revealed that Daken trained under Cyber in the past. Cyber mentions that Daken is a better and faster fighter than he, and was his finest student. However, Cyber's imperviousness and greater superhuman strength make that a moot point (which he later clearly explains to Wolverine). Daken refuses to lead Cyber to his masters and flees the fight, leaving his father and his mentor to deal with each other.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #14</ref>

Daken is last seen in the presence of [[Wild Child (comics) |Wild Child]], and a scarred, expressionless torturer who whips him with a gasoline soaked length of rope. He pleads for mercy, but receives only a warning from his "master" to stay away from his father.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
During his confrontations with Wolverine and Cyber, Daken has demonstrated some degree of superhuman speed, at least over short distances. The limits of his speed aren't known, but he has moved too fast for Wolverine to see, even with his enhanced sense of sight. Daken's body also possesses an accelerated healing factor that allows him to heal damage faster than an ordinary human. The full extent of Daken's healing powers are unknown.

Like his father, Daken also has three retractable bone claws on each hand, though their configuration and appearance is slightly different than that of Wolverine; two claws extend between his knuckles while the third extends from the underside of his wrists. The texture appears to be porous and organic and dark in color. 

Daken has demonstrated the ability to mask his scent entirely. Whether this is part of his natural physiology or if it is achieved through artificial means is unknown.

==Skills and personality==
Unlike Wolverine, Daken has no moral compunction about killing, which he has done in a professional capacity for quite some time. In his appearances he is seen murdering several people. 

Daken has formidable hand to hand combat skills, though the extent of his exact training has yet to be revealed. However, he has proven capable of defeating his father and [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] who at one point was his instructor, has acknowledged that he considered Daken a better fighter than himself, with superior skill and speed.  Cyber, however, doesn't consider him a worthy opponent due to his lack of an adamantium skeleton. 

According to Emma Frost, Daken has been heavily and irreversibly brainwashed. He acknowledges that Wolverine is his biological father and yet harbors an animosity toward him for unrevealed reasons. He has some loyalty to a different paternal figure who has not been revealed.
