==Publication history==
Daken first appeared in ''Wolverine Origins #10''. He becomes a member of the [[Dark Avengers]], as part of "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]", taking the role of his father.<ref name=osbsupda>{{cite web |first= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19654 |title=The Osborn Supremacy: Dark Avengers |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=January 22, 2008 |accessdate= }}</ref> The character also becomes the lead in the ''Wolverine'' series, which becomes ''Dark Wolverine'' in issue #75.<ref>{{cite web |first= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19880 |title=NYCC: Way and Liu Talk ''Dark Wolverine'' |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020907-Dark-WOlverine.html NYCC '09 - Way & Liu on 'Dark Wolverine'], [[Newsarama]], February 7, 2009</ref> [[Brian Bendis]], writer of ''Dark Avengers'' has said:

<blockquote>Daken is one of the best things to come out of 'Origins,' and what better way to piss off his father? He's an iconic and legacy character attached to a number of cool things in the Marvel Universe, but he really hasn't had a lot of face time with it. So we can really roll up our sleeves and see what we've got there and help create a character.<ref name=osbsupda /></blockquote>

As part of the team he is also a part of the crossover ''[[Dark X-Men|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia]]''.<ref name=cbr21488>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21488 |title=IRON PATRIOTISM: Daken |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 }}</ref> He appeared as a regular character in the ''Dark Avengers'' series from issue #1 (March 2009) through issue #16 (June 2010).

''Dark Wolverine'' continued after the end of "Dark Reign" and finished with issue #90 with the prelude for the "Empire" storyline, that continued in the new series ''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #1. Writer [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]] took over the series in 2011, starting with issue #9.1.<ref>{{cite web |first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/rob-williams-daken-dark-wolverine-110302.html |title=Rob Williams Takes Over DAKEN - And Takes Him to LA |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 22, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32409 |title=Rob Williams Is Rockin' With "Daken" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 19, 2011 }}</ref>

In November 2011, it was announced that 'Daken: Dark Wolverine' would be coming to a close.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comic Book Resources' weekly interview with Marvel Editor in Chief Axel Alonso|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=35553}}</ref> The series ended with issue #23.

===Sexual orientation===
Daken has been portrayed as bisexual, having engaged in sexual situations with both men and women. Daken kissed a man in ''Wolverine: Origins'' #11; however the encounter also served to further toy with a woman he had been romantically seeing and later, Daken killed the man in question.<ref name=W:O#11>''Wolverine: Origin'' #11</ref> In ''Dark Wolverine'' #75 it is vaguely suggested Daken has had a sexual encounter with a male employee of Norman Osborn, but this was also shown as a means to access top-secret files.<ref name="waytalks">{{Cite news|url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22141|title=Daniel Way Talks Wolverine(s)|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=2009-07-22|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> Later in the same issue, Daken makes a pass at [[Mac Gargan]] however the context is ambiguous, possibly facetious.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In the same issue, Daken uses his pheromones to "engage" a female H.A.M.M.E.R. agent. In ''Dark Avengers #7'', Daken humorously states how he "...always did like playing for both teams," a [[double entendre]] referencing bisexuality and his membership in both the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men.<ref>''Dark X-Men'' #7</ref> In ''Dark Wolverine'' #76, Daken uses his pheromones in order to manipulate the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], goading him with homoerotic remarks.<ref>''Dark Wolverine #76''</ref> During the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], Daken also made a flirtatious pass at [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] dressed as [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]],<ref name="Dark Wolverine #82">''Dark Wolverine'' #82</ref> also managing to kiss him on-panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/prev_img.php?pid=4752&pg=5 |title=Dark Wolverine #84 |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-08}}</ref> In ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #5, Daken attempts to uses his pheromones during a fight against [[Hulkling]], a gay male superhero.<ref name="Young Avengers #5">''Young Avengers'' #5</ref> Daken has also been shown on numerous occasions engaging in [[heterosexual]] behavior and sleeping with female characters.<ref name=W:O#11/>

At the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], [[Marjorie Liu]] commented (on Daken's sexuality) that "[Daken] will do anyone and anything [to achieve his goals] and he's past that kind of identification. He's beyond it." [[Daniel Way]] added that Daken's sexuality will be addressed later on, but it's more about his personality. "He's no more homosexual than he is heterosexual. It's about control."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22198|title=CCI: X-Men Panel}}</ref> Marjorie Liu later confirmed Daken's bisexuality in a 2011 video interview with Newsarama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/common/media/video/player.php?aid=40251|title=Dark Wolverine and His Sexual Arsenal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYMfUA-efE|title=Dark Wolverine and His Sexual Arsenal}}</ref>

==Alternate versions==

===''What If?''===
In ''[[What If? Wolverine: Father]]'' #1, Logan was present when Daken was born and was able to save him from the people who would have raised him in the original course of events, taking him to live in seclusion in the mountains in the hope that he could raise '''John Howlett''' (as Daken is known in this timeline) away from the kind of life he has lived himself. However, despite his attempts to ensure privacy by turning Professor X away when he came to recruit Logan to join the X-Men, Logan's attempts to suppress Daken's darker instincts failed when Sabretooth found them, revealing the truth about his father's past to John. Leaving his father, John became a brutal killer, roaming various cities and killing his opponents, proclaiming that Logan made him what he is by denying him his heritage. Concluding that he will never bring anything good into the world, Logan stabs John in the heart with the Muramasa Blade, subsequently impaling himself to end his own dark stain on the world.<ref>''What If?
