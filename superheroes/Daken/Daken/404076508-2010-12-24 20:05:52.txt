'''Akihiro''', also codename as '''Daken'''<ref>''Wolverine # 1.'' Wolverine Goes to Hell Jason Aaron (writer); Renato Guedes (pencils); Setp. 2010.</ref> is a [[fiction]]al comic book supervillain appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Daken is the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and his deceased wife [[Itsu (comics)|Itsu]]. He possesses superhuman abilities similar to his father (e.g., [[healing factor]], retractable claws), and was member of the [[Dark Avengers]] under the name '''[[Wolverine]]''' until the conclusion of the 2010 storyline "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]".

==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|date=January 2010}}
{{in-universe|date=December 2010}}
In 1946, as Wolverine is living in Jasmine Falls, Japan with his pregnant wife, Itsu, Romulus{{who|date=December 2010}} sends the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]] to kill Itsu.<ref>''Daken: Dark Wolverine # 1. Dan Way and Marjorie Liu (writers). September 2010.</ref> After Itsu's death, a mysterious man cuts baby Daken from his mother's womb and leaves her body lying on the floor. Daken survives this incident due to inheriting his father's healing factor.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #6</ref> Sometime in the year 1946, Daken is placed at the doorstep of Akihira and Natsumi, a wealthy young and traditional Japanese couple. They take his presence as an answer to their prayers and raise him as their own. Though he is named Akihiro by his father, the servants and other families of the province secretly refer to the boy as Daken ({{lang|ja|駄犬}}, "bastard dog" or "mongrel"), a slur on his obvious mixed heritage. As Akihiro grows, he is often teased by the other boys of the village. His harsh treatment over the years causes Akihiro to develop a very cold personality, directed at everyone except his father. One night, Natsumi confesses to Akihira that she doesn't love their adopted son and that, after long years of trying, she's pregnant. Akihiro overhears the talk and begins plotting. Within a year, after the birth of the baby, Akihiro confronts his mother and tells her that he has killed her son. Upon learning this, Akihira is furious and disowns Akihiro, who angrily responds that "Akihiro" isn't his true name anyway. Natsumi suddenly appears and tries to run him through, triggering the unsheathing of his mutant claws. He waves his arm, accidentally slashing Natsumi. Akihira, unable to force himself to harm his son, commits suicide. [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] then appears to the boy for the first time and tells him that he is what the boy will someday become.<ref name="Wolverine 2008">''Wolverine: Origins'' #26 (Aug. 2008)</ref>

In the present, Daken disguises himself as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent and infiltrates a facility where his father is imprisoned. He stabs [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and confronts his father for the first time. He slashes Logan across the stomach and leaves him to bleed on the floor, just as his mother was left many years before.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins #10</ref> Daken is revealed to have "aided" his father's escape, though not for benevolent reasons.

He is next seen in Berlin at the home of a woman with whom he has been cruelly, and romantically, toying. He allowed her to witness him kissing another man on a date, although unbeknownst to her, he later murdered the man to acquire a passport. Knowing that she would drink an entire bottle of burgundy, he secretly poisons it, resulting in her death. He had to end the relationship and her life so that no loose ends could be left to tie him to his crimes.<ref name=W:O#11/>

While still in Germany, Daken is then contacted by an anonymous messenger who reminds him of his displeased master's "ultimate goal". Daken then dispatches the messenger to again make sure no trace of his presence is left. Later he appears on a train to Brussels, watching his father in a nearby stolen car. He then receives a phone call from an unknown "friend" (who is actually the resurrected [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]]), confirming his father's destination.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #12</ref>

Shadowing his father into a bank vault in Brussels that contains the [[carbonadium synthesizer]], Daken engages Wolverine in a bloody battle with Daken demonstrating great fighting prowess and similar speed and agility to his father. As Wolverine is hampered in the feud by his lack of desire to kill his son and his fading belief that Daken can be redeemed, he quickly loses the upper hand despite his greater experience and training. Their fight is interrupted when Cyber breaks into the vault and challenges Daken.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #13</ref> It is then revealed that Daken trained under Cyber in the past. Cyber mentions that Daken is a better and faster fighter than him, and was his finest student. However, Cyber's imperviousness and greater strength makes that a moot point, as he later explains to Wolverine. Daken refuses to lead Cyber to his master and flees the fight, leaving his father and his mentor to deal with each other.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #14</ref>

Daken is then seen in the presence of [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and a scarred, expressionless torturer who whips him with a gasoline soaked length of rope. He pleads for mercy, but receives only a warning from his "master" to stay away from his father.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #15</ref>

Daken had spent the last couple of months being tortured under observation by Wild Child, who is acting on orders from their mutual master, [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]].<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #21 (cameo)</ref>

Daken returns and fights [[Deadpool]] and Wolverine, managing to knock Deadpool unconscious after a long fight.  Daken is then confronted by Wolverine, only to be shot in the back of the head. Wolverine explains that he set up the entire scenario and leaves with the unconscious Daken.<ref name="Wolverine 2008"/>

During ''[[X-Men: Manifest Destiny|Manifest Destiny]]'', Daken is tracked down by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and [[Mister Sinister]] to help Daken regain his memories. In the finale of ''Original Sin'', Daken finally learns the truth behind Itsu's death and has joined Wolverine in seeking revenge against Romulus.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #30</ref> However, Daken seemingly betrays Wolverine to Cyber afterwards. It was later revealed it was all a plan to get to Cyber's secrets. After learning them, Daken apparently kills Cyber, leaving his body to Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #32</ref> During a conversation between Wolverine and [[Nick Fury]], Fury reveals that he believes Daken is going after the [[Muramasa|Muramasa Blade]] that Wolverine left in [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' care. The sword has various mystical properties, including disabling superhuman regenerative powers. Fury believes that Daken intends to take the sword and have the metal bonded to his bone claws after stating that the [[Tinkerer]] would know how to do such a thing and had last been spotted in New York City.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #55 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

===Dark Reign===
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
During ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'', [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] puts together a new group of [[Dark Avengers|Avengers]], recruiting Daken as his own Wolverine, letting him wear a version of his father's brown and tan costume. Cyclops sees him as a liability and plans to kill him with the Muramasa Blade to protect the image of the [[X-Men]]. It is revealed, however, that he agreed to join the Dark Avengers as a way to draw out Cyclops to take the Muramasa Blade from his possession. When the X-Men attack him, he takes a piece of the blade and brings it to the Tinkerer, who then bonds the metal to the claws on his wrists. After that, he is seen alongside the other Dark Avengers fighting [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morganna le Fay]]'s demons.

When [[Spider-Man]] enters Avengers Tower, pretending to be [[Mac Gargan]], he is first ambushed by Daken who knew he was not Mac via scent. However, he is eventually incapacitated by Spider-Man after he pummeled him and threw him into an electric generator.<ref>''Amazing Spiderman'' #597 – ''American Son'' Part 3</ref>

In ''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'', Daken and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] are sent by Norman Osborn to kill Mac Gargan. However, he is beaten badly by Gargan, when Mac threw him through a building.

In ''[[Punisher (2009 series)#Dark Reign: The List - Punisher#1|Dark Reign: The List – Punisher]]'', after repeated failed attempts to kill [[Punisher|Frank Castle]], [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] sends Daken and a [[platoon]] of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] troops to complete this mission. After a bloody round of [[hand-to-hand combat]], Daken [[dismember]]s and [[decapitate]]s Castle, before kicking his remains from a rooftop. Castle's body parts are collected and spirited away by [[Moloids]], seemingly operating under the protection of [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Dark Reign – The List – The Punisher'' #1</ref>

In ''Incredible Hulk'' #603, [[Bruce Banner]] lures his son [[Skaar]] into a fight between him and Daken. Daken uses his psychic ability to calm Skaar down, reducing him to his human form. Skaar then asks Daken to kill him as he's guilty of the destruction he's caused back home, but Wolverine and Banner intervene. The two father-son teams battle, but the fight is stopped when Banner says that Skaar has learned his lesson and Daken abruptly leaves Wolverine behind.

Daken also becomes a member of Osborn's [[Dark X-Men]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.8207.Dark_X-Men_Dossiers~colon~_Daken|title=Dark X-Men Dossiers: Daken|date=2009-05-29|publisher=Marvel: The Official Site|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> He also remains on the Dark Avengers team, though he takes the Dark X-Men's side in their quarrel with the Dark Avengers. When Bullseye asks him which side he's on, he replies that he "always did like playing for both teams.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #7</ref>

However, Daken's loyalty to Osborn and true motives remain questionable, as Daken constantly mentions that "Osborn thinks I'm working for him". This puts him at odds with Bullseye and [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]. He secretly assists the [[Fantastic Four]] in helping them break into [[Avengers Tower]] to steal incriminating evidence against Osborn while trying to clear their name against Osborn, but was foiled by Bullseye.<ref>Wolverine #77</ref> [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms. Marvel]] tried to psychoanalyze him  and assuage her feelings for him, but Daken rebuked her and Osborn.<ref>Wolverine #81</ref>

===Siege===
{{Main|Siege (comics)}}
During Osborn's [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], it is revealed that Daken intended to turn on Osborn.<ref>''Dark Wolverine'' #82</ref> He appears to murder him, but this was later revealed to be a hallucination caused by the Asgardian divinities who represent fate.<ref>''Dark Wolverine'' #83</ref> Daken attempts to fight [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who strikes him down with a massive bolt of lightning, before the two can even face off.<ref>''Siege'' #2</ref> Once the Siege ends with the Void's death, Osborn's Avengers are rounded up and arrested. Daken is the only one to escape, doing so by killing and disguising himself as an army soldier.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

===Reckoning===
Daken turns on Romulus because he figures out that Romulus really wanted Wolverine to take over his operation and not Daken. Daken stabs Romulus with his wrist-claws, but before he can deliver the killing blow, Wolverine has [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] teleport Romulus to the Dark Force dimension. Logan thinks about just beheading Romulus like he did with [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], but instead decides to leave him stranded.

He then goes back to Daken. They start to fight, but Logan stays calm. He parries Daken's angry attacks, then stabs him through with his claws. While Daken is unconscious, Logan rips out his Muramasa wrist claws. He then buries the claws with the remains of the Muramasa Blade in a grave near the Howlett estate, and Daken is shown with scars running up the insides of his forearms.<ref name="Wolverine: Origins #48">''Wolverine: Origins'' #48</ref>

Daken, later seen at a nightclub, is attacked by the now monstrous [[Punisher]] (now known as Franken-Castle), who is seeking revenge. After a brutal fight Daken is defeated but decides to hunt Franken-Castle to continue the fight and retrieve the [[Bloodstone (comics)|Bloodstone]] integrated into Fraken-Castle's new physical form.<ref>''Dark Wolverine'' #88</ref> After following Franken-Castle's trail, Daken encounters a series of devastating traps before meeting his foe again. After a second brutal hand-to-hand battle, Daken is severely injured and retreats. Franken-Castle finds him and, after damaging Daken even more, is about to throw him into a mass of concrete foundation (presumably to kill him). However, Franken-Castle is stabbed in the chest from behind, by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who states he is intervening in his plans to kill his son.<ref>''Franken-Castle'' #19</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like Wolverine, Daken's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing factor that allows him to rapidly regenerate damaged bodily tissue much faster and more extensively than a normal human is capable of. The full limits of his healing factor aren't known, though he is able to fully recover from intense electric shock within a short span of time. Daken's healing factor also grants him an extended lifespan by dramatically slowing his natural aging process. Although he is over 60 years old, he has the appearance of a man in his physical prime.

Daken's physical stamina and reflexes are also heightened to superhuman levels as a by-product of his accelerated healing factor. As with most of his powers, the full limits of these powers are unknown.

Daken also had three retractable bone claws housed within each forearm, though their configuration and appearance is somewhat different from those of Wolverine. Two claws extend between his knuckles, while a third once extended from the underside of his wrist. The texture of the claws in his knuckles appears to be porous and dark in color, unlike the claws Wolverine possesses in their natural bone state, as seen in [[Origin (comics)|''Wolverine: Origin'']].<ref>''Wolverine: Origin'' #2</ref> It was recently revealed in the pages of ''Dark Reign: Hawkeye''<ref>''Dark Reign: Hawkeye'' #1</ref> that his claws have a naturally ferrous or metallic composition, allowing him to penetrate materials such as metal; he was able to penetrate stolen [[Iron Man's armor|Iron Man armor]] being used by a thief. Recently, the claws which extended from the underside of each wrist had been bonded with a piece of the metal taken from the [[Muramasa Blade]]. The mystic properties of the blade enables it to inflict wounds greatly nullifying superhuman healing factors. Wolverine cut both of Daken's Muramasa steel coated claws out of his arms with the Muramasa Blade<ref name="Wolverine: Origins #48"/> and due to the properties of the Muramasa Blade, the removed claws did not grow back as quickly as they normally would.

Daken's mind is naturally resistant to [[telepathy|telepathic]] probes and assaults. As a result of Romulus' conditioning, Daken's mind contains a certain, undescribed "trap" for most telepaths that attempt to push too far into his mind.<ref>''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' #217 (Dec. 2008)</ref>

He also possesses [[pheromone]] manipulation that suppresses his scent and alters emotions and sensory perception of others, e.g. sexual attraction, psychotic rage, rational thinking, etc.<ref name="Dark Wolverine #75">''Dark Wolverine'' #75</ref> However certain individuals have proven immune to Daken's pheromones, most notably [[Hulkling]]{{Issue|date=August 2010}}, a [[Skrull]]/[[Kree]] hybrid, and The Hulk's son, [[Skaar]], a Human/Oldstrong hybrid.

==Skills and personality==
Unlike Wolverine, Daken has no moral compunction about killing, which he has done in a professional capacity for quite some time. In his appearances he is seen murdering several people, even as a child.

Daken has formidable hand to hand combat skills, though the extent of his exact training has yet to be revealed. However, he has proven capable of defeating his father, Deadpool, and [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] (who at one point was Daken's instructor and has acknowledged that Daken is a better fighter than himself). Cyber, however, does not consider Daken a worthy opponent due to his lack of an [[adamantium]] skeleton. His ability to appear outside his opponent's field of vision is a direct result of his training since he has no superhuman speed.<ref>''Wolverine: Origin'' #25</ref>

According to [[Emma Frost]], Daken has been heavily and irreversibly brainwashed, though [[Professor Xavier]] does not share her view that it is irreversible. Daken acknowledges that Wolverine is his biological father and yet harbors an animosity toward him. Daken once showed loyalty to a mysterious figure known as [[Romulus (Marvel Comics)|Romulus]], who has been a powerful influence in the lives of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and Cyber. With Xavier's help, Daken has seen his first images of his mother through Wolverine's memories.

===Sexual orientation===
Daken has been portrayed engaging in [[homosexual]] behavior in a few instances, however no indication is given whether this is due to [[sexual orientation|orientation]] (and thus confirming the character as being [[bisexual]]) or simply Daken using these situations to his advantage. Daken kissed a man in ''Wolverine: Origins #11'', however the encounter also served to further toy with a woman he had been romantically seeing and later, Daken killed the man in question.<ref name=W:O#11>''Wolverine: Origin'' #11</ref> In ''Dark Wolverine #75'' it is vaguely suggested Daken has had a sexual encounter with a male employee of Norman Osborn, but this was also shown as a means to access top-secret files.<ref name="waytalks">{{Cite news|url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22141|title=Daniel Way Talks Wolverine(s)|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=2009-07-22|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> Later in the same issue, Daken makes a pass at [[Mac Gargan]] however the context is ambiguous, possibly facetious.<ref name="Dark Wolverine #75"/> In the same issue, it is seen that Daken used his pheromones to "engage" a female Hammer agent. In ''Dark Avengers #7'', Daken humorously states how he "...always did like playing for both teams," a [[double entendre]] referencing bisexuality and his membership in both the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men.<ref>''Dark X-Men #7''</ref> In ''Dark Wolverine #76'', Daken uses his pheromones in order to manipulate the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], goading him with homoerotic remarks.<ref>''Dark Wolverine #76''</ref> During the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], Daken also made a flirtatious pass at [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]],<ref>''Dark Wolverine #82''</ref> also managing to kiss him on-panel.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/prev_img.php?pid=4752&pg=5 Dark Wolverine #84]</ref> Daken has also been shown on numerous occasions engaging in [[heterosexual]] behavior and sleeping with female characters.<ref name=W:O#11/><ref name="Dark Wolverine #75"/>

At the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], [[Marjorie Liu]] commented (on Daken's sexuality) that "[Daken] will do anyone and anything [to achieve his goals and he's] past that kind of identification. He's beyond it." [[Daniel Way]] added that Daken's sexuality will be addressed later on, but it's more about his personality. "He's no more homosexual than he is heterosexual. It's about control."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22198|title=CCI: X-Men Panel}}</ref>
