'''Anthony Edward Stark''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] portrayed by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]]—based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Iron Man|of the same name]]—commonly known by his [[alter ego]], '''Iron Man'''. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of [[Stark Industries]]. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]], until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.

Stark is one of the central figures of the MCU, having appeared in eleven films since his introduction in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008). The character and Downey's performance have been credited with helping to cement the MCU as a multi-billion-dollar franchise, with Stark's evolution often being considered the defining arc of the series.<ref name="BusinessInsider" />

==Concept and creation==
Tony Stark first premiered as a comic book character, in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963), a collaboration among editor and story-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], story-artist [[Don Heck]], and cover-artist and character-designer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="DeFalco" /> Lee wanted to create the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership.<ref name="Excelsior160" /> Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on [[Howard Hughes]],<ref name="MaskGameInformer" /> as "one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies' man and finally a nutcase."<ref name="Soapbox" /> The character's original costume was a bulky gray armored suit, replaced by a golden version in the second story (issue #40, April 1963), and redesigned as sleeker, red-and-golden armor in issue #48 (Dec. 1963) by [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name="SigningSession" /> Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team. In the mid-2000s, with a number of movies having been made from other Marvel properties licensed to other studios, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Iron Man. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012" />

[[Jon Favreau]], who was selected to direct the first ''Iron Man'' film, felt Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part,<ref name="DowneyUSAToday" /> and that the actor could make Stark a "likable asshole," but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience.<ref name="FavreauWonderCon2008" />

Ultimately though, Downey ended up being the choice the studio made for the first character in their ever-expansive cinematic universe. Favreau was also attracted to Downey from his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'' (2005), with Downey frequently conversing with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name="KissKissBangBang" />

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born on May 29, 1970, in [[Manhattan, New York]] to [[Howard Stark]], a famous genius inventor and businessman, and [[Maria Stark|Maria Stark (née Carbonell)]], a New York [[socialite]] and philanthropist. Growing up under the eye of family butler [[Edwin Jarvis]], his life was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father. Seeing that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own role in the creation of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]]. This instead embittered Stark, who felt that his father was taking more pride in his creations than in his family. A brilliant and unique [[child prodigy]], Stark attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] for two years starting at age 14.<ref name="Guidebook" /> 

On December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to the [[Bahamas]], but planned to stop at the Pentagon to deliver [[Super Soldier Serum]] he had redeveloped. On their way there, both were killed in a car accident—later revealed to be an assassination carried out by the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]] who was mind controlled by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to steal the serum.{{refn|name=CivilWar|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.}} As a result, Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a [[playboy lifestyle]]. In 1999, he attended a conference in [[Bern]] where he met scientists [[Maya Hansen]], inventor of the [[Extremis]] experimental regenerative treatment, and [[Aldrich Killian]], rejecting an offer to work for Killian's [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]].{{refn|name=IM3|group=N|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.}}

===Becoming Iron Man===
{{See also|Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man 2}}
In the late 2000s, Stark travels to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive [[Ho Yinsen]], a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.

Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|suit of powered armor]]. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor

Stark learns that [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] has been [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'état|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being "Iron Man."

Six months later, Stark has become a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy, but discovers that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, he appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries.

Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]] and is attacked mid-race by [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], who wields electrified whips powered by a miniature arc reactor. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the [[U.S. Air Force]].

Stark discovers a hidden message from his father, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark synthesizes. At the Expo, Stark's rival [[Justin Hammer]] unveils Vanko's armored drones he had him make, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. After narrowly saving Pepper Potts from a self-destructing drone, they start a relationship.

===The Battle of New York and aftermath===
{{See also|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3}}
When the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives and begins menacing Earth, seizing the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, Fury activates the Avengers Initiative and  S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review the research of [[Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Rogers and Loki fight briefly until Tony Stark appears in his Iron Man armor, resulting in Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]].

The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers must work to restart. Loki escapes, and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole in [[New York City]] above [[Stark Tower]] to allow the Chitauri fleet in space to invade. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile, and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground.

Stark develops [[PTSD]] from his experiences during the alien invasion, resulting in panic attacks. Restless, he builds several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with girlfriend Pepper Potts. When [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] is badly injured in one of a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], Stark issues a televised threat to him, who destroys Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit and crashes in rural Tennessee. His experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.

Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters, where he discovers the Mandarin was just an actor named [[Trevor Slattery]]. [[Aldrich Killian]] reveals himself to be the real Mandarin and captures Stark. He escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves the surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. Killian intends to kill Ellis on an oil platform on live television. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts – who had been kidnapped and subjected to [[Extremis]] – as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Potts, having survived the Extremis procedure, kills Killian. Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy all of the Iron Man suits as a sign of his devotion to Potts, and undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing that he will always be Iron Man.

===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===
{{See also|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Captain America: Civil War|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}
Stark and the Avengers raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. While the team fights outside, Stark enters the lab and finds the scepter, along with [[Chitauri]] ships from the Battle of New York and androids under construction. Wanda sneaks up behind him and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision: the death of all the Avengers except him. Stark awakens from the vision and grabs Loki's scepter.

Returning to Stark Tower, Stark and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] discover an [[artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron eliminates Stark's A.I. [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at Stark Tower. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones, kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers find and attack Ultron, but Wanda subdues most of the team with personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.

After hiding at [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]]'s house, Nick Fury arrives and encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to perfect a new body for him. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning to their headquarters in New York, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow was part of his vision. This "[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]" and the Maximoffs, now on their side, accompany Stark and the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. The Avengers establish a new base, and Stark leaves the team in the hands of Rogers and Romanoff.

Approximately one year later, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish UN oversight of the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Circumstances lead to Rogers and fellow super-soldier [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]]—framed for a terrorist attack—going rogue, along with [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], Wanda Maximoff, Barton, and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]]. Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, [[T'Challa]], Rhodes, Vision, and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]. However, during the battle, Rogers and Barnes are able to escape. Stark learns that Barnes was framed and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes. They find that the other supersoldiers have been killed by [[Helmut Zemo]], who plays footage that reveals that Barnes killed Stark's parents. Stark turns on them, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Stark returns to New York to work on exoskeletal leg braces to allow Rhodes to walk again. Steve Rogers sends a flip phone to Stark, his former ally and friend, to keep in contact. When Ross calls informing him that Barton and the others have escaped, Stark refuses to help.

Peter Parker resumes his high school studies, with Stark telling him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Stark rescues Parker from nearly drowning after an encounter with [[Adrian Toomes]] and warns Parker against further involvement with the criminals. When another weapon from Toomes malfunctions during a fight with Parker and tears the [[Staten Island Ferry]] in half, Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Stark Tower to the team's new headquarters. After Parker thwarts the plan and saves Toomes from an explosion, Stark admits he was wrong about Parker and invites him to become an Avenger full-time, but Parker declines. Potts emerges from a packed press conference, called to make the announcement, and Stark decides to use the opportunity to instead propose to Potts. At the end of the film, he returns the suit to Peter.

===The Infinity War===
{{See also|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}
Stark and Potts are in a New York City park discussing having children, when Banner, who had disappeared after the Battle of Sokovia, crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]]. Banner relays a warning to [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], and Stark that the mad Titan [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] plans to use the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Infinity Stones]] to kill half of all life in the universe. [[Ebony Maw]] and [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Cull Obsidian]] arrive to retrieve the Time Stone, prompting Strange, Stark, Wong, and Parker to confront them. Although Cull Obsidian is incapacitated and thrown into Antarctica, Strange is captured by Maw. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship to rescue him.

After successfully freeing Strange and killing Maw, the trio proceed to Thanos’ home planet [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], where they meet members of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. They form a plan to confront Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, but Thanos overpowers the group and stabs Stark. Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark. Thanos takes the stone and departs Titan for Earth, retrieves the final stone, and activates the Infinity Gauntlet. Stark and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], stranded on Titan, watch as Parker and others are turned to dust.

Stark and Nebula are adrift in space before being rescued by [[Carol Danvers]] and returned to Earth, where Stark chooses to retire and raise his daughter [[Morgan Stark|Morgan]] over the next five years. In 2023, when [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] discovers a way to bring back the fallen, the Avengers approach Stark, who initially refuses, considering the idea dangerously hypothetical. Despite this, he examines the matter privately and figures out how to do it successfully and agrees to help. Traveling through time, Stark fails to retrieve the Space Stone following the Battle of New York, and instead goes further back to the 1970s to steal it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where he has a moving conversation with a younger version of his father, Howard Stark.

The Avengers successfully obtain all of the Infinity Stones before returning to the present. The Stones are incorporated into a gauntlet made by Stark, which Banner then uses to resurrect those that were disintegrated by Thanos. However, they are followed by a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are summoned to 2023 by an alternate version of Nebula. During an ensuing battle, Thanos obtains Stark's gauntlet and the two of them wrestle for control of it. Thanos is able to fling Stark away before attempting another snap, but discovers that Stark has transferred the Infinity Stones to his own armor. Stark activates the Gauntlet, using them to disintegrate Thanos and all of his forces and saving the universe, but fatally injures himself in the process. He dies surrounded by Rhodes, Parker, and Potts. A funeral attended by many heroes is later held for him at his homestead.

Eight months later, as the world continues to mourn Stark, Parker receives glasses that can access Stark's artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., with a message that establishes him as Stark's successor.{{refn|name=FFH|group=N|As depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.}}

==Film appearances==
Robert Downey Jr. portrays Tony Stark in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008),<ref name="DowneyCastIM" /> ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name="RDJAugust2008" /> ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref name="DowneyCastAvengers" /> ''Iron Man 3'' (2013),<ref name="DowneyAug2011" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015),<ref name="DowneyAvengers2&3" /> ''Captain America: Civil War'' (2016),<ref name="DowneyVariety2014" /> ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' (2017),<ref name="KitTHR2016" /> ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018),<ref name="DowneyAvengers2&3" /> and ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019).<ref name="DowneyVariety2014" /> In addition, Downey makes an uncredited cameo appearance in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008)<ref name="DowneyTIH" /> and will reprise the role in ''[[Black Widow (2021 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2021).<ref name="DowneyBW" />

In ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), Stark appears in archival footage from ''Captain America: Civil War'',<ref name="StarkFFH" /> and also appears via archive footage in the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[The Consultant (film)|The Consultant]]'' (2011).<ref name="IGNConsultant" />

==Characterization==
===Appearance and personality===
Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,<ref name="EmpireJuly2007" /> especially adding humor to the film.<ref name="EmpireApril2008" /> Downey explained, "What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into [[Dudley Do-Right]], and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor."<ref name="FavreauStarkQuote" /> To prepare, Downey spent five days a week [[weight training]] and practiced martial arts to get into shape,<ref name="DowneyUSAToday" /> which he said benefited him because "it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day."<ref name="PumpingIron" />

In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', Stark struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands. Downey and Favreau, who had been handed a script and worked from it on the first movie, conceived of the film's story themselves.<ref name="RDJAugust2008" /> On Stark being a hero, Downey said "It's kind of heroic, but really kind of on his own behalf. So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man &ndash;' that he's now really wondering what that means. If you have all this cushion like he does and the public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power, I think he's way too insulated to be okay."<ref name="DowneyComicCon" />

''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' introduced Stark's role as one of an ensemble of heroes who must come together to defend the Earth from an alien invasion led by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. Downey initially pushed director [[Joss Whedon]] to make Stark the lead of the 2012 ''Avengers'' film: "Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."<ref name="BreznicanEW2011" /> About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, "In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others... In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others".<ref name="Filmink" /> At the climax of the film, Stark guides a nuclear missile through an interstellar portal to destroy the main alien vessel, demonstrating a willingness to sacrifice his life to save the Earth.<ref name="MCUJourneySR" />

[[File:Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Downey Jr. at Comic Con 2007, after being cast in ''Iron Man''.]]
In ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', Stark struggles to come to terms with his near-death experience in ''The Avengers'',<ref name="StarkMCUProfile" /> suffering from anxiety attacks. On making a third ''Iron Man'' film, Downey said, "My sense of it is that we need to leave it all on the field—whatever that means in the end. You can pick several different points of departure for that."<ref name="DowneyAug2011" /> On following up ''The Avengers'', Downey said they "tried to be practical, in a post-''Avengers'' world. What are his challenges now?  What are some limitations that might be placed on him? And what sort of threat would have him, as usual, ignore those limitations?"<ref name="ComicCon12Interview" /> Screenwriter Drew Pearce compared Stark in ''Iron Man 3'' to an American [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] for both being "heroes with a sense of danger to them, and unpredictability" even if Stark was a "free agent" instead of an authority figure like Bond. He also likened Tony to the protagonists of 1970s films such as ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), where "the idiosyncrasies of the heroes is what made them exciting."<ref name="PearceWhatCulture" />

In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', Stark has become the [[Benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name="WiglerMTV" /><ref name="FeigeIGN2014" /><ref name="DigitalSpy2015" /> On how his character evolves after the events of ''Iron Man 3'', Downey said, "I think he realizes that tweaking and making all the suits in the world—which is what he has been doing—still didn't work for that thing of his tour of duty that left him a little [[PTSD]]. So his focus is more on how can we make it so that there's no problem to begin with. That, you know, there's a bouncer at our planet's rope. That's the big idea."<ref name="DowneySR2014" /> The events of ''Age of Ultron'' lead directly into the conflict of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Stark leads a faction of Avengers in support of the regulation of individuals with superpowers.<ref name="VarietyAug2015" /><ref name="FandangoMarch2016" />  Anthony Russo said that Stark's egomania allowed the writers "to bring him to a point in his life where he was willing to submit to an authority, where he felt it was the right thing to do." Joe Russo added that because of the visions Stark saw in ''Age of Ultron'', he now has a guilt complex which "drives him to make very specific decisions", calling his emotional arc "very complicated".<ref name="RussosEmpire2015" /> Downey's personal trainer Eric Oram stated that the trick to pitting Rogers against Stark, "is to show Iron Man using the 'minimum force' necessary to win the fight".<ref name="DowneyTrainer" /> Marvel initially wanted Downey's part to be smaller, but "Downey wanted Stark to have a more substantial role in the film's plot." ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that Downey would receive $40 million-plus backend for his participation, as well as an additional payout if the film outperformed ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', as Marvel would attribute that success to Downey's presence.<ref name="DowneyVariety2014" />

In ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', Stark is [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Peter Parker]]'s mentor and is the creator of the U.S. Department of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref name="KitTHR2016" /><ref name="FilmSetVisitPg2" /> [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group]] chairman [[Thomas Rothman]] noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name="RothmanDowney2016" /> Watts noted that after Stark's actions in ''Civil War'', introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are "a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure? Is he comfortable with that?"<ref name="DamageControl" /> Co-writer [[Jonathan Goldstein (screenwriter)|Jonathan Goldstein]] compared Stark to [[Ethan Hawke]]'s father character in ''[[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]]'' (2014).<ref name="GoldsteinDaleyCS" />

Downey reprised the role in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name="DowneyAvengers2&3" /><ref name="KitTHR2016" /> ''Iron Man 3'' director [[Shane Black]] stated in March 2013 that "There has been a lot of discussion about it: 'Is this the last ''Iron Man'' for Robert [Downey Jr.]?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [he] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth." Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said that the character of Stark would continue to be featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe regardless of Downey's involvement.<ref name="BlackSR2013" /> Also in March, Downey said he was open to extending his contract, stating he feels "there's a couple other things we've gotta do" with the character.<ref name="DowneySR2013" /> In June 2013, when Downey signed on to return as Iron Man in ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', he also signed on for a third ''Avengers'' film.<ref name="DowneyAvengers2&3" /> In a July 2014 interview during the filming of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Downey expressed his interest in continuing to play Iron Man. "It's down to Kevin [Feige] and [[Isaac Perlmutter|Ike]] [Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment] and Disney to come to us with what the proposal is, and that’s on us to agree or disagree," Downey said. "When things are going great, there's a lot of agreement." He added, "It's that thing of: Why give up the belt when it feels like you can barely get jabbed?"<ref name="DowneyJuly2014" /> In April 2016, Downey expressed openness to appearing in a potential fourth ''Iron Man'' film, saying "I could do one more."<ref name="DowneyCBR2016" /> Downey's Marvel contract expired following ''Avengers: Endgame'', where Stark dies.<ref name="DowneyContract2019" />

Stark's fashion sense evolved over the course of the films, initially being described as "woefully basic...  mostly saggy jeans, henleys and tank tops—with an occasional suit", but improving by the time of the first ''Avengers'' film,<ref name="DworkenVulture" /> and becoming more sophisticated by ''Civil War'', as Stark matured and accepted greater responsibility for the consequences of his actions.<ref name="MakovskyCW" /> Downey expressed the desire for his wardrobe to reflect that "you still know he's Tony Stark, and you still know that he's the richest man in the world".<ref name="MakovskyCW" /> Stark's clothing has been described as alternating between "a sweet suit with some shades" in his corporate look, "or a t-shirt, jeans, and an arc reactor" in his personal time.<ref name="CosplaysEndgame" /> His fashion sense has been referred to as "part Mob boss and part ''[[The Big Bang Theory|Big Bang Theory]]'' cast member", and alternating "between boxy pinstripe suits and faux-ironic vintage tees".<ref name="DworkenVulture" />

===Armor and special effects===
{{main|Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}
[[File:Iron Man Mark III armor from Iron Man (2008 film).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tony Stark's armor, as seen in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008)]]

Tony Stark has worn multiple different armors in his MCU appearances. For ''Iron Man'', [[Stan Winston]] and his company built metal and rubber versions of the armors featured in the film,<ref name="ProductionNotes" /> while Iron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name="GranovSaunders" /> [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) created the digital armors in the film,<ref name="FavreauEffectsConcerns" /> with [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] doing additional work. To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit.<ref name="ProductionNotes" />

For ''Iron Man 2'', ILM again did the majority of the effects, as it did on the first film, with [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] also working on the film.<ref name="ILMBenSnow" /> In the filming of ''The Avengers'', [[Weta Digital]] took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM.<ref name="AWN" /> For ''Iron Man 3'', [[Digital Domain]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Trixter each worked on separate shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, [[Legacy Effects]] constructed partial suits that were worn on set.<ref name="Fxguide2" />

==Differences from the comics==
The origin story of Iron Man has been updated for the films. In the comics, Stark becomes Iron Man following an experience in the [[Vietnam War]], which is changed to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]].<ref name="EraoSR" /> [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]], in the comics, is the family butler, while in the films [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] is an artificial intelligence created by Stark,<ref name="HowardCB" /> though still inspired by the butler from Stark's childhood who is revealed to have passed away by the time the first film takes place.<ref name="EraoSR" /> Stark also proceeds through the early iterations of his armor to reach the now-familiar red and gold color scheme much more quickly. Stark's personality more closely resembles the Ultimate Comics version.<ref name="EraoSR" />

The AI version of J.A.R.V.I.S. is eventually uploaded by Stark to an artificial body and becomes [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. In the films, Vision is created by Stark and Banner as a counter to Ultron. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, [[Hank Pym]], and aspects of Pym's personality are integrated into this version of Stark, such as a desire for peace.<ref name="BrowneSR" /> Another difference in the films is the romance between Stark and Pepper Potts. In the comics, Potts has unrequited feelings for Stark, and ultimately becomes involved with Stark's chauffeur and bodyguard, Happy Hogan.<ref name="HowardCB" /><ref name="BrowneSR" />

A new approach not seen in comics is Stark's mentorial relationship with [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]. In the [[Ultimate Comics]], Stark and Parker do not go past the normal trainer-trainee relationship. In the MCU, Stark is also the creator of multiple iterations of Parker's Spider-Man suits, unlike in the comics where he only creates the [[Iron Spider|Iron Spider Armor]], while Parker creates other suits by himself.<ref name="McMillanWired" /> Stark is also shown to have a history with Parker's foes [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]]; both are depicted as having turned into villains due to actions by Stark. While he does not end up facing them, his protégé does.<ref name="VultureSR" /><ref name="MysterioPS" />

The Mandarin, a recurring Iron Man villain in the comics, turns out to be just an actor portraying the character, with the real criminal mastermind behind the acts claimed by "the Mandarin" being [[Aldrich Killian]]—a minor character in the comics.<ref name="BrowneSR" /><ref name="MandarinMTV" /> The Mandarin is revealed to be a real person in the Marvel One-Shot ''[[All Hail the King]]'';<ref name="MandarinSR" /> this version will instead be portrayed as an enemy of [[Shang-Chi]] in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).<ref name="MandarinShangChi" />

==Reception==
Downey's portrayal of the character has been positively received by fans and critics. [[Roger Ebert]] praised Downey's performance in ''Iron Man'', stating "At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies".<ref name="Ebert" /> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', a one-time Marvel Comics writer, commended that ''Iron Man 2'' "doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh".<ref name="FrankLoveceReview" />

For ''The Avengers'', Joe Morgenstern of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': "His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony".<ref name="MorgensternAvengers" /> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Morgenstern lauded both actor and character, praising "Robert Downey Jr.'s startlingly smart Tony Stark" who, along with Chris Evans' Captain America and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, contributed to that film's "feeling of family ... because the debuts of its most prominent members remain vivid to this day."<ref name="MorgensternEndgame" />

In 2015, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named Tony Stark the 13th greatest film character of all time.<ref name="EmpireGreatest" /> In 2019, following Stark's death in ''Avengers: Endgame'', a statue representing the character in his Iron Man armor was erected in [[Forte dei Marmi]], Italy.<ref name="ItalyStatue" />

===Accolades===
{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}
Downey has received numerous nominations and awards for his portrayal of Tony Stark. He notably won the [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] three times,<ref name="2009SaturnAwards" /><ref name="2014SaturnAwards" /><ref name="2019SaturnAwards" /> making him a record four-time winner (he had previously won the award for 1993's ''[[Heart and Souls]]'');<ref name="1994SaturnAwards" /> it is also the record for most wins for portraying the same character, tied with [[Mark Hamill]] for playing [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name="HamillSaturn" /><ref name="HamillSaturn2" /><ref name="HamillSaturn3" />
