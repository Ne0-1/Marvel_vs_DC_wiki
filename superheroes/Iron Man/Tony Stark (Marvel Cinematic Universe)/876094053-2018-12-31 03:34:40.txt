'''Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark''' is a [[character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character of the same name and known commonly by his [[alter ego]], '''[[Iron Man]]'''. In the films, Tony Stark is an [[industrialist]], genius inventor, and consummate playboy who is CEO of [[Stark Industries]]. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]], until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of [[powered exoskeleton]] suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.

{{As of|2018}}, the character is one of the central figures of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having appeared in nine films of the series (including a brief cameo in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''). In 2015, the evolution of the character over the series was described as "the defining arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe",<ref name="Lubin">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tony-stark-is-the-best-character-in-mcu-2015-5 |title=Tony Stark's evolution is the defining arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe |first=Gus |last=Lubin |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=May 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093127/http://www.businessinsider.com/tony-stark-is-the-best-character-in-mcu-2015-5 |archivedate=January 13, 2018 |df= }}</ref> and in 2018 it was argued that "no other character goes on as transformative a journey as Iron Man".<ref name="McLevy">{{cite web|url=https://film.avclub.com/no-one-in-marvels-avengers-universe-has-a-character-arc-1825543016|title=No one in Marvel's Avengers universe has a character arc that compares to Tony Stark's|first=Alex|last=McLevy|publisher=''AV Film''|date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
Tony Stark first premiered as a comic book character, in ''Tales of Suspense'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963), a collaboration among editor and story-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], story-artist [[Don Heck]], and cover-artist and character-designer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 91|isbn =978-0756641238}}</ref> Lee wanted to create the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership.<ref name="Excelsior 160">{{Cite book|title= Excelsior! : The Amazing Life of Stan Lee|last=Lee|first=Stan|author2=Mair, George|year= 2002|publisher= Simon & Schuster|location=New York, New York|isbn= 978-0684873053|page=160}}</ref> Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on [[Howard Hughes]],<ref name="Maskarticle">{{Cite journal|date=January 2008|title= Mask of the Iron Man|journal= [[Game Informer]]|issue= 177|page= 81}}</ref> explaining, "Howard Hughes was one of the most colorful men of our time.

In the mid-2000s, with a number of movies having been made from other Marvel properties licensed to other studios, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Iron Man. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |deadurl=no  }}</ref>

''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' introduced Stark's role as one of an ensemble of heroes who must come together to defend the Earth from an alien invasion led by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. Downey initially pushed director [[Joss Whedon]] to make Stark the lead of the 2012 ''Avengers'' film: "Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.'

{{quote|text=On the first ''Iron Man'', we tried to use the Legacy [Studios, [[Stan Winston]]'s effects company] and Stan Winston suits as much as we could. For the second one, Jon [Favreau] was confident we could create the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] suits, and the action dictated using them. So, Legacy created what we called the "football suits" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene.

He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5".

==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|section|date=December 2018}}
===Origin of Tony Stark and of Iron Man===
In the continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Tony Stark was born to [[Howard Stark|Howard]] and Maria Stark on May 29, 1970.<ref>Sources are inconsistent on Stark's date of birth; in a post-credits scene in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', Stark states that he was 14 years old in 1983.</ref> His childhood was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father, who was already famous as an inventor. He was also a [[child prodigy]], graduating from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], summa cum laude, at age 17.<ref>Mike O'Sullivan, Ohotmu Team, ''Marvel Cinematic Universe Guidebook: The Avengers Initiative'' (2017), p. 6.</ref> Stark's parents died in a car accident (later revealed to be an assassination by a brainwashed Bucky Barnes)<ref name="CACW">''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).</ref> on December 16, 1991, and Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well-known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a [[playboy lifestyle]]. In 1999, he attended a conference in [[Bern]] where he met scientists [[Maya Hansen]], inventor of the [[Extremis]] experimental regenerative treatment, and [[Aldrich Killian]], rejecting an offer to work for Killian's [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]].<ref name="IM3">''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013).</ref>

In early-2009, Stark travels to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.<ref name="Rant-Erao">{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/avengers-movies-compared-to-comics-characters/ |title=The Avengers: How 15 Movie Heroes Compare To The Comics |first=Matthew |last=Erao |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 6, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020419/https://screenrant.com/avengers-movies-compared-to-comics-characters/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 |df= }}</ref> Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an [[Iron Man's armor#Arc reactor|arc reactor]] to power Stark's electromagnet and a [[Iron Man's armor#Live-action films|suit of powered armor]]. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. With the aid of his computer [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark secretly builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit with a more powerful arc reactor.<ref name="IM1">''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).</ref>

At a Stark Industries charity event, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons were being used by the Ten Rings to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark learns that Stane has been [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'état|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Flying home, Stark is shot at by two [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter jets, forcing him to call Rhodes and reveal his secret identity. Stane acquires the wreckage of Stark's prototype from the Ten Rings, and has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]]. Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it, and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed "Iron Man". S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]]<!-- NOT Ultimate Nick Fury; the similarity between Ultimate and Movie Fury is covered elsewhere in the article --> then visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not "the only superhero in the world", and explaining that he wants to discuss the "Avenger Initiative".<ref name="IM1"/>

In Russia, [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] sees media coverage of Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man, and begins building his own miniature arc reactor. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}} Stark has become a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy, but discovers that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, Stark appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], and is attacked mid-race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intent to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build armored suits to upstage Stark. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the [[U.S. Air Force]].<ref name="IM2">''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010).</ref>

Nick Fury reveals that "Rushman" is Agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]], that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally, and that Vanko's father [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton]] jointly invented the arc reactor with Howard Stark, but tried to sell it for profit. Howard Stark had Anton deported, and the Soviets sent him to the gulag. Stark discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark synthesizes. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency. At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. After Romanoff is able to return control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes, Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism.<ref name="IM2"/> Stark's involvement in the Avengers initiative is evidenced by his approaching General [[Thaddeus Ross]] in a bar shortly after Ross's latest failure to capture the [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]], informing Ross that a team is being put together.<ref>''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008).</ref>

===Formation of the Avengers===
Several months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review the research of [[Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Stark, along with [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) and Romanoff, confront Loki, who surrenders. [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees Loki, but after a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. The Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, and Loki escapes. Stark and Rogers realize that Loki needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] in New York City. A [[Chitauri]] fleet in space invades through the wormhole, and Stark and the others rally in defense of the city. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile, and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground.<ref name="TA1">''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012).</ref>

===Aftermath of the Battle of New York===
Following the battle, [[Adrian Toomes]] and his salvage company contract to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] (D.O.D.C.), a partnership between Stark and the U.S. government. An enraged Toomes persuades his employees to keep [[Chitauri]] technology they have already scavenged to create advanced weapons.<ref name="SMHC">''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017).</ref> Stark develops [[PTSD]] from his experiences during the alien invasion, resulting in panic attacks. Restless, he builds several dozen [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Film|Iron Man suits]], creating friction with girlfriend Pepper Potts. When Happy Hogan is badly injured in one of a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], Stark issues a televised threat to the Mandarin, who destroys Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Maya Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.<ref name="IM3"/>

Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Hansen's Extremis, with the explosions being falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark traces the Mandarin to [[Miami]] and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. He discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named [[Trevor Slattery]], who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image; Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, is the real Mandarin. After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, in order to gain Stark's aid to fix Extremis's flaws and thus save Potts.<ref name="IM3"/>

Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves the surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. Killian intends to kill Ellis on an oil platform on live television. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Potts, having survived the Extremis procedure, kills Killian. Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy all of the Iron Man suits as a sign of his devotion to Potts, and undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing that he will always be Iron Man.<ref name="IM3"/>

===Creation of Ultron===
A few years later, Stark and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility commanded by Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] using the scepter previously wielded by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. While the team fights outside, Stark enters the lab to retrieve the scepter, and finds it, along with [[Chitauri]] ships from the Battle of New York and androids under construction. Wanda sneaks up behind him and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision: the rest of the Avengers dead or dying on a dark world in space, with the Captain's shield broken in half on the ground. Rogers warns him "You could have saved us" before dying, and his words "Why didn't you do more?" are heard. He then sees a massive fleet of Chitauri ships fly into a gigantic portal leading to Earth. Stark awakens from the vision, and grabs Loki's scepter with resolve.

Returning to Stark Tower, Stark and Bruce Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron eliminates Stark's A.I. [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at Stark Tower. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones, kills Strucker, recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers find and attack Ultron, but Wanda subdues most of the team with personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor<!-- Please note the term "Hulkbuster" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}}<ref name="TAAU">''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).</ref>

After hiding at a safe house for a time, Nick Fury arrives and encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to perfect a new body for him. The Maximoffs turn against Ultron when Wanda's powers reveal his plan to destroy humanity. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning to their headquarters in New York, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow—one of the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existence—was part of his vision. This "[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]" and the Maximoffs accompany Stark and the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. The Avengers establish a new base, and Stark leaves the team in the hands of Rogers and Romanoff.<ref name="TAAU"/>

===Aftermath of the Battle of Sokovia===
Some months after the Battle of Sokovia, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Registration acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]], which will establish UN oversight of the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Circumstances lead to Rogers and fellow super-soldier [[Bucky Barnes]] (framed for a terrorist attack) going rogue, along with [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], Maximoff, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]], and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]. Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, [[T'Challa]], Rhodes, Vision, and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]. Rogers and Barnes to escape. Stark learns that Barnes was framed and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by [[Helmut Zemo]], who plays footage that reveals that Barnes killed Stark's parents. Stark turns on them, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Stark returns to New York to work on exoskeletal leg braces to allow Rhodes to walk again.<ref name="CACW"/>

Peter Parker resumes his high school studies when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Stark rescues Parker from nearly drowning after an encounter with Adrian Toomes as the Vulture. Stark warns Parker against further involvement with the criminals. Another weapon from Toomes malfunctions during a fight with Parker and tears the [[Staten Island Ferry]] in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Stark Tower to the team's new headquarters. After Parker thwarts the plan and saves Toomes from an explosion, Stark invites him to become an Avenger full-time, but Parker declines. Pepper emerges from a packed press conference, called to make the announcement, and Stark decides to use the opportunity to instead propose to Pepper. At the end of the film, he returns the suit to Peter.<ref name="SMHC"/>

===Against Thanos===
In 2018, Stark and Pepper are in a New York City park discussing having children, when Bruce Banner, who had disappeared after the Battle of Sokovia, crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]]. Banner relays a warning to [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], and Stark that the mad Titan [[Thanos (comics)|Thanos]] plans to use the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Infinity Stones]] to kill half of all life in the universe. Agents of Thanos arrive to retrieve the Time Stone, prompting Strange, Stark, Wong and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to confront them. Strange is captured, and Stark and Parker pursue the spaceship that has taken him and rescue Strange. The trio proceeds to Thanos’ home planet [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], where they meet members of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. They form a plan to confront Thanos and remove the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], but the plan goes awry; Thanos overpowers the group and impales Stark. Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark. Thanos takes the stone and departs Titan for Earth, retrieves the final stone, and activates the Infinity Gauntlet. Stark, stranded on Titan, watches as Parker and others are turned to dust. Having seen the possible futures resulting from the conflict, Strange, before succumbing, tells Stark that "there was no other way".<ref>''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018).</ref>

==Differences from the comics==
Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe differs from the comic book version of the character in a number of details. In the comics, Stark becomes Iron Man following an experience in Vietnam, which is updated in the films to Afghanistan.<ref name="Rant-Erao"/> Jarvis, in the comics, is the family butler, while in the films, J.A.R.V.I.S. is an artificial intelligence created by Stark,<ref name="Beat 2014">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/iron-man-in-comic-vs-movies/ |title=Iron Man in Comic vs Movies |publisher=[[Comics Beat]] |date=August 31, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150308/http://www.comicsbeat.com/iron-man-in-comic-vs-movies/ |archivedate=January 13, 2018 |df= }}</ref> though still inspired by the butler from Stark's childhood.<ref name="Rant-Erao"/> Stark also proceeds through the early iterations of his armor to reach the now-familiar red and gold color scheme much more quickly.<ref name="Rant-Erao"/>

The AI version of J.A.R.V.I.S. is eventually uploaded by Stark to an artificial body, and becomes the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym, aspects of whose personality are integrated into this version of Stark, like a desire for peace.<ref name="Rant-Browne">{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 |df= }}</ref> Another difference in the films is the romance between Stark and Pepper Potts. In the comics, Potts has unrequited feelings for Stark, and ultimately becomes involved with Stark's chauffeur and bodyguard, Happy Hogan.<ref name="Beat 2014"/><ref name="Rant-Browne"/>

The villains faced by Stark in the films are also treated as more disposable. In the comics, characters like Obadiah Stane and the Mandarin are long-term recurring foes, while in the films, each is killed or rendered harmless in the course of a single film. The Mandarin turns out to be an actor, with the real criminal mastermind behind the acts claimed by the Mandarin being [[Aldrich Killian]] — a character who appears in the comics only in passing, and not as a serious villain.<ref name="Rant-Browne"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1706745/iron-man-3-comic-books/ |title=Does 'Iron Man 3' Stay True To The Comic Books? |publisher=[[MTV News]] |first=Kevin |last=Sullivan |date=May 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113203029/http://www.mtv.com/news/1706745/iron-man-3-comic-books/ |archivedate=January 13, 2018 |df= }}</ref>

==Reception==
In 2015, [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']] named Tony Stark the 13th greatest film character of all time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Team Empire|title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100-greatest-movie-characters/|date=June 29, 2015|website=Empire|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>
