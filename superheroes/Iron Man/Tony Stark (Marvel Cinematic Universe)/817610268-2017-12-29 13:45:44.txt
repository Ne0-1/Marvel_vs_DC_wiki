'''Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe''' has borrowed a number of characteristics and story lines from across the fifty-plus year history of the character of [[Iron Man]] in [[Marvel Comic]]s. Iron Man, in the films (as with the comic books, generally) is the [[alter ego]] of Tony Stark, an [[industrialist]], genius inventor, and consummate playboy, who is CEO of [[Stark Industries]] and, at the beginning of the series, a chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]]. {{As of|2017}}, the character is one of the central figures of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], having appeared in eight films of the series (including a brief post-credits cameo in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''). {{As of|2017}}, The character has been portrayed in all appearances by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Tony Stark. In 2015, the evolution of the character over the series was described as "the defining arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe",<ref name="Lubin">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tony-stark-is-the-best-character-in-mcu-2015-5|title=Tony Stark's evolution is the defining arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe|first=Gus|last=Lubin|publisher=''[[Business Insider]]''|date=May 28, 2015}}</ref> but it has also been asserted that Stark's course of action after ''The Avengers'' renders him "an insufferable asshole".<ref name="Nierstedt">{{cite web|url=https://comicsverse.com/tony-stark-biggest-hole-mcu/|title=Tony Stark: The MCU’s Biggest Asshole|first=Eric|last=Nierstedt|publisher=''Comicsverse''|date=November 20, 2017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin and initial development===
In the continuity of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], Tony Stark was born to Howard and Maria Stark on May 29, 1970. He was a [[child prodigy]], graduating from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], summa cum laude, at age 17.<ref>Mike O'Sullivan, Ohotmu Team, ''Marvel Cinematic Universe Guidebook: The Avengers Initiative'' (2017), p. 6.</ref> His childhood was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father, who was already famous as an inventor. Stark's parents died in a car accident (later revealed to be an assassination) when he was seventeen, and he inherited his father's business, becoming well-known as a weapons designer and playboy. During this period, in 1999, he meets scientist [[Maya Hansen]], the inventor of [[Extremis]], an experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist [[Aldrich Killian]] offers them a place in his company [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]], but Stark rejects the offer, humiliating Killian.

In the mid-2000s, Stark travels to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by one of his own company's rocket-propelled grenades. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings; [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a fellow captive who is a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word.

Stark and Yinsen secretly and quietly build a small, powerful electric generator called an [[Iron Man's armor#Arc reactor|arc reactor]] to power Stark's electromagnet and a [[Iron Man's armor#Live-action films|suit of powered armor]] to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit by accident. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, Stark keeps his work to himself because he is suspicious of his company. 

At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons, including the Jericho, were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'état|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Pepper to hack into its database. She discovers Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent [[Phil Coulson]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an [[intelligence agency]], to inform him of Stane's activities.

Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed "Iron Man". Shortly thereafter, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]]<!-- NOT Ultimate Nick Fury; the similarity between Ultimate and Movie Fury is covered elsewhere in the article --> visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not "the only superhero in the world", and explaining that he wants to discuss the "Avenger Initiative".

In Russia, the media covers [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]] has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy. However, Stark discovers that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.

Nick Fury reveals that "Rushman" is Agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency. At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit. At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. Stark's involvement in the Avengers initiative is evidenced by his approaching General [[Thaddeus Ross]] in a bar shortly after Ross's latest failure to capture the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], informing Ross that a team is being put together.

===Formation of the Avengers, and aftermath of the Chitauri invasion===
Several months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative", and Coulson visits Stark to have him review the research of [[Erik Selvig]]. Stark travels to [[Stuttgart]], where he, along with [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) and Romanoff, confront Loki, who surrenders. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.

The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Loki escapes, killing Coulson in the process, and Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] to the [[Chitauri]] fleet in space, launching his invasion.

Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. While the Avengers battle the Chitauri, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile, and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground.

In the months following the battle, [[Adrian Toomes]] and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] (D.O.D.C.), a partnership between [[Tony Stark]] and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the [[Chitauri]] technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons.

Stark develops PTSD from his experiences during the alien invasion, resulting in panic attacks. Restless, he builds several dozen [[Iron Man's armor#Live action films|Iron Man suits]], creating friction with girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Happy Hogan is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.

Teaming with Harley, a precocious 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis, which at this stage of development caused certain subjects to explosively reject the treatment. After veterans started exploding, these explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents [[Ellen Brandt|Brandt]] and [[Coldblood|Savin]] attack him. With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to [[Miami]] and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named [[Trevor Slattery]], who says he is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin, using Slattery as a cover. After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, in order to gain Stark's aid to fix Extremis's flaws and thus save Potts. Killian kills Hansen when she has a change of heart and tries to stop him.

Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian. After the battle, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing he will always be Iron Man.

Some months later, Stark and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility commanded by Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. They encounter two of Strucker's test subjects—twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro Maximoff]], who has superhuman speed, and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]], who can manipulate minds and project energy—and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter. Stark and Bruce Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I. [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at [[Stark Tower|their headquarters]]. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones, kills Strucker, recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and go to the base of arms dealer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] to obtain [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakandan]] [[vibranium]]. The Avengers attack Ultron and the Maximoffs, but Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing the Hulk (Banner) to rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor<!-- Please note the term "Hulkbuster" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}}

After hiding at a safe house for a time, [[Nick Fury]] arrives and encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. The Maximoffs turn against Ultron when Wanda's powers reveal his plan to destroy humanity. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning to their headquarters in New York, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow—one of the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existence—was part of his vision. This "[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]" and the Maximoffs accompany Stark and the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. Later, with the Avengers having established a new base, Stark leaves the team in the hands of Rogers and Romanoff as they prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, the Vision, [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], and Wanda.

===Aftermath of the Battle of Sokovia===

Some months after the Battle of Sokovia, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Registration acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. At a conference in [[Vienna]] where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King [[T'Chaka]] of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is [[Bucky Barnes]]—a childhood friend and war comrade of Rogers. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended.

Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, [[Helmut Zemo]] uses words from a book stolen from Barnes' previous handler to send Barnes on a rampage, during which Barnes fights other Avengers, including Stark. Rogers captures Barnes without Stark's knowledge. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains to Rogers that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in [[Suspended animation|cryogenic stasis]]. Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]], and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes, Vision, and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft prison]], while Rhodes is partially paralyzed after being inadvertently shot down by Vision, and Romanoff goes into exile.

Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable [[Iron Man's armor in other media|Stark's armor]] and departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Stark returns to New York, where he provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again.

Peter Parker resumes his studies at the [[Midtown High School|Midtown School of Science and Technology]] when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Parker, continuing his local crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man, discovers that criminals are using the advanced weapons they have acquired from Adrian Toomes. Parker is caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Parker and his friend Ned are able to disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features, but another weapon from Toomes malfunctions during a fight with Parker and tears the [[Staten Island Ferry]] in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit. Parker returns to his high school life, but during his [[homecoming]] dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] to the team's new headquarters. Parker thwarts the plan and saves Toomes' life after some unstable material explodes, but declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time.
