'''Anthony Edward Stark''' is a character portrayed by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]]—based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Iron Man|character of the same name]]—commonly known by his [[alter ego]], '''Iron Man'''. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of [[Stark Industries]]. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]], until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.

{{As of|2019}}, the character was one of the central figures of the MCU, having appeared in eleven films{{refn|name=Cameo|group=N|This includes a brief cameo in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.}} from his introduction in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', up to ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.  In 2015, the evolution of the character over the series was described as "the defining arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe".<ref name="Lubin">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tony-stark-is-the-best-character-in-mcu-2015-5 |title=Tony Stark's evolution is the defining arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe |first=Gus |last=Lubin |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=May 28, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093127/http://www.businessinsider.com/tony-stark-is-the-best-character-in-mcu-2015-5 |archivedate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> In 2018, it was argued that "no other character goes on as transformative a journey as Iron Man".<ref name="McLevy">{{cite web |url=https://film.avclub.com/no-one-in-marvels-avengers-universe-has-a-character-arc-1825543016 |title=No one in Marvel's Avengers universe has a character arc that compares to Tony Stark's |first=Alex |last=McLevy |publisher=AV Film |date=April 27, 2018}}</ref> The Iron Man character and Downey's performance has been credited with helping to cement the MCU as a multi-billion dollar franchise, with Stark often being considered "the godfather of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" and one of the greatest film characters of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100-greatest-movie-characters/|title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters|date=2015-06-29|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/06/27/robert-downey-jr-on-why-he-keeps-coming-back-for-marvel-films/|title=Robert Downey Jr. On Why He Keeps Coming Back For Marvel Films|website=Marvel|language=en|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref>

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
Tony Stark first premiered as a comic book character, in ''Tales of Suspense'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963), a collaboration among editor and story-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], story-artist [[Don Heck]], and cover-artist and character-designer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom DeFalco |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura, ed. |chapter=1960s |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2008 |location=London, United Kingdom |page=91 |isbn=978-0756641238}}</ref> Lee wanted to create the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership.<ref name="Excelsior 160">{{Cite book |title=Excelsior! : The Amazing Life of Stan Lee |last=Lee |first=Stan |author2=Mair, George |year=2002 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0684873053 |page=160}}</ref> Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on [[Howard Hughes]],<ref name="Maskarticle">{{Cite journal |date=January 2008 |title=Mask of the Iron Man |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=177 |page=81}}</ref> explaining, "Howard Hughes was one of the most colorful men of our time.

In the mid-2000s, with a number of movies having been made from other Marvel properties licensed to other studios, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Iron Man. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web |date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |work=[[Boston Globe]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Jon Favreau]], who was selected to direct the first ''Iron Man'' film, felt Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part,<ref name="DowneyUSAToday">{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-04-26-iron-man_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Scott |last=Bowles |title=First look: Downey forges a bond with 'Iron Man' role |date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2013 |archivedate=March 23, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FKvBy3m8?url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-04-26-iron-man_N.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> and that the actor could make Stark a "likable asshole," but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience.<ref name="FavreauWonderCon2008">{{cite web |last=Allsletter |first=Rob |title=Iron Man's Jon Favreau |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=March 3, 2008 |url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0803/03/jonfavreau.htm |accessdate=March 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QBJ1O4BQ?url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0803/03/jonfavreau.htm |archivedate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ultimately though, Downey ended up being the choice the studio made for the first character in their ever expansive cinematic universe. Favreau was also attracted to Downey from his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', with Downey frequently conversing with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name="KissKissBangBang">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/lethal-weapon-wunderkind-party-boy-892186 |title='Lethal Weapon' Wunderkind (and Former Party Boy) Shane Black Is Back ... and Still Looking for Action |last=Svetkey |first=Benjamin |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 13, 2016 |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mKuUWCRJ?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/lethal-weapon-wunderkind-party-boy-892186 |archivedate=November 27, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Characterization===
Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,<ref name="EmpireJuly2007">{{cite journal |last=Ambrose |first=Tom |title=The Man in the Iron Mask |page=69 |journal=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |date=July 26, 2007}}</ref> especially adding humor to the film.<ref name="EmpireApril2008">{{cite journal |last=Hewitt |first=Chris |title=Super Fly Guy |journal=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |date=April 2008 |pages=66–72}}</ref> Downey explained, "What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into [[Dudley Do-Right]], and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable.

In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', Stark struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' introduced Stark's role as one of an ensemble of heroes who must come together to defend the Earth from an alien invasion led by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. Downey initially pushed director [[Joss Whedon]] to make Stark the lead of the 2012 ''Avengers'' film: "Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."<ref name="EW4">{{cite web |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |date=September 29, 2011 |title={{-'}}The Avengers' Dis-Assembled!

In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others".<ref name="Filmink">{{cite journal |last=Adamek |first=Pauline |date=January–February 2012 |title=Avengers Assemble! |journal=[[Filmink]] |pages=70–75 |publisher=FKP International Exports}}</ref> At the climax of the film, Stark guides a nuclear missile through an interstellar portal to destroy the main alien vessel, demonstrating a willingness to sacrifice his life to save the Earth.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Long plot|section|date=December 2018}}

===Early life===
'''Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark''' was born to [[Howard Stark|Howard]] and [[Maria Stark]] on May 29, 1970.<ref>Sources are inconsistent on Stark's date of birth; in a post-credits scene in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', Stark states that he was 14 years old in 1983.{{or inline|date=June 2019}}</ref> His childhood was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father, who was already famous as an inventor and businessman. He was also a [[child prodigy]], graduating from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], summa cum laude, at age 17.<ref>Mike O'Sullivan, Ohotmu Team, ''Marvel Cinematic Universe Guidebook: The Avengers Initiative'' (2017), p. 6.</ref> On December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents were killed in a car accident (later revealed to be an assassination by a brainwashed Bucky Barnes).<ref name="CACW">''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).</ref> As a result, Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a [[playboy lifestyle]]. In 1999, he attended a conference in [[Bern]] where he met scientists [[Maya Hansen]], inventor of the [[Extremis]] experimental regenerative treatment, and [[Aldrich Killian]], rejecting an offer to work for Killian's [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]].<ref name="IM3">''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013).</ref>

===Becoming Iron Man===
In the late 2000s, Stark travels to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]], a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.<ref name="Rant-Erao">{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/avengers-movies-compared-to-comics-characters/ |title=The Avengers: How 15 Movie Heroes Compare To The Comics |first=Matthew |last=Erao |website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 6, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020419/https://screenrant.com/avengers-movies-compared-to-comics-characters/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 }}</ref> Ten Rings leader [[Raza (Marvel Comics)|Raza]] offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an [[Iron Man's armor#Arc reactor|arc reactor]] to power Stark's electromagnet and a [[Iron Man's armor#Live-action films|suit of powered armor]]. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. With the aid of his computer [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark secretly builds a sleeker version of his improvised armor suit with a more powerful arc reactor.<ref name="IM1">''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).</ref>

At a Stark Industries charity event, reporter [[Christine Everhart]] informs Stark that his company's weapons were being used by the Ten Rings to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark learns that Stane has been [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'état|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Flying home, Stark is shot at by two [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter jets, forcing him to call Rhodes and reveal his secret identity. Stane acquires the wreckage of Stark's prototype from the Ten Rings, and has a massive new suit [[reverse engineering|reverse engineered]]. Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it, and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed "Iron Man". Later, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]]<!-- NOT Ultimate Nick Fury; the similarity between Ultimate and Movie Fury is covered elsewhere in the article --> then visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not "the only superhero in the world", and explaining that he wants to discuss the "Avenger Initiative".<ref name="IM1"/>

In Russia, [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] sees media coverage of Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man, and begins building his own miniature arc reactor. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}} Stark has become a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy, but discovers that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, Stark appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], and is attacked mid-race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intent to prove that Iron Man is not invincible. Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build armored suits to upstage Stark. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the [[U.S. Air Force]].<ref name="IM2">''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010).</ref>

Nick Fury reveals that "Rushman" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally, and that Vanko's father [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton]] jointly invented the arc reactor with Howard Stark, but tried to sell it for profit. Howard Stark had Anton deported, and the Soviets sent him to the gulag. Stark discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark synthesizes. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor. At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. After Romanoff is able to return control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes, Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism.<ref name="IM2"/>

===Avengers and Battle of New York===
Stark's involvement in the Avengers initiative is evidenced by his approaching General [[Thaddeus Ross]] in a bar shortly after Ross's latest failure to capture the [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]], informing Ross that a team is being put together.<ref>''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008).</ref> Several months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review the research of [[Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Stark, along with [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) and Romanoff, confront Loki, who surrenders. [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees Loki, but after a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. The Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, and Loki escapes. Stark and Rogers realize that Loki needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] in New York City. A [[Chitauri]] fleet in space invades through the wormhole, and Stark and the others rally in defense of the city. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile, and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground.<ref name="TA1">''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012).</ref>

===Aftermath===
Following the battle, [[Adrian Toomes]] and his salvage company contract to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] (D.O.D.C.), a partnership between Stark and the U.S. government. An enraged Toomes persuades his employees to keep [[Chitauri]] technology they have already scavenged to create advanced weapons.<ref name="SMHC">''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017).</ref> Stark develops [[PTSD]] from his experiences during the alien invasion, resulting in panic attacks. Restless, he builds several dozen [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Film|Iron Man suits]], creating friction with girlfriend Pepper Potts. When Happy Hogan is badly injured in one of a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], Stark issues a televised threat to the Mandarin, who destroys Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Maya Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.<ref name="IM3"/>

Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Hansen's Extremis, with the explosions being falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark traces the Mandarin to [[Miami]] and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. He discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named [[Trevor Slattery]], who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image; Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, is the real Mandarin. After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, in order to gain Stark's aid to fix Extremis's flaws and thus save Potts.<ref name="IM3"/>

Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves the surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. Killian intends to kill Ellis on an oil platform on live television. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Potts, having survived the Extremis procedure, kills Killian. Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy all of the Iron Man suits as a sign of his devotion to Potts, and undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing that he will always be Iron Man.<ref name="IM3"/>

===Battle of Sokovia===
A few years later, Stark and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility commanded by Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. While the team fights outside, Stark enters the lab to retrieve the scepter, and finds it, along with [[Chitauri]] ships from the Battle of New York and androids under construction. Wanda sneaks up behind him and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision: the rest of the Avengers dead or dying on a dark world in space, with the Captain's shield broken in half on the ground. Rogers warns him "You could have saved us" before dying, and his words "Why didn't you do more?" are heard. He then sees a massive fleet of Chitauri ships fly into a gigantic portal leading to Earth. Stark awakens from the vision, and grabs Loki's scepter with resolve.

Returning to Stark Tower, Stark and Bruce Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron eliminates Stark's A.I. [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at Stark Tower. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones, kills Strucker, recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers find and attack Ultron, but Wanda subdues most of the team with personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor<!-- Please note the term "Hulkbuster" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}}<ref name="TAAU">''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).</ref>

After hiding at a safe house for a time, Nick Fury arrives and encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to perfect a new body for him. The Maximoffs turn against Ultron when Wanda's powers reveal his plan to destroy humanity. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning to their headquarters in New York, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow—one of the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existence—was part of his vision. This "[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]" and the Maximoffs accompany Stark and the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. The Avengers establish a new base, and Stark leaves the team in the hands of Rogers and Romanoff.<ref name="TAAU"/>

===Civil War===
Some months after the Battle of Sokovia, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Registration acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]], which will establish UN oversight of the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Circumstances lead to Rogers and fellow super-soldier [[Bucky Barnes]] (framed for a terrorist attack) going rogue, along with [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], Wanda Maximoff, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]], and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]. Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, [[T'Challa]], Rhodes, Vision, and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]. However, during the battle, Rogers and Barnes are able to escape. Stark learns that Barnes was framed and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by [[Helmut Zemo]], who plays footage that reveals that Barnes killed Stark's parents. Stark turns on them, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Stark returns to New York to work on exoskeletal leg braces to allow Rhodes to walk again.<ref name="CACW"/> Steve Rogers sends a flip phone to Stark, his former ally and friend, to keep in contact. When Ross calls informing him that Barton and the others have escaped Stark refuses to help.

Peter Parker resumes his high school studies when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Stark rescues Parker from nearly drowning after an encounter with Adrian Toomes now as the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. Stark warns Parker against further involvement with the criminals. Another weapon from Toomes malfunctions during a fight with Parker and tears the [[Staten Island Ferry]] in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Stark Tower to the team's new headquarters. After Parker thwarts the plan and saves Toomes from an explosion, Stark admits he was wrong about Parker and invites him to become an Avenger full-time, but Parker declines. Pepper emerges from a packed press conference, called to make the announcement, and Stark decides to use the opportunity to instead propose to Pepper. At the end of the film, he returns the suit to Peter.<ref name="SMHC"/>

===The Infinity War===
In 2018, Stark and Pepper are in a New York City park discussing having children, when Bruce Banner, who had disappeared after the Battle of Sokovia, crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]]. Banner relays a warning to [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], and Stark that the mad Titan [[Thanos (comics)|Thanos]] plans to use the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Infinity Stones]] to kill half of all life in the universe. [[Ebony Maw]] and [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Cull Obsidian]] arrive to retrieve the Time Stone, prompting Strange, Stark, Wong and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to confront them. Although Cull Obsidian is incapacitated and thrown into Antarctica, Strange is captured by Maw. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship to rescue him. After successfully freeing Strange and killing Maw, the trio proceed to Thanos’ home planet [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], where they meet members of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. They form a plan to confront Thanos and remove the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]], but the plan goes awry; Thanos overpowers the group and impales Stark. Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark. Thanos takes the stone and departs Titan for Earth, retrieves the final stone, and activates the Infinity Gauntlet. Stark and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], stranded on Titan, watch as Parker and others are turned to dust. Having seen the possible futures resulting from the conflict, Strange, before succumbing, tells Stark that "there was no other way".<ref>''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018).</ref>

Stark and Nebula are adrift in space before being rescued by [[Carol Danvers]] who returns them to Earth, where Stark chooses to retire and raise his daughter [[Morgan Stark|Morgan]] over the next five years. In 2023, when [[Scott Lang]] discovers a way to bring back the fallen, the Avengers approach Stark, who initially refuses, considering the idea dangerously hypothetical. Despite this he examines the matter privately and figures out how to do it successfully and agrees to help. Traveling through time, Stark fails to steal the Space Stone from an earlier version of himself following the Battle of New York, and instead goes further back to the 1970s to steal it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where he has a moving conversation with a younger version of his father, Howard Stark. The Avengers successfully obtain all of the Infinity Stones before returning to the present, which are incorporated into a gauntlet made by Stark which Banner then uses to resurrect those that were disintegrated by Thanos. However, they are followed by a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are summoned to 2023 by [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], who had previously been captured by Thanos and also replaced by her 2014 self. Following a climactic battle, Thanos obtains Stark's gauntlet and the two of them wrestle for control of it. Thanos is able to fling Stark away before attempting another snap, but discovers that Stark has caused all of the Infinity Stones to move to Stark's own armor. Stark then uses them to disintegrate Thanos and all of his forces, saving the universe but fatally injuring himself in the process due to the gamma radiation caused by the stones. He dies peacefully, surrounded by Rhodes, Parker and Potts. A funeral attended by many heroes is later held for him at his homestead.<ref>''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).</ref>

===Legacy===
Months later, the world continues to mourn and idolize the deceased Stark with murals and graffiti being drawn to honor the fallen Avenger. Parker, having resumed his studies at Midtown High School, still mourns his fallen mentor, as shown when Parker begins facing increased pressure from the public on whether he would succeed Stark, causing his survivor's guilt to surface at times. Parker considers taking a break from superheroics and travelling to Europe along with his classmates partly because of this. Parker later receives Stark's E.D.I.T.H (Even Dead I'm The Hero) glasses from Nick Fury who states it is for Stark's successor, which will give control to all Stark Industries technology. Parker relinquishes custody of it to [[Mysterio]], who is masquerading as the hero Quentin Beck, initially Parker's ally, but later revealed to be a fraud and an ex-Stark Industries employee who was fired by Stark due to his unstable and callous nature. During their first battle, Beck taunts Parker for his failure to be a better hero and save Stark, even creating an illusion of a zombified corpse of Stark coming out of a grave to frighten and traumatize Parker. Beck tries to use E.D.I.T.H to access Stark Technology, which he intends to use to create an Avengers-level threat, but is ultimately stopped by Parker, who later comes to terms with Stark's death.<ref>''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).</ref>

==Differences from the comics==
Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe differs from the comic book version of the character in a number of details. In the comics, Stark becomes Iron Man following an experience in [[Vietnam]], which is updated in the films to [[Afghanistan]].<ref name="Rant-Erao"/> Jarvis, in the comics, is the family butler, while in the films, J.A.R.V.I.S. is an artificial intelligence created by Stark,<ref name="Beat 2014">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/iron-man-in-comic-vs-movies/ |title=Iron Man in Comic vs Movies |website=[[Comics Beat]] |date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150308/http://www.comicsbeat.com/iron-man-in-comic-vs-movies/ |archivedate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> though still inspired by the butler from Stark's childhood who is revealed to have passed away by the time the first film takes place<ref name="Rant-Erao"/> Stark also proceeds through the early iterations of his armor to reach the now-familiar red and gold color scheme much more quickly. Stark's personality more closely resembles the Ultimate Comics version.<ref name="Rant-Erao"/>

The AI version of J.A.R.V.I.S. is eventually uploaded by Stark to an artificial body and becomes the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. The Vision, in the films, is created by Stark and Bruce Banner as a counter to Ultron. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, [[Hank Pym]], and aspects of Pym's personality are integrated into this version of Stark, such as a desire for peace.<ref name="Rant-Browne">{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 }}</ref> Another difference in the films is the romance between Stark and Pepper Potts. In the comics, Potts has unrequited feelings for Stark, and ultimately becomes involved with Stark's chauffeur and bodyguard, Happy Hogan.<ref name="Beat 2014"/><ref name="Rant-Browne"/>

A new approach not seen in comics is Stark's familial relationship with [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], who he mentors. In the Ultimate Comics, Stark and Parker do not go past the normal trainer-trainee relationship. In the MCU, Stark is also the creator of multiple iterations of Parker's Spider-Man suits, unlike in the comics where he only creates the [[Iron Spider|Iron Spider Armor]], while Parker creates other suits by himself. Also a newer approach, Stark is shown to have a history with Parker's foes [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]]; both are depicted as having turned into villains after due to actions by Stark. While he does not end up facing them, his protégé does.

The villains faced by Stark in the films are also treated as more disposable. In the comics, characters like Obadiah Stane and the Mandarin are long-term recurring foes, while in the films, each is killed or rendered harmless in the course of a single film, while "The Mandarin" turns out to be an actor portraying the Mandarin, with the real criminal mastermind behind the acts claimed by "the Mandarin" being [[Aldrich Killian]] — a character who appears in the comics only in passing, and not as a serious villain.<ref name="Rant-Browne"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1706745/iron-man-3-comic-books/ |title=Does 'Iron Man 3' Stay True To The Comic Books? |publisher=[[MTV News]] |first=Kevin |last=Sullivan |date=May 2, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113203029/http://www.mtv.com/news/1706745/iron-man-3-comic-books/ |archivedate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> The Mandarin is revealed to be a real person in ''[[All Hail the King]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/iron-man-4-mandarin-runaways-marvel-interview/ |title=Drew Pearce Talks ‘All Hail The King’, Runaways, The Real Mandarin & Marvel Future |last=Keyes |first=Rob |date=February 27, 2014 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227225329/http://screenrant.com/iron-man-4-mandarin-runaways-marvel-interview/ |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> this version will instead by portrayed as an enemy of [[Shang-Chi]] in ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' (2021).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/marvel-phase-4-everything-we-know-about-the-mcus-future.html |title=Marvel Phase 4: Everything We Know About the Future of the MCU |last=Lee |first=Chris |website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] |date=July 21, 2019 |access-date=October 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721173006/https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/marvel-phase-4-everything-we-know-about-the-mcus-future.html |archive-date=July 21, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Stark's death in ''Avengers: Endgame'' occurred without any depiction of Stark fighting the "real" Mandarin.

==Reception==
Anthony Lane of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said of the character's portrayal in ''Iron Man 2'', "To find a comic-book hero who doesn't agonize over his supergifts, and would defend his constitutional right to get a kick out of them, is frankly a relief".<ref name="NewYorkerReview">{{Cite web |date=May 10, 2010 |first=Anthony |last=Lane |title=Fighting Form |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2010/05/10/100510crci_cinema_lane |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=May 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJT5xgy9?url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2010/05/10/100510crci_cinema_lane |archivedate=August 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3 stars out of 4, stating that "''Iron Man 2'' is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr".<ref name="EbertReview">{{Cite news |date=May 5, 2010 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100505/REVIEWS/100509987 |title=Iron Man 2 Review |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |quote="Iron Man 2" is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr. |accessdate=May 8, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJTJMoKa?url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20100505%2FREVIEWS%2F100509987 |archivedate=August 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}{{Rating|3|4}}</ref> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', a one-time Marvel Comics writer, said that, "In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to ''Iron Man'' doesn't find a changed man.

For ''The Avengers'', Joe Morgenstern of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': "His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony".<ref name=wsj22>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303916904577378881752158826 |title={{-'}}Avengers': Multiple Marvels, Diminished Fun|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=May 5, 2012|author=Morgenstern, Joe |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BtAEZTdc?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303916904577378881752158826.html |archivedate=November 2, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Morgenstern lauded both actor and character, praising "Robert Downey Jr.’s startlingly smart Tony Stark" who, along with Chris Evans' Captain America and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, contributed to that film's "feeling of family ... because the debuts of its most prominent members remain vivid to this day."<ref name="MorgensternEndgame">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/avengers-endgame-review-a-marvelous-wrap-11556124677|title=‘Avengers: Endgame’ Review: A Marvelous Wrap|last=Morgenstern|first=Joe|journal=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=June 3, 2019|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/78rjAMsPj|archivedate=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Accolades===
Downey has received numerous nominations and awards for his portrayal of Tony Stark. He notably won the [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] three times, making him a record four-time winner (he had previously won the award for 1993's ''[[Heart and Souls]]''); it is also the record for most wins for portraying the same character, tied with [[Mark Hamill]] for playing [[Luke Skywalker]].
