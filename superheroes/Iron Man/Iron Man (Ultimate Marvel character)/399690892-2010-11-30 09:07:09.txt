'''Ultimate Iron Man''', real name '''Antonio Stark''', is the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of [[Iron Man]] that first appears in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' #4, written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Mike Allred]] (though his biography, as related in this book, is very different from what is later established as canon). He later appeared in the [[Ultimates]] and often appears in the same titles they do. In the Ultimate Universe, Antonio "Tony" Stark is a wealthy business tycoon and inventor who creates the Iron Man power armor. Like his mainstream counterpart, Tony has a drinking problem and life-threatening affliction; in this case an inoperable [[brain]] [[tumor]] which will kill him anytime between six months and five years, which he explains is the reason he has become a philanthropist and superhero. Stark's early life and origins are explored in the ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' miniseries, written by science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]].

==Fictional character biography==
Stark's genius is attributed to the fact that he was infected with a regenerative virus while in his mother's ([[Maria Stark|Maria Cerra]]'s) womb, which facilitated the spread of undifferentiated neural tissue throughout his body, in effect making his entire body part of his brain. However, this brings with it an over stimulation of his neural cells, causing excruciating pain whenever his skin comes into contact with anything, even dust. To save the infant Tony's life, his father [[Howard Stark]] applied an experimental bacterial coating all over his body, which grants him a certain degree of protection. However, it is unable to prevent the chronic, constant pain within his body, and the coating can be washed off. In part, this motivates him to create a stronger, more durable form of armor in the form of Iron Man. It's during this part of his young life where he meets [[War Machine|Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes]], a fellow genius he befriends, and [[Obadiah Stane]], the pudgy hidden [[Psychopathy|sociopathic]] son of [[Zebadiah Stane]] (his father's business rival) and [[Loni Stark/Loni Stane|Loni Stane]] (his father's first wife). ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]] II'', ''[[The Ultimates]]'' vol. II, and ''[[Ultimate Human]]'' also portray him as having a "fleet" of [[Nanorobots|nanobots]] in his bloodstream, which he uses to control the Iron Man armor and other machines; ''Ultimate Iron Man II'' further shows him releasing these nanites from his blood via a pricked finger to form mosquito-like flying constructs which can perform complex tasks such as picking locks, defusing bombs, and can combine themselves into a small monitoring screen.

When Tony hears [[Nick Fury]] is assembling a team of superheroes, Tony volunteers his services. After helping defeat the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]], Tony develops a friendship with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] and Steve Rogers ([[Ultimate Captain America]]). He has since captured the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], battled [[Chitauri]] spaceships, snuck aboard a [[Kree]] spacecraft, and decapitated a [[Silver Surfer]] clone as a member of the Ultimates. Though he has made these great accomplishments, he is still unsure of himself, as in the Ultimates when he is beat down and throws up in his own helmet. He doubts his own abilities and decides he can't continue fighting until a soldier asks, "If you don't do it, who will?". 

Tony appears in Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk, where he supports Wolverine being sent to kill Banner.  Tony also criticizes the law being used to stop the Hulk, during which he mockingly suggests creating a Superhero Registration Law referencing the mainstream Stark's support of the Superhero Registration Act.

Stark falls in love with and proposes to Natasha Romanova ([[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]). Just prior to proposing, Stark gives her a black suit of armor, almost identical to his own. The flight test of the suit includes flying over her homeland, where Stark had paid the three million inhabitants of her hometown to stand in a field, spelling out his proposal, which she immediately accepts. When the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] invade America, the Widow shoots [[Edwin Jarvis]] and then tries to get Stark, at gunpoint, to transfer much of his fortune to her. However, Stark has ultimate control of the [[Nanorobotics|nanites]] in her bloodstream that allows her to interface with her armor. Using these nanites, Stark incapacitates Romanova and retrieves the enemy plans from her mind with the intention of fighting back against the Liberators. He takes "Iron Man 6", a massive [[helicarrier]]-sized ship armed with dozens of laser cannons and machine guns, and wipes out the air force of the Liberators in Washington, D.C. (as well as his opposite number in the Liberators, [[Crimson Dynamo]]). He then heads to New York to aid the heroes there. After the battle Stark agrees to finance the now independent Ultimates and very quickly gets over Natasha's betrayal with the help of a pretty blonde.

The start of Volume 3 sees Tony becoming a full-blown alcoholic.  A [[sex tape]] that he made with Natasha during their time together also makes into the public, causing a [[Public relations|PR]] nightmare for the Ultimates.

After Ultimatum, Iron Man will be the main character in the ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' mini-series where he will race across the world to find his stolen armor and save his enterprise. During that time, Tony's brother [[Gregory Stark]] will take his place as financial manager for The newly formed Avengers team and Rhodey will be back as War Machine, where he will be part of the team that will hunt down the renegade Captain America who deserted the group to find his son who is the Red Skull in the Ultimate universe.

==In other media==
* Tony Stark/Iron Man (voiced by [[Marc Worden]]) has been featured in ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]'', an animated [[direct-to-video]] adaptation of the ''[[Ultimates]]''. Although based on Ultimate Iron Man, this version's (like in the main [[Marvel Universe]] continuity) identity is not a matter of public record and is inflicted with a [[heart condition]] rather than a [[brain tumor]]. 

* In ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]'', Tony Stark has been working on multiple armours in secret for some time using his company's resources. One of the armours that are seen resemble the "Ultimate Iron Man" suit.

* Mark Miller said that Ultimate Tony Stark/Iron Man was a big inspiration for ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.
