'''Iron Man''' ('''Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], as well as its associated media. The character was created by writer and editor [[Stan Lee]], developed by scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and designed by artists [[Don Heck]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. He made his [[first appearance]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963).

An [[Americans|American]] [[billionaire]] [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]], [[business magnate]], and ingenious [[engineer]], Tony Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping in which his captors attempt to force him to build a [[weapon of mass destruction]]. He instead creates a [[Iron Man's armor|powered suit of armor]] to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark augments his suit with weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, [[Stark Industries]]. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man, while at first concealing his true identity. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore [[Cold War]] themes, particularly the role of American technology and business in the fight against [[communism]].<ref name="Lee Iron">{{cite web|url= http://www.blastr.com/2013-4-30/little-known-sci-fi-fact-stan-lee-thought-marvel%E2%80%99s-readers-would-hate-iron-man-first|title= Little-known sci-fi fact: Stan Lee thought Marvel’s readers would HATE Iron Man (at first)|first= Mike|last= Lee|date= April 30, 2013|publisher= [[Syfy|Blastr]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117105313/http://www.blastr.com/2013-4-30/little-known-sci-fi-fact-stan-lee-thought-marvel%E2%80%99s-readers-would-hate-iron-man-first|archivedate= November 17, 2015|deadurl= no|access-date= May 7, 2015|quote= In the years following his debut, Iron Man fought against the tyranny of communism, corporate crime, terrorism and alcoholism as a “second-tier” Marvel hero, despite always being a popular character amongst readers.}}</ref> Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War themes to contemporary concerns, such as [[corporate crime]] and [[terrorism]].<ref name="Lee Iron"/>

Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated TV shows and films. The character is portrayed by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in the live action film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), which was a critical and box office success. Downey, who received much acclaim for his performance, reprised the role in a cameo in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008), two ''Iron Man'' sequels ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013), ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), and will do so again in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) as well as ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and its currently [[Production of Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers sequel|untitled sequel]] (2019) in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

===Premiere===
Iron Man's [[Marvel Comics]] premiere in ''Tales of Suspense'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963) was a collaboration among editor and story-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], story-artist [[Don Heck]], and cover-artist and character-designer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 91|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Set against the background of the Vietnam War, Iron Man signaled the end of Marvel's monster/suspense line when he debuted in ''Tales of Suspense'' #39...[Stan] Lee discussed the general outline for Iron Man with Larry Lieber, who later wrote a full script for the origin story.

And that's, I think, what made that character interesting."<ref name="IMDVD"/> Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on [[Howard Hughes]],<ref name="Maskarticle">{{Cite journal|date=January 2008|title= Mask of the Iron Man|journal= [[Game Informer]]|issue= 177|page= 81}}</ref> explaining, "Howard Hughes was one of the most colorful men of our time.

While Lee intended to write the story himself,<ref name="origins 46 pt. 2">Lee, ''Son of Origins,'' p. 47.</ref> a minor deadline emergency eventually forced him to hand over the premiere issue to Lieber, who fleshed out the story.<ref name="origins 46 pt. 1"/> The art was split between Kirby and Heck.

The character's original costume was a bulky gray armored suit, replaced by a golden version in the second story (issue #40, April 1963). It was redesigned as sleeker, red-and-golden armor in issue #48 (Dec. 1963) by that issue's interior artist, [[Steve Ditko]], although Kirby drew it on the cover. As Heck recalled in 1985, "[T]he second costume, the red and yellow one, was designed by Steve Ditko. I found it easier than drawing that bulky old thing. The earlier design, the robot-looking one, was more Kirbyish."<ref name=featurep18>Heck, quoted in {{cite news | first=John | last= Peel | title = A Signing Session with Don Heck | work = Comics Feature | issue = 34 | date= March–April 1985 | page= 18}}</ref>

In his premiere, Iron Man was an [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] hero, defeating various Vietnamese agents. Lee later regretted this early focus.<ref name="origins 45"/><ref name="Nation">{{Cite book|title=Comic Book Nation|last=Wright|first=Bradford|authorlink= |year=2001|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=0-8018-6514-X|page=336}}</ref> Throughout the character’s [[comic book]] series, technological advancement and [[National security|national defense]] were constant themes for Iron Man, but later issues developed Stark into a more complex and vulnerable character as they depicted his battle with [[alcoholism]] (as in the "[[Demon in a Bottle]]" storyline) and other personal difficulties.

From issue #59 (Nov. 1964) to its final issue #99 (March 1968), the anthological [[science-fiction]] backup stories in ''Tales of Suspense'' were replaced by a feature starring the superhero [[Captain America]]. Lee and Heck introduced several adversaries for the character including the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] in issue #50 (Feb. 1964),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 99: "Following the tradition of Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu and Atlas' own Yellow Claw, the Mandarin first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #50 in a story written by Stan Lee and illustrated by Don Heck."</ref> the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] in #52 (April 1964)<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 100: "The Black Widow was a Russian spy assigned to capture American industrialist Tony Stark...Her story was plotted by Stan Lee, written by...Don Rico, and drawn by Don Heck."</ref> and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] five issues later.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 101: "A case of mistaken identity led the police to assume [Hawkeye] was part of [a criminal] gang. The Black Widow saved him from capture but also tricked him into fighting Iron Man"</ref>

Lee said that "of all the comic books we published at Marvel, we got more fan mail for Iron Man from women, from females, than any other title....We didn't get much fan mail from girls, but whenever we did, the letter was usually addressed to Iron Man."<ref name="IMDVD"/>

Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team. The character has  since appeared in every subsequent volume of the series.

Writers have updated the war and locale in which Stark is injured. In the original 1963 story, it was the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 1990s, it was updated to be the first [[Gulf War]],<ref name="emerging pop">{{cite web |url= http://www.americanpopularculture.com/archive/emerging/graphic.htm|title= Graphic Responses: Comic Book Superheroes' Militarism Post 9/11|first= A. David|last= Lewis|date= January 2008|publisher= Americana: The Institute for the Study of American Popular Culture|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6GcdGHcMJ|archivedate= May 14, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 6, 2008}}</ref> and later updated again to be the war in [[Afghanistan]]. Stark's time with the Asian [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist [[Ho Yinsen]] is consistent through nearly all incarnations of the Iron Man origin, depicting Stark and Yinsen building the original armor together. One exception is the [[direct-to-DVD]] animated feature film ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'', in which the armor Stark uses to escape his captors is not the first Iron Man suit.

====Themes====
The original ''Iron Man'' title explored [[Cold War]] themes, as did other [[Stan Lee]] projects in the early years of [[Marvel Comics]]. Where ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' respectively focused on American domestic and government responses to the Communist threat, ''Iron Man'' explored industry's role in the struggle. Tony Stark's real-life model, [[Howard Hughes]], was a significant defense contractor who developed new weapons technologies. Hughes was an icon both of American individualism and of the burdens of fame.<ref name="JournalofPopCulture">{{cite journal|last = Genter|first = Robert|title = 'With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility:' Cold War Culture and the Birth of Marvel Comics|journal = [[The Journal of Popular Culture]]|volume = 40|issue = 6|pages = 953–978 and 965–969|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]|date = December 2007|location= Hoboken, New Jersey|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5931.2007.00480.x}}</ref>

Historian Robert Genter, in ''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]'', writes that Tony Stark specifically presents an idealized portrait of the American inventor. Where earlier decades had seen important technological innovations come from famous ''individuals'' (e.g., [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], the [[Wright brothers]]), the 1960s saw new technologies (including weapons) being developed mainly by the research teams of ''corporations''. As a result, little room remained for the inventor who wanted credit for, and creative and economic control over, his/her own creations.

Issues of entrepreneurial autonomy, government supervision of research, and ultimate loyalty figured prominently in early ''Iron Man'' stories — the same issues affecting American scientists and engineers of that era.<ref name="JournalofPopCulture"/> Tony Stark, writes Genter, is an inventor who finds motive in his [[emasculated|emasculation]] as an autonomous creative individual. This blow is symbolized by his chest wound, inflicted at the moment he is forced to invent things for the purposes of others, instead of just himself. To Genter, Stark's transformation into Iron Man represents Stark's effort to reclaim his autonomy, and thus his manhood. The character's pursuit of women in bed or in battle, writes Genter, represents another aspect of this effort. The pattern finds parallels in other works of 1960s popular fiction by authors such as "[[Ian Fleming]] (creator of [[James Bond]]), [[Mickey Spillane]] ([[Mike Hammer]]), and [[Norman Mailer]], who made unregulated sexuality a form of authenticity."<ref name="JournalofPopCulture"/>

===Origins===
Anthony Edward Stark, the son of wealthy industrialist and head of [[Stark Industries]], [[Howard Stark]], and [[Maria Stark]], was born on [[Long Island]]. A boy genius, he enters [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] at the age of 15 to study [[electrical engineering]] and later receives master's degrees in electrical engineering and physics. After his parents are killed in a car accident, he inherits his father's company.

Tony Stark is injured by a booby trap and captured by enemy forces led by [[Wong-Chu]]. Wong-Chu orders Stark to build weapons, but Stark's injuries are dire and shrapnel is moving towards his heart. His fellow prisoner, [[Ho Yinsen]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physicist]] whose work Stark had greatly admired during college, constructs a [[magnetism|magnetic]] chest plate to keep the shrapnel from reaching Stark's heart, keeping him alive. In secret, Stark and Yinsen use the workshop to design and construct a [[Iron Man's armor|suit]] of [[powered exoskeleton|powered armor]], which Stark uses to escape. But during the escape attempt, Yinsen sacrifices his life to save Stark's by distracting the enemy as Stark recharges. Stark takes revenge on his kidnappers and heads back to rejoin the American forces, on his way meeting a wounded American [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] fighter pilot, [[War Machine|James "Rhodey" Rhodes]].

Back home, Stark discovers that the shrapnel fragment lodged in his chest cannot be removed without killing him, and he is forced to wear the armor's chestplate beneath his clothes to act as a regulator for his heart. He must recharge the chestplate every day or else risk the shrapnel killing him. The [[cover-up|cover story]] that Stark tells the news media and general public is that Iron Man is his (presumably robotic) personal [[bodyguard]], and corporate mascot. To that end, Iron Man fights threats to his company (e.g., [[Communism|Communist]] opponents [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], the [[Crimson Dynamo]], and the [[Titanium Man]]), as well as independent villains like the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] (who eventually becomes his greatest enemy). No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man, as he cultivates a strong public image of being merely a rich playboy and industrialist. Two notable members of the series' supporting cast, at this point, are his personal chauffeur [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Harold "Happy" Hogan]], and secretary [[Pepper Potts|Virginia "Pepper" Potts]]—to both of whom he eventually reveals his dual identity. Meanwhile, James Rhodes finds his own niche as Stark's personal pilot, ultimately revealing himself to be a man of extraordinary skill and daring, in his own right.

The series took an anti-Communist stance in its early years, which was softened as public (and therefore, presumably, reader) opposition rose to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="origins 45"/> This change evolved in a series of storylines featuring Stark profoundly reconsidering his political opinions, and the morality of manufacturing weapons for the U.S. military. Stark shows himself to be occasionally arrogant, and willing to act unethically in order to 'let the ends justify the means'.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24317684|title= Quiz: Is your 'Iron Man' knowledge iron-clad?|first= Christopher|last= Bahn|date= May 4, 2008|publisher= [[MSNBC]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080520193710/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24317684|archivedate=May 20, 2008 |deadurl= yes|accessdate= December 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://graphicpolicy.com/tag/iron-man/|title= Iron Man Takes Off|date= May 4, 2008|publisher= Graphic Policy|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513164840/http://graphicpolicy.com/tag/iron-man/|archivedate=May 13, 2008 |deadurl= yes|accessdate= December 28, 2010}}</ref> This leads to personal conflicts with the people around him, both in his civilian and superhero identities. Stark uses his vast personal fortune not only to outfit his own armor, but also to develop weapons for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; other technologies (e.g., [[Quinjet]]s used by [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]]); and, the image inducers used by the [[X-Men]]. Eventually, Stark's heart condition is discovered by the public and resolved with an artificial [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Goodwin, Archie]]|penciller= Tuska, George|inker= [[Johnny Craig|Craig, Johnny]]|story= What Price Life?!|title= Iron Man|issue= 19|date= November 1969}}</ref>

===1970s and early 1980s===
Later on, Stark expands on his armor designs and begins to build his arsenal of specialized armors for particular situations such as for [[Human spaceflight|space travel]]<ref name="IronMan142" /> and [[stealth technology|stealth]].<ref name="DeFalco202" /><ref name="IronMan152" /> Stark develops a serious dependency on [[alcoholism|alcohol]] in the "[[Demon in a Bottle]]" storyline.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Michelinie|first1= David|last2= Layton|first2= Bob|last3= Romita Jr.|first3= John|title = Iron Man: Demon in a Bottle|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2006<!-- Date of collected edition -->|page = 176|isbn = 978-0785120438}}</ref> The first time it becomes a problem is when Stark discovers that the national security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] has been buying a controlling interest in his company in order to ensure Stark's continued weapons development for them. At the same time, it was revealed that several minor supervillains armed with advanced weapons who had bedeviled Stark throughout his superhero career were in fact in the employ of Stark's business rival, [[Justin Hammer]] who began to plague Stark more directly.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David; Layton, Bob|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Layton, Bob|story= Casino Fatale!|title= Iron Man|issue= 123|date= June 1979}}</ref><ref name="IronMan124">{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David; Layton, Bob|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Layton, Bob|story= Pieces of Hate!|title= Iron Man|issue= 124|date= July 1979}}</ref> At one point in Hammer's manipulations, the Iron Man armor is even taken over and used to murder a diplomat.<ref name="IronMan124" /> Although Iron Man is not immediately under suspicion, Stark is forced to hand the armor over to the authorities.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David; Layton, Bob|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Layton, Bob|story= The Monaco Prelude|title= Iron Man|issue= 125|date= August 1979}}</ref> Eventually Stark and Rhodes, who is now his personal pilot and confidant, track down and defeat those responsible, although Hammer would return to bedevil Stark again.<ref name="IronMan142" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David; Layton, Bob|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Layton, Bob|story= The Caribbean Connection|title= Iron Man|issue= 141|date= December 1980}}</ref> With the support of his then-girlfriend, [[Bethany Cabe]], his friends and his employees, Stark pulls through these crises and overcomes his dependency on alcohol.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David; Layton, Bob|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Layton, Bob|story= Demon In a Bottle|title= Iron Man|issue= 128|date= November 1979}}</ref> Even as he recovers from this harrowing personal trial, Stark's life is further complicated when he has a confrontation with [[Doctor Doom]] that is interrupted by an opportunistic enemy sending them back in time to the time of [[King Arthur]].<ref name="IronMan149" /> Once there, Iron Man thwarts Doom's attempt to solicit the aid of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]], and the Latverian ruler swears deadly vengeance—to be indulged sometime after the two return to their own time.<ref name="IronMan150" /> This incident was collected and published as ''[[Doomquest]].''

Some time later, a ruthless rival, [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], manipulates Stark emotionally into a serious relapse. As a result, Stark loses control of Stark International to Stane, becomes a homeless alcohol-abusing vagrant and gives up his armored identity to Rhodes, who becomes the new Iron Man for a lengthy period of time. Eventually, Stark recovers and joins a new startup, Circuits Maximus. Stark concentrates on new technological designs, including building a new set of armor as part of his recuperative therapy. Rhodes continues to act as Iron Man but steadily grows more aggressive and paranoid, due to the armor not having been calibrated properly for his use. Eventually Rhodes goes on a rampage, and Stark has to don a replica of his original armor to stop him. Fully recovered, Stark confronts Stane who has himself designed a version of armor based on designs seized along with Stark International, dubbing himself the 'Iron Monger'. Defeated in battle, Stane, rather than give Stark the satisfaction of taking him to trial, commits suicide.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]|penciller= [[M. D.

===Late 1980s and 1990s===
In an attempt to stop other people from misusing his designs, Stark goes about [[Armor Wars|disabling other armored heroes and villains]] who are using suits based on the Iron Man technology, the designs of which were stolen by his enemy [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]]. His quest to destroy all instances of the stolen technology severely hurts his reputation as Iron Man. After attacking and disabling a series of minor villains such as [[Stilt-Man]], he attacks and defeats the government operative known as [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]]. The situation worsens when Stark realizes that Stingray's armor does not incorporate any of his designs. He publicly "fires" Iron Man while covertly pursuing his agenda. He uses the cover story of wanting to help disable the rogue Iron Man to infiltrate and disable the armor of the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives known as the [[Mandroid]]s, and disabling the armor of the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], in the process allowing some of the villains that they guard to escape. This leads the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] to declare Iron Man a danger and an outlaw. Iron Man then travels to Russia where he inadvertently causes the death of the Soviet [[Titanium Man#Titanium Man II - The Gremlin|Titanium Man]] during a fight. Returning to the U.S., he faces an enemy commissioned by the government named [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]]. Unable to defeat him head on, Stark fakes Iron Man's demise, intending to retire the suit permanently. When Firepower goes rogue, Stark creates a new suit, claiming that a new person is in the armor.

Stark's health continues to deteriorate, and he discovers the armor's [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] interface is causing irreversible damage to his [[nervous system]]. His condition is aggravated by a failed attempt on his life by Kathy Dare, a mentally unbalanced former lover, which injures his spine, paralyzing him.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David; Layton, Bob|penciller= Kupperberg, Alan|inker= Layton, Bob|story= Master Blaster!|title= Iron Man|issue= 242|date= May 1989}}</ref> Stark has a nerve chip implanted into his spine to regain his mobility.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David|penciller= Layton, Bob|inker= Layton, Bob|story= Footsteps|title= Iron Man|issue= 248|date= November 1989}}</ref> Still, Stark's nervous system continues its slide towards failure, and he constructs a "skin" made up of artificial nerve circuitry to assist it. Stark begins to pilot a remote-controlled Iron Man armor, but when faced with the Masters of Silence, the [[telepresence]] suit proves inadequate. Stark then designs a more heavily armed version of the suit to wear, the "Variable Threat Response Battle Suit", which becomes known as the [[War Machine|War Machine armor]]. Ultimately, the damage to his nervous system becomes too extensive. Faking his death, Stark places himself in [[suspended animation]] to heal as Rhodes takes over both the running of Stark Enterprises and the mantle of Iron Man, although he utilizes the War Machine armor. Stark ultimately makes a full recovery by using a chip to reprogram himself and resumes the Iron Man identity. When Rhodes learns that Stark has manipulated his friends by faking his own death, he becomes enraged and the two friends part ways, Rhodes continuing as War Machine in a solo career.

The story arc "The Crossing" reveals Iron Man as a traitor among the Avengers' ranks, due to years of manipulation by the time-traveling dictator [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Stark, as a sleeper agent in Kang's thrall, kills Marilla, the nanny of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver's]] daughter Luna, as well as Rita DeMara, the female [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]], then Amanda Chaney, an ally of the Avengers. The ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' limited series later [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]s these events as the work of a disguised [[Immortus]], not Kang, and that the mental control had gone back only a few months.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Busiek|first1= Kurt|authorlink1= Kurt Busiek|last2= Stern|first2= Roger|authorlink2= Roger Stern|last3= Pacheco|first3= Carlos|authorlink3= Carlos Pacheco|title = [[Avengers Forever]]|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|page = 328|isbn = 978-0785137528}}</ref>

Needing help to defeat both Stark and the ostensible Kang, the team travels back in time to recruit a teenaged Anthony Stark from an alternate timeline to assist them. The young Stark steals an Iron Man suit in order to aid the Avengers against his older self. The sight of his younger self shocks the older Stark enough for him to regain momentary control of his actions, and he sacrifices his life to stop Kang. The young Stark later builds his own suit to become the new Iron Man, and, remaining in the present day, gains legal control of "his" company.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

During the battle with the creature called [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], the teenaged Stark dies, along with many other superheroes. [[Franklin Richards]] preserves these "dead" heroes in the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" pocket universe, in which Anthony Stark is once again an adult hero; Franklin recreates the heroes in the pocket universe in the forms he is most familiar with rather than what they are at the present. The reborn adult Stark, upon returning to the normal Marvel Universe, merges with the original Stark, who had died during "The Crossing", but was resurrected by Franklin Richards. This new Anthony Stark possesses the memories of both the original and teenage Anthony Stark, and thus considers himself to be essentially both of them. With the aid of the law firm [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Nelson & Murdock]], he successfully regains his fortune and, with Stark Enterprises having been sold to the Fujikawa Corporation following Stark's death, sets up a new company, Stark Solutions. He returns from the pocket universe with a restored and healthy heart. After the Avengers reform, Stark demands a hearing be convened to look into his actions just prior to the Onslaught incident. Cleared of wrongdoing, he rejoins the Avengers.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

===2000s===
At one point, Stark's armor becomes sentient despite fail-safes to prevent its increasingly sophisticated computer systems from doing so. Initially, Stark welcomes this "living" armor for its improved tactical abilities. The armor begins to grow more aggressive, killing indiscriminately and eventually desiring to replace Stark altogether. In the final confrontation on a desert island, Stark suffers another heart attack. The armor sacrifices its own existence to save its creator's life, giving up essential components to give Stark a new, artificial heart. This new heart solves Stark's health problems, but it does not have an internal power supply, so Stark becomes once again dependent on periodic recharging. The sentient armor incident so disturbs Stark that he temporarily returns to using an unsophisticated early model version of his armor to avoid a repeat incident. He dabbles with using liquid metal circuitry known as S.K.I.N. that forms into a protective shell around his body, but eventually returns to more conventional hard metal armors.{{issue|date=September 2013}}

During this time, Stark engages in a romance with [[Rumiko Fujikawa]] (first appearance in ''Iron Man'' (vol. 3) #4), a wealthy heiress and daughter of the man who had taken over his company during the "Heroes Reborn" period. Her relationship with Stark endures many highs and lows, including an infidelity with Stark's rival, Tiberius Stone, in part because the fun-loving Rumiko believes that Stark is too serious and dull. Their relationship ends with Rumiko's death at the hands of an Iron Man impostor in ''Iron Man'' (vol. 3) #87.

In ''Iron Man'' (vol. 3) #55 (July 2002), Stark publicly reveals his dual identity as Iron Man, not realizing that by doing so, he has invalidated the agreements protecting his armor from government duplication, since those contracts state that the Iron Man armor would be used by an ''employee'' of Tony Stark, not by Stark himself. When he discovers that the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] is again using his technology, and its defective nature nearly causes a disaster to Washington, D.C. which Iron Man barely manages to avert, Stark accepts a [[President of the United States|Presidential]] appointment as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].

''[[Illuminati (comics)|New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' #1 (June 2006) reveals that years before, Stark had started participating with a group of leaders including the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Professor X]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Doctor Strange]], and [[Namor]]. The goal of the group (dubbed the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] by Marvel) was to strategize overarching menaces, in which the Black Panther rejects a membership offer. Stark's goal is to create a governing body for all superheroes in the world, but the beliefs of its members instead force them all to share vital information.

===="Civil War"====
In the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, after the actions of inexperienced superheroes [[The New Warriors]] result in the destruction of several city blocks, including the elementary school, in Stamford, Connecticut, there is an outcry across America against super-humans. Learning of the Government's proposed plans, Tony Stark suggests a new plan to instigate a [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. The Act would force every super-powered individual in the U.S. to register their identity with the government and act as licensed agents. The Act would force inexperienced super-humans to receive training in how to use and control their abilities, something in which Tony strongly believes. Since his struggle with alcoholism, Stark has carried a tremendous burden of guilt after nearly killing an innocent bystander while piloting the armor drunk. Reed Richards of the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Hank Pym|Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym]] both agree with Stark's proposal; unfortunately, not everyone does. After [[Captain America]] is ordered to bring in anyone who refuses to register, he and other anti-registration superheroes go rogue, coming into conflict with the pro-registration heroes, led by Iron Man. The war ends when Captain America surrenders to prevent further collateral damage and civilian casualties, although he had defeated Stark by defusing his armor. Stark is appointed the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Daniel Knauf|Knauf, Daniel]]; Knauf, Charles|penciller= De La Torre, Roberto|inker= Sibal, Jonathan|story= |title= [[Iron Man (vol. 4)|Iron Man]]|volume= 4|issue= 15|date= April 2007}}</ref> and organizes a new government-sanctioned group of [[The Mighty Avengers|Avengers]].

===="Secret Invasion"====
To tie into the 2008 ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' feature film, Marvel launched a new ''Iron Man'' ongoing series, ''The Invincible Iron Man'', with writer [[Matt Fraction]] and artist [[Salvador Larocca]].

Becoming keenly aware of the upcoming invasion of the Skrulls, Tony gathers the Illuminati and reveals the corpse to them, declaring that they are at war. After [[Black Bolt]] reveals himself as a Skrull and is killed by [[Namor]], a squadron of Skrulls attack, forcing Tony to evacuate the other Illuminati members and destroy the area, killing all the Skrulls. Realizing that they are incapable of trusting each other, the members all separate to form individual plans for the oncoming invasion.<ref>{{cite comic|title=New Avengers: Illuminati|writer=Bendis, Brian Michael and Reed, Brian|artist=Cheung, Jim|date=January 2008|publisher=Marvel Comics|issue=5}}</ref>

Stark is discredited and publicly vilified after his inability to anticipate or prevent a [[Secret Invasion|secret infiltration and invasion]] of Earth by the shape-shifting alien [[Skrull]] race, and by the Skrull disabling of his StarkTech technology, which had a virtual monopoly on worldwide defense.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Leinil Francis Yu|Yu, Leinil Francis]]|inker= Morales, Mark|title= [[Secret Invasion]]|issue= 1|date= June 2008}}</ref> After the invasion, the U.S. government removes him as head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and disbands the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], handing control of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] over to [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].

With his Extremis powers failing, Stark uploads a virus to destroy all records of the Registration Act, thus preventing Osborn from learning the identities of his fellow heroes and anything that Osborn could possibly exploit, including repulsor generators.

When Osborn personally catches up to the debilitated Stark and beats him savagely, [[Pepper Potts]] broadcasts the beatings worldwide, costing Osborn credibility and giving Stark public sympathy.

Meanwhile, in Stark's subconscious, he is trapped in a scenario where figments of his own mind are preventing him from moving on and returning to the waking world. When the procedure fails to work, Bucky calls in Doctor Strange, who attempts to and succeeds in restoring Stark back to consciousness. It turns out the backup Stark created was made prior to the Civil War, and as such he does not remember anything that took place during the event, although he still concludes after reviewing his past actions that he would not have done anything differently. His brain damage means that he is now dependent on an arc reactor to sustain his body's autonomous functions such as breathing, blinking and a heartbeat due to the brain damage he sustained.<ref>{{cite book|last = Matt|first = Fraction|author2=Larroca, Salvador|title = The Invincible Iron Man, Vol. 4: Stark Disassembled|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|page = 136|isbn =  978-0785136866}}</ref>

Helicarrier 'as a bullet', subduing the Void. When Robert Reynolds begs to be killed, Thor denies the request, but is forced to when the Void resurfaces. Sometime later, the Super-Human Registration Act is repealed and Tony is given back his company and armory.

====Marvel NOW! 2016====
In July 2016, it was announced that Tony Stark would hand off the mantle of Iron Man to a 15-year-old African American girl named [[Riri Williams]]. Riri has thus far been described as an MIT student who built her own Iron Man suit out of scrap pieces and, as such, attracted Stark's attention. Early depictions of Williams' suit depict it without the Arc Reactor which is unnecessary to keep Williams alive, but leaves the power source for the suit unclear.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/06/marvel-introduces-black-female-iron-man-riri-williams|title= Marvel introduces a black, female Iron Man|first= Devan|last=Coggan|date= July 6, 2016|work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160707152518/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/06/marvel-introduces-black-female-iron-man-riri-williams|archivedate= July 7, 2016|deadurl= no|quote= }}</ref> Another Iron Man-based series titled ''[[Infamous Iron Man]]'' will debut featuring Doctor Doom sporting his version of the Iron Man armor.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/doctor-doom-becomes-the-infamous-iron-man/1100-6443826/|title= Doctor Doom Becomes the 'Infamous Iron Man'|first= Tony|last= Guerrero|date= September 22, 2016|publisher= GameSpot|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161105054551/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/doctor-doom-becomes-the-infamous-iron-man/1100-6443826/|archivedate= November 5, 2016|deadurl= no|quote= The villain formerly known as Doctor Doom is also trading in his traditional metal armor and green cloak for something closer to Stark's look in a new comic called ''Infamous Iron Man''.}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

===Armor===
{{See also|Iron Man's armor}}
[[File:IronManV5No25.jpg|thumb|The Bleeding Edge Armor, like the Extremis Armor before it, is stored in Stark's bones, and can be assembled and controlled by his thoughts]]
Iron Man possesses [[powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions). Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark's long-time partner and best friend [[War Machine|James Rhodes]];<ref name="DeFalco211" /> close associates [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Harold "Happy" Hogan]]; Eddie March;<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 144: "Boxer Eddie March was the first African-American to wear Iron Man's armor."</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Goodwin, Archie|penciller= Tuska, George|inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]]|story= The Replacement!|title= Iron Man|issue= 21|date= January 1970}}</ref> and (briefly) [[Guardsman (Michael O'Brien)|Michael O'Brien]].

The weapons systems of the suit have changed over the years, but Iron Man's standard offensive weapons have always been the repulsor rays that are fired from the palms of his [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]]s. Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include: the uni-beam projector in its chest; pulse bolts (that pick up [[kinetic energy]] along the way; so the farther they travel, the harder they hit); an [[electromagnetic pulse]] generator; and a defensive energy shield that can be extended up to 360 degrees. Other capabilities include: generating ultra-[[freon]] (i.e., a freeze-beam); creating and manipulating [[magnetic field]]s; emitting sonic blasts; and projecting 3-dimensional [[hologram]]s (to create decoys).

In addition to the general-purpose model he wears, Stark has developed several specialized [[space suit|suits]] for [[spaceflight|space travel]],<ref name="IronMan142" /> [[atmospheric diving suit|deep-sea diving]], [[stealth technology|stealth]],<ref name="DeFalco202" /><ref name="IronMan152" /> and other special purposes. Stark has modified suits, like the Hulkbuster heavy armor. The Hulkbuster armor is composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability enough to engage the Incredible [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in a fight. A later model, designed for use against [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], is modeled on the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and uses a mystical power source. Stark develops an electronics pack during the Armor Wars that, when attached to armors that use Stark technologies, will burn out those components, rendering the suit useless. This pack is ineffective on later models. While it is typically associated with [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], the War-Machine armor began as one of Stark's specialty armors.

The most recent models of Stark's armor, beginning with the Extremis Armor, are now stored in the hollow portions of Stark's bones, and the personal area networking implement used to control it is implanted in his forearm, and connected  directly to his [[central nervous system]].

The Extremis has since been removed,{{issue|date=April 2014}} and he now uses more conventional armors. Some armors still take a liquid form, but are not stored within his body. His Endo-Sym Armor incorporates a combination of the liquid smart-metal with the alien Venom symbiote, psionically controlled by Stark.

Post-Secret Wars, Stark uses a more streamlined suit of armor that can practically 'morph' into other armors or weapons.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

===Powers===
After being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous system with modified techno-organic virus-like body restructuring machines (the Extremis process).<ref>{{cite book|last = Ellis|first = Warren|authorlink = Warren Ellis|author2=Granov, Adi |authorlink2=Adi Granov |title = Iron Man: Extremis|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2013|page = 160|isbn = 978-0785183785}}</ref> By rewriting his own biology, Stark is able to save his life, gain an enhanced [[healing factor]], and partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the need for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor of lighter designs, technopathically controlled by his own brain. His enhanced technopathy extends to every piece of technology, limitless and effortlessly due to his ability to interface with communication satellites and wireless connections to increase his "range". Some components of the armor-sheath are now stored in Tony's body, able to be recalled, and extruded from his own skin, at will.

During the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline the Extremis package is catastrophically shut down by a virus, forcing him again to rely on the previous iteration of his armor, and restoring his previous limitations. Furthermore, Osborn's takeover of most of the few remaining Starktech factories, with Ezekiel Stane systematically crippling the others, limits Tony to the use of lesser, older and weaker armors.<ref>{{cite book|last = Bendis|first = Brian Michael|author2=Yu, Leinil Francis|title = Secret Invasion|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2010|page = 288|isbn = 978-0785149170}}</ref>

After being forced to "wipe out" his brain to prevent Norman Osborn from gaining his information, Tony Stark is forced to have a new arc reactor, of [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand]] design installed in his chest. The process greatly improves his strength, stamina and intellect. The procedure left him with virtually no autonomic functions: as his brain was stripped of every biological function, Tony is forced to rely on a digital backup of his memories (leaving him with severe gaps and lapses in his long-term memory) and on software routine in the arc reactor for basic stimuli reaction, such as blinking and breathing.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fraction|first = Matt|author2=Larroca, Salvador|title = Invincible Iron Man, Vol. 2: World's Most Wanted, Book 1|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2009|page = 152|isbn = 978-0785134138}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Fraction|first = Matt|author2=Larroca, Salvador|title = Invincible Iron Man, Vol. 3: World's Most Wanted, Book 2|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2010|page = 160|isbn = 978-0785136859}}</ref> The ''Bleeding Edge'' package of armor and physical enhancement is now equal in power, if not a more advanced, version of the old Extremis tech.<ref name="Fraction, Matt 2010"/>

===Skills===
Tony Stark is an inventive genius whose expertise in the fields of [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[computer science]] rivals that of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], [[Hank Pym]], and [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]], and his expertise in [[electrical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]] surpasses even theirs. He is regarded as one of the most intelligent characters in the Marvel Universe. He graduated with advanced degrees in physics and engineering at the age of 17 from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT)<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Sanderson, Peter|penciller= Candelario, Harry|inker= Cheung, Jim|title= Iron Man: The Legend|issue= 1|date= September 1996}}</ref> and further developed his knowledge ranging from [[artificial intelligence]] to [[quantum mechanics]] as time progressed. His expertise extends to his ingenuity in dealing with difficult situations, such as difficult foes and deathtraps, in which he is capable of using available tools, including his suit, in unorthodox but effective ways. He is well respected in the business world, able to command people's attention when he speaks on economic matters, having over the years built up several multimillion-dollar companies from virtually nothing. He is  noted for the loyalty he commands from and returns to those who work for him, as well as for his business ethics. Thus he immediately fired an employee who made profitable, but illegal, sales to [[Doctor Doom]].<ref name="IronMan149" /> He strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses.

At a time when Stark was unable to use his armor for a period, he received some combat training from [[Captain America]] and has become physically formidable on his own when the situation demands it.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael; [[Brian Reed|Reed, Brian]]|penciller= Cheung, Jim|inker= Morales, Mark|story= The war with the Kree is over|title= New Avengers: Illuminati|volume= 2|issue= 1|date= February 2007}}</ref> In addition, Stark possesses great business and political acumen. On multiple occasions he reacquired control of his companies after losing them amid corporate takeovers.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Danny Fingeroth|Fingeroth, Danny]]|penciller= Bright, M. D.|inker= de la Rosa, Sam|story= Happy's Story|title= Iron Man|issue= 210|date= September 1986}}</ref>

Due to his membership in the Illuminati, Iron Man was given the Space [[Infinity Gem]] to safeguard.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael; Reed, Brian|penciller= Cheung, Jim|inker= Morales, Mark|story= This...is an Infinity Gem|title= New Avengers: Illuminati|volume= 2|issue= 2|date= March 2007}}</ref>  It allows the user to exist in any location (or all locations), move any object anywhere throughout the universe and warp or rearrange space.
