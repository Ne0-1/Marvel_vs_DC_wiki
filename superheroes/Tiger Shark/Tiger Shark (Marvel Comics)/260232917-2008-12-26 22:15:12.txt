'''Tiger Shark''' ('''Todd Arliss''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #5 (Sept. 1968) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gene Colan]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Todd Arliss''' was an Olympic swimmer who damaged his spinal cord while rescuing a drowning man. Desperate to regain his swimming ability, Arliss willingly participates in an experiment by the scientist [[Lemuel Dorcas|Doctor Dorcas]], who "cures" him by blending his [[DNA]] with that of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and a [[tiger shark]]. Although successful, the process changed Arliss both physically and mentally: he now had razor-sharp teeth and gills and had become savage and predatory.<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #5 (Sept. 1968)</ref>

Becoming a supervillain and calling himself Tiger Shark, he finds and threatens the [[Lady Dorma]] and is then crowned Lord of Atlantis. The Sub-Mariner, however, soon deposes Tiger Shark and the two become implacable foes.<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #6 (Oct. 1968)</ref> Tiger Shark returns to fight Namor time and again, often with allies such as [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]],<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #24 (Apr. 1970)</ref> [[Llyra]]<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #44 - 46 (Dec. 1971 - Feb. 1972)</ref> and [[Attuma]],<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #1 - 3</ref> although the battles come at great cost: Tiger Shark is buried for months,<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #24 (Apr. 1970)</ref> Namor's father Leonard McKenzie is killed <ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #44 - 46 (Dec. 1971 - Feb. 1972)</ref> and Dr. Dorcas is crushed to death.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #1 - 3 (Aug; Oct & Dec. 1975)</ref>

Tiger Shark goes to fight other superheroes such as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Hulk'' #160 (Feb. 1973)</ref> [[Ms. Marvel]],<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #15 - 16 (Mar. - Apr. 1978)</ref> [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Wolverine'' #19 - 20 (Dec. 1989 - Jan 1990)</ref> and later as a member of the [[Masters of Evil]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]<ref>''Avengers'' #222 (Aug. 1982); 228 - 229 (Feb. - Mar. 1983); 273 - 275 (Nov. 1986 - Jan. 1987) + ''West Coast Avengers'' #16 (Jan. 1987)</ref> and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #18 - 20 (Sept - Nov. 1998); 23 - 25 (Feb. - April 1999)</ref> For a time Tiger Shark renounces crime, and renaming himself '''Arlys Tigershark''' marries a woman from an undersea tribe of nomads. Tiger Shark, however, reverts back to his old ways when his pregnant wife and her tribe are slaughtered by savage undersea creatures called the Faceless Ones. <ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' vol. 3, #34 (Jan. 1993)</ref>

Tiger Shark has also mutated into a more shark-like being (complete with grey skin and a natural fin as opposed to a costume ornament)<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #3 (Feb. 2005)</ref> and then inexplicably back into human form. Tiger Shark's next appearance involves the theft of an artifact called the "Horn of Gabriel", which he uses to summon huge sea monsters and then direct them against the surface world. Tiger Shark, however, is defeated by the Sub-Mariner and the [[Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #1 - 4 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2004)</ref> When [[Alyosha Kravinoff|Al Kraven]], the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]], began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Tiger Shark is seen as one of his captives in a water tank.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #13 (Jan. 2008)</ref> Tiger Shark is later hired by the crimelord the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

He gathered a group of villains together and tried to extort money from the new Thunderbolts director [[Norman Osborn]], but was viciously beaten by Osborn and is now forced to secretly work for him.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason in Madness'' (May 2008)</ref>

During the 2008 ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the heroine [[Ms. Marvel]] later saves Tiger Shark from being killed by an alien [[Super-Skrull#Other Super-Skrulls|Super Skrull]] in the prison the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]].<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #30 (Sept. 2008)</ref> 

==Powers and abilities==
Before gaining his powers, Todd Arliss was a record-breaking Olympic swimmer but otherwise an ordinary human. After Dr. Dorcas' experiment, he becomes an amphibious humanoid with the traits of a human, an Atlantean (''[[Homo mermanus]]''), and a [[tiger shark]]. As Tiger Shark, he possesses the same superhuman strength and durability as Namor, although he weakens if not submerged in water. Tiger Shark also possesses an innate hunting instinct inherited from his shark genes, as once he locks onto prey he cannot stop tracking it until it has been captured or he has been forcibly repulsed.
