'''Tiger Shark''' (real name Todd Arliss) is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillian]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a recurring foe of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].

Real name Todd Arliss, he was originally a championship American swimmer who was severely injured when he rescued a man who fell overboard. Desperate to regain his swimming ability, he approached a mad scientist, Doctor Dorcas, who 'cured' him by blending his DNA with that of an Atlantean and a [[shark]]. The process altered his personality, making him savage, cruel, greedy and predatorial. He subsequently struck out as a villian.

He has committed numerous crimes, including murdering Namor's father Thakorr. He renounced this life of crime for a time, marrying into a tribe of undersea nomads, but returned to his criminal ways after the tribe, including his pregnant wife, were slaughtered by savage undersea creatures called the Faceless Ones.

Tiger Shark has recently mutated, bringing his shark genes to the front: he is now a humanoid shark, with fanged jaws, scaly grey skin and fins.

Tiger Shark wears a tightly-fitting bodysuit with a large fin that runs from the top of his head down his spine. The costume has jagged spines running between the wrist and the elbow as well as all the way down its legs. It has a jagged-edged patch of grey that runs down its center, as well as grey boots and gauntlets. The rest of it is a dull orange, though initially it was red. After his mutation, Tiger Shark replaced this with a yellow, maskless bodysuit with black bands on the neck, arms and legs.

Tiger Shark has the amphibious nature and all of the physical capacities of an Atlantean. He also heals extremely quickly and has highly accute senses. He also possesses a hunting instinct inherited from his shark genes; once Tiger Shark locks onto prey, he cannot stop tracking it until he has captured it or been forcibly repulsed. Since his mutation, Tiger Shark has gained the ability to deliver powerful bites.
