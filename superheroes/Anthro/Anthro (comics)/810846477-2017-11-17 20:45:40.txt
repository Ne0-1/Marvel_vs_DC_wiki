'''Anthro''' is a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]], presented as the "first boy", a [[Cro-Magnon]] born to [[Neanderthal]] parents. Anthro was created by cartoonist [[Howard Post]]; he first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #74, (Mar 1968).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link =   | contribution = Anthro | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 17  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

==Publication history==
After a single ''Showcase'' appearance, Anthro was given his own title, which lasted for 6 issues (1968–69).  All six issues were written and drawn by Post, with [[Wallace Wood]] providing inking for the final issue.

Since the cancellation of his title, he has made minor appearances, most notably in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #2.  Subsequently, Anthro appeared in the 2006 revival of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' and the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[J. G. Jones]]. Anthro also starred in the first story in ''DC Universe Holiday Special 2010''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Anthro''' is the first [[Cro-Magnon]] boy born in the [[Stone Age]]. His father, [[Neanderthal]] [[caveman]] Ne-Ahn is the chief of his tribe, his mother a captive member of another tribe. Winning two competing cavegirls as his wives, Cro-Magnon women '''Embra''' and '''Nima''', Anthro begins the [[human]] race, as Embra lives to bear his first child.

''Justice League Europe Annual'' #2 features a version of Anthro. In an alternate time-line, an older [[Silver Sorceress]], lost in time, is rescued from a large creature by Anthro. He exhibits great eagerness, smashing the beast long after it is subdued. A bored cavegirl, seemingly either Embra or Nima, joins the Sorceress in watching Anthro's 'battle'.

Anthro is featured in the graphic novel "[[Doctor Thirteen]]: Architecture & Mortality". Speaking only French, he is soon melted out of a chunk of ice into what seems to be the modern day. He assists the Doctor, [[Infectious Lass]], [[Genius Jones]], Captain Fear and other somewhat heroic characters in a mission to keep their existence relevant. The story ends with his status seemingly threatened by the reader of the novel itself.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===''Final Crisis''===
{{main|Final Crisis}}
Issue one of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' features an extended introduction involving Anthro, where the [[New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] appears before the boy and gives him the knowledge and skill to make fire.  This starts a sequence in which Anthro is able to fight off a group of savage raiders (led by [[Vandal Savage]].<ref>''Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne'' #1-2 (May–June 2010)</ref>) with a burning stick.  In the closing pages, Anthro seems to have a vision of Kamandi.  In this depiction, Anthro is much more caveman like in his attire, wearing only a loincloth and a satchel, and carrying stone and wood weapons, while his body looks more like a modern teenager rather than having a Cro-Magnon appearance.  In this issue, he only expresses himself with [[!]] and [[?]] signs, as he is apparently unable to speak, as are the rest of the cavemen characters in the book.

In the final issue of ''Final Crisis'', Anthro appears as an old man, drawing the symbols he saw on Metron's body onto a cave wall. As he finishes drawing he dies peacefully, watched over by [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], who is lost in time.<ref>"Final Crisis" #7 (2009)</ref> The after-effects of Anthro's death on his friends and family is explored in the limited series ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]''.

==Alternate versions==
Anthro had a supporting role in the ''[[Booster Gold]]'' series, starting with issue eight. In this story, as in ''Tales of the Unexpected'', Anthro wears a leather jacket that resembles [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]'s, but has Anthro's name on the sleeves instead of "Fair Play." This is an alternate time-line Anthro, who is part of a resistance group against the murderous Maxwell Lord. Fellow members include Green Arrow, Hawkman, Wild Dog and Pantha. During the flight to Lord's headquarters, Anthro is taken out by a mind-controlled Superman.<ref>Booster Gold vol. 2, #7-9 (2008)</ref>

In ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #1, Superman moves briefly through Earth-20, where alternate versions of a number of DC Comics older heroes exist as 'The Society of Super-Heroes', a group of 'pulp'-style mystery men led by Doc Fate and including Immortal Man.<ref>''Final Crisis Secret Files #1 (2009)</ref> Writer Grant Morrison described it as a '' '1940s retro thing'. ''<ref>Interview with Grant Morrison - {{cite web|url=http://www.weeklycrisis.com/2009/05/grant-morrisons-multiversity-more.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006132117/http://www.weeklycrisis.com/2009/05/grant-morrisons-multiversity-more.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 }}</ref> In ''The Multiversity - The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors from the Counter-World'' #1 (2014), it is revealed that Immortal Man of Earth-20 is Anthro, who was exposed to the same meteorite that bestowed Vandal Savage's powers on him. He and Doc Fate's Society of Super-Heroes are Earth-20's last defence from an invasion by their paired evil world, Earth-40, where the militia is led by Vandal Savage and [[Lady Shiva]].
