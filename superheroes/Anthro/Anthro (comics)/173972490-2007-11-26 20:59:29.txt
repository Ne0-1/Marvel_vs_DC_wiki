'''Anthro''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Anthro was created by cartoonist [[Howard Post]]; his first appearance was in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #74 (May 1968)

==Publication history==
After a single ''Showcase'' appearance, Anthro was given his own title, which lasted for 6 issues (1968-69).  All six issues were written and drawn by Post, with [[Wallace Wood]] providing inking for the final issue.

Since the cancellation of his title, he has made minor appearances, most notably in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #2.  Recently, Anthro appeared in the 2006 revival of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]''. He is also slated to appear in the upcoming 7 issue miniseries ''[[Final Crisis]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[J.G. Jones]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Anthro''' is the first [[Cro-Magnon]] boy born in the [[Stone Age]]. His father, [[Neanderthal]] [[caveman]] Nee-Ahn is the chief of his tribe, his mother a captive member of another tribe. Winning two competing cavegirls as his wives, Cro-Magnon women '''Embra''' and '''Nima''', Anthro begins the [[human]] race, as Embra lives to bear his first child.

''Justice League Europe Annual'' #2 features a version of Anthro. In an alternate time-line, an older [[Silver Sorceress]], lost in time, is rescued from a large creature by Anthro. He exhibits great eagerness, smashing the beast long after it is subdued. A bored cavegirl, seemingly either Embra or Nima, joins the Sorceress in watching Anthro's 'battle'.

Comments by Grant Morrison at 2007's [[Comic-Con International|San Diego Comicon]] indicate that Anthro (the First Boy) will appear on the first page of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', mirroring the appearance of [[Kamandi]] (the Last Boy) on the last page.
