==Publication history==
After a single ''Showcase'' appearance, Anthro was given his own title, which lasted for 6 issues (1968-69).  All six issues were written and drawn by Post, with [[Wallace Wood]] providing inking for the final issue.

Since the cancellation of his title, he has made minor appearances, most notably in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #2.  Recently, Anthro appeared in the 2006 revival of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' and the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[J.G. Jones]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Anthro''' is the first [[Cro-Magnon]] boy born in the [[Stone Age]]. His father, [[Neanderthal]] [[caveman]] Ne-Ahn is the chief of his tribe, his mother a captive member of another tribe. Winning two competing cavegirls as his wives, Cro-Magnon women '''Embra''' and '''Nima''', Anthro begins the [[human]] race, as Embra lives to bear his first child.

''Justice League Europe Annual'' #2 features a version of Anthro. In an alternate time-line, an older [[Silver Sorceress]], lost in time, is rescued from a large creature by Anthro. He exhibits great eagerness, smashing the beast long after it is subdued. A bored cavegirl, seemingly either Embra or Nima, joins the Sorceress in watching Anthro's 'battle'.

Anthro is featured in the graphic novel "[[Doctor Thirteen]]: Architecture & Mortality". Speaking only French, he is soon melted out of an chunk of ice into what seems to be the modern day. He assists the Doctor, [[Infectious Lass]], [[Genius Jones]], Captain Fear and other somewhat heroic characters in a mission to keep their existence relevant. The story ends with his status seemingly threatened by the reader of the novel itself.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===''Final Crisis''===
{{main|Final Crisis}}
Comments by Grant Morrison at 2007's [[Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] indicate that Anthro (the First Boy) will appear on the first page of ''Final Crisis'', mirroring the appearance of [[Kamandi]] (the Last Boy) on the last page.

In preparation for his role in ''Final Crisis'', Anthro had a supporting role in the ''[[Booster Gold]]'' series, starting with issue eight.  This story takes place in an alternate time line, so it is unknown how it will relate to the [[shared universe]] of DC comics.  In this story, as in ''Tales of the Unexpected'', Anthro wears a leather jacket that resembles [[Mr. Terrific]]'s, but has Anthro's name on the sleeves instead of "Fair Play."

Issue one of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' features an extended introduction involving Anthro, where the [[New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] appears before the boy and gives him the knowledge and skill to make fire.  This starts a sequence in which Anthro is able to fight off a group of savage raiders with a burning stick.  In the closing pages, Anthro seems to have a vision of [[Kamandi]].  In this depiction, Anthro is much more caveman like in his attire, wearing only a loincloth and a satchel, and carrying stone and wood weapons, while his body looks more like a modern teenager rather than having a Cro-Magnon appearance.  In this issue, he only expresses himself with [[!]] and [[?]] signs, as he is apparently unable to speak, as are the rest of the cavemen characters in the book.

In the final issue of Final Crisis, Anthro appears as an old man, drawing the symbols covering Metron's body on a cave wall. As he finishes drawing he dies peacefully, watched over by [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], who is lost in time.
