==History==
===Origins===
Strange is an [[archeologist]] suddenly [[teleport]]ed from Earth to [[planets in science fiction|fictional planet]] [[Rann]] through the "[[Rann#Rann Technology|Zeta Beam]]." Called on to protect the planet from [[Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture|extraterrestrial]] threats using high-tech weaponry, Strange grew to care for the planet and its inhabitants, especially the blue-haired Alanna. Independently wealthy, he traveled Earth, intercepting the regular patterns of the Zeta Beam to defend Rann and be with Alanna.

Strangeâ€™s adventures were published in a several [[anthology]] series in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s|60s]] and, although never a headlining character, he has had a consistent presence in the [[DC universe]].

===Background===
Created by [[Gardner Fox]], Adam Strange is reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[John Carter of Mars]] series. Both characters have origins in which they are being chased by threatening aboriginal peoples only to find themselves mysteriously transported at the last moment to distant planets where they become heroic figures. In Carter's case this was to Mars, while Adam Strange was transported to Rann. The John Carter stories depicted a rawer sort of adventure that included swordplay, physical action, nudity, and bloodletting. These are absent from the Adam Strange stories, however both characters shared a longing to travel to a strange world with alien opponents to fight and to be united with a beloved woman who resided there.

Like most other (non-[[EC Comics|EC]]) comic book science fiction stories of the 1950s, the problems and their stories were contrived, the solutions often based on haphazard application of simple scientific principles. After the initial run in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'', they moved to ''[[Mystery in Space]]'' (#53-100, 102), drawn by [[Carmine Infantino]] and inked by [[Murphy Anderson]].  He later appeared in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' (reprints in #217 thru 244; new stories in #222, 226/227 text stories with illos).

===Costume===
His costume was a red [[jumpsuit]] with a crested helmet, worn with a white [[rocket pack]] that was fastened on by white cross-straps. Alanna wore one too, and the standard means of transport they used on Rann was to fly to scenes of danger together.

===Beginnings===
One spectacular, even award-winning, story, however, resulted from a continuity gaffe in the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book, in which the [[Barry Allen|Flash]] mentioned him as a possible new member for the [[Justice League]]. That group and he had not met, and when a letter to the editor reported this, [[Gardner Fox]] wrote a story showing how the JLA came to Rann and how Adam Strange got them out of the traps that [[Kanjar Ro]] set for them there.

For years, the character was a regular presence in the [[DC Universe]].  By the 1980s, the acclaimed [[author]] [[Alan Moore]] provided a more cynical reason for his visits to Rann.  Apparently, the population of the planet -- the majority of whom viewed the Terran with contempt -- is sterile, and the real reason for Adam's presence is to be a breeding [[Stud (animal)|stud]]. This new situation was further illustrated in a 1990 [[limited series]] where Adam learned of the population's opinion of him and Alanna died giving birth to their daughter Aleea.  In ''JLA'' #20  (July 1998), Alanna was revealed to be alive, and at the end of the story, she was reunited with her husband and daughter, albeit briefly as Adam was transported back to Earth soon after Alanna's arrival.

===''Planet Heist''===

A 2004 eight-issue [[limited series]], written by [[Andy Diggle]], pencilled by [[Pasqual Ferry]] and colored by [[Dave McCaig]], updated Adam Strange's appearance and abilities by giving him a new costume, a spacesuit that allows for interstellar travel.  In the series, Adam was prepared to relocate to Rann permanently when he was informed that the planet was destroyed and that he was blamed for its destruction.  In fact, Sardath transported Rann to another dimension to save the planet from the cosmic being, [[Starbreaker]], intent on destroying the planet.  Adam, with the help of the [[Omega Men]] and the [[Darkstars]], among others, saved Rann and defeated the evil being.

===''Rann-Thanagar War''===
{{main|Rann-Thanagar War}}

However, the planet [[Thanagar]] was destroyed in the process.  Many Thanagarians were relocated to Rann, but enmity between the two races has resulted in a war, which is depicted in ''The [[Rann-Thanagar War]]'', a six-issue precursor to DC's 2005-2006 limited series and DC crossover event, ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

{{update}}
{{main|52 (comics)}}
Adam is featured as one of the main characters in DC's weekly event ''[[52 (comics)|52]].''

He is stranded on a paradise-like planet with [[Animal Man]] and [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]]. As a result of a teleportation accident involving the zeta beam, he has lost both of his [[eyeballs]] but in spite of his injuries he is trying to fix a damaged spaceship so that they may return home. After being attacked by [[Devilance|Devilance the Pursuer]], they eventually escape having realized that the entire planet is a trap. Encountered by Devilance again, they're saved by the intervention of [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]].
The story is ongoing.
