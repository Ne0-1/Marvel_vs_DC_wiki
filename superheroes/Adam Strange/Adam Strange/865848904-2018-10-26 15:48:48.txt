'''Adam Strange''' is a [[science fiction]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by editor [[Julius Schwartz]] with a costume designed by [[Murphy Anderson]], he first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #17 (November 1958).

==Publication history==
In 1957, [[DC Comics]] editorial director [[Irwin Donenfeld]] held a meeting with editors [[Jack Schiff]] and [[Julius Schwartz]] in his office, asking them each to create a new science fiction hero: one from the present, and one from the future. Given first pick, Schiff chose to create one from the future ([[Space Ranger]]). However, Schwartz was unhappy with the pick, feeling that readers would more readily identify with a hero from the present. He conceived the idea of an Earth man repeatedly traveling to a planet in the [[Alpha Centauri]] star system using a fictional Zeta-beam altered by space radiation, and named his character Adam after [[Adam|the first man on Earth]] according to the [[Abrahamic faith]]s, since Adam Strange was the first Earthman on another planet.<ref name="Archive1">Amash, Jim (2003). "Foreword" in ''The Adam Strange Archives: Volume 1''. Pages 5–8.</ref>

Adam Strange debuted in issues #17–19 of the tryout series ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'', published November 1958&nbsp;– March 1959. The first artwork of the character was a cover for ''Showcase'' #17 by [[Murphy Anderson]]; though Schwartz rejected the drawing and commissioned a new one by [[Gil Kane]], Anderson's costume design was retained.<ref name="Archive1"/> Schwartz then assigned the scribing of the stories to [[Gardner Fox]] and the penciling to [[Mike Sekowsky]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Irvine|first=Alex|authorlink=Alexander C. Irvine|editor-last=Dolan|editor-first=Hannah|chapter= 1950s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 91 |quote = Adam Strange debuted in a three-issue trial starting with ''Showcase'' #17, which was written by Gardner Fox and featured art by Mike Sekowsky.}}</ref> Schwartz and Fox devised the plots for the stories in Schwartz's office, and Fox would write the scripts at home. A science major, Schwartz specialized in giving Fox scientific pointers that gave the Adam Strange tales a plausibility that made them stand out from most science fiction of the time.<ref name="Archive1"/>

Sales on the three-issue ''Showcase'' tryout were enough to justify giving Adam Strange a slot in ''[[Mystery in Space]]'', which ran in issues #53–100 and 102. Though Schwartz and Fox continued their work on the character, Schwartz gave the penciler assignment to [[Carmine Infantino]] instead of Sekowsky. Most issues were inked by [[Murphy Anderson]] (although [[Bernard Sachs (comics)|Bernard Sachs]], [[Joe Giella]] and [[Sid Greene]] did a few issues each). In the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book, the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] mentioned Adam Strange as a possible new member for the [[Justice League]]. When a letter to the editor pointed out the group had not met Adam Strange and could not have heard of him, as all his heroics took place on Rann, Schwartz and Fox wrote a story showing how the Justice League came to Rann and how Adam Strange saved them from [[Kanjar Ro]]. The story was published in ''Mystery in Space'' #75 and won the Alley Award for the "Best Book-Length Story" of 1962.

As of #92, Jack Schiff replaced Schwartz as editor of ''Mystery in Space'' and [[Lee Elias]] became the artist for Adam Strange. Following the discontinuation of the Adam Strange stories, reprints were presented in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #217 through 244 (except for #222, which instead has a new story with Strange, written by [[Denny O'Neil]], while #226 has a new Strange text story, by Fox, with illustrations by Anderson).

Through the 1970s, the character was a regular presence in the [[DC Universe]] despite having no series of his own. In the [[1980s in comics|1980s]], [[Alan Moore]] wrote a [[retcon]] of Adam Strange's reason for his visits to Rann. In this retcon, the population of the planet, the majority of whom view the Terran with contempt, is sterile, and Adam Strange is there to be a breeding [[Stud (animal)|stud]]. In a [[1990 in comics|1990]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''The Man of Two Worlds'', Adam learns of the population's opinion of him and Alanna dies giving birth to their daughter Aleea. In ''JLA'' #20  (July 1998), Alanna is revealed to be alive and is briefly reunited with her husband and daughter before Adam is transported back to Earth.

In 2013, [[Jeff Lemire]] said he intended to introduce a [[The New 52|New 52]] incarnation of Adam Strange at some point in ''Justice League Canada'', a series scheduled to launch in Spring 2014.<ref name="starJLC">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2013/08/23/dc_comics_to_launch_justice_league_canada_in_2014.html|title=DC Comics to launch Justice League Canada in 2014|last=Mudhar|first=Raju|publisher=The Star|date=August 23, 2013|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}</ref> In January 2014 Lemire announced that the series would instead be titled ''[[Justice League United]]'', and that it would feature Alanna as well as Adam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jefflemire.blogspot.com/2014/01/justice-league-canada-becomes-justice.html?spref=tw|title=Justice League Canada becomes Justice League United A New Ongoing Series in April!|last=Lemire|first=Jeff|publisher=Jeff Lemire's Blog|date=January 16, 2014|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Strange is an [[archaeology|archeologist]] suddenly [[Teleportation|teleported]] from Peru, Earth, to the [[planets in science fiction|planet]] [[Rann]] through a "[[Rann (fictional planet)#Rann technology|Zeta-Beam]]". Upon his arrival, he is attacked by one of the planet's predators and rescued by a dark-haired woman called Alanna. She takes him to her father Sardath, who explains that the Zeta-Beam was transmitted to Earth in the hopes that whatever form of intelligent life lived there would trace it back to Rann, and he also theorizes that in the 4.3 years it took the Zeta-Beam to reach Earth, it was altered by space radiation into a transportation beam. Called on to protect the planet from [[Fictional extraterrestrials|extraterrestrial]] threats using Rann's technology, Strange grew to care for the planet and its inhabitants, especially Alanna. Eventually, the effects of the beam's transportation wore off, automatically returning Strange to Earth at the exact point of departure -- but not before Sardath had given him a schedule of beam firings, allowing him to periodically return to the planet. Using mathematical calculations, he was able to determine the exact time and the precise locations at which the Zeta-Beams would arrive. He travels the world and intercepts them, to defend Rann and be with Alanna.<ref>''Showcase'' #17 in ''The Adam Strange Archives: Volume 1''. Pages 9–34.</ref>

===Justice League of America===
In 1997, [[Grant Morrison]] revived the [[Justice League of America]] in the ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' series. During this period, [[Mark Waid]] featured Adam Strange when he filled in for Morrison. Adam Strange kidnapped the entirety of the Justice League and put them to forced labor to reconstruct Rann, as part of a ruse to rescue Alanna and her father. Strange returned to Rann in ''JLA: Heaven's Ladder'' (2000) and presumably reunited with his family shortly after.

===''Planet Heist''===
''Planet Heist'', a [[2004 in comics|2004]] eight-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], written by [[Andy Diggle]], penciled by [[Pasqual Ferry]] and colored by [[Dave McCaig]], replaced Adam Strange's costume with a spacesuit that allows for interstellar travel. Adam was prepared to relocate to Rann permanently when he was informed that the planet was destroyed and that he was blamed for its destruction. In fact, Sardath transported Rann to another dimension to save the planet from the cosmic being [[Starbreaker (comics)|Starbreaker]]. Adam, with the help of the [[Omega Men]] and the [[Darkstars]], among others, saved Rann and defeated the evil being.

===''Rann-Thanagar War''===
{{main|Rann-Thanagar War}}

When Rann was moved, its orbit was believed to have pushed the planet [[Thanagar]] closer to its sun, destroying much of the surface (it was later discovered that the actions of [[Superboy-Prime]] moved Thanagar). Many Thanagarians were relocated to Rann, but enmity between the two races resulted in a war, depicted in ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''. Strange, working with [[Hawkman]], [[Hawkwoman]], [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Kilowog]], tried to end the conflict, a six-issue precursor to DC's [[2005 in comics|2005]] to [[2006 in comics|2006]] limited series and DC crossover event, ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Strange was eventually able to end the war when he discovered evidence of Superboy-Prime's role in Thanagar's relocation.

===''52''===
{{main|52 (comics)}}

Adam was stranded on a paradise-like planet with [[Animal Man]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]. As a result of a teleportation accident involving the Zeta-Beam, he lost both of his [[human eyeball|eyes]] but in spite of his injuries, he tried to fix a damaged spaceship so that the trio might return home.<ref>''52'' Week Seven</ref> After being attacked by [[Devilance|Devilance the Pursuer]], they eventually escaped having realized that the entire planet was a trap.

This ragtag team made a stand against the villainess [[Lady Styx]], whose [[undead]] legions were ravaging planets across the galaxy. With Styx presumably defeated and Animal Man seemingly killed, Strange and Starfire continued their journey back to Earth and Rann, still pursued by angry Lady Styx followers. With Starfire wounded in one such battle, and their ship breaking apart and malfunctioning, Adam was saved by [[Mogo]] and a rookie [[Green Lantern]]. Brought to Rann, Strange was equipped with new eyes, cloned by Aleea and genetically engineered to grant him vision of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. He was briefly questioned by the [[Green Lantern Corps]] about the secret of 52 but, when an emergency arose during the interrogation, the Lanterns offered to respond in Strange's stead so he could return to his wife.

===''Countdown to Adventure''===
Adam Strange joined [[Animal Man]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] in the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown to Adventure]]'' written by [[Adam Beechen]] in August [[2007 in comics|2007]].

In issue #1, Adam finds himself replaced as Rann's protector by '''Champ Hazard''', a former actor from Earth. However, Hazard has no regard for any life and is responsible for ending his battles in a horrifically bloody way. It appears Champ was infected by a madness plague created by [[Lady Styx]] before leaving Earth, and has infected one third of the people on Rann, causing them to riot and say "Believe in Her." Adam and his family escape to Earth, where he enlists the aid of Animal Man and Starfire, eventually discovering a way to cure the plague and restore the infectees to normal.

===''Rann-Thanagar Holy War''===
Adam Strange, along with many of the DC space heroes including Hawkman, [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], The Weird, and the [[Starman (comics)|Prince Gavyn Starman]], battles Synnar the Demiurge. Adam Strange's actions in this story result in the depopulation of Prince Gavyn's Throneworld at the hands of Lady Styx. Later, to defeat Synnar and Lady Styx, Rann's atmosphere was explosively discharged into outer space with Rann's entire population Zeta-beamed to Throneworld. Strange also discovers in this story that he is a member of the so-called Aberrant Six.

===''Strange Adventures''===
With Throneworld renamed New Rann, Adam Strange once more teams up with the DC space heroes to investigate why some of the galaxy's stars are disappearing. It is discovered from the future spirit of Synnar that he is destined to be one of 'The Aberrant Six', a group critical to preventing the Synnar of today (trapped in The Weird's body) from destroying the universe. Ultimately the Aberrant Six did not form and the future Synnar was forced to leave, but not before Captain Comet's mercenary friend Eye was killed by Synnar's supreme god-enemy to prevent the forming of the Six. Comet was entrusted with Eye's robot companion Orb until she returns, told by Synnar that when that happens he will "continue his negotiations – All has changed, but remains as it was". Adam Strange realizes that one day Synnar will return and force him to join his Aberrant Six.

===''R.E.B.E.L.S.''===
Adam Strange then found himself joining up with [[Vril Dox]] as part of his [[R.E.B.E.L.S.]]. Adam Strange helped to save the [[Vega system]] and several galaxies by defeating [[Starro]] the Conqueror. It was also around this time that Adam Strange visited [[New Krypton]] to protest the accord that their Council reached with the Thanagarians. Explaining that the Rannians have recently been on the losing end in a war with the Thanagarians, Adam questions the judgment of the Council in reaching this accord. Whilst there he aided [[Superman]] who was investigating a murder.

The plight of Rann's people was soon resolved by Vril Dox, seeking to restore his reputation after [[Starro]] the Conqueror stole [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] from him and used it to enslave its client worlds. Dox Zeta-beamed Rann into the Vega system, in the orbit previously held by the now destroyed planet [[Tamaran]], and proceeded to terraform Rann and make it suitable to sustain life again.

The restoration of the planet Rann wasn't Dox's only reason for relocating it into the Vega system.  First, by putting Rann into Tamaran's orbit, it restored the gravitational balance to the Vega system, which had been thrown off by Tamaran's destruction. Secondly, in exchange for restoring their planet, the people of Rann agreed to let Dox rebuild L.E.G.I.O.N. headquarters on Rann.

Tamaranian refugees, led by [[Blackfire (DC Comics)|Blackfire]], attacked Rann believing that since the planet was in Tamaran's orbit they had claim to it. The violence was ended when Vril Dox, who was off-world at the start of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the fighting without bloodshed on either side. As it turned out, Dox was off-world negotiating an official end to the [[Rann-Thanagar War]], using Rann's new-found distance from Thanagar and change in leadership on both sides as leverage.

Dox then went on to mediate the tension between the Rannians and the Tamaranians by proposing that the Tamaranians live on Rann's uninhabited southern continent.

Adam Strange, as well as protector of Rann, would also become a senior commander of L.E.G.I.O.N. ensuring peace with the Green Lantern Corps. He also helped create an alliance between Rannians, Tamaranians and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro the Conqueror, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega System and the galaxy.

==Skills and equipment==
Adam Strange lacks any real superhuman attributes, choosing to rely more on quick thinking and ingenuity. Before coming to Rann, Strange was an accomplished explorer and archaeologist who specialized in gathering and studying lost artifacts found in the remains of ancient civilizations. Applying these qualities to his new life on Rann, he would venture out with his new family into the wilds of their homeworld to study and rediscover its ancient history.<ref name="Showcase 17">''Showcase'' Vol 1 #17 December, 1958</ref> Eventually his experiences accumulated on his adventures through the study and understanding of both Rannian culture and its vast technologies as well as its vested history, enabled Adam to pick up a host of vaunted combat techniques and scientific knowledge. Giving him the edge needed to match and defeat physically or innumerably more imposing opponents over the many years. Having battled and bested adversaries both native and extraterrestrial in nature; such as Thanagarians, Durlans, Qwardians, En'Tarans, Meta-Humans, etc.<ref>''Green Lantern'' Vol 3 #38-39</ref><ref>''Adam Strange'' Vol 2 #6</ref><ref>''Swamp Thing'' Vol 2 #58</ref><ref>''Starman'' Vol 2 #63-67/#69-73</ref> This along with his many decades of thriving in the harsh environments of Rann, earth and other galaxian territories has made Adam an accomplished survivalist,<ref>''52'' #7 August, 2006</ref> having spent just as long traversing the rural areas as treacherous as the Amazon rainforest back on Earth. 

Strange has a tactical intellect on par with - or exceeding - the likes of Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor, and complements this with the learning that he has gained in his many years of study on Rann. He is able to reverse engineer functional technological wonders even from the damaged remains of an alien ship with ease.<ref>''52'' #5-10 April, 25 2007</ref> He is also an accomplished mathematician, who can expertly deduce the exact time and place when and where Sardeth's Zeta Beam will hit on his home planet of Earth.<ref>''DC Comics Presents: Mystery in Space'' Vol 2 #1</ref> [[Grant Morrison]] showcases his intellect in his run on ''JLA''.  After Rann is conquered by a telepathic race called En'Tarans, Strange defeats them by secretly converting the planet into a giant Zeta Beam gun, powered by the latent Mega Zeta Radiation in his body. With the aid of the JLA, Strange successfully transports the En'Taran fleet to another part of the galaxy.<ref>''JLA'' July 1998 #20-21</ref> In the aftermath of the Infinite Crisis event, Adam Strange loses his eyes in a freak Zeta Beam accident.  Sardeth is able to clone a new set of eyes from his granddaughter, Aleea Strange, and transplant them into Adam. These new eyes enable Adam to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum.<ref>''52'' #51 April, 25 2007</ref>

===Technology===
[[Rann_(fictional_planet)#Rann_technology|''Rannian Technology'']]
As the protector of Rann, Adam is well connected with Sardeth and his science council.<ref>''Adam Strange'' Vol 1 #1 April, 1990</ref> Adam uses of a colorful variety of technologies both as a hero and spacefarer, the resources pertaining to Rann's wonders of science available to him are numerous. Having studied, taken apart and rebuilt much of his own equipment; mainly consisting of high-tech munitions, armor, gadget's & utensils or cutting edge genetics engineering. Strange is also well versed in their mechanical function as well as practical use in his heroic endeavors.<ref>''Countdown to Adventure'' #1-8 2007–08</ref>  

;Space suit
Strange is an adept aerial combatant, often making use of a fireproof, thermal insulated and environmentally adapted suit with which to traverse the terrains of foreign worlds or in the cold depths of space.<ref name="AS 2.2">''Adam Strange'' Vol 2 #2 December, 2004</ref> With further upgrades, Stranges costume boasts a built-in Zeta Beamer with which to warp lightyears across the universe in an instant.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S'' Vol. 2 #9-28</ref> 

The helmet is equipped with a life support system that protects Adam from harmful atmospheric conditions, while the suit itself pulls up a Holographic HUD (Heads Up Display) system with which to control his equipment via thought & voice command. Technology of which is slaved to his handheld blaster, sporting real-time threat assessment and targeting priority reticles to better combat adversaries.<ref name="AS 2.2"/>  

The jetpack is a twin-engine propulsion system attached to a harness adorning his back capable of aerial aviation for an undisclosed amount of time.<ref>''Mystery In Space'' Vol 1 #60</ref> Strange is also versed in other kinds of rocket propulsion equipment like a booster system with hidden back up blasters, with his equipment Strange can also make escape velocity in order to break planetary orbit.<ref>''Adam Strange'' Vol 2 #2 April, 1990</ref>  

;Alien Arsenal
Primary weapon of choice is a Rannian laser pistol among other assorted weapons and munitions picked up from across the galaxy. Adam Strange is a crack marksman with just about any ranged weapon on hand at the time, the gun comes with a targeting system conductor when worked in tandem with his costume and has a stun setting for non-lethal application. 

Other munitions in his arsenal include '''Holo-Blasters''', which are Hard-Light Energy arms that Strange can use to conjure any number of ordinance or enhanced protective shielding with while in a firefight.<ref>''Adam Strange'' Vol 2 #7-8 December, 2004</ref> The effectiveness of these armaments makes them potent enough in dispatching Smite, one of Starro's lieutenants boasting physical capabilities rivaling Superman or Lobo.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S'' Vol. 2 #9</ref> When properly calibrated by outside forces, these energy weapons can also channel the light of a [[Power ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]] or a facsimile of its corresponding emotion that can dispatch a small enclave of Black Lantern's.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S'' Vol. 2 #10-11</ref>   

;Zeta Beamer Apparatus
One of Strange's as well as the planet of Rann's greatest resource is the Zeta Beam technology developed by Sardeth. Initially designed as a means of communications with intelligent life from across the universe, it was accidentally discovered to be an instantaneous means of intergalactic transport that rode along a cosmic radiation called Zeta Rays.<ref name="Showcase 17"/>  The effects of the ray were always short lived, and their dissipation meant Adam would  return to where he first intercepted the ray. This would be a running staple for years until later Zeta designs made its effects permanent, albeit at the cost debilitating mental sickness for its user.<ref>''Adam Strange'' Vol 1 #1-3 March, 1990</ref> Eventual innovations in Rannian transport technology would produce a more streamlined device called the Zeta Beamer module, an A.I. commanded mobile drone in the form of a floating sphere that could be used to track Zeta Rays across galaxies and even into alternate universes.<ref>''Adam Strange'' Vol 2 #1-8 2004-05</ref> Like the Mega Zeta Beam, transport was also permanent, without the danger of Zeta Ray sickness. Further modifications integrated the transport device into Adam's space suit.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S'' Vol. 2 #17</ref>

==Awards and reception==
The character and series of the same name have received several awards over the years, including the 1967 and 1968 [[Alley Awards]] for Strip Most Desired for Revival. [[IGN]] ranked Adam Strange as the 97th greatest comic book hero of all time stating that<blockquote>If by fluke we were given the chance to ride a Zeta Beam[sic] into space, meet a sexy alien princess[sic] on the planet Rann, and fight extraterrestrial threats with high-tech weaponry, I[sic] wouldn’t want to go back to mundane Earth-life either. That makes us completely sympathetic to Adam Strange’s plight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/97 | title=Adam Strange as number 97 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>
