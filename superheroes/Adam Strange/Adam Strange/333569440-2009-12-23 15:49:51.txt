'''Adam Strange''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Mike Sekowsky]], he first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #17 (November 1958).

==Publication history==
Created by [[Gardner Fox]], Adam Strange is reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s ''[[John Carter (character)|John Carter of Mars]]'' series. Both characters have origins in which they are chased by threatening aboriginal peoples only to find themselves mysteriously transported at the last moment to distant planets where they become heroic figures. In Carter's case this is to Mars, while Adam Strange is transported to Rann. Although the ''John Carter'' stories depict a raw sort of adventure that includes swordplay, physical action, nudity, and bloodletting, these are absent from the ''Adam Strange'' stories. However, both characters long to travel to a strange world to fight alien opponents and be united with a beloved woman who resided there. 

Like most other comic book science fiction stories of the 1950s, the problems and their stories are contrived, the solutions often based on haphazard application of simple scientific principles. After his initial 3-issue run in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' (#17-19), came a move to ''[[Mystery in Space]]'' (#53-100, 102), drawn by [[Carmine Infantino]] and most often inked by [[Murphy Anderson]] (although [[Bernard Sachs (comics)|Bernard Sachs]], [[Joe Giella]] and [[Sid Greene]] did a few issues each). As of #92, [[Jack Schiff]] replaced [[Julius Schwartz]] as editor of ''MIS'' and [[Lee Elias]] became the artist for ''Adam Strange''. He later appeared in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' (reprints in #217 through 244, except for #222, which instead had a new story with Strange, written by [[Denny O'Neil]], while #226 had the addition of a new ''Strange'' text story, by Fox, with illos by Anderson).

One award-winning story, however, resulted from a continuity gaffe in the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book, in which the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] mentions Adam Strange as a possible new member for the [[Justice League]], a group he had not met and who could not have heard of him, as all his heroics took place on Rann. When a letter to the editor reported this, [[Gardner Fox]] wrote a story showing how the JLA came to Rann and how Adam Strange got them out of the traps that [[Kanjar Ro]] set for them there.

For years, the character was a regular presence in the [[DC Universe]]. By the [[1980s in comics|1980s]], the acclaimed [[author]] [[Alan Moore]] provided a more cynical reason for his visits to Rann. Apparently, the population of the planet, the majority of whom viewed the Terran with contempt, is sterile, and the real reason for Adam's presence is to be a breeding [[Stud (animal)|stud]]. This new situation is further illustrated in a [[1990 in comics|1990]] [[limited series]], ''The Man of Two Worlds'', where Adam learns of the population's opinion of him and Alanna died giving birth to their daughter Aleea. In ''JLA'' #20  (July 1998), Alanna is revealed to be alive, and, at the end of the story, she is reunited with her husband and daughter, albeit briefly, as Adam is transported back to Earth soon after Alanna's arrival.

==Fictional character biography==
Strange is an [[archaeology|archeologist]] suddenly [[teleportation|teleport]]ed from Peru, Earth to [[planets in science fiction|fictional planet]] [[Rann]] through the "[[Rann#Rann Technology|Zeta Beam]]". Called on to protect the planet from [[Fictional extraterrestrials|extraterrestrial]] threats using high-tech weaponry, Strange grew to care for the planet and its inhabitants, especially the blue-haired Alanna. Independently wealthy, he traveled Earth, intercepting the regular patterns of the Zeta Beam to defend Rann and be with Alanna. Strange’s adventures were published in  several [[anthology]] series in the 1950s and '60s and, although never a headlining character, he has had a consistent presence in the [[DC Universe]].

===Mystery in Space===
During [[Grant Morrison|Grant Morrison's]] revival of the [[Justice League of America]] series, [[Mark Waid]] featured Adam Strange when he filled in for Morrison. This proved to be the starting point of a renaissance for the character, establishing new motivations and updating the character's role in the DC Universe. Adam Strange kidnaps the entirety of the Justice League while seeming to be completely insane. The heroes of the Justice League are put to forced labor, ostensibly to celebrate the return of the missing Princess Alanna, who is believed to be dead. With the help of the En'Taran's, a group of alien slavers, the entire population of Rann has been rebuilding the planet to restore its technology and infrastructure. The League's role is to help with the finishing touches for the finale, which will greet Alanna and her En'Taran escorts.

After several escape attempts by the New God, [[Orion_(comics)|Orion]], and a concerted effort by [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], the league succeeds in breaking loose and restraining their En'Taran captors. Adam Strange then reveals that he has been completely sane during their entire incarceration, and that the restoration effort has been a ruse to ward off an En'Taran invasion. Due to a fluke of circumstances, Alanna was never really dead; rather, she was in a coma. As the En'Tarans revived her, they discovered the secret to Zeta Beam teleportation technology and began to covet it for military purposes. Acting quickly, Adam Strange feigned insanity and had the Justice League brought to Rann to provide back up and help him with a desperate gamble. The structures of the Capitol city are actually a larger version of the teleporter; by using his own body as part of the lens, the radiation that keeps him tethered permanently to Rann can instead be used to permanently teleport the invasion fleet away. The Justice League was necessary to complete the repairs in time and for mounting a fast rescue attempt of Alanna and her father from the En'Taran fleet. The plan works, and Strange's family is rescued seconds before the beam channels through him to teleport the fleet away.

Just as Strange is reunited, he begins to disappear as the beam has expunged his radiation tether. The League disappears shortly after, both admiring that Strange beat an alien invasion using only his wits, but also lamenting how painful it must be to have won the battle only to lose his loved ones again. Somewhere on Earth, [[Martian_Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] finds Adam Strange looking up at the sky with longing, and comforts him by placing an understanding hand on his shoulder.

===''Planet Heist''===
''Planet Heist'', a [[2004 in comics|2004]] eight-issue [[limited series]], written by [[Andy Diggle]], penciled by [[Pasqual Ferry]] and colored by [[Dave McCaig]], updated Adam Strange's appearance and abilities by giving him a new costume, a spacesuit that allows for interstellar travel. In the series, Adam was prepared to relocate to Rann permanently when he was informed that the planet was destroyed and that he was blamed for its destruction. In fact, Sardath transported Rann to another dimension to save the planet from the cosmic being, [[Starbreaker (comics)|Starbreaker]], intent on destroying the planet. Adam, with the help of the [[Omega Men]] and the [[Darkstars]], among others, saved Rann and defeated the evil being.

===Rann-Thanagar War===
{{main|Rann-Thanagar War}}

When Rann was moved, its orbit was believed to have pushed the planet [[Thanagar]] closer to its sun, destroying much of the surface (it was later discovered that the actions of [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]] moved Thanagar). Many Thanagarians were relocated to Rann, but enmity between the two races resulted in a war, depicted in ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]'', a six-issue precursor to DC's [[2005 in comics|2005]] to [[2006 in comics|2006]] limited series and DC crossover event, ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

===''52''===
{{main|52 (comic book)}}

Adam is featured as one of the main characters in DC's weekly event ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]''. Adam is stranded on a paradise-like planet with [[Animal Man]] and [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]]. As a result of a teleportation accident involving the zeta beam, he has lost both of his [[eye]]balls but in spite of his injuries, he is trying to fix a damaged spaceship so that they may return home.<ref>''52'' Week Seven</ref> After being attacked by [[Devilance|Devilance the Pursuer]], they eventually escape having realized that the entire planet is a trap. 

Encountered by Devilance again, they're saved by the intervention of [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. Having renounced violence and his career as a bounty hunter, Lobo agrees to serve as the group's guide. They are soon also joined by Ekron, a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] nicknamed the "[[Emerald Empress#52|Emerald Head]]" for his unique mode of transport. This ragtag team makes a stand against the villainess [[Lady Styx]], whose [[undead]] legions are ravaging planets across the galaxy. With Styx presumably defeated and Animal Man seemingly killed, Strange and Starfire continue their journey back to Earth and Rann, still pursued by angry Lady Styx followers. With Starfire wounded in one of such battles, and their ship breaking apart and malfunctioning, Adam is forced to fly blindly in open space. When he's about to crash into a sun, he is saved by [[Mogo]] and a rookie [[Green Lantern]]. Brought to Rann, Strange is equipped with new eyes, cloned by Aleea and genetically engineered to grant him vision of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. He is briefly questioned by the [[Green Lantern Corps]] about the secret of 52, but when an emergency arose during the interrogation, the Lanterns offered to respond in Strange's stead so he could be reacquainted with his wife.

===''Countdown to Adventure''===
Adam Strange joined [[Animal Man]] and [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] in the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown to Adventure]]'' written by [[Adam Beechen]] in August [[2007 in comics|2007]].

In issue #1, Adam finds himself replaced as Rann's protector by '''Champ Hazard''', a former actor from Earth. However, Hazard has no regard for any life and is responsible for ending his battles in a horrifically bloody way. It appears Champ was infected by a madness plague created by [[Lady Styx]] before leaving Earth, and has infected one third of the people on Rann, causing them to riot and say "Believe in Her." Adam and his family escape to Earth, where he enlists the aid of Animal Man and Starfire, eventually discovering a way to cure the plague and restore the infectees to normal.
