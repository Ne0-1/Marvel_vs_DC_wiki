'''Adam Strange''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Showcase (DC Comics)|Showcase]]'' #17 (November-December 1958).

==Synopsis==
Adam Strange is an [[archeologist]] who was suddenly [[teleported]] an astronomical distance to the fictional planet [[Rann]] orbiting the nearest star to the Earth, [[Alpha Centauri]], through a Rannian device called a Zeta Beam. Once there, he was called upon to stop a menace on the planet and was successful. Although he grew to enjoy the planet and its inhabitants, especially a blue-haired woman named Alanna, Adam learned that he would be automatically returned to Earth when the effects of the beam wore off. However, he learned that the beam was used regularly and was provided with a schedule as to times and strike locations so as to use the teleporter. Because Alpha Centauri is visible only in the southern hemisphere, these locations were all located there, usually at archeologically or touristically interesting sites. On Earth, Adam Strange was, like so many other comic protagonists, an independently wealthy American, so having to go to all these places on the other side of the world and having a ladylove on another planet was no loss to him. 

==Costume==
His costume was a red jumpsuit with a crested helmet, worn with a white [[rocket pack]] that was fastened on by white cross-straps. Alanna wore one too, and the standard means of transport they used on Rann was to fly to scenes of danger together. 

==Invention==
Adam Strange was invented as a character by [[Gardner Fox]] as being reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Barsoom]] series, though there wasn't the swordplay, physical strain, unclothedness, and bloodletting, merely the looking up to the sky - to [[Alpha Centauri]], though, not [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] - and the longing to return to a strange world with alien opponents to fight and to his beloved woman.

Like most other (non-[[EC Comics|EC]]) comic book science fiction stories of the 1950s, the problems and their stories were contrived. After the initial run in ''[[Showcase (comic)|Showcase]]'', they moved to ''[[Mystery in Space]]'', drawn by [[Carmine Infantino]] and inked by [[Murphy Anderson]].

==The Past==
One spectacular, even award-winning story, however, resulted from a continuity gaffe in the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book, in which [[the Flash]] mentioned him as a possible new member for the [[Justice League]]. That group and he had not met, and when a letter to the editor reported this, [[Gardner Fox]] wrote a story showing how the JLA came to Rann and how Adam Strange got them out of the traps that [[Kanjar Ro]] set for them there.

For years, the character was a regular presence in the [[DC Universe]].  By the 1980s, the acclaimed [[author]] [[Alan Moore]] provided a more cynical reason for his visits to Rann.  Apparently, the population of the planet--the majority of whom viewed the Terran with contempt--is sterile, and the real reason for Adam's presence is to be a breeding [[stud]]. This new situation was further illustrated in a 1990 [[mini series]] where Adam learned of the population's opinion of him and Alanna died giving birth to their daughter Aleea.  In ''JLA'' #20  (July 1998), Alanna was revealed to be alive, and at the end of the story, she was reunited with her husband and daughter, albeit briefly (Adam was transported back to Earth soon after Alanna's arrival).  

==Modern Strange==

A 2004 mini-series, written by [[Andy Diggle]] and pencilled by [[Pasqual Ferry]], updated Adam Strange's appearance and abilities by giving him a new costume, a spacesuit that allows for interstellar travel.  In the mini-series, Adam was prepared to relocate to Rann permanently when he was informed that the planet was destroyed and that he was blamed for its destruction.  In fact, Sardath transported Rann to another dimension to save the planet from a cosmic being intent on destroying the planet.  Adam, with the help of the [[Omega Men]] and the [[Darkstars]], among others, saved Rann and defeated the evil being.  However, the planet [[Thanagar]] was destroyed in the process.  Many Thanagarians were relocated to Rann, but enmity between the two races has resulted in a war, which is depicted in ''The [[Rann-Thanagar War]]'', currently being published.

==Awards==
The character and series of the same name have received several awards over the years, including the 1967 and 1968 Alley Awards for Strip Most Desired for Revival.
