==Louis Sadler==

Louis Sadler is the name of the first Major Mapleleaf. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 1)'' #106.

Louis Sadler was a Canadian superhero during [[World War II]], and the occasional ally of the Invaders in their battles against Hitler and the Nazis. He gained his powers through an unrevealed process which appears to have retarded his aging process. After the war, he went underground in his crime fighting and eventually revealed his public identity in 1963 to devote time to raising his son, Michael, his most proud achievement. Eventually however, Michael, who was [[homosexuality|gay]], contracted [[HIV]] and died of [[AIDS]]. Louis went into a deep depression. Michael had always been Sadler's favorite of the two children. 

While Louis Sr. was made to appear to have been physically and mentally abusive with his younger son, Louis Sadler Jr.,  appearances can be deceiving. This belief is based upon Louis Jr.'s memory of a childhood incident in which both he and his older brother were caught in their father's room going through things they had been told to stay out of. Their father, a war-hero of strong values, was not pleased.

==Lou Sadler==
Louis Sadler's youngest son, Lou, has currently taken up the mantle of Major Mapleleaf. Lou first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 3) #1.

Lou has a 'goody two-shoes'-type personality. He is secretly a normal human with no superpowers who just rides a super-powered [[horse]] named Thunder.

Bearing the rank of Staff Sergeant in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Lou Sadler Jr. took the code name of Major Mapleleaf out of respect for his father. Lou reportedly had an abusive relationship with his father, who beat him; blaming him for the death of his mother. Lou, who speaks very positively of his father, denies the abuse.

Lou was recruited by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] as one of the new members of the Alpha Flight team when the original team was kidnapped by aliens.

{{spoiler}}
Along with [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] I and II, [[Vindicator]], Sasquatch, and [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Major Mapleleaf was among the Alpha Flight members wounded or possibly killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]] in ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #16.
