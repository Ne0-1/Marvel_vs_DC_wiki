==Louis Sadler==

Louis Sadler is the name of the first Major Mapleleaf. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 1)'' #106.

Louis Sadler was a Canadian superhero during [[World War II]]. He gained his powers through an unrevealed process which may have extended his lifetime. After the war, he went underground in his crime fighting and eventually revealed his public identity in 1963 to devote time to raising his son, Michael, his most proud achievement. Eventually however, Michael, who was [[homosexuality|gay]], contracted [[HIV]] and died of [[AIDS]]. Louis went into a deep depression. Michael had always been Sadler's favorite of the two children. He appears to have been physically and mentally abusive with his younger son, Louis Sadler Jr.

==Lou Sadler==

Louis Sadler's youngest son, Lou, has currently taken up the mantle of Major Mapleleaf. Lou first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 3) #1.

Lou has a 'goody two-shoes'-type personality. He is secretly a normal human with no superpowers who just rides a super-powered [[horse]] named Thunder.

Bearing the rank of Staff Seargeant in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Lou Sadler Jr. took the code name of Major Mapleleaf out of respect for his father. Lou had an abusive relationship with his father, who  beat him; blaming him for the death of his mother.  It appears that Lou, who speaks very positively of his father, is in denial of the abuse.

Lou was recruited by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] as one of the new members of the Alpha Flight team when the original team was kidnapped by aliens.
