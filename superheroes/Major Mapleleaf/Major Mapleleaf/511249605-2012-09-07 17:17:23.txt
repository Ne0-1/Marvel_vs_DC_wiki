'''Louis Sadler''' is the name of the first Major Mapleleaf. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 1'' #106.

=== Fictional character biography ===
'''Louis Sadler''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] superhero during [[World War II]] and the occasional ally of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] in their battles against Hitler and the Nazis. He gained his powers through an unrevealed process which appears to have affected his aging process. After the war, he went underground in his crimefighting and eventually revealed his public identity in 1963 to devote time to raising his son, Michael, his proudest achievement.

While Louis Sr. was made to appear to have been physically and mentally abusive with his younger son, Louis Sadler Jr., appearances can be deceiving. This belief is based upon Louis Jr.'s memory of a childhood incident in which both he and his older brother were caught in their father's room going through things they had been told to stay out of. Their father, a war-hero of strong values, was not pleased.

'''Louis "Lou" Sadler, Jr.''', the younger son of the original Major Mapleleaf, assumed the mantle of Major Mapleleaf. Lou first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 3 #1.

=== Fictional character biography ===
Lou has a 'goody two-shoes'-type personality. He is secretly a normal human with no superpowers who just rides a super-powered [[horse]] named Thunder.

Bearing the rank of Staff Sergeant in the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], Lou Sadler Jr. took the code name of Major Mapleleaf out of respect for his father. Lou reportedly had an abusive relationship with his father, who beat him; blaming him for the death of his mother. Lou, who speaks very positively of his father, denies the abuse.

Lou was recruited by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] as one of the new members of the Alpha Flight team when the original team was kidnapped by [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]].

Along with [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], both incarnations of [[Puck (comics)|Puck]], [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], and [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Major Mapleleaf was among the Alpha Flight members killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]].<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref>
