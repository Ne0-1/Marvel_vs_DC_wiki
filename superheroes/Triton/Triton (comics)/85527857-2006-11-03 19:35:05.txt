== Character History ==

A member of the [[Inhuman]]s royal family, Triton was exposed to the Terrigen Mist as an infant.  The mists altered his body, turning his skin green and giving him the ability to breath underwater, as well as surviving the cold temperatures and incredible pressures of the deep.  An unfortunate side effect was the loss of the ability to survive in a non-aquatic environment.  As a result, he lived in a specifically designed area of the Inhuman's [[city-state]] of [[Attilan]], requiring a special breath apparatus to leave the water.  The apparatus, cumbersome at first, was eventually reduced in size by fellow Inhuman, [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]]. Triton's mutation after Terrigenesis was so severe that his parents disallowed his brother Karnak from going through it.

Triton maintains a friendship with [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], and has occasionally been involved in stories with Marvel's other ocean-dwelling characters. He had pivotal roles in major crossover stories such as [[The Kree-Skrull War]] and [[Atlantis Attacks]].

==Ultimate Triton==
An ultimate version of Triton appeared, along with the other Inhumans, in Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual #1 where they first met the FF.

== Other Media ==
*Because [[Hanna-Barbera]] was unable to use the [[Sub-Mariner]] character for their [[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]] series, Triton was used in his place.

*Triton has appeared in the [[Iron Man (TV series)|90's ''Iron Man'' animated series]] and was voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. 

*Triton will appear as an NP hero in the upcoming video game: [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]].
