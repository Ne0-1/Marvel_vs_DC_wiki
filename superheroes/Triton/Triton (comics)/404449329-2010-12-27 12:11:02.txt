'''Triton''' is a [[fictional]] [[merman]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Triton is member of the [[Inhumans]]' Royal Family, son of Mander and Azur, brother to [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], and cousin to [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]].  Triton was born on the island of [[Attilan]], and was exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]] as an infant. The mists altered his body, turning his skin green and giving him the ability to breathe underwater, as well as surviving the cold temperatures and incredible pressures of the deep.  An unfortunate side effect was the loss of the ability to survive in a non-aquatic environment.  As a result, he lived in a specifically designed area of the Inhuman's [[city-state]] of [[Attilan]], requiring a special breathing apparatus to leave the water.  The apparatus, cumbersome at first, was eventually reduced in size by fellow Inhuman, Maximus the Mad. Triton's mutation after Terrigenesis was so severe that his parents disallowed his brother Karnak from going through it.

Triton later first encountered the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics â€“ Day 261 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=September 18, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref> During an accidental encounter, he tells his fellow Inhumans he recognizes the Hulk from Reed Richard's micro-film files. <ref>"The Incredible Hulk" #175 (May 1974)</ref> Triton acquires an artificial life support system which enabled him to exist out of water.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #54</ref> He then first left the Great Refuge with the other members of the Royal Family, acting as a scout for them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #69</ref> He was freed from the "negative zone" barrier, along with the rest of the Inhumans.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59-61</ref> He then aided the Fantastic Four in battle against [[Blastaar]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #62</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During the [[Skrulls]]' invasion, the Inhuman royal family forges an alliance with the [[Kree]] to recover Black Bolt from the Skrulls' clutches. Together they discover a weakness in the Skrull's defense, and split up to recover the resources to exploit it. Triton is sent to the all-water planet Pelagia, where he encounters a race of mermen-like beings that closely resemble him in appearance. He develops feelings for the native Dascylla. <ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref> Although outnumbered by the hostile Pelagians, Triton manages to overcome them and find what he came for. Triton's breathing harness is then upgraded by the Kree, allowing him to operate in the vacuum of space, thus enabling him to physically attack the Skrulls' ship during the rescue.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Triton is a member of the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] race, artificially mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]], giving him scaly greenish skin, a small dorsal fin running from the base of the skull to the forehead, membranous fins extending from his temples, and webbing between his toes and between his fingers. Triton is able to breathe water, to swim at great speeds, and to withstand the pressures of the deep sea.  He cannot naturally breathe air and needs near-constant contact with water to survive, and cannot exist out of water without artificial aids.  His resistance to deep sea pressure also gives him superhuman strength and speed underwater. He has the ability to survive underwater indefinitely, and the ability to withstand the temperature and pressure of ocean depths.

Triton has undergone basic Inhuman royal militia training.  When on land, Triton employs a water circulation system consisting of lengths of plastic tubing which run along his torso and limbs, maintaining a constant mist of water and providing a supply of fresh water to his gills.
