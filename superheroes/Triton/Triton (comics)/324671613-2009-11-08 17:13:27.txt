'''Triton''' is a [[fictional]] [[merman]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Triton is member of the [[Inhumans]]' Royal Family, son of Mander and Azur, brother to [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], and cousin to [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]].  Triton was born on the island of [[Attilan]], and was exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]] as an infant. The mists altered his body, turning his skin green and giving him the ability to breathe underwater, as well as surviving the cold temperatures and incredible pressures of the deep.  An unfortunate side effect was the loss of the ability to survive in a non-aquatic environment.  As a result, he lived in a specifically designed area of the Inhuman's [[city-state]] of [[Attilan]], requiring a special breathing apparatus to leave the water.  The apparatus, cumbersome at first, was eventually reduced in size by fellow Inhuman, Maximus the Mad. Triton's mutation after Terrigenesis was so severe that his parents disallowed his brother Karnak from going through it.

Triton later first encountered the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45</ref> He acquired an artificial life support system which enabled him to exist out of water.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #54</ref> He then first left the Great Refuge with the other members of the Royal Family, acting as a scout for them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #69</ref> He was freed from the "negative zone" barrier, along with the rest of the Inhumans.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59-61</ref> He then aided the Fantastic Four in battle against [[Blastaar]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #62</ref>

Triton maintains a friendship with Namor the Sub-Mariner, and has occasionally been involved in stories with Marvel's other ocean-dwelling characters. He had pivotal roles in major crossover stories such as the Kree-Skrull War and [[Atlantis Attacks]].

Triton has expressed discontent to [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] when they visit Attilan's current moon location. He reveals that several underground chambers have been flooded for his benefit, but it is just not the same.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
During the [[Skrulls]]' invasion, the Inhuman royal family forges an alliance with the [[Kree]] to recover Black Bolt from the Skrulls' clutches. Together they discover a weakness in the Skrull's defense, and split up to recover the resources to exploit it. Triton is sent to the all-water planet Pelagia, where he encounters a race of mermen-like beings that closely resemble him in appearance.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref> Although outnumbered by the hostile Pelagians, Triton manages to overcome them and find what he came for. Triton's breathing harness is then upgraded by the Kree, allowing him to operate in the vacuum of space, thus enabling him to physically attack the Skrulls' ship during the rescue.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Triton is a member of the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] race, artificially mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]], giving him scaly greenish skin, a small dorsal fin running from the base of the skull to the forehead, membranous fins extending from his temples, and webbing between his toes and between his fingers. Triton is able to breathe water, to swim at great speeds, and to withstand the pressures of the deep sea.  He cannot naturally breathe air and needs near-constant contact with water to survive, and cannot exist out of water without artificial aids.  His resistance to deep sea pressure also gives him superhuman strength and speed underwater. He has the ability to survive underwater indefinitely, and the ability to withstand the temperature and pressure of ocean depths.

Triton has undergone basic Inhuman royal militia training.  When on land, Triton employs a water circulation system consisting of lengths of plastic tubing which run along his torso and limbs, maintaining a constant mist of water and providing a supply of fresh water to his gills.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate future of ''[[Earth X]]'' Triton has undergone a change, becoming even more fish-like. He assists the Royal family in an investigation of just what has happened to Earth.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Heroes Reborn===
{{main|Heroes Reborn}}
Triton and his Inhuman allies revere [[Galactus]] and his heralds in this alternate universe.

Later, in ''Heroes Reborn'' #3, Triton is seen as one of the many heroes onboard the well-outfitted, shrinking spaceship belonging to [[Doctor Doom]]. He, along with many other heroes and Inhumans, must return to the main Marvel universe or all those within the alternate one will be endangered. Despite Doom's lust for power endangering the mission, everyone who has to return safely does.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

=== Marvel Zombies ===
Triton appears as part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance Nick Fury sets up in order to combat the infection.

===Ultimate Triton===
An ultimate version of Triton appeared, along with the other Inhumans, in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #1. The Inhumans first encounter the Fantastic Four over the problem of Crystal, who has run away from home.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

==Other media==
===Television===

* Triton has appeared in the 1990s ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' TV series voiced by [[Rocky Carroll]] and later by [[Mark Hamill]].

===Video games===
* Triton appears as a non-playable character in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] mentions that Triton will accompany him and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] into fighting [[Doctor Doom]] while the heroes went to the Skrull Homeworld.
