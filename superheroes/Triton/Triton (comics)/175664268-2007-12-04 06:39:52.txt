'''Triton''' is a [[fictional]] [[merman]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Triton is member of the [[Inhuman]]s royal family, son of Mander and Azur, brother to [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], and cousin to [[Gorgon (comics)#Gorgon the Inhuman|Gorgon]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]].  Triton was exposed to the Terrigen Mist as an infant. The mists altered his body, turning his skin green and giving him the ability to breath underwater, as well as surviving the cold temperatures and incredible pressures of the deep.  An unfortunate side effect was the loss of the ability to survive in a non-aquatic environment.  As a result, he lived in a specifically designed area of the Inhuman's [[city-state]] of [[Attilan]], requiring a special breath apparatus to leave the water.  The apparatus, cumbersome at first, was eventually reduced in size by fellow Inhuman, [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]]. Triton's mutation after Terrigenesis was so severe that his parents disallowed his brother Karnak from going through it.

Triton maintains a friendship with [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], and has occasionally been involved in stories with Marvel's other ocean-dwelling characters. He had pivotal roles in major crossover stories such as [[The Kree-Skrull War]] and [[Atlantis Attacks]].

Triton has expressed discontent to [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] when they visit Attilan's current moon location. He reveals that several underground chambers have been flooded for his benefit, but it is just not the same.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate future of ''[[Earth X]]'' Triton has undergone a change, becoming even more fish-like. He assists the Royal family in an investigation of just what has happened to Earth.

===[[Heroes Reborn]]===
Triton and his Inhuman allies revere [[Galactus]] and his heralds in this alternate universe.

Later, in ''Heroes Reborn'' #3, Triton is seen as one of the many heroes onboard the well-outfitted, shrinking spaceship belonging to [[Doctor Doom]]. He, along with many other heroes and Inhumans, must return to the main Marvel universe or all those within the alternate one will be endangered. Despite Doom's lust for power endangering the mission, everyone who has to return safely does.

===Ultimate Triton===
An ultimate version of Triton appeared, along with the other Inhumans, in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #1. The Inhumans first encounter the FF over the problem of Crystal, who has run away from home.

==In other media==
* Because [[Hanna-Barbera]] was unable to use the [[Sub-Mariner]] character for their [[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]] series, a character named Triton was used in his place.
* Triton has appeared in the 90's ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' TV series voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. 
* Triton appears as a Non-Playable Character in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] mentions that Triton will accompany him and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] into fighting [[Doctor Doom]] while the heroes went to the Skrull Homeworld.
