In college, Brian meets a woman named Rebacca, who he falls in love with and later marries; gaining a PhD in physics, Brian finds a job in [[Los Alamos]] working for the government as a member of a project trying to develop a clean way to create nuclear energy. The stress of his job eventually leads Brian to become an alcoholic and begin to develop anger problems, lashing out at others. Becoming drunk on the job one day, Brian accidentally overloads some machinery, causing an explosion that causes him to get fired. Despite doctors stating that the explosion has caused him no harm, Brian becomes convinced that the explosion in Los Alamos has affected him on the genetic level.

Despite his vow to never have children, Brian impregnates Rebecca, who gives birth to Bruce Banner. Instantly hateful of the young Bruce, who he believes to be a monster created from the radiation he was exposed to and the "monster gene", Brian ignores him completely and attempts to keep Rebecca away from him, leaving Bruce in the care of the neglectful Nurse Meachum. When Bruce wakes up early one [[Christmas]] morning and opens a present from his mother, a complex model, he assembles it easily despite his young age; Brian's discovery of this convinces him that his belief that Bruce was abnormal and different was correct and results in him beating Bruce and Rebecca when she comes to their son's aid. <ref name = "Monster"> {{Cite comic

In the [[2003]] [[Hulk (film)|Hulk film]], Brian, renamed '''David Banner''', appears as a main antagonist and is portrayed by [[Nick Nolte]].

In the film, David is a genetics researcher who, in his quest to improve on humanity, experiments on himself; after his wife, Edith Banner gives birth to Bruce, David, seeing that Bruce is not normal, barely showing emotion and gaining patches of green skin when he does, feels that he is responsible, realizing that his experiments on himself have affected Bruce. Trying to find a cure for Bruce's condition, David has his research shut down by [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]]; going into a rage over the loss of his work and the hopelessness of Bruce's situation, David accidentally destroys his laboratory and kills Edith during a fight, before being arrested and confined to a mental institution; blocking his memories of David killing Edith, which haunt his nightmares, Bruce is taken into foster care.

Some years later, David is released from mental hospital and gets a job as a janitor at the research institute Bruce works at, in the same field as his father. Confronting Bruce on the night after he is blasted with radiation and nanobots, David reveals his relationship to him (Bruce had previously thought his biological father was dead) and steals some of his mutated DNA. Experimenting with Bruce's DNA on animals, David also sees his son's first transformation into the Hulk, which he soon becomes obssessed with copying.

Releasing three dogs he had mutated to kill Betty Ross, who had confronted him over what has happened with Bruce, David calls Bruce and tells him of this. Defeating the mutant dogs and saving Betty, Bruce is tranquilized and taken to a military facility, which David follows him to. As Bruce is held captive, David subjects himself to the same devices that gave Bruce the ability to change into the Hulk, giving himself the ability to absorb the properties of everything he touches (similar to the villain [[Absorbing Man]] from the Hulk comics). Finding Betty, David tells her that he will turn himself in if he allowed to see Bruce one more time, also revealing to her that he had intended to murder Bruce (believing he would mutate out of control) when his research was originally shut down and that instead he ended up killing Edith when she tried to stop him.

Taken to Bruce, David is placed in a room with him, where they are placed between two electrical generators that will kill both of them if things got out of hand. Having descended into megalomania, David rants to Bruce about how the military has ruined their lives, also stating that the Hulk is his true son, and Bruce is just a shell for him. Biting some electrical wires, David becomes a being of pure electricity while Bruce, upon seeing this, becomes the Hulk. Breaking out of the military facility and engaging each other, David and the Hulk crash into a lake, where David, becoming a being of stone and water, tries to absorb all the Hulk's energy, which the Hulk allows. Unable to contain the Hulk's energy, David swells into a gigantic energy bubble, which is blown apart by a Gamma Charge Bomb launched by General Ross, killing David. <ref>{{cite video|people = Ang Lee (Director) |title = Hulk |medium = DVD |location = United States |publisher = Universal Pictures|year = 2003}}</ref>
