== Fictional character history ==

As a child, Brian Banner and his mother were physically and emotionally [[domestic abuse|abuse]]d by Brian's father; regarding his father as a monster and believing that he had [[heredity|inherited]] a "monster [[gene]]" from him, Brian promised himself that he would never have any children, for fear of bringing another Banner into the world.<ref name = "Grave"> {{Cite comic

In college, Brian meets Rebecca, with whom he falls in love and marries. Brian earns his [[PhD]] in [[physics]] and finds a job in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] working for the [[United States government]] on a project developing a clean way to create [[nuclear energy]]. The stress of his job eventually leads Brian to become an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and begin to develop anger problems, lashing out at others. While drunk at work one day, Brian accidentally overloads some machinery, causing an explosion that costs him his job. Even though his doctors concluded that the explosion caused him no permanent harm, Brian becomes convinced it affected him on the genetic level.

Despite his vow never to have children, Brian impregnates Rebecca, who gives birth to Bruce Banner. Brian believes Bruce has inherited both the "monster gene" and [[genetic defect]]s due to the accident in Los Alamos, so he ignores him completely and attempts to keep Rebecca away from him. He frequently leaves Bruce in the care of the neglectful Nurse Meachum. When Bruce wakes up one [[Christmas]] morning and opens a present from his mother, a complex model, he assembles it easily despite his young age. This convinces Brian that his assumptions about Bruce were correct. He beats Bruce and, after she comes to her son's aid, Rebecca as well.<ref name = "Monster"> {{Cite comic

After fifteen years of confinement, Brian, who is believed fit for reintroduction into society, is released into a reluctant Bruce's care. Living with Bruce causes Brian's delusions to begin again and, on the anniversary of Rebecca's death, Brian and Bruce engage in a verbal and later physical fight at Rebecca's grave on a stormy night.

Brian's ghost would continue to haunt Bruce's alter-ego, the Hulk, after his death, often appearing to taunt him, stating that Bruce was no better than he himself; villains such as [[Mentallo]], the [[Red Skull]], [[Devil Hulk]], and Guilt [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] would also use the image of Brian Banner against the Hulk in an attempt to weaken him.

When Bruce Banner and the Hulk are fused back together after the events of ''[[Heroes Reborn|Heroes Return]]'', Bruce finds himself in Hell, where he meets several former adversaries, including his father, Brian. Bruce is terrorized by Brian, [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], and [[Maestro (Marvel Comics)|Maestro]].

In ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] hero [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], who has the power to change into an opponent's worst fear, adopts the guise of Brian Banner to use against the Hulk.

== Other versions ==

In the ''[[House of M]]'' timeline created by the [[Scarlet Witch]], '''Dr. Brian D. Banner''' believes Bruce to be a mutant created through the radiation he experimented with and attempts to kill him; murdering Rebecca when she gets in his way, Brian, before he can harm the young Bruce, is shot to death by police who arrive at the scene.  This is very similar to the scenario involving in the Hulk film (see below).<ref> [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hulk_(House_of_M) Hulk (House of M) - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios]</ref>

== In other media ==
=== Television ===

In 1979 the [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|''Incredible Hulk'' television series]] aired an episode called [[List_of_The_Incredible_Hulk_episodes#Season_3|"Homecoming"]] featuring Banner's family.  [[John Marley]] played Banner's father in the episode, but his character is otherwise unrelated to the comic-book character created by [[Bill Mantlo|Mantlo]] and [[Mike Mignola|Mignola]] six years later.

=== Film ===
[[Image:DavidBannerHulkFilm.jpg|thumb|right|David Banner in a scene from the film ''Hulk''.]]   

In the [[2003 in film|2003]] [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' film]], Brian, renamed '''David Banner''' (a reference to the [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|television series]]), appears as the main antagonist in the film and is portrayed by [[Nick Nolte]], and [[Paul Kersey (actor)|Paul Kersey]] in the film's prologue and subsequent flashbacks. The character's antagonist name, as stated by [[Ang Lee]], is simply called '''The Father'''.

In the film, David is a genetics researcher who, in his quest to improve on humanity, experiments on himself; after his wife, Edith Banner gives birth to Bruce, David, seeing that Bruce is not normal, barely showing emotion and gaining patches of green skin when he does, feels that he is responsible, realizing that his experiments on himself have affected Bruce. Trying to find a cure for Bruce's condition, David has his research shut down by [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]]; going into a rage over the loss of his work and the hopelessness of Bruce's situation, David accidentally destroys his laboratory and tried to murder Bruce (believing he would mutate out of control), only ending up killing Edith when she tried to stop him. While Bruce is taken into foster care, with the [[Repressed memory|memories of his mother's death blocked out]], David is confined to a mental institution.

Years later, after being released from the institution and after Bruce becomes the Hulk, David, believing the Hulk to be his "true son" tests him by sending three "hulk-dogs" to kill [[Betty Ross]] before attempting to replicate his powers, which results in David giving himself [[Absorbing Man]]-like abilities. After both he and Bruce are captured by the military, David engages the Hulk in a fight, after biting into an electrical wire referencing to [[Zzzax]], they then battle in the sky, then on the ground with David being composed of stones, after that being made of lake water, which ends when David attempts to absorb the Hulk's power. Unable to contain this newly acquired power, David swells into an energy bubble, which is destroyed by General Ross with a Gamma Charge Bomb. Bruce survives the explosion, but David dies in it.<ref> {{cite video|people = Ang Lee (Director) |title = Hulk |medium = DVD |location = United States |publisher = Universal Pictures|date = 2003}}</ref>
