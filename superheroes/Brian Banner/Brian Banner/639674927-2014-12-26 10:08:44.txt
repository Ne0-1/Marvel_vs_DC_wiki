'''Brian Banner''' is a fictional [[villain]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]] created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]] and first appearing in print in early 1982. Brian Banner is the abusive father of Bruce Banner, the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]], and his mistreatment of his own wife and son is a major contributing cause of Bruce's mental illness linked to his Hulk condition.

==Fictional character biography==
As a child, Brian Banner along with his sisters '''Susan, Elaine''' and their Mother, were all physically and emotionally [[domestic abuse|abuse]]d by their father 'Bruce Banner' (and when Brian grew up and had his own son with his wife Rebecca' he named him Bruce thinking he would grow up to be just like his grandfather). Brian regarded his father as a monster and believed that he had [[heredity|inherited]] a "monster [[gene]]" from him, and so promised himself that he would never have any children, for fear of bringing another Banner into the world (which he, ironically [[Bruce Banner|would]]).<ref name = "Grave">{{Cite comic

Brian's past with his father tortured him so much he cut off all communication with his sisters Susan & Elaine along with their Mother as soon as he left the house not wanting to relive bad memories, so he instead tried to move on with his life and try to forget. But eventually his past would catch up to him.

While his sister '''Elaine''' moved to Los Angeles, fell in love with and married a County Sheriff named '''Morris Walters''' (which would lead them to have their daughter '''Jennifer''' who grow up to be Super-heroine known as [[She-Hulk]]). His other sister '''Susan''' would move to a nice town and eventually marry a man going by the name of '''Drake'''.

While he was in college, Brian met a woman named ''''Rebecca'''', with whom he falls in love and marries. Brian earns his [[PhD]] in [[physics]] and finds a job in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] working for the [[United States government]] on a project developing a clean way to create [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. The stress of his job eventually leads Brian to become an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and begin to develop anger problems, lashing out at others. While drunk at work one day, Brian accidentally overloads some machinery, causing an explosion that costs him his job. Even though his doctors concluded that the explosion caused him no permanent harm, Brian becomes convinced it affected him on the genetic level.

Despite his vow never to have children, Brian impregnates Rebecca, who gives birth to their only child, Robert Bruce Banner. Brian believes Bruce has inherited both the "monster gene" and [[genetic defect]]s due to the accident in Los Alamos, so he ignores him completely and attempts to keep Rebecca away from him. He frequently leaves Bruce in the care of the neglectful Nurse Meachum. When Bruce wakes up one [[Christmas]] morning and opens a present from his mother, a complex model, he assembles it easily despite his young age. This convinces Brian that his assumptions about Bruce were correct. He beats Bruce and, after she comes to her son's aid, Rebecca as well.<ref name = "Monster">{{Cite comic

After fifteen years of confinement, Brian, who is believed fit for reintroduction into society, is released into a reluctant Bruce's care. Living with Bruce causes Brian's delusions to begin again and, on the anniversary of Rebecca's death, Brian and Bruce engage in a verbal and later physical fight at Rebecca's grave on a stormy night.

Brian's ghost would continue to haunt Bruce's alter-ego, the Hulk, after his death, often appearing to taunt him, stating that Bruce was no better than he himself; villains such as [[Mentallo]], the [[Red Skull]], [[Devil Hulk]], and [[Guilt Hulk]] would also use the image of Brian Banner against the Hulk in an attempt to weaken him.

When Bruce Banner and the Hulk are fused back together after the events of ''[[Heroes Reborn|Heroes Return]]'', Bruce finds himself in Hell, where he meets several former adversaries, including his father, Brian. Bruce is terrorized by Brian, [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], and [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]]. He eventually stands up to his father, attacking and strangling him before being returned to Earth by an image of his wife, [[Betty Ross]].<ref name = "Homecoming">{{Cite comic

With the resulting samples, Mr. Fantastic manages to cure the Hulk, instructing [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] in shrinking down to a point where he can insert Brian's gene samples into Banner's own DNA, with the energy surge released when the Hulk returns to human form infusing the healthy DNA with his own system. Bruce subsequently visits his father's grave and laments his confusion over his feelings for his father, noting the fact that he now owes his life to the man despite his old issues with him.<ref>{{Cite comic

[[File:BrianBannerHulkMonster.jpg|right|thumb|Brian returns as a Hulk-like monster.]]

In ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', the hero [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], who has the power to change into an opponent's worst fear, adopts the guise of Brian Banner to use against the Hulk during the ''[[World War Hulk]]''.

Recently, Bruce has implied that killing his father wasn't actually an accident, noting during a confrontation with [[Daken]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] that he has managed to avoid causing any innocent deaths when he is rampaging as the Hulk- save for those occasions when he is under the control or influence of something else-, and suggesting that it is unlikely that he would make such a 'mistake' in his more limited human form.<ref>Incredible Hulk #603</ref> In an indirect manner, Brian's memory also resulted in Bruce stopping his fight with his son [[Skaar]] after the Hulk was restored following the final battle with the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], Bruce recognising that he couldn't continue the fight with Skaar- regardless of how much either side might 'deserve' to die- without becoming his father all over again.<ref>Incredible Hulk #611</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Brian Banner returns from the dead and ends up facing Hulk again alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] after what happened to the death realms. Brian transforms into a creature resembling a mix of the Guilt and [[Devil Hulk]]s as he does.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #619</ref> When Brian tries to kill Rebecca again, Hulk ends up fighting him alongside [[Skaar]]. Brian feeds on the Hulk's anger towards him, becoming stronger. It is only when the Hulk's lost love [[Jarella]] tells him to remember his love for her that the tide turns. Hulk instead focuses on the positive emotions inspired by the rest of his allies and defeats Brian Banner.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #620</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Brian Banner has genius-level intellect.

When Brian Banner was resurrected during the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Brian Banner gained the ability to turn into a hybrid replica of the Guilt Hulk and the Devil Hulk.

==Other versions==

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' timeline created by the [[Scarlet Witch]], '''Dr. Brian D. Banner''' believes Bruce to be a mutant created through the radiation he experimented with and attempts to kill him. He murdered Rebecca when she gets in his way. Before he can harm the young Bruce, Brian is shot to death by the police who arrive at the scene. This is very similar to the scenario involving in the Hulk film (see below).<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hulk_(House_of_M) Hulk (House of M) - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios]</ref>

==In other media==

===Film===
* In the [[2003 in film|2003]] film [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'']], Brian, renamed '''David Banner''' (a reference to the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|television series]]), appears as the main antagonist in the film and is portrayed by [[Nick Nolte]], and [[Paul Kersey (actor)|Paul Kersey]] in the film's prologue and subsequent flashbacks. The character's antagonist name, as stated by [[Ang Lee]], is simply called '''The Father'''. In the film, David is a genetics researcher who, in his quest to improve on humanity, experiments on himself; after his wife, Edith Banner, gives birth to Bruce, David sees that Bruce is not normal, and feels that he is responsible. He realizes his experiments on himself have affected Bruce, who barely shows emotion and gaining patches of green skin when he is hurt or angered. While attempting to find a cure for Bruce's condition, David has his research shut down by [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]]; in his rage over the loss of his work and the hopelessness of Bruce's situation, David destroys his laboratory to prevent the military using the data and tries to murder Bruce (believing that Bruce would mutate out of control). Instead, he accidentally kills Edith when she tries to stop him. Bruce is taken into foster care, with the [[Repressed memory|memories of his mother's death blocked out]], and David is confined to a mental institution. Years later, after being released from the institution and after Bruce becomes the Hulk, David, convinced the Hulk to be his "true son", tests the Hulk by sending three "hulk-dogs" to kill [[Betty Ross]]. While the Hulk defeats them, David attempts to replicate the Hulk's powers, giving himself [[Absorbing Man]]-like abilities. After both he and Bruce are captured by the military, David bites into an electrical wire (referencing to [[Zzzax]]), and engages the Hulk in a fight that rages through the sky, on land and into a lake. David takes form of a being composed of stones, and then of lake water. When David attempts to absorb the Hulk's power, he is unable to contain the newly acquired power, causing him to swell into an energy bubble, which is destroyed by General Ross with a Gamma Charge Bomb. Bruce survives the explosion, but David is killed.<ref>{{cite video|people = Ang Lee (Director) |title = Hulk |medium = DVD |location = United States |publisher = Universal Pictures|date = 2003}}</ref>
