'''Sentinels''' are a [[fiction]]al variety of mutant-hunting [[robot]]s, appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. They are usually portrayed as antagonists to the [[X-Men]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], they first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' (vol. 1) #14 (November 1965).

According to Marvel canon, Sentinels are programmed to locate [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and capture or kill them. Though several types of Sentinels have been introduced, the typical Sentinel is three stories tall, capable of [[flight]], projects [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Energy blasts|energy blasts]], and can detect mutants.

The Sentinels have been featured in several X-Men [[video game]]s, and played a large role in the [[X-Men (TV series)|1990s ''X-Men'' animated series]]. Additionally, a simulated version made a brief appearance in the beginning of the 2006 film, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' seen in the [[Danger Room]]. They will be featured prominently in the upcoming film, ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''. In 2009, the Sentinels were ranked by [[IGN]] as the 38th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/38.html Sentinels is number 38 ], [[IGN]].</ref>

==Characteristics==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

Sentinels are designed to hunt [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who often represent the protagonists of Marvel stories; therefore, the Sentinels are usually employed as [[supervillain]]s or as the tools of other villains. While many are capable of [[tactic (method)|tactical thought]], only a handful are [[self-awareness|self-aware]].

Sentinels are technologically advanced, and have exhibited a wide variety of abilities. They are armed (primarily with [[Directed-energy weapon|energy weapons]] and restraining devices), capable of flight, and can detect mutants at long range. They possess vast physical strength, and their bodies are highly resistant to damage. Some are able to alter their physical forms or re-assemble and reactivate themselves after they have been destroyed.

Some Sentinel variants have the ability to learn from their experiences, developing their defenses during an engagement. Several groups of the robots have been created or led by a single, massive Sentinel, called [[Master Mold]].

==Generations==
* '''Mark I''' and '''[[Master Mold]]''' - by [[Bolivar Trask]]. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #14. Bolivar Trask sacrificed himself to destroy the Master Mold.
* '''Mark II''' - by [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]]. This model was capable of adapting to and counter-acting super-powers almost instantly. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #57.
* '''Composite''' - created by merging the remaining portions of five Sentinels destroyed by the X-Men and came under control of Ashley Martin. It was destroyed by her when it rebelled against her.
* '''Mark III''' - by [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]] and ''Project: Armageddon'', secretly funded by [[Edward Buckman]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Council of the Chosen]]. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #98.
** '''X-Sentinels''' - by Stephen Lang, [[Android (robot)|android]]s who were duplicates of the original X-Men.
* '''Mark IV''' - by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]. First appeared in ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #151.
* '''Mark V''' - by Sebastian Shaw for U.S. government's ''[[Project Wideawake]]''. First appeared in ''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #2.
* '''Mark VI''' - by Shaw Industries for ''Project: Wideawake'', used by Onslaught. Also incorporated parts of Project Nimrod.
* '''Mark VII''' - by Shaw Industries, experimental, remotely controlled.
* '''[[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]]''' (later [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]) - a prototype Super Sentinel that arrived from the "[[Days of Future Past]]" timeline and was later reactivated by Reverend [[William Stryker]].
** '''Project Nimrod''' - by an offshoot of ''Project: Wideawake'', experimental. Cancelled after [[X-Force]] interfered. Based on the Nimrod Sentinel.
* '''[[Prime Sentinel]]s''' - by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] and ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]'', handicapped humans equipped with [[nanotechnology]] without their knowledge at Prospero Clinic, used as sleeper agents until activated by attack or presence of a mutant.
* '''Omega Prime Sentinels''' - the second generation of [[Prime Sentinel]]s. [[Karima Shapandar]] is one of them.
* '''Wild Sentinels''' - Built in secret by a new [[Master Mold]] in Ecuador, activated by Donald Trask III and used by [[Cassandra Nova]]. New units are produced based on the currently available resources; salvaged parts, weapons and sometimes even entire vehicles; which give this particular type of Sentinel a very diverse, rag-tag appearance. Both due to this and their design flexibility, a wide variety of different shapes and forms have been observed. The Mega-Sentinels used to destroy [[Genosha]] and Nanosentinels both belong to this kind of Sentinel. The technology used in Nano-Sentinels is also employed by [[Weapon Plus]] for their artificial evolution experiments and the creation of their Super-Sentinels.
* '''Mark VIII''' - Sentinel Squad [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E]], designed by [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]]. Unlike other Sentinels, the Mark VIII requires a human pilot.
* '''Bio-Sentinels''' - Humans infected by a technological virus created by Simon Trask, the victims become anti-mutant activists, who later at Trask's command, are fully transformed into robotic Sentinels mindlessly following Trask's commands.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #31</ref>

===Related mutant-hunting creations===
*'''[[Tri-Sentinel]]''': A combination of three fairly standard Sentinels bonded together by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], and defeated by [[Spider-Man]] at the peak of his cosmic ([[Captain Universe]]) powers. Later revived by The Life Foundation, only to be destroyed again by Spider-Man and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]].

* '''Super-Sentinels''': Using [[Nanotechnology|Nano-Sentinel technology]], [[Weapon Plus]] created artificially evolved superhumans at ''[[Weapon Plus#The World|The World]]''. Three of the creations were chosen to form the mutant-hunting Super-Sentinels, Huntsman, [[Fantomex]] and Ultimaton, who were intended to be presented to the public as superheroes in order to make the extermination of mutantkind look "like a Saturday morning cartoon".
* '''Colcord's Sentinels''': Some of the Boxbots created by [[Madison Jeffries]] (aka Box) to serve the [[Weapon X]] Program. In one variation of the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline seen in the ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' limited series, one of the Boxbots evolves into a new Master Mold and a new breed of Sentinels.
*'''Hardaway''': A cyborg created at Camp Hayden, killed by the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], who called himself a Bio-Sentinel.
*'''X-51 ([[Machine Man]])''': Captured by Bastion and "infected" with Prime Sentinel nano-bots which reconfigured and reconstructed his systems thereby giving him similar capabilities to Nimrod, such as adapting to almost any situation and programming that at times forced him to attack mutants.
* Juston Seyfert's Sentinel: First appearing in ''[[Sentinel (comic book)|Sentinel]]'' #1, this is a rebuilt Sentinel (likely a Mark V or Mark VI), reprogrammed to obey Juston Seyfert. Initially, Seyfert controlled the Sentinel by riding on its shoulder; he now has built a cockpit into it. Seyfert and his Sentinel are now members of the [[Avengers Academy]] and will be featured in the upcoming ''[[Avengers Arena]]'' title.
* '''Sentinaughts''': one of the types of sentient robots who live in the free robot city of The Core,<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 1 #26</ref> Sentinaughts are apparently based on the Sentinel design. They vary in size from roughly human to the large stature of traditional Sentinels.

===Ultimate Sentinels===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', the Sentinels, created by the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Bolivar Trask, were already in action at the beginning of the first story arc, hunting down and killing mutants on the streets, in a program apparently openly and publicly acknowledged by the U.S. government. Later on, there were also the ''New Sentinels'' that were actually sixty of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s top agents in a Sentinel [[powered exoskeleton|battle armor]] that was described as having enough hardware to take on a fleet of the old Sentinel models (though this may have been an exaggeration). A new breed of Sentinel robots, created by Trask under orders from the [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] twins, is currently hunting mutants.
After the events of the [[Ultimatum Wave]], a new model of Sentinel (Nimrod Sentinels) was deployed to hunt and capture, or kill, mutants that refused to turn themselves in.

==In other media==

===Television===
* A Sentinel appeared in a flashback of the episode of ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' "A Firestar Is Born".

* Sentinels appeared in a number of episodes of the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] voiced by David Fox. They appeared as the main antagonists of the first season. The first episode revolves around Sentinels hunting down [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. The Sentinel program, controlled by [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], was cancelled by the president and the project moved overseas to [[Genosha]]. Trask constructed [[Master Mold]] while on Genosha, but it was apparently destroyed when [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] flooded the complex. Sentinels later appeared in the "[[Days of Future Past]]" episode. As with the comic series, in the future timeline, Sentinels had taken over the world and mutants were on the verge of extinction. In "[[The Final Decision]]", the season one finale, Master Mold reappeared in a secret base constructed by Trask and Gyrich in the United States. Acting under orders from Trask, the Sentinels rescued [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]] from [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], but Master Mold then declared that he was "giving the orders now." Master Mold had plans to kidnap world leaders from around the world and replace their brains with computers so that the world would fall under his control. Master Mold had concluded that mutants were humans, and therefore, humans must be protected from themselves. He planned to bring order and peace to the world in accordance with his programming to protect humans from mutants. [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] destroyed Master Mold's body by flying an explosive-filled [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] into the robot's chest, escaping at the last minute. However, Master Mold's head survived and planned on rebuilding a new, stronger body, while also placing Xavier under his control. He was finally destroyed by [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]].

* The Sentinels appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' episode "The Mutant Agenda". They are seen in a [[Danger Room]] simulation. [[Spider-Man]] accidentally activated the simulation when he visited the X-Men seeking help from Professor X with his recent mutation.

* In the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated series, there is originally only one Sentinel, a prototype created by [[Bolivar Trask]], in this series a former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, and to Trask's dismay, released in public by Magneto to force the X-Men to fight it and reveal the existence of mutants to the media. These Sentinels are much more powerful and heavily armed than their comic book counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Trask's prototype alone was a dangerous challenge, even for the combined might of the X-Men and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]]. Three upgraded Sentinels are later used by S.H.I.E.L.D. against [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and prove a difficult fight for him. The series finale hinted at Nimrod appearing later in the show's timeline leading a new fleet of Sentinels.

* Sentinels have appeared in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. A new type of Sentinel called the Prowler (a scorpion-like machine reminiscent of the [[Spider-Slayer]]s of the Spider-Man franchise) is the first Sentinel that was introduced. In "Thieves Gambit", the Mark I Sentinel is seen being constructed in the background. In "Future X", during a scene set in the future, the Sentinels hunt down mutants to replicate their powers mechanically and to evolve. In "Badlands", Sentinels called Trackers (based on Wolverine) are produced and able to use laser claws and can heal themselves. The Sentinels are controlled by [[Master Mold]].

* Sentinels appear in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Days, Nights and Weekends of Future Past! (Six Againest Infinity Part 2)", voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. In this version, they were created in an alternate reality's future where they were created to defend a superhero-less city.

* A Sentinel appeared in a Danger Room simulation in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''.

* A Sentinel appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Game Over" as part of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s Madland game. Because it was a real Sentinel, Spider-Man took control of it and used it and itsfirepower to cheat through Arcade's levels.

===Films===
* Sentinels appeared in an early draft of the first [[X-Men (film)|X-Men film]], wherein Henry Peter Gyrich and Bolivar Trask attacked the X-Men with the Sentinels, but this treatment didn't make it past the concept stage. Sentinels were planned for inclusion in the second ''X-Men'' film, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', but they did not appear onscreen (although Project Wideawake is mentioned on a computer readout screen). Sketches for the film versions of the Sentinels appear as extras on the ''X2'''s [[DVD]] release. The Sentinels' height wasn't specified, but the sketches indicated that although their appearance was not severely altered, the film version had the ability to compact itself into a rolling saucer as a mode of transportation. Recently, Sentinels appeared in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]''. The Sentinels featured in the game appear to be similar to those from the game ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''. There are two types of Sentinels: one is a smaller, aerial model; and the other is a giant walking behemoth.

* In ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', a simulation of a Sentinel was used in the Danger Room for Professor Xavier's mutant students to train and fight against. At the end of the session, [[Fastball Special|Colossus throws Wolverine]] at the robot and he beheads it. The only part of the Sentinel ever made visible to the viewer is its decapitated head, while the rest is shrouded in fog.

* The Sentinels will be featured in the upcoming ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' film.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=99760]</ref>

===Video games===
Sentinels have appeared as major antagonists in almost every [[video game]] to feature the X-Men. In most games, the Sentinels are human-sized foes rather than the massive figures that are seen in most of their comic book appearances:

* In the [[X-Men (arcade game)|''X-Men'' arcade game]], where they served as the bulk of enemies.

* In ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', they were featured enemies in Cyclops' levels.

* In ''[[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]]'', Sentinels appear as [[boss (video games)|bosses]] in Genosha, with varying sizes.

* A robot resembling a Sentinel also appears in both the arcade and SNES versions of ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]''. In the game, it is not called a 'Sentinel', but instead, is referred to simply as 'Robot'.

* In ''[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]'', in the second level (the first level after the title screen), sentinels appear in the background, as the level is set in a high-tech factory that produces sentinels.

[[File:Xm-coa.png|right|200px|thumb|Sentinel (right) fights ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' in the 1994's arcade game ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''.]]
* A non-standard 10' tall Sentinel is a [[player character|playable character]] in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''.

* In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'', the same Sentinel from ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' makes another appearance as a playable character. In ''Marvel vs. Capcom 2'', it is considered by many players to be the most powerful character in the game,<ref>[http://www.shoryuken.com/wiki/index.php/Marvel_vs_Capcom_2#Tier-list_.28Over-all_Value_to_Team.29 Marvel vs Capcom 2 - Shoryuken Wiki]</ref> largely due to its powerful combos and semi-infinites, as well as having the largest life meter in the game. It was also featured as a secret partner assist in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]''.

* Sentinels appear in Cyclops' intro in ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy]]''. In it, they hunt for mutants in the streets of New York City. One Sentinel nearly kills a baby by stepping on it, but [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] tears off one of the Sentinel's legs, making it fall.

* Sentinels are seen in Cyclops/Spider-Man's level in ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy 2]]''. They are shown in the background, patrolling the skies of New York City, hunting for mutants.

* In ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]'', Bastion is the main boss character, who is also unlockable as a playable character. A male Prime Sentinel and a female Prime Sentinel are both available as playable characters.

* In ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', they are the game's primary antagonists. There are several versions of the Sentinels in this game:
** Sentinel Alpha uses rockets, gas, punches, and a palm beam
** A Sentinel with rockets, eye beams, punch, stomp, and a bomb (this version has shoulder pads like Sentinel Squad ONE)
** A Sentinel Controller with eye beams, punch, stomp, an enhanced version of the palm beam, rockets, and a wave that nullifies mutant powers (this version has a blue head and its body is blue and purple)
** A Sentinel Weapons Platform in the shape of a purple spider with green blasters, which can bash and use a green wave that reverses the controls
** A Sentinel Advanced (based on the Prime Sentinel) with freeze beam, orange blasters, punch, groundquake (with fist), and a rush.

* In ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', the Sentinels are shown assisting with the evacuation after Apocalypse devastates New York City. Bastion later turns them on the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. After Bastion is defeated, the Sentinels resume their evacuation duties.

* In ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' (which fills the gap between [[X2 (film)|X2]] and [[X-Men: The Last Stand]]), Sentinels are part of [[William Stryker]]'s back-up plan if his plan to eliminate all mutants with the Dark Cerebro failed. Stryker would have mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels to track down and kill all mutants they could find.

* In [[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' video game]], the Sentinel Mark I is one of the major bosses of the game. While infiltrating the headquarters of [[Project Wideawake|Project: Wideawake]] to find his old teammate [[John Wraith]], Wolverine encounters two full-sized Sentinels, destroying a half-finished Sentinel with a Sentinel hand-weapon and defeating the other one in a prolonged confrontation. 

* A Sentinel is a playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', with [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] reprising his role.  Sentinel has then appeared again in the updated version of the game ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3]]''. The Sentinel's character ending has the Sentinel uploading Master Mold's program on [[Galactus]]' worldship, with the Sentinel's planning not only the destruction of mutants but mankind as well and shows several new Sentinel models sporting a design similar to Galactus himself.  

* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men Destiny]]''. The player must defeat a Sentinel before they can challenge the final boss and main antagonist Luis Reyes.

* The Sentinels appear in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''. The Sentinels are made up of the Coeus Sentinels, the Crius Sentinels, the Cronus Sentinels, the Hyperion Sentinels, the Iapetos Sentinels, the Phoebe Sentinels, the Rhea Sentinels, and the Themis Sentinel. A Salvaged Sentinel is an opponent for the players on the tutorial level. The Brotherhood of Mutants have also included their own versions of Sentinels called the M-Series Rho MK III, the M-Series Sigma MK III, and the M-Series MK III. In a Spec-Ops mission revolving around the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] was hired by the Hellfire Club to build them Sentinels that obey their every command.

* The Sentinels appear in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]''.

* Destroyed parts of Sentinels (including arms, legs, heads and a boot) appear in the ''[[Deadpool (video game)|Deadpool]]'' game.

* The Sentinels appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''<ref>[https://twitter.com/JoeMooreDesign/status/358357245752385536]</ref> voiced by [[Stephen Stanton]]. The player can fight three different Sentinels across New York City, beating one of which unlocks a Mini-Sentinel to play as.

===Toys===
Several different toys of Sentinels have been made since their introduction. One is the [[X-Men Classics]] 10" Sentinel by Toybiz. A "Build-A-Figure" version of the character was made in wave ten of the ''[[Marvel Legends]]'' line. The most recent Sentinel toy is made by Hasbro as part of the Marvel Universe line. Along with a large, unposeable statue, two [[Minimates]] figures have been made of the Sentinels. The first, a classic version, came with [[Rachel Summers]] in either her Phoenix or Marvel Girl guises. The second, based on ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', comes with a red-haired "First Appearance" figure of [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]].

===Parodies===
* On the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', the episode "Sausage Fest" showed a [[parody]] of the X-Men being killed by a Sentinel, and [[Professor X]] then recruiting the cast of the [[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]] films to replace them. The Sentinel eventually kicks them far as Professor X quotes "Same time next week." The Sentinel nods yes.

* In an episode of ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]] ''entitled "Operation S.A.F.E.T.Y", an ambassador for children's health decided to build many giant robots to prevent children from playing harmful games. The main robot (which is a parody of [[Master Mold]]) decided to capture adults (because they could harm kids) and take over the world.

* ''[[Mad (magazine)|MAD Magazine]]'''s X-Men parody "ECH!-Men" featured a Sentinel (called "Sentinent") with a huge posterior.
