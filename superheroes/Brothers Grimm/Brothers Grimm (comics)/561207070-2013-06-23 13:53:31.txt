'''The Brothers Grimm''' are two sets of [[Character (arts)|fictional]] twin [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s, owned by [[Marvel Comics]] and existing in that company's [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
The first appearance of the first Brothers Grimm came in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #3. These were a pair of identical, magically animated mannequins created by doll collector Nathan Dolly (also known as '''Mister Doll''') and his wife Priscilla. During their initial appearances only one was ever seen at a time and the singular identity, Brother Grimm was used instead of their true plural name. After three return appearances in ''Spider-Woman'', they perished in issue #12.

The second Brothers Grimm appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #188. They would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known super-villains in a group called the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]].

Mister Doll was a criminal who could mystically harm a person by harming a doll whose features he could reshape to resemble the victim's.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #48</ref> Later, in the process of creating the Brothers Grimm dolls, Nathan's consciousness was trapped simultaneously inside both doll mannequins. These mannequins mailed themselves to Nathan's wife Priscilla and transferred their life forces into two life size versions.<ref name="SW12"/> She named them Jake and William (after the historical [[Brothers Grimm]]), and believed them to be her sons, a delusion which they played along with.<ref name="SW12"/>

The "brothers" had sharply opposed personalities, rarely could come to agreement, and as such pursued separate criminal careers. William, though timid and shy in his civilian personality, was a flamboyant, confrontational jokester in his Brother Grimm guise. After debuting with a robbery of a theatre, he pursued the more lucrative pursuit of stealing from diamond merchants. In contrast, Jake was flirtatious in his civilian identity but cold and dispassionate as Brother Grimm, preferring less publicly visible crimes such as extortion. He was also less skilled with his abilities than William; while William was able to consistently defeat Spider-Woman, Jake was defeated in both his confrontations with her, and William had to free him from prison.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #3-4</ref> William was later hired by Pyrotechnics to capture Spider-Woman, and succeeded.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #7</ref>

Priscilla planned to use her [[occult]] knowledge to transfer Nathan's mind from the mannequins to a living human body.<ref name="SW12"/> To this end, Jake abducted Jerry Hunt to use for the body, and William captured Spider-Woman to coerce [[Magnus the Sorcerer]] to perform the transfer.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #11</ref> Spider-Woman pulled Hunt out of the spell at the last moment, and Nathan's consciousness dispersed.<ref name="SW12">''Spider-Woman'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both pairs of Brothers Grimm had powers which were somehow related to the Brothers Grimm mannequins built by Nathan Dolly.  Both pairs of Brothers Grimm possess the ability to conjure, with the appearance of [[sleight of hand]], a variety of small novelty items from within their costumes. Each of these items has a unique offensive capability; long strands of nearly unbreakable thread, corrosive filled eggs, pies filled with blackbirds, paralytic "stardust", fast-growing bean seeds, and many others have been used. They could also emit poisonous smoke from their hands. They could fly by means of floating five-pointed "stars" and small cloud banks which are somehow solid enough to stand on.
