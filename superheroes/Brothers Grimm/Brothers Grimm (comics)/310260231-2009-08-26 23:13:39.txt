'''The Brothers Grimm''' are two sets of [[Character (arts)|fictional]] twin [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s, owned by [[Marvel Comics]] and existing in that company's [[Marvel Universe]].

==First Pair==
The first appearance of the first Brothers Grimm came in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #3.  These were a pair of identical, magically animated mannequins created by doll collector Nathan Dolly (also known as '''Mister Doll''') and his wife Priscilla.  During their initial appearances only one was ever seen at a time and the singular identity, Brother Grimm was used instead of their true plural name.

===Fictional character biography===
Mister Doll was a criminal who could mystically harm a person by harming a doll whose features he could reshape to resemble the victim's.<ref>Tales of Suspense #48</ref>

Later, in the process of creating the Brothers Grimm dolls, Nathan's consciousness is trapped simultaneously inside both doll mannequins.  They are used by Nathan's wife Priscilla to power a pair of life size versions. She names them Jake and William (the names are a take on the [[Brothers Grimm]]), treats them as if they are her sons, and they in turn completely believe this to be true.

Priscilla's plan is to use her [[occult]] knowledge to transfer Nathan's mind from the mannequins to a living human body.  These efforts are stopped by Spider-Woman, and Nathan's consciousness disperses.<ref>Spider-Woman #12</ref>

==Second pair==
The second Brothers Grimm appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #188. They would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known super-villains in a group called the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]]. 

===Fictional character biography===
Twin brothers, Percy and Barton Grimes are born in [[Fresno, California]].  They work as realtors, and while exploring a theatre they own, they find the original Brothers Grimm mannequins.  On a whim, they decide to try the costumes on and become gifted with the powers of the original pair. As the Brothers Grimm, they terrorize a restaurant belonging to a business rival, and then battle [[War Machine|Iron Man II]].  [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] deduced their true civilian identities, and the police arrest the brothers.<ref>''Iron Man'' #187-188</ref>

The Brothers Grimm later became professional criminals, and join the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]], and team with [[Captain America]] against the [[Power Broker]] and his augmented mutates.<ref>''Captain America'' #330-331</ref> With the rest of the Night Shift, the Brothers test [[Moon Knight]] to take over as their leader.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3</ref> Alongside the Night Shift, they next battle the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #40</ref> The Brothers Grimm then attack [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in order to collect the reward being paid by [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] to the first person who delivered to him Hawkeye's arm. Alongside Crossfire, [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]], [[Bobcat (comics)|Bobcat]], [[Razor Fist]], [[Bullet Biker]], and the [[Death-Throws]], the Brothers battle Hawkeye, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #22, 24-25</ref>

During the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]", the Brothers Grimm are freed from prison by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]].  They battle a cosmic-powered [[Spider-Man]] and are defeated.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #159</ref> Alongside [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], [[Trapster]], and [[Erik Josten|Goliath IV]], the Brothers are hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to kill Spider-Man.  They are then tricked into attacking the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #64-65</ref> Alongside Mockingbird and the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], they help the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] defeat a street gang.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #87</ref>

The Brothers then briefly rejoin the Night Shift, under the leadership of the new [[Hangman (Marvel Comics)#Jason Roland|Hangman]], and the Night Shift's powers are increased by [[Satannish]].  They battle the Avengers West Coast again, but are defeated.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #76-79</ref>

The Brothers are later depicted as prisoners in the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]], a high security prison for costumed criminals, and escape.<ref>''Spider-Man: Breakout''</ref>.

===Post-Civil War===
The Brothers Grimm are later hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>New Avengers #35</ref> They are later captured by Nighthawk and Gargoyle and sent back to jail.

In [[Secret Invasion]], the Brothers Grimm appear as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes; the grouping is intent on defeating the [[Skrull]] invasion force of New York City.<ref>"[[Secret Invasion]]" #6</ref>They are later seen as part of the Hood's criminal gang that is sent by Norman Osborn to attack the New Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

Brothers Grimm are seen to be among the new recruits for [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref> Tigra beats Percy severely,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26</ref> and leaves a note for his brother reading, "You're next."<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both pairs of Brothers Grimm had powers which were somehow related to the Brothers Grimm mannequins built by Nathan Dolly.  Both pairs of Brothers Grimm possess the ability to conjure, with the appearance of [[sleight of hand]], a variety of small novelty items from within their costumes. Each of these items has a unique offensive capability; long strands of nearly unbreakable thread, corrosive filled eggs, pies filled with blackbirds, paralytic "stardust", fast-growing bean seeds, and many others have been used. They could also emit poisonous smoke from their hands. They could fly by means of floating five-pointed "stars" and small cloud banks which are somehow solid enough to stand on.
