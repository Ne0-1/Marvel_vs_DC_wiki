'''The Brothers Grimm''' are two sets of twin [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] super-villains who are owned by [[Marvel Comics]] whose adventures take place in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==First Pair==
The first appearance of the first Brothers Grimm came in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #3.  These were a pair of magically animated mannikins that were created by doll collector Nathan Dolly and his wife Priscilla.  During their initial appearances only one was ever seen at a time and the singular identity, Brother Grimm was used instead of their true plural name.

In the creation process Nathan's consciousness is trapped inside the doll sized figures that he creates first.  They are used by Nathan's wife Priscilla to power a pair of life size versions. She names them Jake and William (the names are a take on the [[Brothers Grimm]]), treats them as if they are her sons, and they in turn completely believe this to be true.

Priscilla's plan is to use her [[occult]] knowledge to transfer Nathan's mind from the mannikins to a living human body.  These efforts are stopped by Spider-Woman, and Nathan's consciousness disperses.

==Second pair==
The second Brothers Grimm appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' (first series) #188. They would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known super-villains in a group called the [[Night Shift (comics)|the Night Shift]].  Since this point the Brothers Grimm have not had an appearance without the other members of the Night Shift.

Twin brothers, Percy and Barton Grimes were born in [[Fresno, California]].  They find the original Brothers Grimm mannikins and decide to try the costumes on. The pair become gifted with the powers of the original pair and use them to commit crimes.

==Powers==
Both pairs of Brothers Grimm possess the ability to conjure, with the appearance of [[sleight of hand]], a variety of small items. Each of these items has a unique offensive capabilty; corrosive filled eggs, pies filled with blackbirds, and many others have been used.
