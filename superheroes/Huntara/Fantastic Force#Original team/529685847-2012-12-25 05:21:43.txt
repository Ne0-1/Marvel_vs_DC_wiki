'''Fantastic Force''' was a [[superhero]] team in the [[Marvel Universe]], a spin-off of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The team had its own title, which lasted for eighteen issues from November 1994 to April 1996. The title was revived for a miniseries involving a new team in April, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.comics.ign.com/objects/143/14331922.html |title=Fantastic Force Vol. 2 at IGN |publisher=Au.comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=11482 |title=Fantastic Force (2009) #1 &#124; Comic Books &#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>

==Original Team==
Rumours started circulating in the early 1990s that the [[Fantastic Four]] was to be cancelled and a new title called Fantastic Force launched in its place. At the time the rumors were false, however the [[Editor-In-Chief]] of [[Marvel Comics]], [[Tom Defalco]] decided that due to the amount of traction the rumor had gained that they should create a new [[comicbook]] with the same title.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20862 Ahearne Populates Nu-World with "Fantastic Force"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 17, 2009</ref>

A creative team was brought together, however after it disbanded due to creative differences,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Tom Brevoort]] and [[Mike Kanterovich]] wrote the new book while [[Dante Bastianoni]]. It launched in November, 1994 as a spinoff book to [[Fantastic Four]] rather than as a replacement.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/02/15/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-90/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #90 |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>

The founding members of the original team were:
* '''Psi-Lord''' ([[Franklin Richards]]) was the leader, son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Invisible Woman]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]
* '''Huntara''' (Tara Richards), Franklin Richards's aunt from an [[alternate future]], armed with a scythe that enabled her to open interdimensional portals
* '''Vibraxas''', a [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakandan]] with the power to generate vibratory force
* '''Devlor''', an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] who could transform into a large ape-like creature

Vibraxas later became a supporting character in the ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' volume 2.

Fantastic Force was funded by the Black Panther, who also served as an unofficial member of the team, joining them in the field on occasion. For a short time the Human Torch became team leader.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} Eventually Huntara left the group for another dimension,{{Issue|date=August 2010}} and her slot on the team was filled by [[She-Hulk]].{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

===The Initiative===
Huntara was considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Battle Damage Report]]''.

==New series==
The new miniseries in 2009 followed the exploits of a group formerly known as "[[The New Defenders]]". This team were the last superheroes of a bleak future who brought the remaining members of the human race to the present day where they settled on Nu Earth, an artificial copy of Earth. This group first appeared in the storyline "Death of The Invisible Woman" featured in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #558-562.  This team includes a descendant of Bruce Banner/Hulk and a future version of [[Old Man Logan#The Hooded Man|Wolverine]] as well as a number of less recognizable characters.  There are possible connections between the future from which these characters emerged and the one seen in the Wolverine story ''[[Old Man Logan]]''.
