'''Fantastic Force''' was a [[superhero]] team in the [[Marvel Universe]], a spin-off of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The team had its own title, which lasted for eighteen issues from November 1994 to April 1996.

==Members==
The founding members of the team were:
* '''Psi-Lord''' ([[Franklin Richards]]) was the leader, son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Invisible Woman]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]
* '''Huntara''' (Tara Richards), Franklin Richards's aunt from an [[alternate future]], armed with a scythe that enabled her to open interdimensional portals
* '''Vibraxas''', a [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakandan]] with the power to generate vibratory force
* '''Devlor''', an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] who could transform into a large ape-like creature

With the exception of Franklin Richards, all of the other founding members of Fantastic Force were not well-known and have remained relatively obscure{{Fact|date=May 2009}}, although Vibraxas later became a supporting character in the ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' volume 2.

Fantastic Force was funded by the Black Panther, who also served as an unofficial member of the team, joining them in the field on occasion.  Eventually Huntara left the group for another dimension, and her slot on the team was filled by [[She-Hulk]].

===The Initiative===
Huntara was considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''[[Civil War: Battle Damage Report]]''.

==New series==
A new Fantastic Force series is in production as of April 2009.<ref>http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=11482</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20862 Ahearne Populates Nu-World with “Fantastic Force”], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 17, 2009</ref> It follows the exploits of a group formerly known as "[[The New Defenders]]", the last superheroes of a bleak future, who have brought the remaining members of the human race to the present day, and have settled them on Nu-Earth, an artificial copy of Earth. This group first appeared in the storyline "Death of The Invisible Woman" featured in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #558-562.  This team includes a descendant of Bruce Banner/Hulk and a future version of [[Old_Man_Logan#The_Hooded_Man|Wolverine]] as well as a number of less recognizable characters.  There are possible connections between the future from which these characters emerged and the one seen in the Wolverine story ''[[Old Man Logan]]''.
