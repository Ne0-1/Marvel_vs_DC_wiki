'''Fantastic Force''' was a [[superhero]] team in the [[Marvel Universe]], a spin-off of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The team had its own title, which lasted for eighteen issues from November 1994 to April 1996.

The founding members of the team were:
* '''[[Franklin Richards]]''', as Psi-Lord, was the leader, son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Invisible Woman]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]; character roughly corresponded to Mister Fantastic
* '''Huntara''', Franklin Richards's aunt from an [[alternate future]], armed with a scythe that enabled her to open interdimensional portals; character roughly corresponded to Invisible Woman
* '''Vibraxas''', a [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakandan]] with the power to generate vibratory force; character roughly corresponded to the [[Human Torch]]
* '''Devlor''', an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] who could transform into a large ape-like creature; character roughly corresponded to the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]

With the exception of Franklin Richards, all of the other founding members of Fantastic Force were not well-known and have remained relatively obscure, although Vibraxas later became a supporting character in the ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' volume 2.

Fantastic Force was funded by the Black Panther, who also served as an unofficial member of the team, joining them in the field on occasion.  Eventually Huntara left the group for another dimension, and her slot on the team was filled by [[She-Hulk]].

===The Initiative===
Huntara is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.
