'''Dawnstar''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]] of the 30th Century, a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Dawnstar is her real name (she had no Legion code name), and she is from Starhaven, a planet colonized from Earth in the 23rd Century. Her name is derived from the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], the '[[morning star]]'. This is why Dawnstar wears an eight-pointed star ornament on her forehead. 

Dawnstar is of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] heritage, although no specific [[tribe]] was ever linked with her. Her costume was light yellow, with long fringed sleeves, a plunging back and neckline, and fringed boots. She has long, straight black hair, full lips, high cheekbones, and brown eyes. Her skin was colored in the salmon hue commonly used for American Indian comic-book characters.

Dawnstar's unique powers include the ability to track life forms and objects across light years of distance and through interstellar space. She can survive in deep space for long periods of time without a spacesuit or oxygen. Dawnstar and other Starhavenites have pairs of large, white-feathered wings that grow out of their upper backs, the result of genetic engineering. In deep space, she can travel at faster-than-light speeds. In an Earth-normal atmosphere or in a sizable gravity well, her speed is diminished. She wears a Legion flight ring to signal for help, for monitoring of her location, and for other non-flight uses.

Dawnstar's parents are Mistrider and Moonwalker, and her younger brothers are Greybird and Greatfire. During her late childhood and early teens, her parents built a thriving business on their daughter's abilities. Dawnstar would guide spaceships through hazardous areas of space.

Dawnstar received an invitation to attend the Legion Academy, and reluctantly accepted the opportunity. She first appeared in ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #226 at age 16 as a recent graduate of the Legion Academy. Her tracking and navigation talents earned her membership on her first mission. Her Legion stipend went to pay for enhancing her home world's defenses.

Dawnstar had a lengthy, tragic romance with fellow Legionnaire [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]]. They each respected the other's defiant, outspoken personality, although they each counseled each other on working with their talents as part of a team instead of acting as individuals. Wildfire was an anti-energy being in a containment suit, and thus had no physical body. When he briefly was able to partially reverse this, they attempted a physical relationship, but were unsuccessful.

In the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' v4 series, Dawnstar was possessed by an evil entity called [[Bounty (comics)|Bounty]] who amputated her wings and forced her to use her tracking powers as an assassin. Dawnstar was later freed from the Bounty entity's control. The storyline was never resolved, as her timeline was erased by the events depicted in [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].

In post-Zero Hour continuity, Dawnstar has not appeared. There is a character called [[Shikari]] from another non-human race, the Kwai, who has pathfinding powers of similar scope, and who has insectoid wings. Some Legion fans believe that Shikari is the post-reboot Dawnstar, but this was denied by various Legion writers.
