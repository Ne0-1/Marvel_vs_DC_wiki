'''Dawnstar''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]] of the 30th Century, a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Dawnstar is her real name (she has no Legion code name), and she is from [[Starhaven]], a planet colonized from Earth in the 23rd Century. Her name is derived from the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], the "[[morning star]]." This is why Dawnstar wears an eight-pointed star ornament on her forehead. 

Dawnstar is of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] heritage, although no specific [[tribe]] was ever linked with her. Her original and long-standing costume is light yellow, with long fringes on sleeves and crotch, a plunging back and neckline, and fringed boots. She has long, straight black hair, full lips, high cheekbones, and brown eyes. Her skin was colored in the salmon hue commonly used for American Indian comic-book characters.

Dawnstar's unique powers include the ability to track life forms and objects across light years of distance and through interstellar space. She can survive in deep space for long periods of time without a spacesuit or oxygen. Dawnstar and other Starhavenites have pairs of large, white-feathered wings that grow out of their upper backs, the result of genetic engineering. In deep space, she can travel at faster-than-light speeds. In an Earth-normal atmosphere or in a sizable gravity well, her speed is diminished. She wears a Legion flight ring to signal for help, for monitoring of her location, and for other non-flight uses.

Dawnstar's parents are Mistrider and Moonwalker, and her younger brothers are Greybird and Greatfire. During her late childhood and early teens, her parents built a thriving business on their daughter's abilities. Dawnstar would guide spaceships through hazardous areas of space.

Dawnstar received an invitation to attend the Legion Academy, and reluctantly accepted the opportunity. She first appeared in ''Superboy [and the Legion of Super-Heroes]'' #226 at age 16 as a recent graduate of the Legion Academy. Her tracking and navigation talents earned her membership on her first mission. Her Legion stipend went to pay for enhancing her home world's defenses.

She served in many missions with the Legionnaires, contributing her often underrated talents at tracking and high-speed travel to perform many rescues of her colleagues, as well as investigations of personal disappearances and similar mysteries. She brought these talents into many Legion adventures in other times, especially the 20th Century. Notable here is her early role in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

Dawnstar had a lengthy, tragic romance with fellow Legionnaire [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]]. They each respected the other's defiant, outspoken personality, although they each counseled each other on working with their talents as part of a team instead of acting as individuals. Wildfire was an anti-energy being in a containment suit, and thus had no physical body. When he briefly was able to partially reverse this, they attempted a physical relationship, but were unsuccessful.

In the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' v4 series, Dawnstar was possessed by an evil entity called Bounty who amputated her wings and forced her to use her tracking powers as an assassin. Dawnstar was later freed from the Bounty entity's control. The storyline was never resolved, as her timeline was erased by the events depicted in [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].

In post-Zero Hour continuity, Dawnstar has not appeared. Before the current [[Reboot (continuity)|rebooted]] ''LSH'' story line (volume 5), a character was depicted called [[Shikari Lonestar|Shikari]] from another non-human race, the Kwai, who had pathfinding powers of similar scope and insectoid wings. Some Legion fans believed that Shikari was a post-Zero-Hour Dawnstar, but this was denied by various Legion writers.

== Return? ==
''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (v5) #15 (February 2006) featured a Barry Kitson cover which depicted Dawnstar alongside classic Legion members [[Blok (comics)|Blok]] and [[Tyroc]]. The solicitation for this issue hinted that the Legion would become the "greatest heroes of the Multiverse."

The solicitation and cover turned out to be misleading. The Dawnstar character turns up only in a series of "campfire stories" told by groupie fans of the characters of the current Legion (primarily written by Mark Waid and drawn by Kitson). It was a fill-in issue between larger story lines, and it didn't suggest that Dawnstar will be reintroduced in that title anytime soon.

The recent ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' relaunch, (v3) #1 (December 2006), featured a page that previewed the coming storylines for the entire year of 2007. The second of these appeared to show Dawnstar's arm, wings and Legion ring, along with a text balloon of her pledging to track down [[Starman (comics)#New Starman|Starman]].

In a ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' [http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002650576.cfm interview], writer Geoff Johns confirmed that this was indeed Dawnstar's arm, and that <blockquote>"You'll see this [followed up on] very, very soon. All of these [scenes] take place in the first year, but this one is coming very soon."</blockquote>

In an [http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/JSA/JohnsJSA3.html interview on Newsarama] on the same subject, when asked if Starman's earlier comments in the issue that there is a "star" on [[Thanagar]] and that "She's looking for [him]" had a link with the Legionnaire, Johns answered:
<blockquote>"Like I said, no line is a throwaway line in this book. And also, who else would be able to blend in and not be noticed on Thanagar?"</blockquote>
