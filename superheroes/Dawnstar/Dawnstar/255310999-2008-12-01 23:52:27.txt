'''Dawnstar''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]] of the 30th and 31st centuries, a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  Dawnstar is her real name (she has no Legion code name), and she is from Starhaven, a planet colonized from Earth in the 23rd century.  Her name is derived from the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], the "[[morning star]]."  This is why Dawnstar wears an eight-pointed star ornament on her forehead.  Dawnstar is of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] heritage, although no specific [[tribe]] was ever linked with her.

== Character biography ==

Dawnstar's unique powers include the ability to track life forms and objects across light years of distance and through interstellar space.  She can survive in deep space for long periods of time without a spacesuit or oxygen.  Dawnstar and other Starhavenites have pairs of large, white-feathered wings that grow out of their upper backs, the result of genetic engineering.  In deep space, she can travel at faster-than-light speeds.  In an Earth-normal atmosphere or in a sizable gravity well, her speed is diminished.  She wears a Legion flight ring to signal for help, for monitoring of her location, and for other non-flight uses.

Dawnstar's parents are Mistrider and Moonwalker, and her younger brothers are Greybird and Greatfire.  During her late childhood and early teens, her parents built a thriving business on their daughter's abilities.  Dawnstar would guide spaceships through hazardous areas of space.

Dawnstar received an invitation to attend the Legion Academy, and reluctantly accepted the opportunity.  She first appeared in ''Superboy [and the Legion of Super-Heroes]'' #226 at age 16 as a recent graduate of the Legion Academy.  Her tracking and navigation talents earned her membership on her first mission.  Her Legion stipend went to pay for enhancing her home world's defenses.

She served in many missions with the Legionnaires, contributing her often underrated talents at tracking and high-speed travel to perform many rescues of her colleagues, as well as investigations of personal disappearances and similar mysteries.  She brought these talents into many Legion adventures in other times, especially the 20th Century.  Notable here is her early role in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

Dawnstar had a lengthy, tragic romance with fellow Legionnaire [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]].  They each respected the other's defiant, outspoken personality, although they each counseled each other on working with their talents as part of a team instead of acting as individuals.  Wildfire was an anti-energy being in a containment suit, and thus had no physical body.  When he briefly was able to partially reverse this, they attempted a physical relationship, but were unsuccessful.

Dawnstar was later freed from the Bounty entity's control.  The storyline was never resolved, as her timeline was erased by the events depicted in ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' and by the ensuing [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]].

Dawnstar did not appear in the reboot Legion stories, except for a crossover of multiple time lines and Legions in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #105.  Before the current, once-again-rebooted Legion storyline, a character was depicted called [[Shikari (comics)|Shikari]] from a non-human species, the Kwai, who had insectoid wings, an armored [[exoskeleton]] she could activate for space travel, and pathfinding (rather than tracking) powers of similar scope.  Some Legion fans believed that Shikari was intended to be a post-Zero-Hour Dawnstar, but this was denied by various Legion writers.

== Recent appearances ==

<!-- FAIR USE of DawnstarReturns.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:DawnstarReturns.jpg for rationale -->[[Image:DawnstarReturns.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Art by [[Ed Benes]] from "The Lightning Saga," ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #9]]''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 5) #15 (February 2006) featured a Barry Kitson cover which depicted Dawnstar alongside classic Legion members [[Blok (comics)|Blok]] and [[Tyroc]].  The solicitation for this issue hinted that the Legion would become the "greatest heroes of the Multiverse."

The solicitation and cover turned out to be misleading.  Dawnstar appears briefly with other Legionnaires from previous iterations of the team, as a character in a "campfire story" showing the Legion's influence and the urban legends and myths that had sprung up around it.  The appearance was a cameo, and does not appear to have been meant to take place in the series' [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].  Nor was it included in subsequent [[trade paperback]] collections.

In a ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]-[[Justice League of America|JLA]]'' crossover story, "[[The Lightning Saga]]," Dawnstar (along with many other [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] Legionnaires) is seen as a statue in [[Superman]]'s [[Fortress of Solitude]].  Several members of the JSA and JLA track Dawnstar's flight ring to [[Thanagar]], but she had left it as a promise to return to a woman strongly implied to be her lover.

Dawnstar, with her wings and original appearance, unites with other Legionnaires in the 21st Century in a still-mysterious effort to save someone's life (they hold rods that resemble those used for a similar action, to save [[Lightning Lad]], in the original [[Silver Age]] Legion stories).  Although it was predicted that at least one was risking his or her own life, no one dies, and the Legion contingent returns to the 31st Century.

<!-- FAIR USE of Dawnstar-Frank-FlightRings.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dawnstar-Frank-FlightRings.jpg for rationale -->[[Image:Dawnstar-Frank-FlightRings.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Art by [[Gary Frank]] from "Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes," ''Action Comics'' #859]]The Legion shown in this story also took part in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story, set in its own time and involving Superman, in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #858-863.  Dawnstar's outfit was extensively redesigned.

Dawnstar is now being depicted as part of a Pre-Crisis Legion — highly similar to the original, though not identical — that is known by Superman.  The stories taking place after the Legion's [[Superboy#The Legion's Superboy|Superboy]] died — and, later, was removed from the original Legion storyline — could now be considered either to have been erased or to take place in an alternate continuum to the "main" or "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Infinite Crisis|New Earth]]" DC Universe.  Either choice could explain a healthy and whole Dawnstar having been restored to the Legion.  What the editors ultimately intend in this respect, however, has not yet been made clear.

Dawnstar currently is shown with this Pre-Crisis Legion in the [[limited series]] ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]''.

==Other media==
Dawnstar appears in the second and final (2007-2008) season of the recent [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|animated Legion TV series]].  In the concluding two-part episode "Dark Victory," she is visible on three occasions standing or flying in the midst of a large group of Legionnaires.

Dawnstar also appears, but with dialogue and extensive action, in issue 19 (December 2008) of [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)#Legion Of Super Heroes In The 31st Century|the printed comic book]] based on the TV series (this book is planned to end with its issue #20).
