'''Martinex T'Naga''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from an [[alternate future]] version of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]].  Most of Martinex's adventures take place as a member of the 31st century [[Guardians of the Galaxy]].

==Fictional character biography==
In their future, [[Earth]] had colonized several planets in its [[solar system]], including [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]].  Martinex was born on Cerberus Center, Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of [[Africa]] on Earth.

He grew up to become a [[scientist]] and technician.  Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystalline in appearance.  This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world.  Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands.  Martinex became the last surviving Pluvian after the [[Badoon]] exterminated all the other Pluvians.  Martinex escaped the Badoon and teamed with [[Vance Astro]], a [[human]] [[astronaut]] from the 20th century, [[Charlie-27]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]], and [[Yondu]], from [[Alpha Centauri]], to fight the Badoon as the freedom fighters, the Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 1 #18</ref>

The Guardians later teamed with the time-traveling [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Captain America]], and [[Sharon Carter]] to retake New York City from Badoon forces.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #5</ref> Martinex and the Guardians then time-traveled to the 20th Century and met the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. They returned to the future with [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] and the Defenders and defeated the Badoon.<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #5; ''Defenders'' #26-29</ref>

Eventually, the Guardians drove the Badoon from Earth's solar system and Martinex later became the team's reluctant leader for a time. The Guardians departed post-war Earth on a space mission, and met [[Nikki (comics)|Nikki]] who joined the Guardians of the Galaxy, and they visited the Asylum planet.<ref>''Marvel Presents'' #3-5</ref> The Guardians then teamed with a time-traveling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and battled [[Korvac]] and his Minions of Menace.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #6</ref> Martinex and the Guardians traveled to the present era, and assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in battle against Korvac.<ref>''Avengers'' #167-168, 170, 177, 181</ref>

While looking for the [[Captain America's shield|shield]] of [[Captain America]], the Guardians came into conflict with Taserface and the [[Stark (species)|Stark]]. They also encountered [[Firelord]] and defeated the Stark.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #1-4</ref> The Guardians then battled a team of superhumans known as Force, and Martinex was mortally injured by the member of Force known as Brawl.  Much of the crystals that covered Martinex's body were shattered, but Martinex recovered with the help of fellow Guardian Starhawk.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #5-6</ref>  All of the exterior crystals on Martinex fell away, leaving Martinex with a new crystalline appearance, one that was less faceted, and somewhat purple in tone.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #7</ref> The Guardians then located Haven, a lost colony of Earth founded by [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], where they battled [[Rancor (comics)|Rancor]] and her lieutenants.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #8-11</ref> Martinex later met the [[Ghost Rider (comics)#The Spirit of Vengeance|Spirit of Vengeance]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13</ref>

Eventually, Martinex left the team to form a larger version of the Guardians, known as the Galactic Guardians. This team was summoned to help rescue an imperiled planet full of innocents. The Galactic Guardians were initially made up of alternate future versions of [[Wonder Man]], [[Firelord]], the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], Phoenix, and [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. They had further adventures in their own limited series. <ref>''Galactic Guardians'' #1-4</ref>. Martinex later returns to the Guardians of the Galaxy.  The adventures of Martinex and his fellow Guardians after the end of their 1990s self-titled series have yet to be revealed.

==Powers and abilities==
Martinex is a member of a genetically engineered offshoot of humanity whose traits were designed for survival under the cold conditions of the planet Pluto. He possesses enhanced strength, speed, and stamina, and superhuman durability. His epidermis is composed of a silicon-isotope organic crystal. Martinex has the ability to convert bodily energy into laser-like beams of energy which he can project from his hands. His right hand can project infrared energy, stimulating heat in any object. His left hand can project microwave energy that reduces thermal energies in objects, thereby producing coldness. His body is highly resistant to intense heat and cold as well as other conventional forms of injury. Martinex can only use his superhuman powers to project heat and cold at maximum output for up to one half hour before having to rest in order to replenish them.

Martinex has earned doctorates in physics and engineering. He possesses expertise in various areas of 31st Century technology, including computers and cyborg design.
