'''Martinex T'Naga''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Most of Martinex's adventures take place in an alternate future of [[Earth-616]]
as a member of the [[31st century]] [[Guardians of the Galaxy]].

In their future, [[Earth]] had colonized several planets in its [[solar system]], including [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]].  Martinex was born on Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of [[Africa]] on Earth.

He grew up to become a [[scientist]].  Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystaline in appearance.  This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world.  Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands.  Martinex became the last surviving Pluvian after the [[Badoon]] exterminated all the other Pluvians. Martinex escaped the Badoon and teamed with [[Vance Astro]], a [[human]] [[astronaut]] from the [[20th century]], [[Charlie 27]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]], and [[Yondu]], from [[Alpha Centauri]], to fight the Badoon as the Guardians of the Galaxy.  Eventually, the Guardians drove the Badoon from Earth and Martinex later became the team's reluctant leader.

While looking for the shield of [[Captain America]], the Guardians came into conflict with a team of superhumans known as Force.  Martinex was badly injured by a member of Force known as Brawl.  Much of the crystals that covered Martinex's body were shattered, but Martinex recovered with the help of fellow Guardian [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]].  All of the exterior crystals on Martinex fell away, leaving Martinex with a new crystaline appearance, one that was less faceted, and somewhat purple in tone.  

Eventually, Martinex left the team to form a larger version of the Guardians, known as the Galactic Guardians.  The Galactic Guardians were initially made up of alternate future versions of [[Wonder Man]], [[Firelord]], the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], and [[Ghost Rider]].  Martinex would later return to the Guardians of the Galaxy.  The adventures of Martinex and his fellow Guardians after the end of their [[1990s]] self-titled series have yet to be revealed.
