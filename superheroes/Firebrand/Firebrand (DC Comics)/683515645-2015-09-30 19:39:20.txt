==Rod Reilly==
[[File:Firebrand1.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Firebrand (Rod Reilly)<br>Cover to ''Police Comics'' #2 (September 1941)]]
Published by [[Quality Comics]] from August 1941 to November 1942, '''Rod Reilly''' was the bored and wealthy socialite son of a steel tycoon, who decided to fight crime with his servant and friend, "Slugger" Dunn.<ref name="dc-fire1">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Firebrand I | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 122  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>  Originally drawn by Reed Crandall, Firebrand appeared in ''Police Comics'', issues #1 through 13, at which time his series was canceled.  Firebrand's costume consisted of a transparent shirt and red pants, with a bandana mask covering the top half of his face.

After DC purchased Quality Comics, Firebrand was largely left on the sidelines until 1981, when DC collected most of their '40s characters into the [[All-Star Squadron]]. At this time it was [[retcon]]ned that Rod had been injured in the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], and replaced by his sister, Danette Reilly.  Rod Reilly later recovered and joined the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].<ref name="dc-free">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Freedom Fighters | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 131 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>  He was killed in a fight with the [[Silver Ghost (comics)#Silver Ghost|Silver Ghost]],<ref name="dc-fire1"/> but that occurred only in a photocopied issue of ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'', which was never released to public and thus unsure as to whether it is considered part of the current DC Universe. In ''Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.'' #12, it is strongly implied that Firebrand was killed by the [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dragon King]].<ref name="ss12">{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Geoff Johns]] | penciller=[[Lee Moder]] | inker=[[Dan Davis (comics)|Dan Davis]] | story=Dragon Food! | title=Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. | volume= 1| issue=12 | date=July 2000 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page= | panel= }}</ref>

In All-Star Squadron No. 5 (Vol. 2, 1981), Rod's sister Danette discovers that Rod is Firebrand while staying at his penthouse. Musing about Rod's relationship with his bodyguard, Slugger Dunn, she wonders "though what a confirmed bachelor playboy like my brother needed with a bodyguard, I never understood", and then finds a hidden closet that leads her to think that "from the look of these clothes, I didn't know my brother quite as well as I thought I did!"

===Powers and abilities===
An Olympic-level athlete and superb hand-to-hand combatant, Firebrand possesses no true super-powers, but he was personally trained by ex-heavyweight boxer "Slugger" Dunn to the height of physical perfection.

[[File:Firebrand (All-Star Squadron no. 5).jpg|thumb|left|145px|Firebrand (Danette Reilly)<br>From the cover to ''All-Star Squadron'' #5 (January 1982)]]
Volcanologist '''Danette Reilly''' is the sister of Rod Reilly, the first Firebrand.  First introduced in a special "All-Star Squadron" preview in ''Justice League of America'' #193 (August 1981), Danette was studying volcanos north of Hawaii in the 1940s when she was kidnapped by the [[time travel]]ling villain [[Per Degaton]] and one of the JSA foes he had pulled back in time, the powerful sorcerer [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]].  During her escape, she was struck by a bolt of lightning and fell into a pit of mystical lava.  The combination of the lightning and magic lava not only allowed her to survive, but to develop the power to control heat and project plasma blasts (first seen in ''All-Star Squadron #5'' (January 1982)). Her powers surfaced after she discovered her brother Rod's costume and put in on. As Rod had been injured during the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], Danette decided to become the new Firebrand.<ref name="dc-fire2">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Firebrand II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 122  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Due to Per Degaton going back to 1947 when he was defeated the All-Star Squadron forgot his attack. Originally she was quite [[racist]] towards the Japanese. However she visited her brother in hospital and he revealed he had been saved from death by a soldier whose parents were from Japan, and who later died from his wounds. Firebrand realized she had been racist and should show more respect towards those from Japan.

Danette appears in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], wherein she was briefly rejoined by her former lover, the reluctant supervillain [[Cyclotron (comics)|Cyclotron]].  Cyclotron, although deceased, phased into her time to assist her.  Danette assumed partial custody of his daughter Terri, along with fellow hero the [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]]. This makes her technically the godmother of Terri's son, [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]]. Her later adventures during [[World War II]] have thus far been unchronicled.

After World War II ended, Danette assisted and later married the [[Shining Knight]] (Sir Justin).  Together they faced the Dragon King and Danette was apparently killed.<ref name="dc-fire2"/>

Her name is a homage to creator Roy Thomas' wife, Danette "Dann" Thomas.<ref>{{Citation  | last =Thomas  | first =Roy  | authorlink = Roy Thomas  | title =The All Star Squadron Chronicles Part III: Hail, Hail, Now the Gang's Really All Here!  | journal =Alter Ego  | volume =3  | issue =12  | pages =  | publisher =TwoMorrows Publishing  |date=January 2002  | url =http://twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/12a-ss.html  | doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 2007-04-30  | postscript =. }}</ref>

The [[Quality Comics]] heroine [[Wildfire (Golden Age)|Wildfire]] was originally intended to play a major role in the [[All-Star Squadron]] but DC objected on the basis of her name, which she shared with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] member. Instead, Danette Reily was introduced into the series.<ref>http://www.monitorduty.com/mag/fanzing37/feature1.shtml</ref>

Firebrand was ranked 67th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 45| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

Firebrand made a cameo appearance in the [[Young Justice: Invasion]] episode "Cornered."  She was depicted as a statue alongside other golden age heroes in the [[Hall of Justice]].
In yet another episode of [[Young Justice]], [[Young Justice]] "Humanity", it is revealed the she was secretly an android who was sent to infiltrate the league but was 'too heroic for her own good' causing her death.

==Alex Sanchez==
[[File:Firebrand1996.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover of Firebrand #1. Art by [[Sal Vellutto]].]] In February 1996, DC introduced a third Firebrand, former police detective '''Alejandro 'Alex' Sanchez'''. After nearly dying in an explosion that destroyed his apartment, Sanchez underwent experimental surgery to restore his mobility. The surgery was paid for by local philanthropist Noah Hightower, who later approached Sanchez with a special opportunity. Hightower offered Sanchez a suit of advanced armor which, when combined with the implants, would give Sanchez enhanced strength and speed for a period up to four hours. After Sanchez's partner was attacked during an investigation, he agreed to become the superhero Firebrand. In addition to enhanced strength, Sanchez's armor emits a greenish flame, giving him a demonic appearance.<ref name="dc-fire3">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Firebrand III | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 122  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Sanchez's tenure as Firebrand lasted only nine issues of his self-titled comic.  He reappeared in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA: Secret Files]]'' #2, where he is stabbed in the throat and apparently dies in [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette's]] underground gaming arena, the House, at the hands of a drugged [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] knight.

==Andre Twist==
[[File:Firebrand Jurgens.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Firebrand (Andre Twist)<br>''The Battle For Blüdhaven'' #2 (January 2006).<br>Art by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]].]]
The latest Firebrand, '''Andre Twist''', was introduced in ''[[Blüdhaven|The Battle for Blüdhaven]]''.  He gains control over fire after his exposure to [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] being dropped on the city.<ref name="dc-fire3"/>  He also appears in the limited series,  ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'', as a member of the new [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].  Andre carries a [[bo staff]], and has some measure of athletic and martial arts ability.  In ''[[Blüdhaven|The Battle for Blüdhaven]]'' #5, Andre hears a voice in his head, asking him to come to the Mississippi River and fight for liberty, claiming that Andre is pure of heart and will be his Firebrand.  The voice is that of [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]].

After joining forces with Uncle Sam, Andre is captured and tortured by [[Father Time (DC Comics)|Father Time]] after attacking [[United States Senate|senator]]/[[President of the United States|presidential candidate]] Henry Knight, who is really [[Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard]]. He is freed from captivity by [[Phantom Lady]], and joins the rest of the Freedom Fighters to recruit the new [[Black Condor]].<ref>''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #2</ref>

He and the rest of the Freedom Fighters manage to defeat Gonzo, and are offered positions as the new leaders of S.H.A.D.E.

In the 2007 Freedom Fighters series, Firebrand strikes up a relationship with [[Red Bee (comics)|Red Bee]], and is distraught when she had been taken over by an alien insectoid race. Together, the Freedom Fighters are able to save Red Bee, and repel the insectoid's invasion. However, in the 2010-2011 mini-series, Twist was first paralyzed during a fight and later killed in action.

==In other media==
* The Danette Reilly Firebrand appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Humanity", voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]. In the show, it is explained that Danette was an android created by [[T.O. Morrow]] in order to infiltrate the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] back in the 1930s. However, Danette overcame her programming and was damaged by [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dragon King]] after being hit by an energy blast meant for [[Jay Garrick|Flash]]. Decades later, she was rebuilt as '''Red Inferno''' and was ultimately destroyed after helping her siblings ([[Red Tornado]] and [[Red Torpedo]]) destroy [[Red Volcano]].
