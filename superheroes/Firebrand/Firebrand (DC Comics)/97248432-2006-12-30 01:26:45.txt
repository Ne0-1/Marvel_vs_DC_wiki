'''Firebrand''' is a name that has been used by multiple heroes by [[DC Comics]].

==Rod Reilly==

Published by [[Quality Comics]] from August, 1941 to November, 1942, '''Rod Reilly''' was the bored and wealthy socialite son of a steel tycoon, who decided to fight crime with his servant and friend, Slugger Dunn.  Originally drawn by Reed Crandall, Firebrand appeared in Police Comics, issues #1 through 13, at which time his series was canceled.  Firebrand's costume consisted of a transparent shirt and red pants, with a bandana mask covering the top half of his face.

After DC purchased Quality Comics, Firebrand was left on the sidelines until 1981, when DC collected most of their '40s characters into the [[All-Star Squadron]]. At this time, Rod was injured and replaced by his sister, Danette Reilly.  He later recovered and joined the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], dying in a fight with the [[Silver Ghost]]. 

In All-Star Squadron #5 (1981) writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons for Rod Reilly's sister, Danette, suggesting Rod had been involved in a homosexual relationship with Slugger Dunn. "Good old Slugger! He's been Rod's bodyguard -- and his friend -- for years now -- though what a confirmed bachelor playboy like my brother needed with a bodyguard I've never understood!" Immediately after, she finds several of his superhero costumes in a hidden closet and thinks "From the look of these clothes -- I didn't know my brother quite as well as I thought I did." 

Rod appears briefly in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

==Danette Reilly==

Vulcanologist '''Danette Reilly''' was studying volcanos north of Hawaii in the 1940s when she was kidnapped by [[Per Degaton]] and [[Wotan]].  During her escape, she was struck by a bolt of lightning and developed the abiilty to control fire with her hands. By then, Rod had been sidelined and his sister took over as Firebrand.  

Danette appears in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], wherein she was briefly rejoined by her former lover, the reluctant supervillain Cyclotron.  Cyclotron, although deceased, phased into her time to assist her.  Danette assumed partial custody of his daughter Terri, along with fellow hero the [[Al Pratt (comics)|Atom]]. Her later adventures during [[World War II]] have thus far been unchronicled.

After World War II ended, Danette assisted the [[Shining Knight]] (Sir Justin) on his quest to find the [[Holy Grail]].  They faced the [[Dragon King]] and Danette was apparently killed.

Her name appears to have been a homage to creator Roy Thomas' wife, Danette.

The [[Quality Comics]] heroine [[Wildfire (Golden Age)|Wildfire]] was originally intended to play a major role in the [[All-Star Squadron]] but DC objected on the basis of her name, which she shared with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] member. Instead, Danette Reily was introduced into the series. [http://www.monitorduty.com/mag/fanzing37/feature1.shtml]

==Alex Sanchez==
In February 1996, DC introduced a third Firebrand, former police detective '''Alexander 'Alex' Sanchez'''.  Sanchez's tenure as Firebrand lasted only nine issues of his self-titled comic.  He reappeared in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA: Secret Files]]'' #2, where he dies in [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette's]] underground gaming arena, the House, at the hands of a drugged [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] knight.

==Andre Twist==

Revealed in ''[[Blüdhaven|The Battle for Blüdhaven]]'', a new Firebrand named '''Andre Twist''' has emerged.  Gaining control over fire after his exposure to [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] being dropped on the city, he is a left leaning activist who is diplomatic enough with unsympathetic people until he feels he must take a stand.  He also appears in the limited series,  ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'', as a member of the new [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].  Andre carries a bo staff, and has some measure of athletic and martial arts ability.  In ''[[Blüdhaven|The Battle for Blüdhaven]]'' #5, Andre hears a voice in his head, asking him to come to the Mississippi River and fight for liberty, claiming that Andre is pure of heart and will be his Firebrand.  The voice is that of [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]].

After joining forces with Uncle Sam, Andre is captured and tortured by [[Father Time (DC Comics)|Father Time]] after attacking a [[United States Senate|senator]]/[[President of the United States|presidential candidate]]. He is freed from captivity by Phantom Lady, and joins the rest of the Freedom Fighters to recruit the new Black Condor <ref>''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #2</ref>.

His story is still ongoing.
