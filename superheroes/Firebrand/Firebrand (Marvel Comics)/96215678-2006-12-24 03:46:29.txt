'''Firebrand''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  A superpowered enforcer for corrupt [[industrialist]] [[Justin Hammer]], Firebrand is a former activist who turned to violence after believing peaceful protest produced no results.

==Biography==

Firebrand accidentally killed his own father.  He also won the [[Black Llama]]'s "war of the supervillains".  He fell to alcoholism and gave up political activism only to work for other villains because he "needed the work".  He later gave up his costumed identity and became a "supervillain agent", brokering employment for other costumed villains.  When news of the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]'s initial wave of supervillain murders spread among the criminal community, Gilbert took it upon himself to gather several costumed criminals for a meeting to determine what should be done about this menace.  The meeting, held at a tavern known among the criminal underworld as "The Bar With No Name", turned out to be a massacre, as Scourge infiltrated the event disguised as a bartender; a few minutes into the meeting, Scourge slaughtered every criminal present, including Gilbert, with machine gun fire.

After Gilbert's death, an unknown individual acquired a modified version of the Firebrand suit and was seen acting as the new fire-themed member of the environmental terrorist group known as the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]].
