==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Gary Gilbert wore a suit with an armored exoskeleton that gave him superhuman strength and resistance to fire. It also housed flamethrowers (which allowed him to fire thermal blasts from his hands), one mounted on each wrist, and flying jets that gave him the ability to fly.

Broxtel uses a modified version of the Firebrand suit.

Dennison was actually a mutated human being whose body temperature was up in the high hundreds. He could project heat rays of thousands of degrees. He was equipped with a cybernetic harness which could reconfigure itself into different modes if he mentally commanded it to do so.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Gary Gilbert version of Firebrand appeared in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' episode "Fire and Rain" voiced by [[Neal McDonough]]. This version of Firebrand is the son of the late ex-[[Stark Industries]] employee Simon Gilbert, who had stolen money from Stark and started a fire that killed Simon, which Gary blamed Tony Stark for. Firebrand was attacking power sources and demanding a ransom of a million dollars. After a series of arson upon power generators, Iron Man confronted Firebrand and had to use his Inferno Armor to confront him. With the lack of solar energy, Iron Man had a hard time stopping a dam that Firebrand detonated. A fragment of the dam hits Firebrand's jet pack causing him to fall into the flood. With Iron Man low on power, [[War Machine]] had to face his fear of water to rescue Iron Man and Firebrand. After diverting the flood, Iron Man and War Machine handed Firebrand over to the police as Firebrand still shouts for justice against Tony Stark.
* Firebrand appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode "World On Fire." This version is a fire spirit and the guardian of the 4th Makluan Ring located in the Temple of Temperance at the foot of [[Mt. Saint Helens]]. When James Rhodes becomes possessed by Firebrand, upon inadvertently throwing ice into a pillar of light, it turns him into a powerful lava monster thus starting the Test of Temperance. When [[Pepper Potts|Pepper]] ends up doing the opposite by throwing coal into the light, Firebrand leaves James' body and possesses Pepper. James manages to call up [[Mandarin (comics)|Gene]] and learns that the coals and the ice must go in the light together. Once that was done, Firebrand leaves Pepper's body.<ref>Iron Man Armored Adventures: World on Fire</ref>
* The Rick Dennison version of Firebrand appeared in a cameo in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Flight of the Iron Spider" being defeated by Spider-Man wearing an "Iron Spider" armor.
