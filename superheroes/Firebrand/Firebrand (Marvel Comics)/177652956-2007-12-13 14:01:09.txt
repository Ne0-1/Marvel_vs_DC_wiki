'''Firebrand''' is the codename of one of three [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. All three were normal humans inside [[powered armor]] and relied on fire-based weapons. The first and third Firebrands, Gilbert and Dennison, both of whom were enemies of [[Iron Man]], are much better known than the second Firebrand, Broxtel, who made only a handful of appearances.

==Gary Gilbert==
Gary Gilbert was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]].  A superpowered enforcer for corrupt [[industrialist]] [[Justin Hammer]], as Firebrand he is a former radical activist saboteur who turned to violence after believing peaceful protest produced no results.

Firebrand accidentally killed his own father.  He also won the [[Black Lama]]'s "war of the supervillains".  He fell to alcoholism and gave up political activism only to work for other villains because he "needed the work".  He later gave up his costumed identity and became a "supervillain agent", brokering employment for other costumed villains.

When news of the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]'s initial wave of supervillain murders spread among the criminal community, Gilbert took it upon himself to gather several costumed criminals for a meeting to determine what should be done about this menace.  The meeting, held at an abandoned tavern in Medina County, Ohio, known among the criminal underworld as "The Bar With No Name", turned out to be a massacre, as Scourge infiltrated the event disguised as a bartender; a few minutes into the meeting, Scourge slaughtered every criminal present, including Gilbert, with machine gun fire.

==Broxtel==
After Gilbert's death, a man named Broxtel was seen acting as the new fire-themed member of the [[eco-terrorist]] group known as the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]]. He made only a handful of appearances and fought [[Spider-Man]], [[Cloak and Dagger]], and the [[New Warriors]].

==Rick Dennison==
Richard L. "Rick" Dennison was the third Firebrand. He was an anti-[[capitalist]] [[eco-terrorist]] who worked with a group called the Flaming Sword, and he fought [[Iron Man]] on several occasions.

==Powers and equipment==
Gary Gilbert wore a suit with an armored exoskeleton that gave him superhuman strength and resistance to fire.  It also housed flamethrowers (which allowed him to fire thermal blasts from his hands), one mounted on each wrist, and flying jets that gave him the ability to fly. Broxtel uses a modified version of the Firebrand suit. Dennison was actually a mutated human being whose body temperature was up in the high hundreds; he could project heat rays of thousands of degrees. He was equipped with a cybernetic harness which could reconfigure itself into different modes if he mentally commanded it to do so.

==In other media==
===Television===
Firebrand appeared in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man Animated Series]]'' in episodes "Fire and Rain", his voiced by [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]].
