===Fictional character biography===
Gary Gilbert was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. A superpowered enforcer for corrupt [[industrialist]] [[Justin Hammer]], as Firebrand he is a former radical activist saboteur who turned to violence after believing peaceful protest produced no results.

Firebrand accidentally killed his own father. He also won the [[Black Lama]]'s "war of the supervillains". He fell to alcoholism and gave up political activism only to work for other villains because he "needed the work".  He later gave up his costumed identity and became a "supervillain agent", brokering employment for other costumed villains.

When news of the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]'s initial wave of supervillain murders spread among the criminal community, Gilbert took it upon himself to gather several costumed criminals for a meeting to determine what should be done about this menace. The meeting, held at an abandoned tavern in Medina County, Ohio, known among the criminal underworld as "The Bar With No Name", turned out to be a massacre, as Scourge infiltrated the event disguised as a bartender; a few minutes into the meeting, Scourge slaughtered every criminal present, including Gilbert, with machine gun fire.

==Firebrand (Broxtel)==
After Gilbert's death, a man named Broxtel was seen acting as the new fire-themed member of the [[eco-terrorist]] group known as the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]]. He made only a handful of appearances and fought [[Spider-Man]], [[Cloak and Dagger]], and the [[New Warriors]].

Firebrand was later hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Splinter groups|R.A.I.D]] and helped into London by [[Fasaud]]. The [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] confronted Firebrand who struck back with a wall of flame. Protected by his magic uniform, the Knight stopped Firebrand. 

After [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Firebrand returned to the United States. Donning a new suit, he attempted to rob a gas station. He was stopped by [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Hawkeye]] and [[Patriot (comics)#Patriot (Elijah Bradley)|Patriot]].

==Firebrand (Rick Dennison)==
Richard L. "Rick" Dennison was the third Firebrand. He was an anti-[[capitalism|capitalist]] [[eco-terrorist]] who worked with a group called the Flaming Sword, and he fought [[Iron Man]] on several occasions.

After he recoverd, Firebrand returned with the Flaming Sword and kidnapped Osborn Chemical vice-president Charles Standish. They were confronted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and they were defeated.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Gary Gilbert wore a suit with an armored exoskeleton that gave him superhuman strength and resistance to fire. It also housed flamethrowers (which allowed him to fire thermal blasts from his hands), one mounted on each wrist, and flying jets that gave him the ability to fly. Broxtel uses a modified version of the Firebrand suit. Dennison was actually a mutated human being whose body temperature was up in the high hundreds; he could project heat rays of thousands of degrees. He was equipped with a cybernetic harness which could reconfigure itself into different modes if he mentally commanded it to do so.

==Other media==
===Television===
* The Gary Gilbert version of Firebrand appeared in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' episode "Fire and Rain" voiced by [[Neal McDonough]]. This version of Firebrand is the son of the late ex-[[Stark Industries]] employee Simon Gilbert. Firebrand was attacking power sources and demanding a ransom of a million dollars. After a series of arson upon power generators, Iron Man confronted Firebrand and had to use his Inferno Armor to confront him. With the lack of solar energy, Iron Man had a hard time stopping a dam that Firebrand detonated. A fragment of the dam hits Firebrand's jet pack causing him to fall into the flood. With Iron Man low on power, War Machine had to face his fear of water to rescue Iron Man and Firebrand. After diverting the flood, Iron Man and War Machine handed Firebrand over to the police.
