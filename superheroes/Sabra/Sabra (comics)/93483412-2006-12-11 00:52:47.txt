'''Sabra''' (Ruth Bat-Seraph) is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She is an [[Israel|Israeli]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]].   "[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]" means both a native of Israel and a [[Opuntia|kind of prickly pear]].  She first appeared in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #250.

==Character history==
Raised on a special [[kibbutz]] run by the Israeli [[government]] after her power manifested, Ruth was the first superhuman agent created to serve the [[Mossad]] (the Israeli Secret Service).  Her first public act as Sabra was to battle the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]], whom she mistakenly believed was working with Arab terrorists operating in Israel.  Some years later, Sabra's young son was killed in a terrorist attack.  She disobeyed orders in order to bring her son's killers to justice.

Years later, Sabra found herself caught up in the events of the anti-mutant campaign known as ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]].'' It was at this time Sabra fought along side the [[X-Men]] and began to subscribe to the philosophies of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].  Sabra was formerly a member of the [[X-Corporation]]'s Paris branch. After Genosha got demolished by Sentinels, she accompanied Charles Xavier and other X-Men members to visit the place, where they eventually found an "insane" Polaris. 

According to ''The X-Men: 198 Files'', Sabra is one of a handful of mutants to have retained their powers after the [[House of M]] story arc.

In [[Civil War: X-Men]] #1, it is been revealed that Sabra has formed a policing force against unruly mutants. This team is fronted by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] with additional team mate [[Micromax]] (formerly of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]). Sabra is therefore associated with Iron Man's pro-registration side in Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], an uncommon role for a mutant.

{{spoiler}} 

She is set to return in the new Union Jack miniseries.

==Powers==
Sabra's mutant power has enhanced all of her body's physical abilities, such as strength, speed, agility, reflexes, durability and healing process, to superhuman levels.  She can withstand impacts up to high caliber rifle fire.  Her various costumes, usually based on the design or colors of the [[Israeli flag]], contain anti-gravity devices that grant her controlled flight and wrist gauntlets that can fire plasma bursts and paralyzing quills.

She is also able to generate low-level superhuman abilities in others, enhancing their physical health (she has twice used this ability to save dying individuals) and granting them powers apparently at random and otherwise unrelated to Sabra's own mutant powers, such as the wind-generating powers given to a woman who took the costumed identity Windstorm.  The recipient's new powers are permanent unless Sabra herself decides to withdraw them.

In addition to her superhuman abilities, Sabra possesses the standard weapons and combat training given to members of the Israeli military.

It should be noted that some accounts indicate that none of Sabra's powers are mutant in origin, but instead granted through an Israeli project similar to the American Super-Soldier program that created [[Captain America]].
