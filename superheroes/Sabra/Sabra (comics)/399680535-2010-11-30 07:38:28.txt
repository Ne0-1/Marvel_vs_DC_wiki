'''Sabra''' is the alias of '''Ruth Bat-Seraph''', a [[fictional character]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Sabra made a cameo appearance in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 1 #250 (August 1980) but first fully appeared in ''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1 #256 (February 1981) and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]]. Belinda Glass came up with the name and concept of the character.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #256</ref>  "[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]" means both a native of [[Israel]] and a [[Opuntia|kind of prickly pear]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ruth Bat-Seraph was born near [[Jerusalem]], Israel.  Raised on a special [[kibbutz]] run by the Israeli government after her power manifests, Ruth was the first superhuman agent created to serve the [[Mossad]] (the Israeli [[secret service]]).  She becomes a police officer in addition to serving as a government agent. Her first public act as Sabra is to battle the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], whom she mistakenly believes is working with [[Arab]] [[terrorist]]s operating in Israel.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #256</ref> Not long after that, Sabra is chosen as a pawn of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] in the latter's game against the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. There, she meets [[Iron Man]] and the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] and battled [[She-Hulk]] and [[Captain Britain]].<ref>''Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions'' #1-4</ref> She later appeared at the Hulk's amnesty ceremony in Washington, D.C.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #279</ref> Some years later, Sabra's young son is killed in a terrorist attack.  She disobeys orders in order to bring her son's killers to justice.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

A dispute with the Hulk again would be intensified as Sabra's powers had temporarily robbed him of his voice, making it seem as if he is still a near-mindless monster. She fights the Hulk, but the two work through their differences and attempt to search for a child who was foretold to become a genocidal maniac, while contending with [[Achilles (Pantheon)|Achilles]] of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], who was sent to kill the boy.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #386-387</ref>

Later, during a peace process meeting, Sabra finds herself fighting the [[New Warriors]] while under the mental influence of a mysterious, unexplained force.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Some time after, Sabra finds herself caught up in the events of the anti-mutant campaign known as ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]].'' It is at this time Sabra fights alongside the [[X-Men]] and begins to subscribe to the philosophies of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  Sabra spends some time as a member of the [[X-Corporation]]'s Paris branch.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She accompanies Charles Xavier and other X-Men members to [[Genosha]], after it was demolished by Sentinels.<ref>''New X-Men'' #132</ref>

Sabra is one of a handful of mutants to have retained their powers after the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''The X-Men: 198 Files''</ref>

Ruth is later seen, under request from the British Government, to aid [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] against a terrorist attack on London.<ref>''Union Jack'' #1</ref> She comes into conflict with the new [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] because of cultural differences, but they begrudgingly work together, paralleling her relationship with the first Arabian Knight during the [[Contest of Champions]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

It is later revealed that Sabra has formed a policing force against unruly mutants. This team is fronted by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] with additional team mate [[Micromax]] (formerly of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]).<ref>''[[Civil War: X-Men]]'' #1</ref> Sabra is identified pro-registration in the Superhuman [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] as one of the 142 registered superheroes under the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

Sabra is briefly seen fighting off Skrulls in Israel.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Sabra's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power has enhanced all of her body's physical abilities, such as strength, speed, agility, reflexes, endurance, and stamina, to superhuman levels.  She can withstand impacts up to high caliber rifle fire, though she has been wounded by fire from an MP-40 sub-machine gun.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She is also able to charge other individuals by transferring to them her own life energy, in the process enhancing their physical state of health (she has twice used this ability to save dying individuals) and granting them low-level super-powers, which are apparently at random and otherwise unrelated to Sabra's own mutant powers (such as the wind-generating powers given to a woman who took the costumed identity Windstorm).  The recipient retains their new powers until Sabra herself decides to withdraw them by retrieving her life energy. Her standard power levels drop when she gives away her life energy (she has been shown losing up to half her natural physical power), but they return to normal once she takes back her life energy. She still remains susceptible to gas attacks.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Her various costumes, usually based on the design or colors of the [[Israeli flag]], contain additional paraphernalia to enhance her combat capabilities. She wears a cape that contains a secret Israeli gravity-polarization device, which allows her to neutralize gravity's effect on her mass, and a tight array of four electric micro-turbines which impel air for sufficient thrust for inertialess mass to fly at subsonic speeds. She wears special pressure reduction valve nose-filters to allow her to breathe at high speeds and high altitudes. The cape also contains a wafer-thin computer system which processes her mental commands received by the circuitry in her tiara. The cape also has an optical navigation device which functions as an auto-pilot. Besides her cape, Sabra also has neuronic-frequency stunners built into her two wrist bracelets that shoot "energy quills," small bundles of low-density plasma (like ball lightning), that travel just below the speed of sound, that paralyze the nervous system of any organic being almost instantaneously.

In addition to her superhuman abilities and equipment, Sabra possesses the standard weapons, and armed and unarmed combat training given to members of the [[Israeli military]]. She is trained in police methods and skills and in anti-terrorist techniques.

Some accounts indicated that none of Sabra's powers are mutant in origin, but instead granted through an Israeli project similar to the American [[Super-Soldier]] program that created [[Captain America]], but as of the moment she is still considered a genetic mutant by the US government.
