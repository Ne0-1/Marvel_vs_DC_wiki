'''Sabra''' (Ruth Bat-Seraph) is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She is an [[Israel|Israeli]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]].   "[[Sabra]]" means both a native of Israel and a kind of prickly pear.  She first appeared in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #250.

Sabra's power enhances all of her body's physical abilities such as strength, speed, agility, reflexes, durability and ability to heal. She wears a costume which has anti-gravity devices that let her fly, wrist gauntlets that can fire plasma bursts, and a cape that can fire paralyzing quills.

Raised on a special [[kibbutz]] run by the Israeli [[government]] after her power manifested, Ruth was the first agent created to serve the [[Mossad]] (the Israeli Secret Service). Some years later, Sabra's young son was killed in a terrorist attack.  She disobeyed orders in order to bring her son's killers to justice.

Years later, Sabra found herself caught up in the events of the anti-mutant campaign known as Operation: Zero Tolerance. It was at this time Sabra fought along side the [[X-Men]] and began to subscribe to the philosophies of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].  Having presumably left the Mossad, Sabra is now a member of the [[X-Corporation]]'s Paris branch.

Sabra recently lost her powers during the events of the [[House of M]] series.
