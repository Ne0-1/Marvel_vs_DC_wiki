'''Sabra''' ('''Ruth Bat-Seraph''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She is an [[Israel|Israeli]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[superhero]].   "[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]" means both a native of Israel and a [[Opuntia|kind of prickly pear]].  She first appeared in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #250.

==Fictional character biography==
Ruth Bat-Seraph was born near [[Jerusalem]], Israel.  Raised on a special [[kibbutz]] run by the Israeli [[government]] after her power manifested, Ruth was the first superhuman agent created to serve the [[Mossad]] (the Israeli Secret Service).  Her first public act as Sabra was to battle the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]], whom she mistakenly believed was working with Arab terrorists operating in Israel.  Some years later, Sabra's young son was killed in a terrorist attack.  She disobeyed orders in order to bring her son's killers to justice. 

A dispute with the Hulk again would be intensified as Sabra's powers had temporarily stolen his voice, making it seem as if he were still a near-mindless monster. The two would work through their differences and attempt to search for a child who was foretold to become a genocidal maniac.

Sabra would later find herself fighting the [[New Warriors]] while under the mental influence of a mysterious, unexplained force. 

Years later, Sabra found herself caught up in the events of the anti-mutant campaign known as ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]].'' It was at this time Sabra fought alongside the [[X-Men]] and began to subscribe to the philosophies of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].  Sabra was formerly a member of the [[X-Corporation]]'s Paris branch. She accompanied Charles Xavier and other X-Men members to Genosha, after it was demolished by Sentinels.

Sabra is one of a handful of mutants to have retained their powers after the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''The X-Men: 198 Files''</ref>

Ruth is later seen, under request from the British Government, to aid [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] against a terrorist attack on London.<ref>''Union Jack'' #1</ref> She comes into conflict with the new [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]] because of cultural differences, but they begrudgingly work together, paralleling her relationship with the first Arabian Knight during the [[Contest of Champions]].

===Civil War/The Initiative===
It is later revealed that Sabra has formed a policing force against unruly mutants. This team is fronted by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] with additional team mate [[Micromax]] (formerly of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]). Sabra is therefore associated with Iron Man's pro-registration side in Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], an uncommon role for a mutant.<ref>[[Civil War: X-Men]] #1</ref>

Ruth has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who may be a part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]]<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref>. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>.  Why she has registered under SHRA, since she is a foreign national, is still to be determined.

==Powers and abilities==
Sabra's mutant power has enhanced all of her body's physical abilities, such as strength, speed, agility, reflexes, endurance, and stamina, to superhuman levels.  She can withstand impacts up to high caliber rifle fire.  Her various costumes, usually based on the design or colors of the [[Israeli flag]], contain anti-gravity devices that grant her controlled flight and wrist gauntlets that can fire plasma bursts and paralyzing quills.

She is also able to charge other individuals by transferring to them her own life energy, in the process enhancing their physical state of health (she has twice used this ability to save dying individuals) and granting them low-level super-powers, which are apparently at random and otherwise unrelated to Sabra's own mutant powers (such as the wind-generating powers given to a woman who took the costumed identity Windstorm).  The recipient retains their new powers until Sabra herself decides to withdraw them by retrieving her life energy. Her standard power levels drop when she gives away her life energy (she has been shown losing up to half her natural physical power), but they return to normal once she takes back her life energy.

In addition to her superhuman abilities, Sabra possesses the standard weapons and combat training given to members of the Israeli military.

It should be noted that some accounts indicated that none of Sabra's powers are mutant in origin, but instead granted through an Israeli project similar to the American Super-Soldier program that created [[Captain America]], but as of the moment she is still considered a genetic mutant by the US Government.
