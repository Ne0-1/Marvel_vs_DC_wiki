'''Hulkling''' ('''Teddy Altman''') is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] and a member of the [[Young Avengers]], a team of superheroes in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Hulkling's appearance is patterned on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  He has shapeshifting abilities that go far beyond the ability to mimic the Hulk, and enhanced strength unrelated to the latter.

==Publication history==
Hulkling was created by [[writer]] [[Allan Heinberg]] and [[artist]] [[Jim Cheung]] and first appeared in ''Young Avengers'' #1 (April [[2005]]) along with other teen-aged heroes patterned after founding [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] members.

Hulkling was originally planned to be a female character. According to [[Tom Brevoort]], "Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as a man. I suspect this was as close as Allan felt he could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic. But as we got underway... he started to have second thoughts and approached me about maintaining Hulkling and Wiccan as two involved male characters."<ref>[http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?SESSIONID=263b1a8c-4c2f-43f0-a3ac-306f17a34589&AFF_TYPE=3&STORY_ID=1611&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 Xtra: In print Young Avengers]</ref>

He also featured in ''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'' and appeared in the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' crossover event.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Teddy altman.jpg|185px|left|thumb|Teddy, from ''[[Young Avengers]]'' #9.]]

In his first appearances, little is revealed about Hulkling save for the fact he is raised by a single mother. All this changes when the [[shape-shifting]] [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] known as the [[Super-Skrull]] appears, stating that Teddy is a [[Skrull]]. The Super-Skrull is surprised to learn that Teddy has super strength and wonders "perhaps the rumors about his father are true."

The Super Skrull follows the Young Avengers to [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan's]] house, where Teddy's mother is waiting for him. The Super-Skrull releases a device designed to turn Teddy into his true form in an attempt to prove his Skrull heritage. But the device doesn't change Teddy's physical appearance.  Instead Ms. Altman, who is also caught in the device's beam, turns into a Skrull. When the Super Skrull accuses her of being a traitor to her race, she responds by saying that the Empress ordered her to protect Teddy. Before she can continue, the Super-Skrull kills her.

The Super-Skrull reveals that, years ago, during the [[Kree-Skrull War]], he kidnapped [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]], presenting them to the Skrull Emperor. Though the heroes later escaped, the Emperor's daughter, [[Princess Anelle]], conceived a child with Mar-Vell.  At birth, the child was immediately exiled and grew up on Earth as Teddy.

Interrupting the Super-Skrull's account, Kree soldiers arrive to take Teddy as one of their own. A battle erupts between the Kree and the Skrull. Teddy ends the conflict by surrendering himself. It is settled that Teddy will spend half an Earth-year with the Kree and the other half with the Skrull, at which time he will declare his ultimate allegiance. However, the "Teddy" that left Earth is actually the Super-Skrull in disguise. The real Teddy remains on Earth.

Along with the rest of his team, Hulkling sides with [[Civil War (comics)#The Secret Avengers|Secret Avengers]] against the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] during the Marvel [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. He plays a pivotal role in [[Captain America]]'s plan for the final confrontation with Iron Man's forces, impersonating [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] in order to free the imprisoned heroes of Prison 42.

On the cover of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1, Hulking is visible as one of the 142 characters who are registered, implying he had joined the Initiative. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>. Hulkling seemlingly appeared in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 in a brief cameo appearance. However, it was shown in a recent issue of She-Hulk that this version of Hulkling was from another dimension, and the real Hulkling remained un-registered.

==Relationships==
Exchanges between [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] (then called Asgardian) and Hulkling (and the latter's character design) have led some readers to speculate that the two young men have a much more intimate bond than mere friendship.  Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation at a San Diego convention panel, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship in issue #12, and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly. 

Since ''Young Avengers'' #2, each issue's letters page has seen the exchange of opinions between people who support and people who are against the portrayal of  [[homosexuality|gay]] superheroes.  Many readers praise the addition of a gay couple in a comic, while others have cited their disdain for the relationship. 

In Young Avengers Special, the team agrees to give an interview to [[Kat Farrell]], and Jessica Jones warns Billy and Teddy that Farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true.  After some deliberation, the two decide to tell her, with Teddy adding, "Why should [[Northstar]] have all the fun?" Teddy's half-sister [[Phyla-Vell]] is also gay.

In "[[Cable & Deadpool]]" #30, Deadpool is caught by Captain America's Secret Avengers, with whom the Young Avengers had merged; Deadpool, a typical breaker of the [[Fourth Wall]], made a subtle dig at Hulkling & Wiccan's sexuality in referring to the Team as "...The Ripe, Nubile '''Young Avengers'''! And I'm especially discomfited to admit that '''Wiccan''' and '''Hulkling''' are looking especially nubile..."

==Powers and abilities==
Hulkling is a hybrid offspring of a [[Kree]]/[[Skrull]] mating. Each of his abilities comes from his alien backgrounds. His powers of shapeshifting/metamorphing, and his accelerated healing factor come from his Skrull heritage, while his superhuman strength originates from his Kree background.

His shapeshifting abilities allow him to impersonate others, alter parts of his body or add entirely new abilities. He can add claws, extend his reach, create body armour, or grow wings. Teddy has four earrings and one ear cuff in each ear. They appear in both his human and Hulkling forms, though he can make them disappear if he desires. For instance, when he transformed into Iron Lad, they disappeared, but when he changed back into Hulkling, they returned. It is not clear if they are part of him or actual pieces of jewelry.

A [[healing factor]] allows him to heal wounds quickly, but not on a scale with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  His shapeshifting abilities also act autonomically to protect him, as seen in [[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]], where his internal organs constantly rearranged themselves to avoid damage during a vivisection by The Cube's warden.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
Hulkling is seen briefly in the [[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]] mini-series. In Issue #3 while [[Ash Williams#Ashley G. Williams|Ashley '''G.''' Williams]] is trying to save the city, he at one point confronts the remains of a zombified Hulkling. With little effort, he chainsaws off his arms and head, and destroys the zombie.
