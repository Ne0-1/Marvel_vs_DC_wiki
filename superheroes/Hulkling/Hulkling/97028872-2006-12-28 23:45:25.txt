'''Hulkling (Teddy Altman)''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], and a member of the [[Young Avengers]], a team of superheroes in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Created by [[writer]] [[Allan Heinberg]] and [[artist]] [[Jim Cheung]], he first appeared in ''Young Avengers'' #1 (April [[2005]]).  Hulkling's appearance is patterned on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  He has shapeshifting abilities that go far beyond the ability to mimic the Hulk, and enhanced strength that seems unrelated to the former.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:Teddy altman.jpg|150px|thumb|Teddy.  Young Avengers #9.|left]]
In his first of several appearances, little was revealed about Hulkling save for the fact he was raised by a single mother. All this changed when the [[shape-shifting]] [[Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture|extraterrestrial]] known as the [[Super-Skrull]] showed up, saying that Teddy was a [[Skrull]]. The Super-Skrull was surprised to learn that Teddy had super strength and wondered "perhaps the rumors about his father are true."

The Super Skrull followed the Young Avengers to [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan's]] house, where Teddy's mother was waiting for him. The Super-Skrull released a device designed to turn Teddy into his true form, trying to prove to him his Skrull heritage. But the device didn't change Teddy's physical appearance, instead Ms. Altman, who was also caught in the device's beam, turned into a Skrull. When the Super Skrull accused her of being a traitor to her race, she responded by saying that the Empress ordered her to protect Teddy. Before she could say much else, the Super-Skrull killed her.

The Super-Skrull then revealed that, several years ago, during the [[Kree-Skrull War]], he kidnapped [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] and presented them to the Skrull Emperor. While the heroes later escaped, the Emperor's daughter, [[Princess Anelle]], conceived a child with Mar-Vell.  At birth, the child was immediately exiled and grew up on Earth as Teddy. Kree soldiers then arrived to help Teddy, stating that the Kree look after their own. A battle then erupted between the Kree and the Skrull, both claiming Teddy as their own. The only solution that Teddy saw to end the war was surrender. It was settled that Teddy would spend half an Earth-year with the Kree and the other half with the Skrull, at which time he would declare his ultimate allegiance, while also being able to make scheduled visits to Earth. However "Teddy" was the Super-Skrull disguised as him, therefore the real Teddy stayed on Earth.{{endspoiler}}

===Relationships===
Exchanges between [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] (then called Asgardian) and Hulkling (and the latter's character design) have led some readers to speculate that the two young men have a much more intimate bond than mere friendship.  Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation at a San Diego convention panel, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship in issue #12, and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly. 

Since ''Young Avengers'' #2, each issue's letters page has seen the exchange of opinions between people who support and people who are against the portrayal of  [[homosexuality|gay]] superheroes.  Many readers praise the addition of a gay couple in a comic, while others have cited their disdain for the relationship. 

In Young Avengers Special, the team agrees to give an interview to Kat Farrell, and Jessica Jones warns Billy and Teddy that Farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true.  After some deliberation, the two decide to tell her, with Teddy adding, "Why should [[Northstar]] have all the fun?"

==Powers==
Hulkling is a hybrid offspring of a Kree/Skrull mating. Each of his abilities come from his alien backgrounds. His powers of shapeshifting/metamorphing, and his accelerated healing factor (derived from his shapeshifting) comes from his Skrull heritage, while his superhuman strength originates from his Kree background. It is not clear if any of his abilities are as powerful (or more powerful) as those of the race from which he gained each specific ability.

His shapeshifting abilities allow him to change his physical appearance. With this ability, he can impersonate others (as he has, in the past, impersonated superhero celebrities such as [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]), or change his physical qualities to look like no one in particular. 

His metamorphing ablilites allow him to change parts of his body or add something on to it. Using his metamorphing talents, he can add claws, extend his reach, create body armour, or grow wings in a protoplasmic matter.

Another one of his Skrull abilities aside from shapeshifting and metamorphing is an accelerated healing factor. This allows him to heal wounds quickly, but not on a scale with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].

His Kree inheritance was his superhuman strength. His strength limit is unknown, but is not as strong as his fellow Young Avenger, [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], as her strength can change proportionate to her height/mass.

==Trivia==
*Teddy has four earrings and one ear cuff in each ear. They appear in both his human and Hulkling forms, though he can make them disappear if he desires. For instance, when he transformed into Iron Lad, they disappeared, but when he changed back into Hulkling, they returned.
*Teddy is really the eldest son of Captain Mar-Vell. [[Genis-Vell]] was artificially aged by his mother.
*Hulkling was originally meant to be a female character. According to [[Tom Brevoort]], "Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as a man. I suspect this was as close as Allan felt he could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic. But as we got underway... he started to have second thoughts and approached me about maintaining Hulkling and Wiccan as two involved male characters."<ref>http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?SESSIONID=263b1a8c-4c2f-43f0-a3ac-306f17a34589&AFF_TYPE=3&STORY_ID=1611&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2</ref>
