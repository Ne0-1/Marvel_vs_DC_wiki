'''Hulkling''' (real name Teddy Altman) is a [[fictional character]], a member of the [[Young Avengers]], a team of [[superheroes]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. His appearance is patterned on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. He has apparent shapeshifting abilities, and enhanced strength that seems unrelated to the former.

He first appeared in ''Young Avengers'' #1 (April [[2005]]). The issue was scripted by [[Allan Heinberg]] and drawn by [[Jim Cheung]].

==Origin==

In his first of several appearances, little was revealed about Hulkling save for the fact he was raised by a single mother.  In Young Avengers #9 a [[Super-Skrull]] showed up saying that Teddy was a [[Skrull]].  The Super Skrull was surprised to learn that Teddy had super strength and wondered "perhaps the rumors about his father are true."

The Super Skrull followed the Young Avengers to [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]]'s house, where Teddy's mother was waiting for him.  The Super Skrull released a device designed to turn Teddy into his true form, trying to prove to him his Skrull heritage. But the device didn't change Teddy's physical appearance, instead Miss Altman, who was also caught in the device's beam, turned into a Skrull. When the Super Skrull accused her of being a traitor to her race, she responded by saying that the Empress ordered her to protect Teddy.  Before she could say much else the Super Skrull killed her.

==Relationships==
Odd exchanges between Asgardian and Hulkling (and the latter's character design) have led some readers to speculate that the two young men have a much more intimate bond than mere friendship. Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation at a San Diego convention panel, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship in issue 12, and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly.

Since ''Young Avengers'' #2, each issue's letters page has seen the exchange of opinions between people who support and people who are against the portrayal of [[homosexuality|homosexual]] superheroes. Many readers praise the addition of a gay couple in a comic, while others have cited their disdain for the relationship. In #6, Kate advises that Asgardian should change his name to avoid the obvious puns when the press discovers that he's in a relationship with Hulkling, implying that the others already know the two are gay.
