==Fictional character biography==
As a child, Lester Verde was severely bullied. When complaining about it to his mother, she noted his creative use of insults against his tormentors and sparked his desire to use his creativity to become a writer.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Originally a [[journalism]] student whose [[yellow journalism]] got his professor fired, his hand is severed by a miniature [[guillotine]] when performing with the punk band Mildred Horowitz. This is a big factor into becoming the villain Doctor Bong. How he developed his paraphernalia was easily explained.

It is revealed that he was also a skilled scientist, using his knowledge of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] to create several devices and creatures to do his bidding, particularly [[Fifi the Duck]], who was the closest thing Bong had to a henchwoman.<ref>"Howard the Duck" #17</ref>

He had a longtime crush on [[Beverly Switzler]], whom he eventually married.  Before he was removed from the book, [[Steve Gerber]] had intended for their marriage to last and for her to no longer be a main character in the ''Howard the Duck'' series. After Gerber left, [[Bill Mantlo]] brought Beverly, now single again, back to the book.

[[John Byrne]] later pitted Bong against [[She-Hulk]], trying to uncensor sanitized violent television so that his [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] [[quintuplets]] would be raised not finding violence at all attractive. She-Hulk, using her abilities to break the [[fourth wall]], manages to defeat him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

It is later revealed in his initial appearance that he had given up supervillainy to obtain a [[PhD]] in [[psychology]]. His first patient is [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who came to him for treatment after the events of the ''[[Dead Reckoning (comics)|Dead Reckoning]]''.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}  He was, however, back to supervillainy by the [[Max (comics)|Max]] [[Howard the Duck]] series.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Bong later appears as one of the many villains in a bar that [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]] enter in search for information. They defeat all the villains, with Bong himself accidentally taking out the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]]. At sword point, Bong reveals all the information he knows about current power struggles.<ref>"Daughters of the Dragon" #3.</ref> He appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in yet another bar.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

He has made an appearance in Deadpool #28. He created imperfect clones of Steve Rodgers (Captain America), Marc Spector (Moon Knight), and Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) and lured Deadpool into teaming up with them. While at there main base the real Secret Avengers infiltrated the base causing the real Steve Rodgers to battle with Deadpool.  After pummeling each other, the real Moon Knight steps in and things finally calm down enough that Cap and Deadpool can talk, Doctor Bong realizes that he has officially lost. He sets off an explosion that kills the Marc Spector and Natasha Romanoff clones, apparently collapsing the building on all the occupants.<ref>Deadpool #28</ref>
