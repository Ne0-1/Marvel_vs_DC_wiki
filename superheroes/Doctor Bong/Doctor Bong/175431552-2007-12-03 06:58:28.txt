==Fictional character biography==
Originally a [[journalism]] student whose [[yellow journalism]] got his professor fired, his hand was severed by a miniature [[guillotine]] when performing with the punk band Mildred Horowitz, which led him in the direction of villainy in becoming Doctor Bong.  How he developed his paraphernalia was easily explained.  He had a longtime crush on [[Beverly Switzler]], whom he eventually married.  Before he was removed from the book, [[Steve Gerber]] had intended for their marriage to last and for her to no longer be a main character in the ''Howard the Duck'' series, but when he was removed from the book, [[Bill Mantlo]] quickly dissolved the marriage and brought the series back to a position of [[status quo]].

[[John Byrne]] later pitted him against [[She-Hulk]], trying to uncensor sanitized violent television so that his [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] [[quintuplets]] would be raised not finding violence at all attractive.

It is later revealed in his initial appearance that he had given up supervillainy to obtain a [[PhD]] in [[psychology]]. His first patient was [[Deadpool]], who came to him for treatment after the events of the ''[[Dead Reckoning (comics)|Dead Reckoning]]''.  He was, however, back to supervillainy by the [[Max (comics)|Max]] [[Howard the Duck]] series.
