==Fictional character biography==
Originally a [[journalism]] student whose [[yellow journalism]] got his professor fired, his hand is severed by a miniature [[guillotine]] when performing with the punk band Mildred Horowitz. This is a big factor into becoming the villain Doctor Bong. How he developed his paraphernalia was easily explained.

It is revealed that he was also a skilled scientist, using his knowledge of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] to create several devices and creatures to do his bidding, particularly [[Fifi the Duck]], who was the closest thing Bong had to a henchwoman.

He had a longtime crush on [[Beverly Switzler]], whom he eventually married.  Before he was removed from the book, [[Steve Gerber]] had intended for their marriage to last and for her to no longer be a main character in the ''Howard the Duck'' series, but when he was removed from the book, [[Bill Mantlo]] quickly dissolved the marriage and brought the series back to a position of [[status quo]].

[[John Byrne]] later pitted him against [[She-Hulk]], trying to uncensor sanitized violent television so that his [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] [[quintuplets]] would be raised not finding violence at all attractive. She-Hulk, using her abillities to break the fourth-wall, manages to defeat him.

It is later revealed in his initial appearance that he had given up supervillainy to obtain a [[PhD]] in [[psychology]]. His first patient is [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who came to him for treatment after the events of the ''[[Dead Reckoning (comics)|Dead Reckoning]]''.  He was, however, back to supervillainy by the [[Max (comics)|Max]] [[Howard the Duck]] series.

Bong later appears in a multi-villain fight.<ref>"Daughters of the Dragon" #3.</ref> He appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar.
