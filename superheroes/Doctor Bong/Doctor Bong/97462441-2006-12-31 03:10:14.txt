'''Doctor Bong''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He possess an advanced knowledge of [[genetic engineering]], and his [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped [[helmet]] can be struck to create a number of effects.  He has clashed with [[Howard the Duck]].

Originally a [[journalism]] student whose [[yellow journalism]] got his professor fired, his hand was severed by a miniature [[guillotine]] when performing with the punk band Mildred Horowitz, which led him in the direction to becoming Doctor Bong.  How he developed his paraphernalia was never explained.  He had a longtime crush on [[Beverly Switzler]], whom he eventually married.  Before he was removed from the book, [[Steve Gerber]] had intended for their marriage to last and for her to no longer be a main character in the ''Howard the Duck'' series, but when he was removed from the book, [[Bill Mantlo]] quickly dissolved the marriage and brought the series back to a position of [[status quo]].

[[John Byrne]] later pitted him against [[She-Hulk]], trying to uncensor sanitized violent television so that his [[Genetic engineering|gentically-engineered]] [[quintuplets]] would be raised not finding it at all attractive.

He later appeared in issues of ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]''.
