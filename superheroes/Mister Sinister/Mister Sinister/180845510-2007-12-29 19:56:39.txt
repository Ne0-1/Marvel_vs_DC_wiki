'''Mister Sinister''' ('''Dr. Nathaniel Essex''') a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character is a recurring foe of the [[X-Men]], and was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]].

Born in [[19th century]] [[London]] as a human scientist of unparalleled genius, Nathaniel Essex foresaw the coming [[Mutant (comics)|mutations]] that would befall mankind. He entered into a pact with the centuries-old mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who granted him eternal life. However, Sinister has no allegiance to Apocalypse and, while studying the bloodlines of the X-Men [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] and [[Jean Grey]], determined that their child would be a mutant powerful enough to destroy Apocalypse. When Grey was thought dead, Sinister created the clone [[Madelyne Pryor]] to bear the child who would become [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Sinister's existence is unknown to the general public and he does his research in secret laboratories across the globe. He has employed groups like the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and [[Nasty Boys]] to carry out his schemes.

==Publication history==
Mister Sinister was first mentioned in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #212, and then a shadowy mental image of him appeared in the following issue. He made his actual appearance in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #221 ([[1987#September|September 1987]]).

Sinister's real name was revealed in the ''Age of Apocalypse'' timeline, but confirmed in the main Marvel Universe in ''X-Men Annual'' 1995. His human background was explored in ''[[The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]''.

Originally, according to creator Chris Claremont, Mister Sinister did not have the Victorian background, but was a mutant whose natural non-enhanced form was an eight-year old child who could never age, while his enhanced form was an eight-year old’s image of a supervillain; his enmity with Cyclops stemmed from their shared childhood in an orphanage. In his original appearances in ''X-Men'' and ''Classic X-Men'', these plot lines were hinted at, but others ended up writing an alternate origin for the character once Claremont left the franchise. The appearance of Sinister as a child at the orphanage was later [[retcon|written off]] as a disguise.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
[[Image:Sinisapoc.png|175px|Nathaniel Essex meets [[En Sabah Nur]]. Art by [[John Paul Leon]].|left|thumb]]
Dr. Nathaniel Essex was a 19th-century scientist in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[England]] obsessed with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]’s [[theory of evolution]], though he felt Darwin and his contemporaries were shackled by too many moral constraints. While pursuing his own research in 1859, he discovered that humanity was undergoing increasing mutation, due to what he called “Essex Factors” in the human genome. His theories were mocked, making him bitter; his son’s death (at the age of four from numerous birth defects, including crooked bones & [[hemophilia]]) drove him deeper into his work. He approached many groups in search of funding, including the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], though all turned him down. He hired a group of thugs, whom he named Marauders, to kidnap people off the streets of [[London]] so he could perform experiments on them; he even went so far as to dig up his dead son and experiment on him.

During this time, Essex came into contact with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] (whom the Marauders had stumbled upon and awoken), accidentally educating the ancient [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] about the facts surrounding his nature. The two subsequently formed an alliance, during which [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] used his advanced technology to mutate Nathaniel. A time-traveling [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] tried to prevent Essex’s transformation but failed. In fact, [[Madame Sanctity]] of the Askani had sent Cyclops and Jean to the past to ensure Essex's transformation and further rebellion against Apocalypse, as Sinister was necessary for the birth of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Cyclops & Jean also freed many of Sinister’s captives, two of whom (a man named Oscar Stamp and an apparently mute boy named Daniel) traveled to America and took the name Summers.

With his new abilities and dispassionate outlook, Essex took a new name "Sinister", the last word his wife spoke to him as she died, after discovering the horrors he’d been engaged in (the stress also caused her to miscarry their unnamed child). Apocalypse’s first command was to create a plague to destroy the weak of the world, but Sinister would not do it&mdash;he had clarity of purpose, and destruction for its own sake was not part of it. The plague Sinister created attacked only Apocalypse, driving him into hibernation.

Soon after, he left for the [[United States]]. Sinister continued his work, just as often allying with Apocalypse as against him. In 1891, he moved to [[New York City|New York]], and posed as an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] named Nathan Millbury; here he had unrestricted access to an abundance of generational genetic material to study, including that of the adult Daniel Summers and his wife, [[Amanda Mueller]]. He came across another pair of time traveling mutants from the future, the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and a shape changer called [[Courier (comics)|Courier]]. Using his scientific equipment, Sinister managed to replicate the shape shifting abilities of Courier; before that, he’d hidden his pale complexion with common makeup. Gambit needed help getting back to the present, and to do so had Sinister re-implant a piece of tissue into his brain. Once the piece was restored, Gambit’s powers increased exponentially and he was able to return himself and Courier to the present. A century later, Gambit and Sinister would meet again.

===The first half of the 20th Century===
In 1915, Essex went back to England and granted [[Jacob Shaw]], who would become [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]'s father, the ability to shapeshift. In the 1920s, Essex encountered a man named Herbert Edgar Wyndham, who dreamed of doing what Sinister had already accomplished&mdash;breaking the genetic code for human [[DNA]]. Essex worked side by side with Wyndham, who would later become better known as the [[High Evolutionary]]. 

In the 1930s, Essex spent some time in [[California]], gathering subjects for his experiments; while in [[Los Angeles]], he met and fell in love with radio comedienne Faye Livingstone, though he never admitted his feelings. Discovering his secret laboratory one night, Essex confronted her with the truth&mdash;she carried the x-factor in her genes, and her offspring would produce special children, children that would be more than human. Horrified, Faye tried to leave, but Essex kept her prisoner. Months passed, filled with degrading examinations; affected pity gave way to foul contempt. Essex broke her in mind and spirit, and made her (not let her) see behind the illusion that was Nathan Essex. Then, in the middle of a raging storm one night, Essex flung the door open and released her, without speaking or gesturing. In time, Faye was brought to the Carlysle Nursing Home in [[San Diego]], [[California]], her mind & body falling to [[cancer]]. Due to her love for Essex, Livingstone had never married, and never had children. The offspring Sinister so eagerly anticipated never came to exist. Once a year, a Mister Essex would come and visit her, though he would never admit to anyone (not even himself) why. [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] forced Sinister to confront both her and himself about the relationship, but Sinister refused, adamantly maintaining that she was nothing more than a useless husk to him. After sharing a telepathic dance with Essex, Faye died in his arms.

In the 1940s Sinister, using the name Nathan Essex, worked with the [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazis]], earning the nickname “Nosferatu,” due both to his pale visage and his habit of taking blood from everyone; he frightened even the Nazis. According to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], he was present at the [[Auschwitz]] death camp, going as far as giving candy to children in exchange for blood samples. During this time, he also created ''Experiment N2'', a clone of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], which could forcibly suck the water out of Namor and use it to douse the android [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]]’s flames. To Sinister’s considerable surprise, though, [[Captain America]] was able to defeat N2. It was during this period in 1944, Essex came across a man named John Greycrow, who would become [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], his first “new” Marauder. Following the end of World War II, Sinister's labs were raided by the United States army. [[Weapon Plus]] scientists [[Professor Thorton]], [[Abraham Cornelius]] and [[Carol Hines]] found Nathan Essex's journals, which detailed the nature and results of his experiments

In 1946, one Dr. Nathan Milbury (quite possible Sinister in disguise) was involved with ''Project: Black Womb'', a secret government project headed, which experimented on thousands of babies, mostly [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutants]], in post-natal holding tanks. Brian Xavier (father of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]) was a colleague of Ryking and Marko at the project, which was based in Alamogordo, New Mexico, but whether he was involved with Project: Black Womb remains unclear.

In 1968, Sinister, alongside the ever-loyal John Greycrow, was present at [[Saigon]]. Rumours spread about a ''White Devil'' that kidnapped soldiers in the jungle and villagers from their homes, never to be seen again, and of monsters prowling through the jungle. Sinister also sent Greycrow to recruit [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] into his Marauders.

===Emergence of mutants===
For decades, Sinister secretly observed the development of mutant children as they grew (many of which had been “earmarked” by ''Project: Black Womb'') in the State Home for Foundlings in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. He cruelly manipulated their childhood developmental processes and even tried to control their adult lives so they might become his minions. The hero Cyclops was among his subjects; one of Scott’s roommates in the orphanage was named Nate, and another alias of Sinister’s was Mike Milbury, neighbor to Scott’s grandparents (Phillip & Deborah Summers), in [[Alaska]]. It was from his laboratory under the [[orphanage]] that many evils ensued. At some point, Sinister spliced mutant genes from [[Havok (X-Men)|Alex Summers]] into Ahmet Abdol, who became the [[Living Monolith]], able to absorb cosmic energies and use them to grow to enormous size.

Sinister is responsible for the [[Mutant Massacre|Morlock Massacre]], ordering his band of [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] to kill all of the sewer-dwelling mutants, due to many of the Morlocks were experiments of [[Dark Beast]], the alternative realtiy version of X-Man member, Beast. Since the Dark Beast had learned genetics from his reality's version of Sinister, and that Sinister’s methods were similar to those mainline reality's Sinister, Sinister could see his “signature” in the Morlocks. To prevent further unauthorized usage of his theories, he had the Marauders wipe out the Morlocks. He considered a similar course of action for the [[Genosha]]n mutates, who were created by the [[Sugar Man]] using his Age of Apocalypse counterpart's technology as well, but decided against it because the process had turned the mutates sterile; consequently, he didn’t consider them a contamination of his work. Though some of his Marauders died during the Massacre, Sinister’s mastery of genetics and cloning technology has enabled him to recreate his Marauders again and again and again.

It was later revealed that Gambit was the one who had assembled Sinister’s Marauders. Gambit did this, and many other tasks, for Sinister because he owed the geneticist a huge debt, due to the fact that Sinister helped him gaining a greater degree of control over his mutant power by removing a portion of Gambit’s brain. In exchange, Gambit had to perform many tasks for him, such as assemble the Marauders for the Morlock Massacre.

===Involvement with the Summers family===
[[Image:Orphanage2.jpg|Sinister in possession of a young [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers]]. Art by Marc Silvestri.|frame|right|thumb]]
Sinister is obsessed with the Summers genetic line, which includes Cyclops, Havok, and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], and has taken a proprietary interest in the family because Daniel Summers is a direct ancestor of Scott & Alex Summers. For a time, Sinister continued to advance his master plan to serve Apocalypse (and his own ends), but in general prefers to let bloodlines breed naturally (rather than hastily transforming them) in order to produce the most racially-supreme beings. 

Sinister eventually believed -- or realized -- that Scott Summers’ and Jean Grey’s mingled gene lines would create a mutant of unparalleled power, one that could destroy Apocalypse and thus free him from the yoke of that ancient tyrant.

To this end, he created [[Madelyne Pryor]], a clone of Jean Grey, though he was disappointed that the clone manifested no powers at adolescence and he considered the whole project a waste of time and effort. Upon “Jean’s” death on the Blue Area of the Moon (at the culmination of the [[Dark Phoenix Saga]]), the [[Phoenix Force]] left her body and entered Madelyne’s, much to Sinister’s delight. He arranged a set of false memories for her, and left her where Scott would eventually encounter her. Eventually the two wed and produced a child, Nathan Christopher Charles Summers.  Madelyne convinced Scott to move with her back to Alaska and live out their lives there, a subconscious suggestion implanted by Sinister&mdash;the remote location made it easier for him to study and if need be abduct the child.  Sinister eventually took the child, then lost it to Madelyne (now the Goblyn Queen), briefly regained it (following her death), then lost it to Cyclops, who blasted him with a supercharged Optic Blast and reduced him to a skeleton (''X-Factor'' #39). A later engagement with Cyclops showed that his optic blast can do little to no permanent harm to Sinister who can simply reform himself after being hit.

Little did Sinister know that the entire ''Inferno'' conflict would gain the notice of his and the X-Men's great foe; Apocalypse, who had sensed the threat posed to him and infected Nathan with a techn-organic virus which threatened to consume him. The only hope of saving him was for Scott and Jean to give him to a woman known as the [[Askani]], who spirited him away to the future. Nathan survived, and came to be the man better known as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Later, a group of mutants known as the [[Nasty Boys]] appeared, working alongside an evil duplicate of [[Multiple Man|James Madrox]]. The evil Madrox wished to kill the true Madrox to ensure his continued independence and sought Sinister’s help in doing so; he sent the Nasty Boys to aid Evil Madrox by fighting X-Factor. Eventually, the Evil Madrox was re-absorbed by the original Madrox, and subsumed into him. Meanwhile, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]’s powers were being secretly overcharged by Senator Steven Shaffran, who was trying to discredit X-Factor in order to spur on his political career. Unknown to Shaffran, though, Sinister took the senator’s appearance and revealed Shaffran’s deeds to the team. Shaffran later confronted Sinister, and planned to kill him, but only succeeded in killing himself when his bullet ricocheted off of Sinister's chest. 

Later, Sinister sent his Nasty Boys to track down a rogue [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], who was trying to break free of Sinister. In an earlier confrontation with X-Factor, Malice had possessed Polaris, but Polaris’s powers prevented the possessing entity from departing Lorna Dane’s body&mdash;something Sinister knew would happen. Malice did eventually break out of Dane’s body, and was determined to escape Sinister’s control&mdash;for a being used to existence as an incorporeal energy being, entrapment in a physical body, even one as powerful as Polaris’s, was Hell for her. A massive fracas between Sinister and the Nasty Boys, Malice, and Havok and Polaris broke out. Both Alex and Lorna tried to absorb Malice (in order to prevent the other from being possessed), but the strain wound up fatally disrupting Malice’s energy form (as planned by Sinister). Seeing as the conflict had no meaning anymore, Sinister and his minions withdrew.

====Legacy Virus & the “[[third Summers brother]]”====
After the events of the ''X-Cutioner’s Song'' saga, Sinister unwittingly unleashed the [[Legacy Virus]] upon the Earth, a plague engineered by [[Stryfe]], a clone of Cable. Sinister revealed to Cyclops Stryfe’s trick, and mentioned Cyclops’ “brothers,” something Cyclops picked up on and dubbed by many fans as the “[[Summers brothers|third Summers brother]]”&mdash;though, technically, it wasn’t said that the brother was a Summers. Speculation abounds as to who that third brother is, though most evidence&mdash;and some quasi-official statements&mdash;indicate [[Adam X the X-Treme]] is that brother. It was theorized that Adam-X is the product of the rape of Cyclops’ mother by the former [[Shi'ar|Shi’ar]] emperor D’Ken, thus making Adam-X the illegitimate heir to the throne of the Shi’ar Empire. However, the third Summers brother has been revealed to be [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], who was born at the time in which Christopher and Katherine Summers were prisoners of the Shi’ar. In any event, Sinister did not mention a specific number of brothers, thus Adam-X could still be another brother of Cyclops, Havok and Vulcan, though not technically a Summers.

Sinister later took in the mutant [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]], and used her unique powers to track down victims of the Legacy Virus, which he could then study and work on to develop a cure. [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira MacTaggart]], long-time ally to the X-Men and one of the top genetic immunologists on the planet, eventually developed a cure for the Virus. This cure was released thanks to the sacrifice of the mutant [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Sinister offered to clone him to his fellow X-men as a form of gratitude (though he may have had ulterior motives), but they refused.

===''Weapon X''===
Sinister continues his research into mutant genetics, and recently reappeared in the pages of the new ''[[Weapon X]]'' series, in the guise of Dr. Robert Windsor. As Windsor, Sinister supposedly helped a number of prisoners escape from Weapon X's concentration camp ''Neverland''. Sinister later appeared in Russia in the limited series ''Colossus: Bloodline'' to confront [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Mikhail Rasputin]] about their family’s shrouded history. He paired with Mikhail to kill off all of his living relatives to allow the essence of [[Grigory Rasputin]] to be concentrated in one host and become [[reincarnation|reincarnate]]. After the brothers fought Sinister’s influence, it was discovered that the reason he wanted Grigory in power was to stabilize his own failing abilities. Sinister admitted that he was weakened&mdash;being unable to shapeshift or teleport and actually sustaining injuries from Colossus’ attack&mdash;but vowed vengeance for when he did have his abilities restored.

===House of M and Beyond===
Mister Sinister’s had a small, yet significant, presence in the divergent [[House of M]] reality (as seen in ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #17). While remaining a physiologically altered geneticist, this Sinister was a quite gentle, friendly person&mdash;even to the point of offering the visiting trio of Deadpool, Cannonball and Siryn a (drugged) barbecue dinner. Sinister was apparently rejected from society for experimenting on mutants, which was taboo under Magneto’s rule, and lived on a secluded Nebraska farm. Despite the difference in personality, this Sinister was also responsible for the birth of an infant Cable, who Sinister believed was a potential savior for the world of the House of M.

Beyond a one-panel appearance in ''House of M: The Day After'' one-shot (not identified by name, but his facial markings were unmistakable), Mister Sinister has not made his presence known. It is unknown what effect, if any, had the [[Decimation (comics)|massive depowering of mutants]] in Sinister, as some of his powers were obtained by enhancing himself with mutant DNA. In any event, Sinister presented himself before [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and Gambit after the two former Horsemen of Apocalypse abandoned their master and decided to sever all ties with their former lives. Sinister recently showed up in ''X-Men Annual 2007'' on the last page, telling [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] he had the key to save the mutant race from extinction, to which Exodus pledged that he and his [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] will work with him. Part of this plan is to obtain the Destiny Diaries from the X-men, battling with the Acolytes and Marauders, Cannonball and Iceman for them. The two X-men lose the battle and Sinster attempts to competely empty Cannonball's mind only to have Iceman stop him. In the midst of the battle, Gambit destroys the Destiny Diaries, with Sinster stating this is a serious setback to his plans.

===Blinded by the Light===
Sinister and the Marauders are the main villains in the story arc starting in ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #200.<ref>{{cite news|author=Richard George|title=Endangered X-Men Build to Fall Event|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-03-18]]|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/773/773652p1.html|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref> He is among the 9 supervillain geniuses that Beast seeks out to help reverse the effects of Decimation in ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]''. He sends the Marauders and Acolytes out to murder all those who have knowledge of the future and acquire objects such as the Destiny Diaries which contain future knowledge. He also has a [[Cerebro]] Machine which allows him to detect any mutant, anywhere.

==Powers and abilities==
Mister Sinister's physiology was altered by Apocalypse, giving him an extended lifespan including superhuman strength and tremendous resistance to injury. Since then, Sinister has copied mutant genes into his own body to provide for additional powers. He can [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]], allowing him to assume human appearances or [[Healing Factor|regenerate]] from massive damages or destroyed tissue. Sinister possesses formidable mental powers; he has been referred to as one of the six most skilled [[telepathy|telepaths]] known to Exodus, and has demonstrated [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] abilities in the past. He has also been able to project force bolts and generate force fields possibly psionic in nature. 

Sinister is a [[geneticist]] of the highest order, capable of creating superhuman abilities and enhancing or controlling [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant abilities]], including being able to predict genetic mutations and splice [[DNA]]. He is also able to produce large amounts of [[cloning|clone]]s; he has done so with all his Marauders (initially Sinister had indicated that Sabretooth's DNA was uniquely difficult to clone, but he apparently found a way to clone him nevertheless) and with [[Jean Grey]]. He is a skilled manipulator and [[mechanical engineer|engineer]]. Many of his bases seem to have some quasi-biological properties, such as being able to “grow” tentacles from a surface to hold a prisoner at Sinister’s mental commands.

== Other versions ==
=== Age of Apocalypse ===
[[Image:MisterSinisterAoA2.png‎|right|225px|thumb|Mister Sinister in the [[Age of Apocalypse]].]]
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Sinister was brought back into Apocalypse’s servitude as one of his Horsemen. Sinister ruled over a part of North America and was tasked with creating stronger, more powerful generations of mutants, for which he was given control over vast Breeding Pens, in which thousands of mutants and humans were captured for genetic experimentation. To maintain control over the Breeding Pens, Sinister assembled his personal taskforce, the so-called Elite Mutant Force, formed mostly by mutant siblings with great genetic potential. The EMF lineup was formed by Beast (Hank McCoy, Sinister’s apprentice), the Summers Brothers (Cyclops and Havok, both raised by Sinister), the Beaubier twins (Aurora and Northstar), and two of the Guthrie Clan (Amazon and Cannonball), who replaced the deceased Emplate and the catatonic Monet Twins. Those mutants who refused to join the EMF were imprisoned in the Breeding Pens.

Thanks to his access to nearly infinite genetic material and test subjects, Sinister was one of the people responsible for the creation of the Infinites, Apocalypse’s genetically engineered army, the Madri, a fanatical cult formed by the duplicates of [[Multiple Man|Jamie Madrox]], and the Brain Trust, using the brains of six telepathic mutants, intended to pacify the prisoners of the Breeding Pens. However, like he had done in the past, Sinister would betray Apocalypse, as Sinister considered that Apocalypse’s plans would bring about the total annihilation of life on Earth. 

Sinister secretly gave classified information to the Human High Council through Jean Grey and Weapon X (Logan). He also created [[X-Man|Nate Grey]], using the genetic material of Cyclops and Jean Grey, a nearly all-powerful psychic intended to assassinate Apocalypse. To cover up his actions, Sinister destroyed his personal lab, hidden in the Statue of Apocalypse and disappeared. He approached the runaway Nate Grey while disguised as a man named "Essex". Sinister killed some of Grey's companions in the process, such as Forge and Brute (who recognized Essex whom had experimented on him.) Sinister informed Grey of his destiny, but was attacked by Grey. Sinister realized that Grey was even more powerful than intended, and believed that he might actually die from the wounds the boy inflicted.

However in the tenth-anniversary limited series, Sinister had recovered from Nate's attack and finds that Jean's DNA contains special properties and that she should have access to the powers of "Mutant Alpha", the legendary "first mutant". Sinister blackmailed Magneto in order to obtain the body of Jean Grey. With her, Sinister was capable of creating his new team: the Sinister Six.

=== Ultimate Sinister ===
[[Image:ultimate-sinister.jpg|200px|thumb|Ultimate Sinister. Art by Brandon Peterson.]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Sinister has been heavily reimagined. He is portrayed as a scientist working for [[Norman Osborn]] who is specialized in stealth and mind-altering drugs. It is also hinted that he might have experimented on [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and other young mutants during his youth. Striking is also that Sinister’s outer appearance is extremely different from his mainstream [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] [[gentleman]] ways: in this universe, he is a muscle-bound, heavily tattooed [[bodybuilder]]. 

He has the word ''Sinister'' tattooed on his forearm, hence the name. He experimented on himself and acquired superhuman powers, namely the ability of [[mind control]]&mdash;so strong that even [[Professor X]] could not neutralize him, allowing Sinister to throw him down a flight of stairs&mdash;and being invisible to anything but the naked eye. His powers are strong enough that he can kill a person by telling them “Choke yourself.”

However, he also lost his sanity in his process, and began to hallucinate of a '''[[Apocalypse (comics)|Lord Apocalypse]]''', who “ordered” him to kill mutants. After shooting several young mutants (possibly [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Maggott]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Destiny (Marvel Comics personification)|Destiny]]), he failed to kill [[Northstar|Jean Paul Beaubier]] and tried to kill the X-Men, but was incapacitated by Rogue and imprisoned in the [[Triskelion]] of the [[Ultimates]]. It is there that he sees a vision of Apocalypse, which reveals that he might not have been hallucinating (though whether this 'vision' was merely another of his hallucinations is unclear). The vision has one command for him. “Choke yourself.” Sinister survived this suicide attempt, only to choke himself to death on his own shirt while on "Suicide Watch."

In Magnetic North, Sinister mentioned that "A child is coming. The ''master'' will be reborn", presumably referring to Apocalypse. In issue 81 "Cliffhangers" he is found dead, having suffocated himself with his shirt. However, in Magnetic North he commented that "For those who serve Lord Apocalypse death is only part of evolution". He also made comments that suggested he was still developing his powers, so it is possible that this "Death" is merely a stage leading to him becoming more powerful. In the solicitations for January 2008, Issue 90 shows Sinister returning to life to herald the coming of Apocalypse.

=== Earth X ===
In the Earth X alternate timeline, Sinister is actually an older [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] who became obsessed with Jean Grey and traveled back in time to the Victorian Era. This was possibly a joke, to make [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] feel better about his existence as [[Belasco]].

=== Mutant X ===
In the Mutant X timeline, Sinister had Gambit steal two children from a fortified facility, of whom the boy was artificially grown into the X-Man, and the girl was left with Gambit, to be raised as his "daughter" Raven. Sinister originally wanted to kill the girl, but Gambit protested and turned to mist (he had just been changed into a vampire), and Sinister relented.
Sinister is also a master of genetic manipulation, and most likely created Madelyne Pryor to breed with Havok and produce a powerful child. At some point, Sinister joined forces with Xavier in a plan to control the world. However, in the final battle, Sinister realized that Xavier was going to destroy the conditions he needed for his genetic manipulations of mutants, and he protested, whereupon Xavier blasted him, apparently killing him.

=== X-Men: The End ===
In the miniseries ''[[X-Men: The End]]: Heroes and Martyrs'', [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] was revealed to be the clone of Mister Sinister, created from Sinister's own pre-mutated [[DNA]].  Sinister wished to destroy his master, Apocalypse, and to do so he needed a body that had not been subject to Apocalypse's altering.  Sinister then engineered mutant powers for the clone, using the DNA of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], which technically makes Gambit the [[Summers brothers|third Summers brother]] in that alternate reality.  However, Apocalypse learned of Sinister's plan and had the child stolen and left it in the care of the Thieves Guild.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Sinistertas.jpg‎|thumb|right|250x|Mister Sinister in [[X-Men (TV series)|the ''X-Men'' animated series]].]]
Mr. Sinister appeared on the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] and was voiced by Christopher Britton. Like in the comics, Sinister was originally a British scientist during the Victorian era, though he wasn't mutated by Apocalypse. This version of Sinister experimented on mutants and obtained organs from his minion, [[Jack the Ripper]], and used the knowledge obtained through his activities to mutate himself. An ancestor of Professor X, Dr. Xavier, was one of Sinister's opponents and attempted to save his victims. Despite his origins having no link to Apocalypse, Sinister joined forces with him when Apocalypse plotted to rewrite reality by harnessing the power of the axis of time.

Interested in the creation of more powerful mutants, Sinister had an obsession with Cyclops and Jean Grey, as well as other powerful mutants such as Magneto. Like his comics counterpart, this Sinister was capable of emitting energy blasts from his hands and was vulnerable to Cyclops' optic beams. He was served both by the Nasty Boys and the Savage Land Mutates. In an alternate, [[Age of Apocalypse]]-esque reality glimpsed in the episode "[[One Man's Worth]]", Sinister was seen fighting alongside Magneto's mutant resistance forces.

Mr. Sinister was also set to appear in The [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man The Animated Series]] 3 part episode adapting the [[Secret Wars]].  His appearance was canceled due to the decision to pull the X-Men cast (save for Storm) from the story.  The Secret Wars storyline also had an additional episode which would center around Spider-Man and The X-Men infiltrating Sinister's base.[http://marvel.toonzone.net/retrospective/x-men/part6.php]

There were suggestions to bring him in as a leading antagonist in ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' however the writers of the show were apprehensive about his inclusion feeling it would over-populate the show with too many major villains. Producer Boyd Kirkland suggested that had X-Men Evolution been renewed for a 5th Season it was possible that Sinister would have been brought in as a new threat. Before being canceled, Sinister was set to appear an issue of the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' comic book spin-off. It was part a of plot that started in issue #8 (which centered around Beast meeting a friend online who knew of his mutant condition). Unfortunately, the storyline wasn't followed up in issue #9, a stand alone issue, which was the final issue published.
