[[Image:Uncanny239.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cover to Uncanny X-Men #239]]'''Mister Sinister''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Sinister is a long-lived and scheming foe of the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor]]. He was first mentioned in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #212, by the villain [[Sabretooth]], but he did not appear on-panel until issue #222.  He was created by writer Chris Claremont, and was visually designed by artist [[Mark Silvestri]. 

== Powers and abilities ==

Mister Sinister has vaguely-defined powers. He has exhibited vast shape-changing and regenerative abilities, incredible resistance to injury, teleportation, blasts of concussive force, and he has apparently survived having the flesh blasted off his bones at the climax of the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" crossover.  However, he has also demonstrated telepathic abilities in the past, suggesting that any number of potential uses of his powers may have actually been mentally projected illusions.

Sinister is a geneticist of the highest order, able to predict genetic mutations and splice [[DNA]] to create mutants to his whim. He can also produce large amounts of clones; he has done so with his Marauders, and with [[Jean Grey]]. He is also a master surgeon, having excised a portion of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit's]] brain, and then later restored it (although from Sinister's point of view, he restored a portion of Gambit's brain and later excised it, as Gambit was travelling back in time when the restoration was completed).

Unfortunately, Sinister has no conscience, and does not care how many lives are destroyed in pursuit of his ultimate goals; he is known to have collaborated with members of the Nazi party.

== History ==

Mister Sinister was formerly known as Nathaniel Essex, a biologist in Victorian [[England]], who was fascinated with [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] concept of natural selection and genetic mutations. His radical theories and experiments, however, received derision from his colleagues in the London Royal Society, and they cut off his work.

Without funding or a proper facility, Essex resorted to experimenting on the dregs of society, using a group of thugs he called Marauders to bring him material to experiment on. The Marauders disturbed the resting place of an ancient evil, the entity known as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. When Apocalypse learned of Essex's work, he realized that it explained his existence. Apocalypse convinced Essex to work for him, after being rejected by his contemporaries and his wife, and transformed him into a new breed of being.

At that moment, Nathaniel Essex discarded his old name, and called himself "Sinister." Apocalypse's first command was to create a plague to destroy the weak of the world, but Sinister would not do it; he had clarity of purpose, and cruelty for its own sake was not part of it. The plague Sinister created attacked only Apocalypse, driving him into hibernation.

It has been revealed that Sinister also participated in the [[Holocaust]], in which he experimented on the prisoners. He had the nickname of [[Nosferatu]] there due to his pale skin.

Sinister's next plan was to use selective breeding to create a mutant that could destroy Apocalypse, and over the course of a hundred years, he found the ideal genetic match between Marvel Girl (Jean Grey) and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers).

He created [[Madelyne Pryor]], a clone of Grey, and set her up to meet Summers and eventually bear his child. She did, but Sinister's plan hit a snag when Apocalypse infected the child with a techno-organic virus that would soon kill him. The child was taken far into the future, where he became [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

The villain [[Stryfe]] tricked Sinister into unleashing the [[Legacy Virus]], decimating the mutant population, and let slip to Cyclops that he has more than one brother (the one known brother being [[Havok]]). (Speculation abounds as to who that third brother is, though most evidence (and some semi-official statements) indicate Adam-X, the [[X-Treme]], is that brother. It is theorized that Adam-X is the product of the rape of Cyclops' mother by D'Ken, thus making Adam-X the illegitimate heir to the throne of the Shi'ar Empire.)

Fortunately for Sinister, Cable also had a deep grudge against Apocalypse, and when Apocalypse merged with Cyclops at the climax of "The Twelve," Cable and Jean Grey ([[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] IV) tracked the merged being, separated them, and Cable killed Apocalypse, fulfilling his destiny as written by Sinister.

Sinister continues his research into mutant genetics, and recently reappeared in the pages of the new [[Weapon X]] series. With the title Weapon X's cancellation, Sinister has left to [[Genosha]] where he will appear in the second volume [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].

==Notes and Trivia==

Originally, according to creator Chris Claremont, Mister Sinister did not have the Victorian background, but was a mutant whose natural non-enchanced form was an 8-year old child who could never age.  In his original appearances in ''X-Men'' and ''Classic X-Men'', these plotlines were hinted at, but others ended up writing an alternate origin for the character once Claremont left the franchise.
