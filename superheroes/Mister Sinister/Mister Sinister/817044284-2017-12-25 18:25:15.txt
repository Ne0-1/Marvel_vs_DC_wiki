==Publication history==
===Creation===
Writer [[Chris Claremont]] conceived Sinister as a new villain for the [[X-Men]]. Having felt "tired of just going back to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and the same old same old" Claremont recalled:

{{blockquote|[[Dave Cockrum]] and I went over ideas, and what we were coming towards was a mysterious young boy—apparently an 11-year-old—at the orphanage where Scott ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]) was raised, who turned out to be the secret master of the place. In effect what we were setting up was a guy who was aging over a lifespan of roughly a thousand years. Even though he looked like an 11-year-old, he'd actually been alive since the mid-century at this point—he was actually about 50 [...] He had all the grown up urges. He's growing up in his mind but his body isn't capable of handling it, which makes him quite cranky. And, of course, looking like an 11-year-old, who'd take him seriously in the criminal community? [...] So he built himself an agent in a sense, which was Mister Sinister, that was, in effect, the rationale behind Sinister's rather—for want of a better word—childish or kid-like appearance. The costume... the look... the face... it's what would scare a child. Even when he was designed, he wasn't what you'd expect in a guy like that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?p=1411447#post1411447 |title=Comixfan Forum |publisher=comixfan.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>}}

===1980s===

Mister Sinister [[first appearance|debuted]] in the title ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', briefly mentioned by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] during the ''[[Mutant Massacre]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] as the leader of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] who had sent them to slaughter the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] population.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #212 (Dec. 1986)</ref> In the following issue, the X-Men member [[Psylocke]] picks up a shadowy mental image of the Marauders' "Master" from Sabretooth's mind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #213 (Jan. 1987)</ref> Mister Sinister finally appeared on-panel in issue #221 (Sept. 1987). The character plays a major role in the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' crossover,<ref name="Uncanny241">''Uncanny X-Men'' #241 (Dec. 1988)</ref> where it is revealed that Sinister cloned [[Madelyne Pryor]] from [[Jean Grey]] for the purpose of having her conceive a child with Cyclops, their son Nathan;<ref name="Uncanny241"/> Sinister is also revealed to have manipulated Cyclops' life since early childhood. After a battle with the X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the villain is apparently destroyed by Cyclops' optic beam.<ref>''X-Factor'' #39 (April 1989)</ref>

''[[Classic X-Men]]'' #41–42 (Dec. 1989) details the role Mister Sinister played in Cyclops' life at the orphanage in [[Nebraska]]. The story features a boy named Nathan who is obsessively fixated on Cyclops — and whom Claremont intended to actually be Mister Sinister. However, as Claremont left the ''X-Men'' comics, this origin was never revealed in-story.<ref>{{cite web|author=@ 01:39 AM |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/23/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-78/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed | website= comicbookresources.com |date=2006-11-23 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

===1990s===
Mister Sinister returns in the title ''X-Factor'', leading the [[Nasty Boys]]<ref>[[David, Peter]] (w). ''X-Factor'' #74–75 (Jan. – Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> and has allied himself with the mutant terrorist [[Stryfe]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #78 (May 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> In the crossover storyline "[[X-Cutioner's Song]]", the character impersonates Apocalypse and uses his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] to capture Cyclops and Jean Grey.<ref>''X-Factor'' #84 (Nov. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> Sinister hands them over to Stryfe in exchange for a canister containing his genetic material,<ref>''X-Men'' #14 (Nov. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> but finds it empty, unknowingly unleashing the [[Legacy Virus]] in the process.<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' #18 (Jan. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, Sinister confronts Cyclops to reveal that the canister contained the deadly Legacy Virus. It was during this conversation, that Sinister said, "I care enough to wish you and your brothers to be protected from this illness", but he corrected himself in saying that he meant "brother".<ref>''X-Men'' #23 (Aug. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In 1996, Mister Sinister's origin story was told in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''[[The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]''. It established the character as '''Nathaniel Essex''', a scientist from the 19th century obsessed with evolution who made a pact with the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to become a virtually immortal being.<ref>''The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1–4 (June – Sept. 1996). Marvel Comics.</ref> It is furthermore established that Mister Sinister created Cyclops's son Nathan (who became the time-traveling soldier [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]) to destroy Apocalypse.<ref>''Cable Annual'' 1999. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was also revealed that Sinister had initiated the Morlock Massacre because he saw his signature in them (as many of them were experiments of [[Dark Beast]], a student of Mr. Sinister from an alternate timeline known as the [[Age of Apocalypse]]), and he would not allow unauthorized use of his theories, so they were slaughtered.<ref name="Cable28">''Cable'' vol. 1 #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though some of his Marauders did not survive the battle, many of them returned thanks to Sinister's genetics mastery and the fact that he had multiple clones of all of them.<ref name="X-Men34">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #34</ref> He also considered doing the same with the Genosha mutates, who were experiments of [[Sugar Man]] (another student of his Age of Apocalypse counterpart). Yet in the end he did not because the mutates were sterile and so in his opinion, they were not a tainting of his work.<ref name="Cable28"/>

Another running storyline for the character was his mysterious ties to the X-Man [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]; these ties were first introduced in ''X-Men'' v2 #6 when Sabretooth encountered Gambit and the X-Men and implied that the two had a history working together.<ref>''X-Men'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Rogue briefly absorbed Gambit's memories,<ref>''X-Men'' #41-45. Marvel Comics.</ref> she realized the relationship between the two: that Gambit had been an agent of Mister Sinister, recruiting Sabretooth and several other villains, to serve as Sinister's Marauders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #350. Marvel Comics.</ref> Furthermore, he had served as a guide for the group in the tunnels, before abandoning the villains upon discovering their plans on wiping out the Morlocks. His payment for these deeds would be Mister Sinister's services as a scientist, to correct a genetic defect regarding Gambit's powers that was causing him to slowly lose control over them.<ref>''Gambit'' #13-15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2000s===
Mister Sinister appears in the title ''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'';<ref>''Gambit'' #14-23</ref> besides revealing the connection between the two characters, Mister Sinister would provide Gambit with a chemical compound designed to neutralize the genetic modification process that the Skrulls were using as part of their infiltration process of Earth, as the alien shapeshifters had formed an alliance with Apocalypse to conquer Earth.<ref>''Gambit'' 23, ''Uncanny X-Men'' #375. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was also revealed that Mister Sinister had genetically altered the villain the [[Living Monolith]], allowing him to access Havok's power, in order to serve as replacement for Havok in Apocalypse's plan to harvest the power of The Twelve.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Following Apocalypse's defeat, Sinister attempts to use the [[High Evolutionary]]'s space station to mutate the human population but is stopped by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #99. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sinister's actions would have worldwide repercussions: by helping High Evolutionary strip all of mutantkind of their powers, Sinister unknowingly wiped out a community of evolved mutants known as The Neo.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 380. Marvel Comics.</ref> The surviving Neo began hunting Sinister down, forcing Sinister to go into hiding as the Neo known as Domino (whose daughter was one of the dead) kills over 17 Sinister doppelgangers left behind by Sinister as he goes into hiding.<ref>''X-Men'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sinister would resurface in the pages of ''[[Weapon X]]'', experimenting on mutants under the guise of Dr. Robert Windsor.<ref>''Weapon X'' (2002), #2</ref> It is revealed that the character [[Nazi human experimentation|worked alongside the Nazis]] during [[World War II]] and created a clone of [[Namor]] called N2 which was destroyed by Captain America.<ref>''Weapon X'' (2002) #14</ref> He would be accompanied by the Marauder Scalphunter in the series, with Scalphunter serving as his bodyguard.

Mister Sinister reappears in the "[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]" storyline, sending the Marauders and [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] out to murder all those who have knowledge of the future;<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203</ref> In the "[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]" storyline, Sinister, leading a mob of many of the remaining evil mutants, seeks out the first mutant child born since [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] (also known as "M-Day", when the Scarlet Witch de-powered most of the world's mutant population). However, the character is apparently killed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who presses his face onto an unconscious [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], whose powers had been amplified into an instantaneous death-touch.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Miss Sinister====
[[image:Miss sinister.png|thumb|upright|Miss Sinister in ''X-Men Legacy'' #214 (September 2008). Art by Scot Eaton.]]
The title ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' reveals that Mister Sinister had been anticipating his physical death for some time, putting events in motion that would lead to his resurrection. It was even revealed that besides the Summers family, Mister Sinister had also been manipulating for some time events in the Xavier family as well as the Marko, Ryking and Shaw families. By using the Cronus Device, he manages to implant within their DNA the seeds through which to ensure his own rebirth. Then he transferred his own consciousness and powers to the machine which after his death would activate itself and his consciousness would take control over the body with his DNA imprint.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #211. Marvel Comics.</ref> When that happened, Sinister's consciousness took control over Professor Xavier's body to save him from a gunshot wound.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #213. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the combined efforts of [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and Gambit destroy the machine, enabling Xavier to successfully drive Sinister's consciousness from his mind and body. At the end, a female character appears called '''Miss Sinister'''.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #214. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her name is revealed to be Claudine Renko, and she possesses telepathy and a healing factor similar to Sinister, but not the memories or mind due to the fact that she was engineered to be Mister Sinister's fail-safe in the event of the Cronus Device would fail. When that ultimately occurred, Claudine was activated.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #217. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Claudine later on approaches Gambit and [[X-23]] (Laura Kinney), the latter having left the X-Men's base to strike out on her own, seemingly asking for the former's help. Claudine at this point seems to be suffering from injuries inflicted earlier by Wolverine's son [[Daken]]. A near fatal strike from X-23 reveals the nature of the injury as Claudine's body morphs into that of Mister Sinister.<ref>''X-23'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

X-23, flanked by Gambit, encounters a young girl named Alice and witnesses her being murdered, though the next day Alice appears to them somehow alive. Encouraging them to follow her to a peculiar desert laboratory, Alice introduces them to her employer/owner/adoptive mother, Claudine. Revealing herself openly to X-23, Claudine explains that Alice is also a clone, fourth of a series of five created by Essex as another experiment alongside several other children that live in the complex. She then expands upon her own origins, stating that the process of becoming what she is left her with vague, but invasive memories of Essex's life and that as a malignant presence within her mind, he is slowly killing her as a means of self-resurrection; he even manages to manifest briefly before being re-absorbed back into her. Claudine then incapacitates Gambit and straps X-23 to a peculiar chair, stating her aim to switch their bodies, thus inheriting Laura's healing factor, something she has wanted after her stabbing, and thereby free herself of Essex. The plan backfires when Essex controls Laura's body and uses her to mortally wound Claudine again. Laura manages to overcome Essex's presence in her mind, expelling it through force of will. Laura, Alice and Gambit manage to escape the laboratory as it collapses and arrange for the children to be given new homes before setting off on their journey again. However, in the wreckage left behind, Claudine is still alive, although just barely, and is being watched over by the fifth Alice clone, the new host of Essex.<ref>''X-23'' #4-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
[[image:Mister Sinister.png|thumb|upright|Mister Sinister in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #2 (January 2016). Art by Humberto Ramos and Victor Olazaba.]]
Now dressed in Victorian era garb, Mister Sinister resurfaced in the pages of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #544. Using his knowledge gained from Apocalypse, he merges with the Dreaming Celestial and warps its head to match his own, using the power he gained as a result to turn San Francisco's residents into doppelgangers of himself resembling 19th century England, where he believes society was perfect. His plan is to disturb the Celestials so that they would come to Earth and eradicate all life, leaving only his perfection to rebuild the planet. However, Sinister is defeated and forced out from San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol 2 #1</ref>

During the "[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]" storyline, Mister Sinister is discovered to have built his own city (based on Victorian-era London) in the Moloids' underground tunnels within [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]. The city is inhabited solely by clones of Mister Sinister and his various acquaintances, including Cyclops, Madelyne Pryor, Gambit, Mystique and Krakoa. Also populating the city are clones of the Phalanx, clones of Sabretooth called "Hounds", and clones of the Marauders, who function as Battalion Guards. After disposing of a rebel clone, he explains to one of his other clones that he has foreseen that the Phoenix Force would come after [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], and that the Avengers would try to stop it and clash with the X-Men, resulting in the Phoenix Five. He also knows that the Phoenix Five will soon come after him and intends to take the Phoenix energy away from them by using a group of [[Madelyne Pryor]] clones.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #14</ref>

During a meeting of the Extinction Team, the Phoenix Five reveal to Magneto, Storm, Psylocke and Danger (who is still controlled by UNIT) that Mister Sinister is the one who told Hope about the Phoenix Force, and ponder on the danger that his goals may represent to the world. The Phoenix Five leave their teammates behind and track Mister Sinister to [[Anchorage, Alaska]] (Cyclops's birthplace) finding out that he built his city in the underground tunnels beneath Anchorage. Mister Sinister has also formed his cloned army. He then orders his clones to enter into war against the Phoenix Five.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #15</ref> One by one, the Phoenix Five members are taken down by Mister Sinister's cloned creatures (including a clone of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Krakoa|Krakoa]]) until only Cyclops remains, and even he is eventually defeated by the Madelyne Pryor clones. Shortly after, Magneto, Storm, Psylocke and Danger arrive at Mister Sinister's city and find out that their teammates were captured.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #16</ref> However, the Phoenix Five are able to escape and decide to kill each and every clone of Sinister, ending the threat he posed to mutantkind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #17</ref>

[[Image:Sinister London.png|thumb|upright|left|Sinister London in ''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2, #14 (August 2012). Art by Dustin Weaver.]]
Yet in the aftermath of "Avengers vs. X-Men," it is revealed that the threat of Sinister still goes on as he appears alive and well when he engages in a tête-à-tête with an imprisoned Cyclops. Sinister tells Cyclops that he had actually thought he could indeed keep the Phoenix chained, yet as confident as he was it was always possible there were holes in his data set. And so, before all that, at some point he surprised Katie Kildare, Cyclops' PR agent, and killed her. He then created a para-personality of her, took Katie's position in Utopia and left a secondary Sinister in charge of his kingdom. Sinister also reveals that the para-personality he created of Katie would only dissolve once the Phoenix had gone and his own would reemerge. Sinister even provides a final dilemma for Cyclops to think about: Sinister may have lost his empire, his blessed creation engines, his backups, his Madelynes. He is on his own, but Cyclops just knows that no one else can stop him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #20</ref>

It is later revealed that Sinister had acquired a mole inside the Jean Grey School in the form of [[Ernst (comics)|Ernst]], who had a natural immunity to telepathic probing, Ernst providing Sinister with DNA samples of the mutants at the school in return for him creating a new body for her friend Martha Johannesen.{{issue|date=August 2015}} However, Logan had become aware of the existence of a mole, and left a note in his will for [[Spider-Man]] to teach a 'Special Class' at the school consisting of the mutants that Logan had identified as the most likely suspects, wanting an outsider's perspective on the students who would be untainted by prior emotional ties.{{issue|date=August 2015}} Although Sinister's work allowed him to transplant Martha's brain into a clone of Storm (Albeit one that he could control), while also creating a team of clones of Nightcrawler, Beast, Wolverine, Iceman and Firestar, the Special Class were able to come together and defeat him thanks to Spider-Man's instruction.{{issue|date=August 2015}} Although Sinister escaped, his plan was thwarted when Spider-Man tricked the Firestar clone into destroying his DNA samples, Storm noting in the aftermath that for a team of students to defeat Sinister with the only casualty being the mall he was using as a base was an impressive achievement.<ref>''Spider-Man and the X-Men'' #6</ref>

During the "Last Days" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, it was mentioned months ago that Mister Sinister was among the scientists that Magneto's right-hand person Briar tried to contact in order to make a special cocktail to augment Magneto's powers for the upcoming incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19</ref>

===All New, All Different===
With the release of the Terrigen Mist in the atmosphere of the Earth, it was discovered the substance was actually incredibly toxic with long-term exposure for mutants.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref> Mr. Sinister began experimenting on unwilling subjects, trying to make Inhuman and Mutant DNA co-exist in order to allow the creation of a genetically superior species of mutants. Sinister caught the attention of the X-Men after the disappearance of Colossus and Magik at the hands of the Marauders. When Sinister was confronted by the group of mutants, he deployed his only successful specimen, the seemingly-revived Cyclops. It is also revealed that he has several clones of Gambit, Cyclops, Cannonball, Sabretooth, Mystique, and several others which he maintains locked as his prize collection.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #4</ref> The revived Cyclops was, however, revealed to be actually another experiment of Sinister who combined Scott Summers' genetic material with Inhuman DNA.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #5</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
Born Nathaniel Essex in Victorian London, Sinister became a biologist in 1859. He was a contemporary of [[Charles Darwin]] and became obsessed with Darwin's theories. However, Essex believed his peers were shackled by too many moral constraints and that their research should be beyond morality. Essex believed that humanity was undergoing increasing mutation, due to what he called “Essex Factors” in the human genome. He dreamed of bringing the perfection of the evolution of the human race to the masses. After the loss of his young son due to birth defects, he delved deeper into his work. Essex's theories were mocked, making him bitter, and his revealing of an unorthodox experiment resulted in his ousting from the Royal Society. Angry, Essex stated that if becoming a monster was what was required for his work to progress, then he would become a monster.<ref name="Milligan">{{cite comic|writer=[[Peter Milligan]]|penciller=[[John Paul Leon]]|story=Beginnings|title=Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 #4|date=September 1996|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Essex met with Cootie Tremble and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], the group he would eventually lead. The Marauders kidnapped homeless and neglected people off the streets of London and used them as test subjects for Essex's experiments. Essex ordered the Marauders to awaken the immortal Egyptian mutant En Sabah Nur, who would become known as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. En Sabah Nur ordered the Marauders to take him to Essex. During this time, Essex's wife, Rebecca Essex, was pregnant with their unborn child and was shocked to find that Essex had dug up their first-born child to experiment on him. Nur met Essex and became interested in Essex's work. Nur offered an alliance with Essex in continuing his research. Left with the choice of continuing his work or his wife shunning him, Essex allied himself with Nur. Essex explained to Nur that Nur was the first born in what he believed would be a great mutation in the human race.<ref name="Milligan"/>

The time-travelers [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] confronted Nur, believing that they were to prevent Dr. Essex’s future transformation into Mr. Sinister, but unaware that [[Madame Sanctity]] of the [[Askani]] had sent them to the past to stop Nur from conquering England. Essex was necessary for the birth of Nathan Summers, also known as the mutant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], whom Madame Sanctity worshiped. Nur defeated Cyclops and Phoenix and leaves them for Essex to experiment on. Phoenix explains to Essex that continuing his work with Nur would lead to the destruction of the world. Deciding to leave his life of unorthodox research and dedicate his life to his wife and unborn child, Essex returned home to learn that his wife had freed all of his captives, prematurely had the baby, and was dying of stress. Asking for forgiveness at her side, Rebecca denied him and stated, "To me, you are... utterly… and contemptibly… sinister!", with her dying words. Essex agreed to Nur's offer and was ordered to create a plague to destroy the weak of the world, as Nur's first prelate. In his alien ship, Apocalypse painfully transformed Essex into an ageless being of extraordinary pallor with telekinesis, asking him to shed his past name and choose another. With his new abilities and dispassionate outlook, Essex took the new name, "Sinister", Rebecca's last words to him.<ref name="Milligan"/>

Sinister has shown an obsession with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]], and the Summers genetic line. This led Sinister to create a clone of [[Jean Grey]] called [[Madelyne Pryor]], with the sole purpose of breeding with Scott. That successful quest resulted in the birth of [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Chris Claremont]]|penciller=[[Marc Silvestri]]|story=Inferno, Part the Second: Fan the Flames!|title=Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 #241|date=February 1989|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Mister Sinister is also a scientific [[genius]], with expertise in the fields of [[biology]], [[genetics]], [[cloning]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The character is a master manipulator and planner, with decades of genetic research at his command. He goes to great lengths to preserve his powers and personality through elaborate technological means such as conditioning certain children to be his 'hosts' in the event of his future death. However, [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] noted that the later discovery of cloning technology would make such a plan relatively pointless, reflecting that Sinister tends to continue pursuing old plans even when future technology offers more viable alternatives.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

==In other media==
===Film===
* Nathaniel Essex / Mr. Sinister is first referenced in the ''X-Men'' film series, in a post-credits scene from ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''. In the film, [[Wolverine (character)|James Howlett / Logan / Wolverine]] is subject to experimentation at Alkali Lake, where ultimately [[William Stryker|Col. William Stryker]] means to turn him into a [[Weapon X|weapon]]. The Weapon X program brainwashes Wolverine and attempts to control him with [[Weapon X #First installment|mechanical headgear]]. As he is released by the young X-Men, Wolverine escapes. The post-credits scene shows employees of Essex searching the Weapon X facility labs for DNA. Upon finding vials of his blood, the men begin putting them into briefcases. Producer and writer [[Simon Kinberg]] in interviews has stated that this scene was included to hint what direction the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film universe]] will be taking in upcoming films, namely: ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'', ''[[X-Men (film series)#Untitled Gambit film|Gambit]]'' and future ''X-Men'' films as well.<ref>[http://collider.com/x-men-apocalypse-post-credits-scene/]</ref> On the commentary for ''X-Men: Apocalypse'', Bryan Singer had stated the character would make his first on-screen appearance in ''Logan'', this however was not the case as [[James Mangold]] stated he wanted to keep the grounded and serious tone of his film consistent. Though Mister Sinister does not appear in the film, Kinberg has since confirmed that the post-credits scene from ''Apocalypse'' is how [[X-23|Laura Kinney / X-23]] was eventually created by ''Transigen'', during the events of ''Logan''. In the same interview, he stated that Mister Sinister will appear in future ''X-Men'' films.<ref>http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1628949/a-surprising-connection-between-logan-and-x-men-apocalypse-has-been-revealed</ref>

===Television===
* Mister Sinister appears in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Christopher Britton (voice actor)|Christopher Britton]]. As in the comics, he is a scientist obsessed with Cyclops and Jean Grey's genetics, claiming to have watched them all their lives. He leads the [[Nasty Boys]] and the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. He sees little value in Xavier's dream for co-existence or Magneto's preparations for war, instead believing that the goal should be pushing mutants to the next stage of their mutations. He is responsible for reviving [[Morph (comics)#X-Men: The Animated Series|Morph]] and intended to use him to destroy the X-Men. The episode "Descent" reveals Mister Sinister's origin. Instead of being remade by Apocalypse, Essex's own experimentations during the Victorian era are what made him into Mister Sinister.  In that time, he is shown to have known the ancestors of Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Xavier. In this incarnation, he is shown to be particularly vulnerable to Cyclops's optic blasts.
* Mister Sinister was set to appear in a [[Secret Wars]] episode of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man The Animated Series]]''. His appearance was canceled due to the decision to pull the X-Men cast (save for Storm) from the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/retrospective/x-men/part6.php |title=Marvel Animation Age |publisher=Marvel.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>
* Producer [[Boyd Kirkland]] of ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'', suggested that had the show been renewed for a fifth season it was possible that Sinister could have appeared.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Before the series was canceled, Sinister was set to appear in an issue of the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' comic book spin-off.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The cover for issue #10 features Mister Sinister.
* Mister Sinister first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "eXcessive Force" voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. This version of Sinister is described by Cyclops to be a mutant instead of a mutation. He has his Marauders collect Mutant DNA by force in his plot to create "the Ultimate Mutant". When Cyclops targets each Marauder in succession, based on the faint hope that Mister Sinister kidnapped Jean Grey, Sinister has [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]] fake a confession to lead Scott into a trap. During the confrontation, Mister Sinister states that he does not have Jean Grey. When the other X-Men arrive, Sinister escapes, leaving Multiple Man to deal with the X-Men. He later appears in the episode "Guardian Angel", where he turns Angel into Archangel after Angel's wings are injured in an encounter with the MRD and are ordered to be cut off by Angel's father. In the episode "Shades of Grey", he has Archangel capture Jean Grey and Cyclops, leading to a fight between the X-Men and the Marauders. In the final scene, it is revealed that he is working for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. At the end of the episode "Foresight (Part 3)", he is shown with the "Age of Apocalypse" version of Cyclops in a future ruled by Apocalypse.

He later uses specific drugs to turn Angel into Archangel. He later fights the X-Men alongside Dark Beast. When Apocalypse was defeated, it was shown at the end that Mister Sinister was the one who had sabotaged the machine. Mister Sinister has special dialogue with Nightcrawler (when encountered on Genosha) and Storm (before the fight with him and Dark Beast). During his dialogue with Nightcrawler, Mister Sinister mentioned how he had wanted to combine Nightcrawler's teleportation powers and Cyclops' optic energy beams to see what the resulting creation might turn out. Such creatures are indeed encountered later in the New York City levels.

Although Deadpool doesn't have a clue as to what Sinister is up to, what he's trying to accomplish is revealed in the details the player overhears. Sinister wishes to push the populace of Earth to genetic perfection; however, as Cable explains, this would cause destruction to the world. Sinister has an army of clones created from mutants, which he uses as his army. He also has clones of himself, and back ups of Vertigo, Blockbuster and Arclight. Two clones of himself are killed by Deadpool, who is ticked off by the joke repeating. After Deadpool destroys his facilities and prevents him from harvesting the genetics of dead mutants, Sinister confronts him, only to be smashed by a Sentinel foot flown by Deadpool's dog.
