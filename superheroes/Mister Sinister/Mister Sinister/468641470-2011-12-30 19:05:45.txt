==Publication history==
===Creation===

Writer [[Chris Claremont]] conceived Mister Sinister as a new villain for the [[X-Men]], having felt "tired of just going back to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and the same old same old" Claremont recalled:

{{blockquote|"[[Dave Cockrum]] and I were over ideas and what we were coming towards was a mysterious young boy - apparently an 11-year-old - at the orphanage where Scott ([[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]) was raised, who turned out to be the secret master of the place. In effect what we were setting up was a guy who was aging over a lifespan of roughly a thousand years. Even though he looked like an 11-year-old, he'd actually been alive since the mid-century at this point - he was actually about 50 [...] He had all the grown up urges. He's growing up in his mind but his body isn't capable of handling it, which makes him quite cranky. And, of course, looking like an 11-year-old, who'd take him seriously in the criminal community? [...] So he built himself an agent in a sense, which was Mister Sinister, that was, in effect, the rationale behind Sinister's rather - for want of a better word - childish or kid-like appearance. The costume... the look... the face... it's what would scare a child. Even when he was designed, he wasn't what you'd expect in a guy like that." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?p=1411447#post1411447 |title=comixfan.com |publisher=comixfan.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>}}

===1980s===

Mister Sinister [[first appearance|debuted]] in the title ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', briefly mentioned by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] during the ''[[Mutant Massacre]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] as the leader of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] who had sent them to slaughter the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] population.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #212 (Dec. 1986)</ref> In the following issue, the X-Men member [[Psylocke]] picks up a shadowy mental image of the Marauders' "Master" from Sabretooth's mind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #213 (Jan. 1987)</ref> Mister Sinister finally appeared on-panel in issue #221 (Sept. 1987). The character plays a major role in the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' crossover,<ref name="Uncanny241">''Uncanny X-Men'' #241 (Dec. 1988)</ref> where it is revealed that Sinister cloned [[Madelyne Pryor]] from [[Jean Grey]] for the purpose of her to mate with Cyclops and produce a child, their son Nathan;<ref name="Uncanny241"/> Sinister also reveals to have manipulated Cyclops' life since early childhood. After a battle with the X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the villain is apparently destroyed by Cyclops' optic beam.<ref>''X-Factor'' #39 (April 1989)</ref>

''[[Classic X-Men]]'' #41–42 (Dec. 1989) details the role Mister Sinister played in Cyclops' life at the orphanage in [[Nebraska]]. The story features a boy named Nathan who is obsessively fixated on Cyclops — and whom Claremont intended to actually be Mister Sinister. However as Claremont left the ''X-Men'' comics, this origin was never revealed in-story.<ref>{{cite web|author=November 23, 2006 @ 01:39 AM |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/23/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-78/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #78 &#124; Comics Should Be Good! @ Comic Book Resources |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date=2006-11-23 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

===1990s===
Mister Sinister returns in the title ''X-Factor'', leading the [[Nasty Boys]] <ref>''X-Factor'' #74–75 (Jan. – Feb. 1992)</ref> and has allied himself with the mutant terrorist [[Stryfe]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #78 (May 1992)</ref> In the crossover ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'', the character impersonates Apocalypse and uses his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] to capture Cyclops and Jean Grey.<ref>''X-Factor'' #84 (Nov. 1992)</ref> Sinister hands them over to Stryfe in exchange for a canister containing his genetic material,<ref>''X-Men'' #14 (Nov. 1992)</ref> but finds it empty, unknowingly unleashing the [[Legacy Virus]] in the process.<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' #18 (Jan. 1993)</ref> Afterwards, Sinister confronts Cyclops to reveal that the canister contained the deadly [[Legacy Virus]]. It was during this conversation, that Sinister said, "I care enough to wish you and your brothers to be protected from this illness", but he corrected himself in saying that he meant "brother".<ref>''X-Men'' #23 (Aug. 1993)</ref>

In 1996, Mister Sinister's [[origin story]] was told in the [[limited series]], ''[[The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]''. It established the character as '''Nathaniel Essex''', a scientist from the 19th century obsessed with evolution who made a pact with the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to become a virtually immortal being.<ref>''The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1–4 (June – Sept. 1996)</ref> It is furthermore established that Mister Sinister created Cyclops' son Nathan (who became the time-traveling soldier [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]) to destroy Apocalypse.<ref>''Cable Annual'' '99</ref>

It was also revealed that Sinister had initiated the Morlock Massacre because he saw his signature in them (as many of them were experiments of [[Dark Beast]], a student of the Age of Apocalypse's Mr. Sinister) and he would not allow unauthorized use of his theories, so they were slaughtered.<ref name="Cable28">'' Cable'' vol. 1 #28</ref> Though some of his Marauders did not survive the battle, many of them returned thanks to Sinister's genetics mastery and the fact that he had multiple clones of all of them.<ref name="X-Men34">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #34</ref> He also considered doing the same with the Genosha mutates, who were experiments of [[Sugar Man]] (another student of his Age of Apocalypse counterpart). Yet in the end he did not because the mutates were sterile and so in his opinion, they were not a tainting of his work.<ref name="Cable28"/>

Another running storyline for the character was his mysterious ties to the X-Man Gambit; these ties were first introduced in ''X-Men'' v2 #6 when Sabretooth encounted Gambit and the X-Men and implied that the two had a history working together.<ref>''X-Men'' #6</ref> When Rogue briefly absorbed Gambit's memories,<ref>''X-Men'' #41-45</ref> she realized the relationship between the two: that Gambit had been an agent of Mister Sinister, recruiting Sabretooth and several other villains, to serve as Sinister's Marauders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #350</ref> Furthermore, he had served as a guide for the group in the tunnels, before abandoning the villains upon discovering their plans on wiping out the Morlocks. His payment for these deeds would be Mister Sinister's services as a scientist, to correct a genetic defect regarding Gambit's powers that was causing him to slowly lose control over them.<ref>''Gambit'' 13-15</ref>

===2000s===
Mister Sinister appears in the title ''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'';<ref>''Gambit'' #14-23</ref> besides revealing the connection between the two characters, Mister Sinister would provide Gambit with a chemical compound designed to neutralize the genetic modification process that the Skrulls were using as part of their infiltration process of Earth, as the alien shapeshifters had formed an alliance with Apocalypse to conquer Earth.<ref>''Gambit'' 23, ''Uncanny X-Men'' #375</ref> It was also revealed that Mister Sinister had genetically altered the villain "The Living Monolith", allowing him to access Havok's power, in order to serve as replacement for Havok in Apocalypse's plan to harvest the power of "The Twelve".{{issue|date=November 2011}} Following Apocalypse's defeat, Sinister attempts to use the [[High Evolutionary]]'s space station to mutate the human population but is stopped by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #99</ref>

Sinster's actions would have world wide repercussions: by helping High Evolutionary strip all of mutantkind of their powers, Sinister unknowingly wiped out a community of evolved mutants known as "The Neo".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 380</ref> The surviving Neo began hunting Sinister down, forcing Sinister to go into hiding as the Neo known as Domino (whose daughter was one of the dead) kills over 17 Sinister dopplegangers left behind by Sinister as he goes into hiding.<ref>''X-Men'' #103</ref>

Sinister would resurface in the pages of ''[[Weapon X]]'', experimenting on mutants under the guise of Dr. Robert Windsor.{{issue|date=November 2011}} It is revealed that the character [[Nazi human experimentation|worked alongside the Nazis]] during [[World War II]].{{issue|date=November 2011}} He would be accompanied by the Marauder Scalphunter in the series, with Scalphunter serving as his bodyguard.

Mister Sinister reappears in ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]'' crossover, sending the Marauders and [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] out to murder all those who have knowledge of the future;<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203</ref> In the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'' crossover, Sinister, leading a mob of many of the remaining evil mutants, seeks out the first mutant child born since [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] (also known as "M-Day", when the Scarlet Witch de-powered most of the world's mutant population). However, the character is killed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] who presses his face onto an unconscious [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], whose powers had been amplified into an instantaneous death-touch.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #46</ref>

====Miss Sinister====
[[image:Miss sinister.png|Miss Sinister. Art by Scot Eaton.|thumb]]
The title ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' reveals that Mister Sinister had predicted his own death putting in motion events that would lead for his resurrection. His consciousness and powers were transferred to a machine that would activate itself after his death.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #211</ref> Sinister manages to take control of Professor Xavier's body to save him from a gunshot wound.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #213</ref> However, the combined efforts of [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and Gambit destroys the machine, enabling Xavier to successfully drive Sinister's consciousness from his mind and body. At the end, a female character appears called "'''Miss Sinister'''".<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #214</ref> Her name is revealed to be Claudine Renko, and she possesses telepathy and a healing factor similar to Sinister, but not the memories or mind due to the fact that she was a clone of Mister Sinister.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #217</ref>

Claudine later on approaches Gambit and [[X-23]], the latter having left the X-Men's base to strike out on her own seemingly asking for the former's help. Claudine at this point seems to be suffering from injuries earlier inflicted by Wolverine's son, Daken. A near fatal strike from X-23 reveals the nature of the injury as Claudine's body morphs into that of Mister Sinister. <ref>''X-23'' #5</ref>

X-23, flanked by Gambit, encountered a young girl named Alice and witnessed her being murdered though the next day Alice appeared to them somehow alive. Encouraging them to follow her to a peculiar desert laboratory, Alice introduces them to her employer/owner/adoptive mother: Claudine. Revealing herself openly to X-23, Claudine explains that Alice is also a clone, fourth of a series of five created by Essex as another experiment alongside several other children that live in the complex. She then expands upon her own origins, stating that the process of becoming what she is left her with vague, but invasive memories of Essex's life and that as a malignant presence within her mind, he is slowly killing her as a means of self-ressurection, he even manges to manifest briefly before being re-absorbed back into her. Claudine then incapacitates Gambit and straps X-23 to a peculiar chair, stating her aim to switch their bodies - thus inheriting Laura's Healing factor, something she'd wanted after her stabbing, and thereby freeing herself of Essex. The plan backfires when Essex in fact controls Laura's body and uses her to mortally wound Claudine again. Laura manages to overcome Essex presence in her mind, expelling it through force of will. Laura, Alice and Gambit manage to escape the laboratory as it collapses and arrange for the children to be given new homes before setting off on their journey again. However in the wreckage left behind, Claudine is still alive, although just barely and is being watched over by the fifth Alice Clone - the new host of Essex.{{Issue|date=December 2011}}

===2010s===
Now dressed in Victorian era garb, Mr. Sinister resurfaced in the pages of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #544. In ''Uncanny X-Men'' v2 #1, he merges with the Dreaming Celestial and warps its head to match his own and uses the power he gained as a result, to turn San Francisco's residents into dopplegangers of himself.

==Powers and abilities==
Mister Sinister is a genetically altered human with superhuman physical and mental abilities. The character is telepathic, able to manipulate the minds of others in various ways, and is capable of [[List of comic book superpowers#Energy blasts|energy projection]] through [[telekinesis]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #39</ref> Using genetic material from the mutant [[Courier (comics)|Courier]], Mister Sinister gained complete control of his body at the cellular level, allowing him to [[List of comic book superpowers#Shapeshifting|shape-shift]],<ref>''Gambit'' #14</ref> [[List of comic book superpowers#Accelerated healing|regenerate]] <ref name="X-Men #23">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #23</ref> and be virtually immune to injuries.<ref name="X-Men #23"/><ref>''X-Force'' #16</ref> The character has exhibited the ability to teleport, though [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] believes this is accomplished through his [[tesseract]] headquarters.<ref name="X-Men34"/>

Mister Sinister is also a scientific [[genius]], with expertise in the fields of [[biology]], [[genetics]], [[cloning]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. The character is a master manipulator and planner, with decades of genetic research at his command. He can sometimes be out of date in his research, such as going to great lengths to preserve his powers and personality through elaborate technological means such as conditioning certain children to be his 'hosts' in the event of his future death when the later discovery of cloning technology would make such a plan relatively pointless, as noted by Sebastian Shaw.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[fictional crossover]] event "[[Age of Apocalypse]]", Mister Sinister is one of Apocalypse's [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] and the foster father of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]].<ref>''Tales from the Age of Apocolypse - Sinister Bloodlines''</ref>

Mr Sinister shows himself to be capable of turning into an exact duplicate of Gambit, a power he uses to kill Rogue when the X-Men seek to rescue the kids. In the end, Mystique murders Mr. Sinister, avenging her adopted daughter's death.

===X-Men/Spider-Man===
Mister Sinister appeared as the main antagonist in the four issue limited series '''X-Men/Spider-Man'''. In the first issue, set in the 1960s comics, he hires [[Kraven the Hunter]], who, along with the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], fight Spider-Man and the original X-Men.

After fighting Spider-Man and the X-Men, only to be confronted by Spider-Man about his lack of honor compared to his template, Xraven battles Mister Sinister.<ref>''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #4</ref> It is unknown whether Sinister or Xraven won the battle.

===X-Men Forever===

In the ''X-Men Forever'' series, Essex is still an immortal over a century old. However, he is stuck in the body of a ten-year old child. Sinister is actually a combination of armored suit/hologram used by Essex to command the Maurauders, reasoning no one would follow his true appearance. He poses as a child at a science lab that uses young mutants and targets Scott Summer's son, Chris. The series ends with Chris being kidnapped on orders from Sinister.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Mister Sinister appears in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Britton (voice actor)|Christopher Britton]]. As in the comics, he is a scientist obsessed with Cyclops and Jean Grey's genetics, claiming to have watched them all their lives. He leads the [[Nasty Boys]] and the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. He sees little value in Xavier's dream for co-existence or Magneto's preparations for war, instead believing that the goal should be pushing mutants to the next stage of their mutations. He is responsible for reviving [[Morph (comics)#X-Men: The Animated Series|Morph]] and intended to use him to destroy the X-Men. The episode "Descent" reveals Mister Sinister's origin. Instead of being remade by Apocalypse, Essex's own experimentations during the Victorian era are what made him into Mister Sinister. (He is also shown to have known the ancestors of Cyclops, Jean Grey and Xavier.)

* The character was set to appear in a [[Secret Wars]] episode of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man The Animated Series]]''. His appearance was cancelled due to the decision to pull the X-Men cast (save for Storm) from the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/retrospective/x-men/part6.php |title=Marvel Animation Age |publisher=Marvel.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

* Producer [[Boyd Kirkland]] of ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'', suggested that had the show been renewed for a 5th Season it was possible that Sinister could have appeared. Before being canceled, Sinister was set to appear in an issue of the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' comic book spin-off. The cover for issue #10 features Mister Sinister.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

* Mister Sinister first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "eXcessive Force" voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. This version of Sinister is described by Cyclops to be a mutant instead of a mutate. He has his Marauders collect Mutant DNA by force in his plot to create "the Ultimate Mutant". When Cyclops targets each Marauder in succession, based on the faint hope that Mister Sinister kidnapped Jean Grey, Sinister has [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]] fake a confession to lead Scott into a trap. During the confrontation, Mister Sinister states that he doesn't have Jean Grey. When the other X-Men arrive, Sinister escapes, leaving Multiple Man to deal with the X-Men. He later appears in "Guardian Angel" where he turns Angel into Archangel after Angel's wings are injured in an encounter with the MRD and are ordered to be cut off by Angel's father. In "Shades of Grey", he has Archangel capture Jean Grey and Cyclops, leading to a fight between the X-Men and the Marauders. In the final scene, it is revealed that he is working for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. At the end of "Foresight (Part 3)", he is shown with [[Nate Grey]] in a future ruled by Apocalypse.

===Film===
* In ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', Nathaniel Essex's name appears on the files when Mystique is browsing around on [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s computer.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Video games===
* Mister Sinister appears in ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Corey Smith]]. He appears as a prison warden for a mutant detention center known as The Void. He orders a cyborg-like female commander named May Deuce and her soldiers to track down [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (who infiltrated The Void) and escaped mutants [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Omega Red]], and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He also is seen as a henchman to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who orders him to "make preparations for his horsemen" in the game's last cutscene.
* Mister Sinister appears in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Daniel Riordan]]. He is shown as a servant of Apocalypse and was experimenting on Genoshan prisoners. Mister Sinister has an AI Computer based on him at Apocalypse's Infinite Factory which creates holographic "Sinister" versions of Cyclops, Iceman, Storm, and Wolverine. He later uses specific drugs to turn Angel into Archangel. He later fights the X-Men alongside Dark Beast. When Apocalypse was defeated, it was shown at the end that Mister Sinister was the one who had sabotaged the machine. Mister Sinister has special dialogue with Nightcrawler (when encountered on Genosha) and Storm (before the fight with him and Dark Beast). During his dialogue with Nightcrawler, Mister Sinister mentioned how he had wanted to combine Nightcrawler's teleportation powers and Cyclops' optic energy beams to see what the resulting creation might turn out.
* Nathaniel Essex is mentioned in the ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' video game adaptation.
