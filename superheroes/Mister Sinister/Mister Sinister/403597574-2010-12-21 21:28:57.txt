==Publication history==
=== Creation ===

Writer [[Chris Claremont]] conceived Mister Sinister as a new villain for the [[X-Men]], having felt "tired of just going back to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and the same old same old" Claremont recalled:

{{blockquote|"[[Dave Cockrum]] and I were over ideas and what we were coming towards was a mysterious young boy - apparently an 11-year-old - at the orphanage where Scott ([[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]) was raised, who turned out to be the secret master of the place. In effect what we were setting up was a guy who was aging over a lifespan of roughly a thousand years. Even though he looked like an 11-year-old, he'd actually been alive since the mid-century at this point - he was actually about 50 [...] He had all the grown up urges. He's growing up in his mind but his body isn't capable of handling it, which makes him quite cranky. And, of course, looking like an 11-year-old, who'd take him seriously in the criminal community? [...] So he built himself an agent in a sense, which was Mister Sinister, that was, in effect, the rationale behind Sinister's rather - for want of a better word - childish or kid-like appearance. The costume... the look... the face... it's what would scare a child. Even when he was designed, he wasn't what you'd expect in a guy like that." <ref>http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?p=1411447#post1411447</ref>}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Mister Sinister appears in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Britton (voice actor)|Christopher Britton]]. As in the comics, he is a scientist obsessed with Cyclops and Jean Grey's genetics, claiming to have watched them all their lives. He leads the [[Nasty Boys]] and the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. He sees little value in Xavier's dream for co-existence or Magneto's preparations for war, instead believing that the goal should be pushing mutants to the next stage of their mutations. He is responsible for reviving [[Morph (comics)#X-Men: The Animated Series|Morph]] and intended to use him to destroy the X-Men. The episode "Descent" reveals Mister Sinister's origin. Instead of being remade by Apocalypse, Essex's own experimentations during the Victorian era are what made him into Mister Sinister. (He is also shown to have known the ancestors of Cyclops, Jean Grey and Xavier.)

* The character was set to appear in a [[Secret Wars]] episode of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man The Animated Series]]''. His appearance was cancelled due to the decision to pull the X-Men cast (save for Storm) from the story.<ref>[http://marvel.toonzone.net/retrospective/x-men/part6.php Marvel Animation Age<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* Producer [[Boyd Kirkland]] of ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'', suggested that had the show been renewed for a 5th Season it was possible that Sinister could have appeared. Before being canceled, Sinister was set to appear in an issue of the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' comic book spin-off. The cover for issue #10 features Mister Sinister.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

* Mister Sinister first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "eXcessive Force" voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. This version of Sinister is described by Cyclops to be a mutant instead of a mutate. He has his Marauders collect Mutant DNA by force in his plot to create "the Ultimate Mutant". When Cyclops targets each Marauder in succession, based on the faint hope that Mister Sinister kidnapped Jean Grey, Sinister has [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]] fake a confession to lead Scott into a trap. During the confrontation, Mister Sinister states that he doesn't have Jean Grey. When the other X-Men arrive, Sinister escapes, leaving Multiple Man to deal with the X-Men. He later appears in "Guardian Angel" where he turns Angel into Archangel after Angel's wings are injured in an encounter with the MRD and are ordered to be cut off by Angel's father. In "Shades of Grey", he has Archangel capture Jean Grey and Cyclops, leading to a fight between the X-Men and the Marauders. In the final scene, it is revealed that he is working for Apocalypse. At the end of "Foresight (Part 3)", he is shown with Cyclops in a future ruled by Apocalypse.

* In ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', Nathaniel Essex's name appears on the files when Mystique is browsing around on [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s computer.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Video games===
* Mister Sinister appears in ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Corey Smith]]. He appears as a prison warden for a mutant detention center known as The Void. He orders a cyborg-like female commander named May Deuce and her soldiers to track down [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (who infiltrated The Void) and escaped mutants [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Omega Red]], and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He also is seen as a henchman to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who orders him to "make preparations for his horsemen" in the game's last cutscene.
* Mister Sinister appears in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Daniel Riordan]]. He is shown as a servant of Apocalypse and was experimenting on Genoshan prisoners. Mister Sinister has an AI Computer based on him at Apocalypse's Infinite Factory which creates holographic "Sinister" versions of Cyclops, Iceman, Storm, and Wolverine. He later uses specific drugs to turn Angel into Archangel. He later fights the X-Men alongside Dark Beast. When Apocalypse was defeated, it was shown at the end that Mister Sinister was the one who had sabotaged the machine. Mister Sinister has special dialogue with Nightcrawler (when encountered on Genosha) and Storm (before the fight with him and Dark Beast). During his dialogue with Nightcrawler, Mister Sinister mentioned how he had wanted to combine Nightcrawler's teleportation powers and Cyclops' optic energy beams to see what the resulting creation might turn out.
* Nathaniel Essex is mentioned in the ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' video game adaptation.
