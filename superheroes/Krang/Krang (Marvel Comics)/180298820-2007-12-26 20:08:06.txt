'''Warlord Krang''' is a [[fictional character]], in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was an high-ranking member of the [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] military.

==Fictional character biography==
Warlord Krang was a leader of the Atlantean military who rose to prominence during the time in which [[Namor]], the Prince of Atlantis was missing. Upon Namor's return, Krang's Bride to be the [[Lady Dorma]] deserts him for Namor bringing a great hatred for Namor from Krang. When Namor attempted shortly thereafter to conquer the city of [[New York]] he made Krang his second in command, however Namor stopped the invasion in order to save [[Sue Storm]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Feeling that Namor had betrayed his own people to save an enemy, Krang was angered and seized control of the throne from Namor, forcing the Prince to prove himself on a quest, made additionally difficult by traps set by Krang. Upon Namor's return Krang was dethroned and exiled.

Krang would soon return and kidnap Lady Dorma, as well as tricking Namor into believing that she had left willingly and betrayed him. Fleeing to the surface world with Dorma he would come into conflict with the armored avenger [[Iron Man]] until Namor finally caught up with him, exiling him once more. When [[Byrrah]], Namor's evil brother seized the throne of Atlantis, he would invite Krang back to enjoy his former position. This however was short lived and soon Krang was forced to flee yet again.

After this he would attempt to steal the [[Serpent Crown]], a powerful object, which would make him nearly invincible. These efforts however were thwarted by Namor and [[Captain America]] (who called himself [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] at the time). Krang was driven fully insane. When Namor spent much time on the surface world allied with [[Doctor Doom]], Krang once more seized control of Atlantis. Stealing the Trumpet Horn of Namor, he summoned the great beast Gargantus, to defeat the returning Namor, but it was soundly defeated by the Prince, while his ally, Dr. Doom, beat Krang within an inch of his life with a neuro-shock blade.

==Powers and abilities==
Krang possesses the ability to breathe underwater through a set of gills as can all Atlanteans, however just like other Atlanteans, he cannot breathe above water without the aid of special tanks. Other than this he has no extra-human abilities however he is a brilliant strategist with a diabolic cunning as well as an expert fencer.  His weapons include an electrically charged sword known as a neuro-shock blade, a chemical which changes his skin from blue to pink and allows him to breathe surface air through lungs (although when using this he loses his ability to breathe beneath the waves), and various other items which he has usually stolen such as the trumpet horn, and the serpent crown. In his exile he controls an army made up of remnants of Byrrah's and [[Attuma]]'s armies, as well as a few surface men.
