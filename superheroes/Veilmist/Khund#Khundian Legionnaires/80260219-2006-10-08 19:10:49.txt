In the [[DC Universe]], the '''Khunds''' are a [[fictional]] [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien race]] notable for extreme violence. Extreme enemies of the [[Thanagarian]]s because of their planetary closeness (''Legends''), they are sworn enemies. They superficially resemble [[human]]s, but are much larger, with pale [[magenta]] skin, the concept possibly derived from [[Ghengis Khan]].
