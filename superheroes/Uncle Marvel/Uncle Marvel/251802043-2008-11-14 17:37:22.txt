'''Uncle Marvel''' is a [[fictional character]] derived from the [[DC Comics]] (formerly [[Fawcett Comics]]) character [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Actually an old, rotund man named Dudley, Uncle Marvel does not have any real superpowers, unlike the rest of the [[Marvel Family]]. Claiming to be [[Mary Bromfield]]'s uncle, Dudley attempted to con his way into the Marvel Family. The Marvels, possessing the wisdom of [[Solomon]], saw right through Dudley's mechanations, but since he was, in their opinion, such a "loveable old fraud", they allowed Dudley to join the team as their manager, Uncle Marvel, and humored his pretense of having Marvel powers. Dudley/Uncle Marvel was modeled after [[United States|American]] [[actor]] [[W.C. Fields]].

The current, [[post-Crisis]] version of Uncle Marvel, introduced in [[Jerry Ordway]]'s ''[[Power of Shazam!]]'' [[graphic novel]], does not claim (or want) to be a superhero. He is simply '''Mr. Dudley''' (full name Dudley H. Dudley), the [[janitor]] at Billy Batson's school, Binder Junior High School. He inadvertedly learns that Billy has the power to transform into Captain Marvel by saying the magic word "Shazam!", and Dudley soon finds himself involved in a number of Captain Marvel's adventures. In the ''Power of Shazam'' series, Dudley was usually paired with Mr. Tawky Tawny, a talking [[anthropomorphic]] [[tiger]].  He was temporarily bestowed the powers of a Marvel in ''Power of Shazam!'' #11-12, in order to help the Marvels confront the [[seven deadly sins|Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]] and the demoness [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]].
