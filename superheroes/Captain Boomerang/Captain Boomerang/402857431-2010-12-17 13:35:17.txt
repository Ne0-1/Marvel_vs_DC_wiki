==Fictional character biographies==
===Digger Harkness===
====Early life====
Secretly the illegitimate son of an [[United States|American]] soldier and an [[Australia]]n woman, Harkness was raised in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making [[boomerang]]s, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.

Although he lacked any actual superhuman abilities, he became a recurring enemy of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects (some would explode, others had razor-sharp edges, etc.), and using them ruthlessly. He became a staple member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], a group of villains dedicated to opposing Flash.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Throughout the first several years of the character's existence, Captain Boomerang spoke with no discernible accent. Beginning in the late 1980s he developed an Australian accent.

====Suicide Squad====
Later on, Harkness became a less-than-effective member of the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for being pardoned for his crimes.<ref name="dc-ency"/> However, Captain Boomerang's grating personality and blatant racism (among other things, he constantly referred to black team member [[Bronze Tiger]] as an "abbo") caused considerable friction among his teammates, and he was considered to be a dangerous, vicious, cowardly and undependable member of the team—dysfunctional even by the Squad's standards and the equivalent of a [[class clown]].
[[Image:CB 117.jpg|left|thumb|George Harkness as Captain Boomerang on the cover of ''Flash'' #117.]]

[[Amanda Waller]], the Squad's commanding officer, characterized Captain Boomerang as "a jerk and a screw-up." This was not an undeserved reputation, as, among other things, Harkness simply watched as his teammate [[Mindboggler]] was shot in the back, even while he could have easily saved her. (Mindboggler had earlier used her mind-manipulating abilities on Harkness to shut him up when he was verbally abusing another team member.) He also manipulated another team member, [[Slipknot (comics)|Slipknot]], into running away from the action just to see if the explosive bracelets the Squad members wore really did activate if the wearer attempted to escape. (Unfortunately for Slipknot, they did). He was scared to learn Ifrit, an artificial intelligence used by the rival team the Jihad, had been created based upon Mindboggler's thought patterns, and revealed what had happened.

While in the Squad, Harkness also briefly took up the mantle of [[Mirror Master]] to commit robberies.<ref name="dc-ency"/> However, this career was cut short when he was caught and brought to Waller, who put an end to it by tricking him into a fake assault scene where he was forced to change constantly between Mirror Master and Captain Boomerang. She rescinded the benefits Harkness had been given such as his apartment in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and his status as a voluntary member of the Squad.

Many times Digger would have to be tricked into battle, but when faced with enemies he proved more than competent in upholding his end of the fight. Harkness also would play a few undercover roles for the squad, convincingly managing to be other slimy, criminal types. Later, Digger would try a simple series of pranks for amusement, hitting various members of the Squad with pies. For a time, suspicion had been diverted from him because had used his skills to pie himself, seemingly being hit by the 'assailant' from behind a wall. When the Squad confronted Digger as the culprit, he lost his temper and shouted that they couldn't really punish him since he was already in prison and in the Suicide Squad. He asked Waller, "What are you going to do about it, Fat Lady?!" Waller dropped him from a helicopter onto a deserted island.

Due to various events, mainly Waller breaking many rules by having a criminal gang ruthlessly gunned down, the Squad broke up for a year. When Waller was approached again because she was needed, she reformed the team and had Digger picked up. He was, at the time, trying to construct a massive boomerang to take him to mainland.

Harkness revealed a deep patriotism for his home country of Australia, though his countrymen do not care at all for him, and a tremendous fear of being laughed at. Teammate Deadshot commented he often wished he had killed Harkness, most notably after his drinking left them to miss a plane and to Deadshot losing his uniform and entering a depressive phase because of it. Ironically, when Boomerang pulled strings to have the suit restored to Deadshot, Lawton's psyche had passed into a phase that led him to loathe it. Harkness remained with the Squad until it was disbanded after a successful mission in Diabloverde.

However, despite being a somewhat trusted employee, Harkness still was quite amoral and greedy, selling out Adam Cray, the Atom, for half a million dollars.

====Other appearances====
Digger later showed up in ''Superboy'' with another Squad. While on a mission to destroy an underwater criminal hideout, he was shot through the hands by Deadshot and apparently fell to his death.

He later appeared in the pages of ''Flash'' with cybernetic hands. Alongside four other Rogues, given a chance by fellow Rogue [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] to become much more than they ever were. Unfortunately for Captain Boomerang, [[Captain Cold]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], [[Weather Wizard]], and [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], Kababra's promise of glory was actually a ruse to free [[Neron]] and empower himself. Neron then resurrects the five Rogues, superpowering them and sending then on a bloody rampage that destroys much of Flash's hometown and kills thousands. Eventually, the Flash and [[Linda Park]] free the Rogues; the dead are restored to life.

After being restored to life, Boomerang and the Rogues, along with the [[Trickster (comics)#James Jesse|Trickster]], sought out an artifact that would protect them from Neron should he ever take an interest in them again. The Trickster accompanied them to help an old ex-girlfriend recover her kidnapped son. In the end, the Trickster found the boy, who turned out to not only be the prophesied agent of a god, but also the Trickster's son. He was also able to convince Neron to leave the Rogues alone, with the Rogues either coming away darker from their experiences, or seeking enlightenment, like Heat Wave, who retired with the monks.

Captain Boomerang is also involved with the [[Joker: Last Laugh]] event. After having suffered a mishap with one of his exploding boomerangs, Digger is transferred by ambulance to Keystone City. En route, the ambulance is attacked by a Jokerized [[Deadshot]], who decides to lend his old pal a hand by injecting him with Joker's serum. The serum's healing factor revives Digger, who is cured of his massive full-body burns and ready to attack the Flash at [[Iron Heights]] prison. However, once there, he is choked unconscious by a Jokerized [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].

====''Identity Crisis''====
{{Main|Identity Crisis (comics)}}

Captain Boomerang was killed in the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries by [[Jack Drake]], father of [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]. Digger had been sent by the [[Jean Loring|real killer]] to attack Jack Drake, only the killer double-crossed Digger and sent Drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself; the killer later defended the action by saying that Boomerang was hired because he was such an incompetent that Jack would only need to pull the trigger and he would be safe. Digger managed to kill Drake but not before he was shot himself.<ref>''Identity Crisis'' #5 (October 2004)</ref>

===="Rogue War"====
Digger was later temporarily revived by Agent James Jesse, the former [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], during the "Rogue War" storyline, when Jesse used unspecified technology to temporarily revive Boomerang in an attempt to find out information about the Rogues' current hideout. However, Jesse was called away due to the latest attack by the Rogues before Harkness's revival, meaning that the only person present when Harkness was briefly reanimated was Ashley Zolomon, the estranged wife of [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]] (a former [[Reverse-Flash]]), who had been brought in based on her expertise in dealing with Rogues. During his brief return to life, Harkness asked Ashley to tell his son that he loved him and warn him never to reveal his mother's real name out of fear that the Rogues would kill him.

===="Blackest Night"====
In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, his remains are reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], and he joins the reanimated Jack and Janet Drake, John and Mary Grayson, [[Tony Zucco]], and the original Batman's deceased rogues gallery members in an attempt to take the life of the current [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. They are met with interference from [[Deadman]], who had possessed the body of the demon [[Etrigan]]. Their attack is ultimately called off when Batman and Red Robin cryogenically freeze themselves, leaving no emotions for the Black Lanterns to target.<ref>''Batman: Blackest Night'' #3 (October 2009)</ref>
Harkness later joins other reanimated members of the Rogues to target their still-living members.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)</ref> However, the battle results a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] on both side. Harkness' son, Owen, arrives and takes him away from the battle, believing he can bring his father back.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> Digger convinces his son that he needs to feed upon the living in order to live so Owen lures people (such as newcomer villain Sandblast) to a pit at a construction site where Digger is waiting. The Rogues track Owen down, Captain Cold berating him on how foolish he is to believe Digger's lies. When they discover the remains of a family nearby, Captain Cold reminds Owen that "the Rogues don't kill women or children." He shoves Owen into the pit where Digger rips out his son's heart. A black ring then flies down to make Owen a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Harkness and his son are then encased in ice by Captain Cold.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)</ref> Digger manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life, in full health, and in much better shape then he was at the time of his death. He appears confused as to what has going on before being knocked out by the Flash.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref> 

===="Brightest Day"====
During the [[Brightest Day]] prologue, Digger is seen locked in his [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]] cell.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref> Digger is visited by [[Tim Drake]], whose father, [[Jack Drake]]<ref>''Red Robin'' #15 (August 2010)</ref>, Harkness murdered. Tim tells him if he tries to escape, Tim's looking forward for him, while Tim begins to walk away.<ref>''Red Robin'' #16 (September 2010)</ref> He's given a message from Captain Cold saying that if he wants to be one of the Rogues again, he has to prove it by escaping from prison on his own.<ref>''The Flash'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> After being beaten by guards, Digger is being seen to in the medical bay when he suddenly finds himself able to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact. While not understanding where this new power came from, Digger uses it to escape Iron Heights and attacks the Renegades while they're trying to apprehend Flash for murdering Mirror Monarch. Shortly after, he finds himself confronting a wounded the Flash.<ref>''The Flash'' #3 (June 2010)</ref>

Captain Boomerang is at one point contacted by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]], who instructs him to throw a boomerang at [[Hawk and Dove|Dawn Granger]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> After seeing the vision his powers go out of control, causing him to attack everyone, including his fellow Rogues.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #5 (September 2010)</ref> Afterwards Captain Boomerang sneaks into Iron Heights, where Professor Zoom is locked up. Boomerang released him, in hopes that he might help him better understand his version of the Entity's message. However, Professor Zoom refused to answer and escaped as Digger was confronted by the Rogues.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #7 (December 2010)</ref>

===Owen Mercer===
{{Main|Owen Mercer}}
During the beginning of ''Identity Crisis'', Harkness, now overweight and burnt out, found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains. Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again.

During this time Harkness finally reached out to the son he abandoned, Owen Mercer. The two began to bond when Harkness accepted a contract to kill Robin's father [[Jack Drake]], he succeeded in the contract but was killed by Drake himself. The sudden loss of  Harkness caused Mercer to take up his father's mantle as Captain Boomerang. [[Captain Cold]] took Mercer in as one of the Flash's enemies, the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues Gallery]] because Cold believed his sister, [[Golden Glider]], was  Mercer's mother. It was revealed in [[the Flash]]'s title that Mercer's mother is actually [[Meloni Thawne]] which makes [[Bart Allen]] his half-brother. He has since then reformed and joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] and has attempted to start a relationship with [[Supergirl]], but left the Outsiders to help the Suicide Squad hunt his half-brother Bart's killers. Owen was finally killed by Black Lantern version of his father during the Blackest Night, the Black Lantern version of his father having tricked Owen into providing him with fresh victims in the belief that it would restore him to life.

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Boomerang carries a number of boomerangs in his satchel. He is an expert at throwing the weapons and as well as ordinary Boomerangs he has a number with special properties, including bladed, explosive, incendiary, and electrified boomerangs.

He had also been shown to be able to hurl his body like a boomerang, giving him the ability to cover more ground than just jumping, but not enough to qualify as flight{{Issue|date=January 2010}}.

Upon his resurrection, Digger finds he has the ability to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact. The source of this new power remains unknown.

==In other media==
===Television===
*A character dressed as Captain Boomerang made an appearance in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Eclipsed",  an actor in a commercial the Flash was starring in.

[[Image:Captain boomerang jlu2.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Captain Boomerang in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]
*The George Harkness version of Captain Boomerang appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Task Force X" voiced by [[Donal Gibson]]. as a member of [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X]] led by [[Rick Flag]]. In "Flash and Substance," Captain Boomerang was released from Task Force X as the U.S. Government said he was "reformed." Captain Boomerang joins up with other Central City villains to destroy The Flash. In that episode, he appears in a streamlined, trench-coated version of his traditional costume. In both appearances, Boomerang's character is defined by his fiscal frugality; he almost gives Task Force X away by refusing to part with 75 cents ("75 cents is 75 cents. I'm supposed to throw away money?"), and he badgers his fellow Flash rogues for cost assistance with his giant boomerang.
*In the ''[[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]]'' episode ''Warrior'', [[Chloe Sullivan]] receives a text message from [[Green Arrow]] about a "maniac with boomerangs".
*Captain Boomerang appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster". He is shown in a flashback where he has Flash strapped to a giant boomerang only for Batman to free Flash who defeats Captain Boomerang.
