'''Captain Boomerang''' (George "Digger" Harkness) is a [[fictional character]] in the {{DC Universe}}. The character's son, [[Owen Mercer]], later assumed the title of Captain Boomerang.

==Digger Harkness==
===Early life===
Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an [[Australia]]n woman, Harkness was raised in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making [[boomerang]]s, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.

Although he lacked any actual superhuman abilities, he became a recurring enemy of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects (some would explode, others had razor-sharp edges, etc.), and using them ruthlessly. He became a staple member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues Gallery]], a group of villains dedicated to opposing Flash.

Throughout the first several years of the character's existence, Captain Boomerang spoke with no noticeable accent. Beginning in the late 1980s, possibly as an influence of the then-recent film ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', he developed a cliched Australian accent, which became even thicker and more slang-ridden as his personality was altered for comic effect (see below).

===Suicide Squad===
Later on, Harkness became a less-than-effective member of the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for being pardoned for his crimes. However, Captain Boomerang's grating personality and blatant racism (among other things, he constantly referred to [[African-American]] team member [[Bronze Tiger]] as an "abbo") caused considerable friction among his teammates, and he was considered to be a dangerous, vicious, cowardly and undependable member of the team -- dysfunctional even by the Squad's standards and the equivalent of a [[class clown]].
[[Image:CB 117.jpg|left|thumb|George Harkness as Captain Boomerang on the cover of ''Flash'' #117.]]

[[Amanda Waller]], the Squad's commanding officer, characterized Captain Boomerang as "a jerk and a screw-up." This was not an undeserved reputation, as, among other things, Harkness simply watched as his teammate [[Mindboggler]] was shot in the back. (Mindboggler had earlier used her mind-manipulating abilities on Harkness to shut him up when he was verbally abusing another team member.) He also manipulated another team member, [[Slipknot (comics)|Slipknot]], into running away from the action just to see if the explosive bracelets the Squad members wore really did activate if the wearer attempted to escape. (Unfortunately for Slipknot, they did.)

While in the Squad, Harkness also briefly took up the mantle of [[Mirror Master]] to commit robberies. However, this career was cut short when he was caught and brought to Waller, who put an end to it. She rescinded the benefits Harkness had been given such as his apartment in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and his status as a voluntary member of the Squad. 

Many times Digger would have to be tricked into battle, but when faced with enemies he proved more than competent in upholding his end of the fight. Harkness also would play a few undercover roles for the squad, convincingly managing to be other slimy, criminal types. 

Later, Digger would try a simple series of pranks for amusement, hitting various members of the Squad with pies. For a time, suspicion had been diverted from him because had used his skills to pie himself, seemingly being hit by the 'assailant' from behind a wall.

Due to various events, mainly Waller breaking many rules by having a criminal gang ruthelessly gunned down, the Squad broke up for a year. Digger ended up being dropped onto a deserted island by his Squad allies. When Waller was approached again because she was needed, she reformed the team and had Digger picked up

It was during the series that Harkness revealed a deep patriotism for his home country of Australia, though his countrymen do not care at all for him. Harkness remained with the Squad until it was disbanded.

===Other appearances===
Digger later showed up in ''Superboy'' with another Squad. He was shot through the hands and presumably fell to his death. 

He later appeared in the pages of ''Flash'' with cybernetic hands. Alongside four other Rogues, given a chance by fellow Rogue [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] to become much more than they ever were. Unfortunately for Captain Boomerang, [[Captain Cold]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], [[Weather Wizard]], and [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], Kababra's promise of glory was actually a ruse to free [[Neron]] and empower himself. Neron then resurrected the five Rogues, superpowering them and sending then on a bloody rampage. Eventually, the Flash was able to free the Rogues. 

After being restored to life, Boomerang and the Rogues, along with the [[Trickster (comics)#James Jesse|Trickster]], sought out an artifact that would protect them from Neron should he ever take an interest in them again. The Trickster accompanied them to help an old ex-girlfriend recover her kidnapped son. In the end, the Trickster found the boy, who turned out to not only be the prophesied agent of a god, but also the Trickster's son. He was also able to convince Neron to leave the Rogues alone, with the Rogues either coming away darker from their experiences, or seeking enlightenment, like Heat Wave, who retired with the monks. 

Captain Boomerang was also involved with the Joker: Last Laugh event. After having suffered a mishap with one of his exploding boomerangs, Digger was transferred to Keystone City. En route, the ambulance was attacked by a Jokerized [[Deadshot]], who decided to lend his old pal a hand by injecting him with Joker's serum. The serum's healing factor had Digger up and running, cured of his massive full-body burns, and ready to attack the Flash at [[Iron Heights]] prison. There, he was choked unconscious by a Jokerized [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].

===''Identity Crisis''===
{{main|Identity Crisis (comics)}}

Captain Boomerang was killed in the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries by [[Jack Drake]], father of [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]. Digger had been sent by the [[Jean Loring|real killer]] to attack Jack Drake, only the killer double crossed Digger and sent Drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself. Digger managed to kill Drake but not before he was shot himself.

==Owen Mercer==
{{main|Owen Mercer}}

During the beginning of ''Identity Crisis'', Harkness found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains. Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again.

During this time Harkness finally reached out to the son he abandoned, Owen Mercer.  The two began to bond when Harkness was killed by [[Jack Drake]].  The sudden loss of  Harkness caused Mercer to take up his father's mantle as Captain Boomerang. [[Captain Cold]] took Mercer in as one of the Flash's enemies, the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues Gallery]] because Cold believed his sister, [[Golden Glider]], was  Mercer's mother. It was revealed in [[the Flash]]'s title that Mercer's mother is actually [[Meloni Thawne]] which makes [[Bart Allen]] his half-brother. He has since then reformed and joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] and has attempted to start a relationship with [[Supergirl]], but left the Outsiders to help the Suicide Squad hunt his half-brother Bart's killers.

==Other media==

Harkness has made an appearance in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as a member of [[Task Force X]] led by [[Rick Flag]]. He also appeared later in the episode "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]." In that episode, he appears in a streamlined, trench-coated version of his traditional costume. In both appearances, Boomerang's character is defined by his fiscal frugality; he almost gives Task Force X away by refusing to part with 75 cents, and he badgers his fellow Flash rogues for cost assistance with his giant boomerang. Captain Boomerang also made an appearance in the episode "Eclipsed", though that character is played by an actor in a commercial the Flash was starring in. He is voiced by [[Donal Gibson]].
