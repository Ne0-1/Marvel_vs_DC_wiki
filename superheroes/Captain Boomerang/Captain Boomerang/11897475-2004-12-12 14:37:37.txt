George "Digger" Harkness, alias '''Captain Boomerang''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]]. 

Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an [[Australia]]n woman, Harkness was raised in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making [[boomerang]]s, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.

Although he lacked any actual superhuman abilities, he became a recurring enemy of the [[Flash]], typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects, and using them ruthlessly. He was also a less-than-effective member of the [[Suicide Squad]].

Captain Boomerang was apparently killed in the [[Identity Crisis]] miniseries.
