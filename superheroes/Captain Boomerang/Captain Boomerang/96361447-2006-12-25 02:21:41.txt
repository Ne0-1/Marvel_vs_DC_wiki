'''George "Digger" Harkness''' and his son '''Owen Mercer''', both known as '''Captain Boomerang''', are [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillains]] in the [[DC Universe]].

==Digger Harkness==
===Early life===
Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an [[Australia]]n woman, Harkness was raised in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making [[boomerang]]s, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.

===The Flash===
Although he lacked any actual superhuman abilities, he became a recurring enemy of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects, and using them ruthlessly. He was also a less-than-effective member of the [[Suicide Squad]]. While in the Squad, he briefly took up the mantle of [[Mirror Master]] to commit robberies.

===''Identity Crisis''===
{{main|Identity Crisis (comics)}}
Captain Boomerang was killed in the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries by [[Jack Drake]], father of [[Tim Drake]]. Digger had been sent by the [[Jean Loring|real killer]] to attack Jack Drake, only the killer double crossed Digger and sent Drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself. Digger managed to kill Drake but not before he was shot himself.

==Owen Mercer==
{{main|Owen Mercer}}
During the beginning of ''Identity Crisis'', Harkness found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains. Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again.

During this time Harkness finally reached out to the son he abandoned, Owen Mercer.  The two began to bond when Harkness was killed by [[Jack Drake]].  The sudden loss of  Harkness caused Mercer to take up his father's mantle, and become the second Captain Boomerang. [[Captain Cold]] took Mercer in as one of the Flash's enemies, the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues Gallery]] because Cold believed his sister, [[Golden Glider]], was  Mercer's mother. It was revealed in [[the Flash]]'s title that Mercer's mother is actually [[Meloni Thawne]] which makes [[Bart Allen]], Kid Flash, his half brother. He's since then reformed and joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].

==Other media==

Harkness has made an appearance in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as a member of [[Task Force X]] led by [[Rick Flag]]. He also appeared later in the episode ''Flash and Substance''. In that episode, he appears in a streamlined, trench-coated version of his traditional costume. Harkness also made an appearance in the episode "Eclipsed", though that character is played by an actor in a commercial the Flash was starring in. He is voiced by [[Donal Gibson]].
