==Digger Harkness==

Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an [[Australia]]n woman, Harkness was raised in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making [[boomerang]]s, and in using them as weapons.  As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father.  Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.

Although he lacked any actual superhuman abilities, he became a recurring enemy of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects, and using them ruthlessly.  He was also a less-than-effective member of the [[Suicide Squad]]. While in the Squad, he briefly took up the mantle of [[Mirror Master]] to commit robberies.

Captain Boomerang was killed in the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries by Jack Drake, father of [[Tim Drake]].  His superspeed-possessing son Owen Mercer, whose biological origin is nebulous, became Captain Boomerang II.

During the beginning of Idenity Crisis, Harkness found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains.  Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again.

During this time he felt it was finally time to reach out to the son he never raised, the previously unheard of Owen Mercer.  Until the death of Harkness, the two had bonded, and afterwards Owen was horribly hurt.  Taking up his father's legacy, he became the second Captain Boomerang.  [[Captain Cold]], brother to [[Golden Glider]] (who was believed to be Owen's mother), took Owen in as one of the Rogues.

Though Owen initially had no real attachment to the Rogues (and even voiced various, albeit short, opinions out loud), he grew to enjoy the purpose and sense of family the Rogues offered after finding that his father's body had been stolen for use in a lab (which was later revealed to be part of a plan to get memories from Harkness).

Around this time the Rogue War began, in which the "reformed" Rogues fought the Rogues under Captain Cold.  [[Ashley Zolomon]] is told by Harkness himself (before he permanently dies) that Golden Glider is not Owen's real mother.  Though Captain Cold and Owen have already pondered this out loud, it isn't known until later that [[Meloni Thawne]], descendent of both [[Professor Zoom]] and [[Cobalt Blue]] and mother of Barry's grandson Bart Allen, a.k.a [[Kid Flash]] II (previously Impulse), is Owen's mother.  Apparently, during a fight in which Wally and Barry fight both Zooms on the cosmic threadmill, the fight went through various time periods, one of which being Harkness in his younger villain days.  During the fight, a time bolt from the treadmill struck Harkness, who was taken to the 30th century.

====Note====

''It isn't known whether Meloni had Owen or Bart first, but through this information readers can speculate that Owen and Bart are indeed brothers.  It also isn't sure how Harkness came back in time; if he took Owen with him or if Owen came back some other kind of way; and what are Meloni's feelings to all of this; but readers will have to wait until the story is continued in the ongoing ''Flash'' series.

''Some readers have also wondered how Owen has gained his speed-burst powers.  Some believe that Owen received them from his mother, who is said by some sources to have some latent speed gene assumedly from Zoom, the Thawnes' ancestor, which was awakened by the time bolt that struck Harkness, altering him (albeit minutely), and "awakening" the speed powers in Owen.''

==Other Media==

Captain Boomerang I has made an appearance in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as a member of [[Task Force X]] led by [[Rick Flagg]].  He is voiced by [[Donal Gibson]].
