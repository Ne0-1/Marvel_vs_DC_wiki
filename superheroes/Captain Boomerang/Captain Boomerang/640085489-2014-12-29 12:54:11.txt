'''Captain Boomerang''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s in the {{DC Universe}}, a supervillain traditionally portrayed as an enemy of the Flash. The original Captain Boomerang was named '''George "Digger" Harkness''' until he died and his son '''Owen Mercer''' would later assume the title of Captain Boomerang (both have gone on to be members of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link = Robert Greenberger|contribution = Captain Boomerang|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 66|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

====Early life====
Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an Australian woman, Harkness was raised in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making [[boomerang]]s, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime. He originally became Captain Boomerang as a mascot for a Toy Company and briefly pretended another man was impersonating him, showing his 'parents', (really other crooks) to the Flash after the Flash caught him next to a crime scene. He nearly succeeded in killing Flash after knocking him out with a boomerang, then tying the Flash to a giant boomerang he fired, so that it was sent into space then fell into the ocean, but Flash vibrated so fast and increased the boomerang's velocity so much he was able to free himself from his friction-proof bonds and jail his foe and the two crocs.

Although he lacked any actual talent, he became a recurring enemy of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and the fans, typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects (some would explode, others had razor-sharp edges, etc.), and using them ruthlessly. He became a staple member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], a group of villains dedicated to opposing Flash, and who were first organized after [[Gorilla Grodd]] broke them out of jail. Though captured when Flash made their weapons hit each other, they continued to act together.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Throughout the first several years of the character's existence, Captain Boomerang spoke with an American accent. Beginning in the late 1980s he developed an Australian accent.

====Suicide Squad====
Later on, Harkness became a less-than-effective member of the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for being pardoned for his crimes.<ref name="dc-ency"/> However, Captain Boomerang's grating personality and blatant racism (among other things, he constantly referred to black team member [[Bronze Tiger]] as an "abbo") caused considerable friction among his teammates, and he was considered to be a dangerous, vicious, cowardly and undependable member of the teamâ€”dysfunctional even by the Squad's standards and the equivalent of a [[class clown]].
[[Image:CB 117.jpg|left|thumb|George Harkness as Captain Boomerang on the cover of ''Flash'' #117.]]

[[Amanda Waller]], the Squad's commanding officer, characterized Captain Boomerang as "a jerk and a screw-up." This was not an undeserved reputation, as, among other things, Harkness simply watched as his teammate [[Mindboggler]] was shot in the back, even while he could have easily saved her. (Mindboggler had earlier used her mind-manipulating abilities on Harkness to shut him up when he was verbally abusing another team member.) He also manipulated another team member, [[Slipknot (comics)|Slipknot]], into running away from the action just to see if the explosive bracelets the Squad members wore really did activate if the wearer attempted to escape. (Unfortunately for Slipknot, they did). He was scared to learn Ifrit, an artificial intelligence used by the rival team the Jihad, had been created based upon Mindboggler's thought patterns, and revealed what had happened.

While in the Squad, Harkness also briefly took up the mantle of [[Mirror Master]] to commit robberies.<ref name="dc-ency"/> However, this career was cut short when he was caught and brought to Waller, who put an end to it by tricking him into a fake assault scene where he was forced to change constantly between Mirror Master and Captain Boomerang. She rescinded the benefits Harkness had been given such as his apartment in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and his status as a voluntary member of the Squad.

Many times Digger would have to be tricked into battle, but when faced with enemies he proved more than competent in upholding his end of the fight. Harkness also would play a few undercover roles for the squad, convincingly managing to be other slimy, criminal types. Later, Digger would try a simple series of pranks for amusement, hitting various members of the Squad with pies. For a time, suspicion had been diverted from him because had used his skills to pie himself, seemingly being hit by the 'assailant' from behind a wall. When the Squad confronted Digger as the culprit, he lost his temper and shouted that they could not really punish him since he was already in prison and in the Suicide Squad. He asked Waller, "What are you going to do about it, Fat Lady?!" Waller dropped him from a helicopter onto a deserted island.

Due to various events, mainly Waller breaking many rules by having a criminal gang ruthlessly gunned down, the Squad broke up for a year. When Waller was approached again because she was needed, she reformed the team and had Digger picked up. He was, at the time, trying to construct a massive boomerang to take him to mainland.

Harkness revealed a deep patriotism for his home country of Australia, though his countrymen do not care at all for him, and a tremendous fear of being laughed at. Teammate Deadshot commented he often wished he had killed Harkness, most notably after his drinking led them to miss a plane and to Deadshot losing his uniform and entering a depressive phase because of it. Ironically, when Boomerang pulled strings to have the suit restored to Deadshot, Lawton's psyche had passed into a phase that led him to loathe it. Harkness remained with the Squad until it was disbanded after a successful mission in Diabloverde.

However, despite being a somewhat trusted employee, Harkness still was quite amoral and greedy, selling out Adam Cray, the Atom, for half a million dollars.

====Other appearances====
Digger later showed up in ''Superboy'' with another Squad. While on a mission to destroy an underwater criminal hideout, he was shot through the hands by Deadshot and apparently fell to his death.

He later appeared in the pages of ''Flash'' with cybernetic hands. Alongside four other Rogues, given a chance by fellow Rogue [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] to become much more than they ever were. Unfortunately for Captain Boomerang, [[Captain Cold]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], [[Weather Wizard]], and [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], Kadabra's promise of glory was actually a ruse to free [[Neron]] and empower himself. Neron then resurrects the five Rogues, superpowering them and sending them on a bloody rampage that destroys much of Flash's hometown and kills thousands. Eventually, the Flash and [[Linda Park]] free the Rogues; the dead are restored to life.

After being restored to life, Boomerang and the Rogues, along with the [[Trickster (comics)#James Jesse|Trickster]], sought out an artifact that would protect them from Neron should he ever take an interest in them again. The Trickster accompanied them to help an old ex-girlfriend recover her kidnapped son. In the end, the Trickster found the boy, who turned out to not only be the prophesied agent of a god, but also the Trickster's son. He was also able to convince Neron to leave the Rogues alone, with the Rogues either coming away darker from their experiences, or seeking enlightenment, like Heat Wave, who retired with the monks.

Captain Boomerang is also involved with the [[Joker: Last Laugh]] event. After having suffered a mishap with one of his exploding boomerangs, Digger is transferred by ambulance to Keystone City. En route, the ambulance is attacked by a Jokerized [[Deadshot]], who decides to lend his old pal a hand by injecting him with Joker's serum. The serum's healing factor revives Digger, who is cured of his massive full-body burns and ready to attack the Flash at [[Iron Heights]] prison. However, once there, he is choked unconscious by a Jokerized [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].

====''Identity Crisis''====
{{Main|Identity Crisis (DC Comics)}}

Captain Boomerang was killed in the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries by [[Jack Drake]], father of [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]. Digger had been sent by the [[Jean Loring|real killer]] to attack Jack Drake, only the killer double-crossed Digger and sent Drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself; the killer later defended the action by saying that Boomerang was hired because he was such an incompetent that Jack would only need to pull the trigger and he would be safe. Digger managed to kill Drake but not before he was shot himself.<ref>''Identity Crisis'' #5 (December 2004)</ref>

===="Rogue War"====
Digger was later temporarily revived by Agent James Jesse, the former [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], during the "Rogue War" storyline, when Jesse used unspecified technology to temporarily revive Boomerang in an attempt to find out information about the Rogues' current hideout. However, Jesse was called away due to the latest attack by the Rogues before Harkness's revival, meaning that the only person present when Harkness was briefly reanimated was Ashley Zolomon, the estranged wife of [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]] (a former [[Reverse-Flash]]), who had been brought in based on her expertise in dealing with Rogues. During his brief return to life, Harkness asked Ashley to tell his son that he loved him and warn him never to reveal his mother's real name out of fear that the Rogues would kill him.

===="Blackest Night"====
In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, his remains are reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], and he joins the reanimated Jack and Janet Drake, John and Mary Grayson, [[Tony Zucco]], and the original Batman's deceased rogues gallery members in an attempt to take the life of the current [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. They are met with interference from [[Deadman]], who had possessed the body of the demon [[Etrigan]]. Their attack is ultimately called off when Batman and Red Robin cryogenically freeze themselves, leaving no emotions for the Black Lanterns to target.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>
Harkness later joins other reanimated members of the Rogues to target their still-living members.<ref name=bntf1>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)</ref> However, the battle results a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] on both side.

The Rogues track Owen down, Captain Cold berating him on how foolish he is to believe Digger's lies. When they discover the remains of a family nearby, Captain Cold reminds Owen that "the Rogues don't kill women or children." He shoves Owen into the pit where Digger rips out his son's heart. A black ring then flies down to make Owen a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Harkness and his son are then encased in ice by Captain Cold.<ref name=bntf3>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)</ref> Digger manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life, in full health, and in much better shape then he was at the time of his death.

===="Brightest Day"====
During the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' prologue, Digger is seen locked in his [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]] cell.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref> Digger is visited by [[Tim Drake]], whose father, [[Jack Drake]], Harkness murdered.<ref>''Red Robin'' #15 (August 2010)</ref> Tim tells him if he tries to escape, he will hunt him down personally.<ref>''Red Robin'' #16 (September 2010)</ref> He is later given a message from Captain Cold saying that if he wants to be one of the Rogues again, he has to prove it by escaping from prison on his own.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #2 (May 2010)</ref> After being beaten by guards, Digger is being seen to in the medical bay when he suddenly finds himself able to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact.

Shortly after, he finds himself confronting a wounded Flash.<ref name="tf3">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #3 (June 2010)</ref>

While there Captain Boomerang discovers that he's the only one who can enter the forest.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> Within the forest, Captain Boomerang finds Dawn and throws a boomerang at her. [[Hank Hall|Hawk]]; however, fails to catch the boomerang and instead the boomerang is caught by Deadman, who ended up dying in the process and Hawk is left to knock Captain Boomerang unconscious. After the Entity proclaims Captain Boomerang has completed his task, and his life is restored to him, the Entity reveals to them that the boomerang was a part a plan to free Hawk from his role as an avatar of war from the Lords of Chaos: his act of saving Dawn would have broken hold the Lords of Chaos have on Hawk and allow Hank to be true to himself.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

In the aftermath of "Brightest Day", Captain Boomerang lost his Black Lantern abilities. However, he seeks out a way to regain this lost power, he eventually steals the plausible deniability in Gotham City, but he is prevented by [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]], who is stalking him. During the struggle, Red Robin, who had lost his father due to Captain Boomerang, allows him to live and leave him in the police custody.<ref name="rr26">''Red Robin'' #26 (August 2011)</ref>

====Origins====
During the beginning of the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' storyline, "Digger" Harkness aka Captain Boomerang found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains. Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again.

During this time he felt it was finally time to reach out to the son he never raised, '''Owen Mercer'''. Before Harkness's death, the two bonded. Taking up his father's legacy, he became the second Captain Boomerang. [[Captain Cold]], brother to [[Golden Glider]] (who was believed to be Owen's mother), took Owen in as one of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

====Rogues====
Though Owen initially had no real attachment to the Rogues (and even voiced various, albeit short, opinions out loud), he grew to enjoy the purpose and sense of family the team offered after finding that his father's body had been stolen for use in a lab (which was later revealed to be part of a plan to get memories from Harkness).

Around this time the ''Rogue War'' began, in which the "reformed" Rogues fought the Rogues under Captain Cold. Ashley Zolomon is told by Harkness himself (he's briefly revived by the "reformed" Rogues as part of an experiment) that Golden Glider is not Owen's real mother. Later, it is revealed in Flash #225 (January 2006) that [[Meloni Thawne]] is the mother of Owen Harkness, formerly Owen Mercer, the new Captain Boomerang, having conceived him by the original Boomerang while he was trapped in the 30th Century. It is unknown whether she gave birth to Bart Allen or Owen first, or how Owen made it back to our own time.

====The Society====
During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Owen was part of [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains#3rd Formation|group of villains]]. He, Captain Cold, and [[Mirror Master]] were sent to guard a factory against the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], under the command of [[Deathstroke]] (who was actually [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] in disguise). When the ensuing battle between Outsiders and Rogues destroyed the machinery in the factory, the Rogues and other villains wouldn't help in the fight at all and then at the explosion, he is saved by the Outsiders, while the Rogues left them at the base to blow up. He is then turned over to the authorities off-panel.

During the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, Owen is part of a [[Suicide Squad]] sent by [[Amanda Waller]] to attack [[Black Adam]].

====Outsiders====
During the events known as [[One Year Later]], Owen finds himself placed in the metahuman prison known as [[Iron Heights]]. There he finds himself being the cellmate of [[Black Lightning]], who was arrested for a murder that Deathstroke the Terminator committed.<ref name="dc-ency"/> It is soon discovered that the other inmates have learned of Black Lightning's identity and are planning to murder him. The Outsiders become aware of this and attempt to break Pierce out of jail. Unfortunately it goes terribly wrong. As they escape, Black Lightning asks that they take Owen with them, which they grudgingly agree. As they escape, the Outsiders' jet, the ''Pequod'', is shot down, and while the team escapes, the world believes them dead.

Because of this event and the Freedom of Power Treaty, the team now works covertly. Most of the current Outsiders were believed dead until a botched mission revealed their presence to the world. His history as a Rogue has been exploited several times by team leader [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] from torturing dictators to taking down a cloned [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]. However, it is revealed that his desire to join the Outsiders comes from his desire for a family. Nightwing allowed him to join his team partially because Arsenal felt he would be worthy, and because Owen has been striving to find a family since the death of his father and the outbreak of the Rogue War.

Owen searched out the current [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] because of their connection, where their fathers killed one another. While Robin originally believed Owen was searching for him in order to finish the fight his father started, in ''Robin'' #152, Owen revealed that he wished to make amends with the younger hero, and has offered his assistance to help Robin destroy a bomb created by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. The two later spend the following night spreading out old hideouts of several villains. Afterward, Robin gained a bit of civil respect for Boomerang despite what their fathers did to another. Boomerang attempted to shake hands with Robin, but Robin refused the gesture feeling unready to make that step.

At some point during his tenure with the Outsiders, Captain Cold approached the mercenary [[Deathstroke]] with an offer concerning Owen. In exchange for kidnapping Deathstroke's daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose]] (who had betrayed her father and joined the [[Teen Titans]]) and delivering her to her father, Deathstroke would track down the Outsiders and turn Owen over to the Rogues. The villains planned to force Owen to cooperate with the team by administering the same mind-controlling agent that Deathstroke had used on his daughter as well as Batman's partner [[Cassandra Cain]]. However, this plan fell apart when Rose escaped and helped the Teen Titans defeat the Rogues, which lead to Deathstroke backing out of the deal.<ref>''Teen Titans: Cold Case'' (February 2011)</ref>

Owen has also developed a close friendship with Supergirl, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> After Supergirl returned from her time away with Power Girl, Kara began looking to start a normal life on Earth and went out a 'date' with Owen, during which they spoke of their past problems. Kara has nicknamed Owen 'Boomer'. Although the pair often flirts with one another, they have never progressed to a romantic relationship. This comes primarily from the fact that Kara continues to show interest in Nightwing, and jokingly says that what she and Owen has is more of a brother-sister relationship, in which he has an unhealthy fixation on his 'little sis'.

Feeling rejected after Kara's relationship with [[Power Boy]], Owen goes to a bar where he meets [[Cassandra Cain]] (Batgirl), who at the time was being mind controlled by Deathstroke the Terminator, and who has been hired to kill Supergirl. Cassandra kidnaps and tortures Owen to lure Supergirl. Unfortunately, this proves unnecessary, as Kara had tracked down Cassandra on her own, without any knowledge of Owen's kidnapping. Batgirl nearly manages to defeat Supergirl, but is defeated when Kara grows Krypton Sunstones which impale her foe. Kara then rushes Owen to the hospital where he is treated. While still in medical care, it is discovered that Power Boy has been stalking Kara.

Following Kara's rather violent break-up with Power Boy, the earth was overtaken by spirits from the Phantom Zone, which began to emerge from within Superman. Kara managed to defeat the Phantoms and return the Earth to normal. Afterwards, in Supergirl #19 Kara begins to make amends with all the people who she has hurt since arriving on earth. Amongst them, Boomer, who she apologies for letting him get hurt and leading him on. During this conversation, the matter of Owen's relationship with Kara is finally clarified. When asked by Kara how he feels about her leading him on, Owen replies, "Well, if I may ... for me to have been 'led on' would presume I thought I had a shot with you ... For me to think I had a shot with a sixteen-year-old girl -- crystal-powered hypersleep whatever junk aside ... that would mean I am a dirtbag with a thing for jailbait. Which I am not." 
In ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' #13-15, crossover with ''Outsiders'' #47-49, Checkmate abducts all members of the Outsiders except [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], allowing him to infiltrate their headquarters offer them a deal: The Outsiders won't be shut down over their actions in Africa in exchange for infiltrating Oolong Island on behalf of Checkmate. During the operation, Nightwing, Owen, and Checkmate's [[Sasha Bordeaux|Black Queen]] are taken captive by [[Chang Tzu]], and the latter two are tortured and experimented on. After [[Batman]] rescues the Outsiders over [[North Korea]]n territory, and Nightwing hands over the team to him, Owen and Nightwing are paired with each other in "auditions" for the new line up. Pushed too far, feeling he doesn't need to prove himself anymore, Owen returns to the Suicide Squad although Batman feels he could make a good [[double agent]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

====Suicide Squad====
In ''All Flash'' #1, Owen as part of the new Suicide Squad captures two of the Rogues that are responsible for Bart Allen's murder, [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Weather Wizard]], in Louisiana. In ''Countdown'' #39, he and the rest of the squad chase after [[Pied Piper (comics)|Piper]] and [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] in [[Gotham City]] after they had escaped capture from Squad member [[Deadshot]]. The Squad however, is just as unsuccessful as Deadshot, and the two Rogues escape capture.

====Blackest Night====
Owen visit his father's grave along with [[Tar Pit (comics)|Tar Pit]], when the swarm of [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black rings]] fly into the crypt, reanimated all the deceased the villains as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]], including his father.<ref name=bntf1 /> The Rogues battle in the [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]], when the battle resulted a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] on both side and Harkness's son, Owen, arrives and took him away from the battle, believing he can bring his father back.<ref name=bntf2 /> Later on, Owen has apparently chained up his father's body and is feeding him victims such as a villain named Sandblast who was relying on Owen to get him into the Rogues. It is revealed that Owen has been deceived by Boomerang into believing the blood of enough victims can bring him back to life. The Rogues track Owen down with Captain Cold berating him on believing Harkness' lies. Realizing that Owen has broken the Rogues' code of honor by killing women and children, Cold shoves him into the pit. Owen has his heart ripped out by his father, with a ring flying in to revive him as a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Owen and his father are then encased in ice by Cold.<ref name=bntf3 /> His father manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and in full health.<ref name=bn8 />

====The New 52====
Owen Mercer remains as Captain Boomerang in [[the New 52]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 4) #27 (March 2014)</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Captain Boomerang and a new character called Yo-Yo join the Suicide Squad to replace the deceased members Savant and Voltaic. He tells the team that he is the new field commander for the Suicide Squad upon being placed in that position by Amanda Waller.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 4) #3 (January 2012)</ref> But this is further revealed to be a set up orchestrated to give them a bargaining chip for bypass an armed Basilisk militia led by the sister of one of his victims. Realizing the trap, Boomerang attempts to use a detonator he was given that is supposed to be connected to the microbombs in each squad member's skin. It fails to function, and Deadshot mocks him for thinking that Waller would trust him with that kind of power before shooting his hand.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 4) #4 (February 2012)</ref>
It's later revealed in the series that Captain Boomerang is working for Basilisk as the Suicide Squad is captured. Captain Boomerang is seen escorting the squad to the concentration camps of the Basilisk militia. Captain Boomerang frees Deadshot and the rest of the squad and reveals that he was Waller's undercover agent. While battling the militia, Captain Boomerang is knocked out by Black Spider who is revealed as the traitor on the team.

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Boomerang carries a number of boomerangs in his satchel. He is an expert at throwing the weapons and as well as ordinary boomerangs he has a number with special properties, including bladed, explosive, incendiary, and electrified boomerangs.

Upon his resurrection, Digger finds he has the ability to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact.<ref name="tf3"/> However this new ability is lost when he completes the task given by the White Lantern Entity.<ref name="rr26"/>

The original Captain Boomerang then began to train his son Owen Mercer before he died. He has exhibited creativity in his boomerangs by creating "razorangs" and an acid-spewing boomerang.

Owen has also exhibited "speed bursts": short burst of limited super speed over short distances, most notably when throwing boomerangs. These were even possible during the time period that Bart Allen fully contained the [[Speed Force]], usually displayed as his ability to throw boomerangs at high velocities, rather than running.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #36 (July 2006)</ref> However, during [[Chang Tzu]]'s experiments he claimed he believed Mercer could access the Speed Force, and Mercer denied having super speed at all anymore, but Chang Tzu was able to activate Owen's speed involuntarily, causing him great pain.<ref>''Checkmate'' (vol. 2) #15 (August 2007)</ref> The exact source of this power remains unrevealed. Regardless, as of ''Justice Society of America'' #8, the Speed Force appears to have returned and is accessible to all former speedsters once more.

== Other versions ==
In the 1997 [[Tangent Comics]] One Shot [[Green Lantern]] Captain Boomerang goes by the name Adam Clay, who becomes a disenfranchised pilot after the Japanese army marched on Burma and killed his family whilst they were at their plantation there. Clay escapes in his families cropduster and forms a group of fliers. He becomes nicknamed "Captain Boomerang" because of his families Australian origins and the unique "V" Shaped planes his Corp. fly.

Captain Boomerang uses genetic surgery sourced by the secret government group [[Nightwing]] in order to remain young and therefore always lead his private corp. of fliers.

An older Harkness appears in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #2 (June 1996)</ref>

Boomerang appears briefly in a panel in Chapter Eight of the Injustice Comic along with several other Flash Rogues, battling [[Cyborg]] who is demanding the location of [[Mirror Master]] from him.

==In other media==

===Television===
*An actor dressed as Captain Boomerang made an appearance in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Eclipsed", starring alongside the Flash in a television commercial. The actor used an Australian accent.

[[Image:Captain boomerang jlu2.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Captain Boomerang in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]
*The George Harkness version of Captain Boomerang appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Task Force X" (voiced by [[Donal Gibson]]) as a member of [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X]] led by [[Rick Flag]]. In "Flash and Substance", Captain Boomerang was released from Task Force X as the U.S. Government said he was "reformed". Captain Boomerang joins up with other Central City villains to destroy The Flash. In that episode, he appears in a streamlined, trench-coated version of his traditional costume. In both appearances, Boomerang's character is defined by his fiscal frugality; he almost gives Task Force X away by refusing to part with 75 cents ("75 cents is 75 cents. I'm supposed to throw away money?"), and he badgers his fellow Flash rogues for cost assistance with his giant boomerang.
* In the ''[[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]]'' episode ''Warrior'', [[Chloe Sullivan]] receives a text message from [[Green Arrow]] about a "maniac with boomerangs".
