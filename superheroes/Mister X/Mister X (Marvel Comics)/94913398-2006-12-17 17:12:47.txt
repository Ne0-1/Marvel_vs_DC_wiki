'''Mister X''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] of the [[Marvel Universe]] introduced in [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] #159 (February, [[2001]]).  His [[Henchman|henchmen]] include T & A ([[nickname]]d "[[Betty Cooper|Betty]] and [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]]" by Wolverine), and Blok.     

==Character biography==
Mister X is an extremely wealthy businessman who has demonstrated a [[psychological]] [[addiction]] to killing that, by his own account, started in his adolescence. His latent [[telepath]]ic power was awakened by seeing a woman who had been hit by a car, which fascinated him; he felt her die. This is very similar to the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] that awakened [[Jean Grey]]'s psionic abilities. He soon became obsessed with death.

As a youth, X committed several [[murder]]s to recreate the high of telepathically connecting with another person at the moment of their death. He murdered his pet dog and his entire family, including his mother and father. Over the years X would commit hundreds of murders and had his identity erased. Using his family's considerable fortune, X traveled throughout the world and studied under some of the finest [[martial artists]] in the world. After X learned all he could from each of his teachers, he would kill them.  The thrill of killing an opponent in [[Close combat|hand to hand combat]] provided him with a rush that he had never dreamed of. X kept a public image of a handsome, single, wealthy [[socialite]], while he secretly coveted the honor of being the greatest [[hand to hand combat]] fighter on earth, which, of course, meant killing all of the other greatest fighters.

For every murder, X would cut a [[scar]] somewhere on his body. By the time he met [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], his torso was covered in hundreds of them arranged in an ornate pattern. X defeated Wolverine in their first battle, but was amazed at his opponent's skills, bravery, and tenacity.   X offered to spare Wolverine's life if he would agree to join him in his gruesome quest, much as T and A and Blok had done.  Wolverine refused and engaged X in battle once again.  This time, hearing of X's crimes and the lives he'd destroyed over the years, pushed Wolverine over the edge, and he slipped into a [[berserker]] rage.  While in this state, Wolverine's conscious mind essentially shut down and the primal, savage instincts brought on by his mutation took over.  Even though X stabbed and slashed him with swords and knives, impaled him with a spear, shot him with a machine gun, and set him on fire with a flamethrower, Wolverine continued to fight.  In the end, Wolverine's determination and healing powers proved too much for X to overcome.  X himself received several severe injuries, including deep lacerations down the length of his chest and stomach.  He would have been killed had his bodyguard, Blok, not interfered.

Their third and final battle, at the Bloodsport tournament, went similarly. X had just defeated [[Taskmaster]], who managed to escape with his life due to momentary interference by a referee, whom X murders for robbing him of his kill.  At first, the battle appeared to be going in a similar direction as their first.  No matter what Wolverine did, X was immediately prepared with a counter to Wolverine's offense.  Wolverine noted to himself that X's movements, his technique, and form were absolutely flawless. Wolverine surmised at this point that X must have telepathic abilities that enable him to predict his opponent's moves. The natural solution to such a talent is not to think while fighting; to slip into a berzerker fury as he had done during their second fight. He allowed himself to slip into a berserker rage and the tide immediately changed.  Despite his skill, X was unable to predict Wolverine's moves.  Wolverine, who is a highly skilled martial artist himself, soon had the advantage.  During this time, the Taskmaster had plotted to kill X by setting fire to the ring in which he and Wolverine were fighting since the Taskmaster had been humiliated in his fight with X.  The ring eventually collapsed but not before Wolverine had knocked X into one of the corners containing the championship belt.  X picked up the belt and declared that he'd won the match, which was technically true according to the rules of the tournament.  Despite this, Wolverine was poised to deliver the death blow but Blok, once again, saved X's life.  X managed to escape and his current location is unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Mister X possesses minor telepathic abilities that he is able to use in order to predict the fighting moves of any opponent he engages.  These abilities allow him to "see" what his opponent will do to the point that he is already several steps ahead of them.  The combination of his skills and these psionic powers was sufficient for X to defeat the Taskmaster, who is one of the finest combatants on Earth, and make it look easy.

X possesses the physical capabilities of a man that is in the peak of physical condition.  His physical abilities of strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reaction time are on par with those of Captain America.  X is  a master of many different forms of combat, including various martial arts from Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  X is also highly proficient with a variety of weaponry including swords, knives, staffs, and firearms.   He also has an uncanny tolerance for physical pain and may be a [[masochist]].
