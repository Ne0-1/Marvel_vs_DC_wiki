'''Spider-Girl''' ('''May "Mayday" Parker''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]ine active in an alternate future of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The character was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man]] character, and first appeared in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (Vol. 2) #105 (1998).  She later acquired her own ongoing comic book, '''''Spider-Girl''''', written by DeFalco and drawn by Frenz and [[Pat Olliffe]], which is the longest-running superhero book with a lead female character ever published by Marvel.

==Publication history==
''Spider-Girl'' first appeared in a one-shot story in the ongoing series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''.  Following positive fan response to the concept, ''Spider-Girl'' and two other series (''[[A-Next]]'' and ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'') set in the same alternate future universe were launched under the [[MC2]] imprint.  Although each of these titles were slated to be 12-issue limited series, ''Spider-Girl'''s initial sales justified their continuation as ongoing titles.

After initial interest, ''Spider-Girl'' drew low sales.  However, the book's active fanbase caused Marvel to revoke several cancellation announcements.   Reprints of the series in [[digest size]] [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] sold well, and Marvel Associate Editor Nick Lowe revealed in a November 2005 interview that "Spider-Girl, for the first time is completely safe from cancellation."[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004386]

However, despite Lowe's statement, Marvel announced that #100 would be the title's final issue.  Although the ''Spider-Girl'' title was indeed canceled, the book was relaunched as ''The Amazing Spider-Girl,'' with issue #0 appearing in October 2006.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Maydayparker.png|thumb|225px|right|frame|May "Mayday" Parker. Art by [[Pat Olliffe]].]]
May "Mayday" Parker is the child of [[Spider Man|Peter]] and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane Parker]] in a future, alternate universe continuity.  In the [[MC2]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|continuity]], they were reunited with their baby daughter by [[Kaine]], who found the child living with Alison Mongraine, the con artist who had kidnapped the baby on instruction from the Green Goblin.  After they were reunited, Peter lost a leg during the horrific final conflict with the [[Green Goblin]]. After the battle Peter received a bionic replacement from Mr. Fantastic and, considering it a wake-up call, decided to retire and focus on being a husband and father  (the battle is glimpsed in ''Spider Girl'' #7, and fully explained in ''Spider Girl'' #49).  For years, they chose to keep their past from Mayday and hoped that she wouldn't develop powers of her own.

Despite her parents' hopes, May began developing versions of her father's Spider-powers when she was 15.  At the same time, [[Normie Osborn]] (Green Goblin's grandson) set out to restore the family name (as he saw it).  Mayday donned [[Ben Reilly]]'s Spider-Man costume to stop him and soon took to crime fighting, at first hindered, then helped, by her worried parents.

May shares traits of both of her parents. Like her mother, she is a good-looking and popular student, and she is intelligent and bright, just as her father was.  She also inherited his love for in-fight bantering. In addition, she is a very good athlete and excelled in her girls' [[basketball]] team until she quit after her powers emerged.  On the other hand, May seems to have inherited the "Parker luck" in which her dual identity wreaks havoc in her private life.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Girl,'' May has promised to give up costumed superheroics, dates Eugene Thompson, and runs for student council.  When Mary Jane becomes aware that the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] poses a threat to her daughter's teenaged friends, she allows Mayday to resume her activities as Spider-Girl (a situation they wanted to keep secret from Peter).  After a battle with the Hobgoblin, May tells her father the truth, and after a conversation with Mary Jane, they allowed May to resume her Spider-girl identity.

After an attempt at helping the S.H.I.E.L.D government agency, a case filled with a piece of the Carnage symbiote was released. It attaches itself to May's friend Moose,who becomes the new Carnage. Carnage causes a stir at May's school and kidnaps Peter and Baby Ben, forcing May to confront her friend. May tries to talk to Moose within the symbiote but fails, and it bonds with her brother Ben. Peter escapes as May battles the two symboites and gathers sonic gear that may be able to defeat the Symbiote. However it is May who uses the weapons, thereby destroying the piece of the Carnage symbiote.

==Powers and abilities==
May Parker inherited many of the [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|same abilities]] as her father, Peter Parker.  May possesses superhuman strength, can leap several stories high, and can cover the width of a city block. Spider-Girl's reflexes are also heightened to levels well beyond that of an ordinary human.  She heals somewhat faster than a normal human, and is more agile than Spider-Man.

Spider-Girl can adhere to almost any surface through a bio-magnetic field her body generates, allowing her to scale the sides of a building, just like a spider.  Wall-crawling doesn't come as naturally to May as Peter; she has to concentrate to keep herself from slipping off surfaces.  In addition to adhering to surfaces, May can also repel herself like an opposing magnet, or she can repulse and adhere another object or person through a shared medium.  For example, she can cause a person to stick to a wall they're touching just by touching that same wall and willing them to, or she can just as easily violently push them away.

May Parker has inherited a "spider-sense", a clairvoyance that warns her of danger that is somewhat more powerful and reliable than her father's.  It tells her the direction a threat is coming from with a high level of accuracy.  Through intensive training, she learned to fight blindfolded using only her spider-sense.  She can use it to spot weaknesses in an opponent and use them to her advantage.  She can also sense mundane threats or observations like her father, but unlike him she can use it to sense deception.  By touching her father's clone, [[Kaine]], she experienced a shared precognitive vision, but she does not normally have that ability.

May also has mechanical [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Web-shooters|web-shooters]] based on [[Ben Reilly]]'s web-shooter design, but longer and narrower. They can fire impact webbing and metal needles called "Stingers" but May rarely uses them, thinking them to be "too brutal". Her [[mobile phone]] is modified to attach to one of her web-shooters, and looks like one of its cartridges. She occasionally uses spider-tracers, but as they are tuned to her father's spider-sense and not hers, she needs a receiver to detect them.

Spider-Girl once lost her powers due to being electrocuted.  However, she borrowed the [[Green Goblin]] equipment from [[Normie Osborn]] until she regained them.

May has also received some [[martial arts]] training from the [[Ladyhawk]]s and [[Elektra Natchios]], as well as being drilled in the use of her powers by her father.  

===Mutant question===
Whether Spider-Girl is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] has not been established. May was born with her powers &mdash; an important criterion which usually leads to a character's classification as a "mutant" in the Marvel Universe. However, the term is never used to describe her. 

Before her birth, a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot found her to be "beyond the range of embryonic normalcy", but not specifically a mutant (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #415).

Several of the explanations for her father's powers stated that they were a result of his [[genome]] changing.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

==Other versions==
===Earth-616===
May Parker also existed in the primary [[Earth-616]] timeline in which most [[Marvel Comics]] are set.  However, her status was unknown for a time and she was believed to be dead until the events of [[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]] 

[[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] became pregnant at the beginning of the [[Clone Saga]].  Impending fatherhood was one of the main reasons Peter retired as Spider-Man during that storyline, passing the mantle to [[Ben Reilly]].  However, at the end of the story, Mary Jane was poisoned by Alison Mongraine, an agent of the [[Green Goblin]], and the baby was stillborn (or seemed to be, as Mongraine  took the sedated infant away with her). Ben Reilly died at the Green Goblin's hands the same night, and Peter Parker became Spider-Man again.

There were hints during the "[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #434-435, one of Tom DeFalco's last storylines on the title, that Baby May would be returned. Instead, the subplot was dropped, and a few issues later DeFalco was replaced by [[Howard Mackie]] and [[John Byrne]].  Under that team, [[Aunt May]] was brought back instead.<ref>http://www.comicboards.com/spidergirl/view.php?rpl=000705182940&q</ref> In a flashback in ''Spider-Girl'' #49, an alternative version of this story was presented, with the younger May returned instead of the elder.

However, unlike developments in the MC2 continuity, baby May and her parents were never reunited in Marvel's main continuity. Editors had repeatedly stated that the baby died, or at the very least would not be seen again; the baby was considered a major factor in the "aging" of the characters. However, no proof of her death was ever shown, it was clearly implied that she was kidnapped, and Alison Mongraine and Kaine were never conclusively shown to have died either.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #439 (Defalco's last on the title), the issue takes place 1,000 years (2998 based on the release date of the issue) in the future.  Two archaeologists stumble across relics belonging to Spider-Man (such as his webshooters).  They speculate on his career, and discuss the other heroes who were inspired by him, such as Spider-Girl, [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Spider-Man 2211]].

In issue #545, the final chapter in the "One More Day" story-line, Peter and Mary Jane accept a deal from the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to save his Aunt May's life in exchange for erasing their marriage from the timeline.  The deal prevents May's conception, removing her from the universe whether she died or not.  Mephisto showed the couple another daughter, a child who might have been theirs if they had chosen to remain married, but the child's name and identity is unrevealed.

===Earth X===
There are two variant and alternate universe versions of Spider-Girl.  One was raised by a Ben Reilly who survived after her father died during her childhood, as seen ''What If?'' vol. 2 #86, and later revealed in the ''Paradise X: Heralds'' mini-series.  Another version of Spider-Girl is actually Venom, who is seen in the ''[[Earth X]]'' mini-series and its two sequels, ''[[Universe X]]'' and ''[[Paradise X]]''.

The world of MC2 is designated as "Earth-982".  The world where Spider-Girl was raised by Ben Reilly is known as "Earth-1122" and the world featuring Venom as Spider-Girl along with the other heroes of the ''Earth X'' saga is known as "Earth-9997"

===Ultimate universe===
In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', Peter's girlfriend [[Kitty Pryde]] ([[Shadowcat]]) adopts a second costumed identity in order to fight crime at his side.  (It is already public knowledge that she and Shadowcat are one and the same; hence, she cannot work with him as Shadowcat). She wears the costume in issue #91, and Peter jokingly suggests "Spider-Girl" as her crime-fighting name.<ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/113995099618514.htm Silver Bullet Comics preview of Ultimate Spider-Man #91]</ref>

The Ultimate universe's Spider-heroine is introduced in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #98; in issue #102 she is revealed to be a clone of Peter Parker whose chromosomes have been manipulated to make her female. She resembles Peter, retains his memories, and appears to be the same age.  Cassandra Webb was preparing to erase her memories in order to replace them with a new identity as "Jessica Drew", but the clone managed to escape before the process could be carried out.  This character is an analogue to the mainstream Marvel universe's [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]].

==In other media==
===Novels===
*An older, more cynical alternate version of May Parker/Spider-Girl appears in the Spider-Man/[[X-Men]] team-up novel ''Time's Arrow 3: The Future'' by Tom DeFalco and [[Rosemary Edghill]] (ISBN 0-425-16500-0). In that novel, Spider-Man travels to the alternate future known for its [[Iron Man 2020]] (Arno Stark). This universe's Earth is designated Earth-8410. In this reality, Spider-Girl wears a costume almost identical to the one worn by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], except the colors have been modified to look like Spider-Man's costume. She also has the ability to fire venom blasts as well as webs.
===Action Figures===
*[[Toy Biz]]'s 8-inch scale "Famous Covers" action figure line included a Spider-Girl with a cloth costume and removable mask.
*Toy Biz's 5-inch scale "First Appearances" line included a  Spider-Girl (as well as her allies, [[Cassandra Lang|Stinger]] and [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]).
*Toy Biz's preschool-oriented "Spider-Man & Friends" line has included several Spider-Girl figures and toys.  These feature an exposed lower face, visible eyes, and [[pigtails]] or a [[ponytail]], to make it easier for very young children to differentiate Spider-Girl from Spider-Man. According to one of the children's books released for the "Spider-Man & Friends" toyline, this Spider-Girl is actually Spider-Man's cousin.
===Video games===
*Spider-Girl appeared as one of the alternate costumes for Spider-Woman in the multi-platform action-RPG ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
