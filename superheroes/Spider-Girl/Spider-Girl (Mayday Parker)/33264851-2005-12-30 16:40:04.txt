'''Spider-Girl''' (May "Mayday" Parker) is a [[comic book]] [[superheroine]] in an alternate future of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man]] character, and first appeared in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' volume 2 #105, later getting her own ongoing comic book which has become the longest-running superhero book with a lead female character ever published by Marvel, partly due to the fan backlash which has caused them to recant several cancellation attempts.

Currently, however, due to the sales of the "digest-sized" [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]], the book is "for the first time in [its] history, is completely safe from cancellation." [http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004386]

==Character history==

The story concerns Mayday Parker, the future offspring of [[Peter Parker|Peter]] and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane Parker]], who was born a few years before Peter lost a leg and was forced to retire following the horrific final conflict with the [[Green Goblin]]. (It's implied that Peter was responsible for the Goblin's death but this has never been confirmed.) For many years the duo chose to keep their past from Mayday and kept their fingers crossed she wouldn't develop powers of her own.

Despite her parents' hopes, May began developing versions of her father's Spider-powers when she was 15. At the same time, Normie Osborn (Green Goblin's grandson) set out to restore the family name (as he saw it). Mayday donned the [[Ben Reilly]] Spider costume to stop him and soon took to crime fighting, at first hindered, then helped, by her worried parents.

May shares traits of both of her parents. Like her mother, she is a good-looking and popular student, and she is intelligent and bright, just as her father was. She also inherited his love for in-fight bantering. In addition, she is a very good athlete and excels in her girls' [[basketball]] team. On the other hand, May seems to have inherited the typical "Parker luck" in which her dual identity causes a lot of problems in her private life.

[[Image:Spider Girl 75.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to '''Spider-Girl #75'''. Art by Ron Frenz. First appearance of Spider-Girl with the black costume on.]]The series has recently passed issue 75, whereupon the title character temporarily assumed a mostly black outfit, before reverting to her earlier costume at the end of the story. Though still relatively weak, sales of the comic remain at a very consistent level, and several "digest-sized" collections of the series' early material have apparently sold very well (with more on the way), and the book is safe from cancellation for now.

==Powers and abilities==

May Parker inherited many of the same abilities as her father, Peter Parker.  She has super-strength and has been shown to be able to lift up to 5 tons.  She can also leap several stories high and the width of a city block.  She is also tougher and heals faster than the average human.  However, her father at her age was double her in these fields.  Still, even before receiving her powers May was already an accomplished athlete.  As such, her speed and agility are greater than Peter's were.

Spider-girl also gained from her father the ability to "wall-crawl".  She can adhere to just about any surface through a static-electric field her body generates.  It also allows her to scale the sides of a building, just like a spider.  Unlike her father, wall-crawling doesn't come naturally to May.  She has to concentrate to keep herself from slipping off surfaces.  Despite this weakness, her wall-crawling is still far more developed than Spider-man's ever was. In addition to adhering to surfaces, May can also repel herself like an opposing magnet.  Or she can even repulse and adhere another object or person through a shared medium.  For example, she can cause a person to stick to a wall they're touching just by touching that same wall and willing them to.  Or she can just as easily violently push them away.

Finally, May Parker inherited a form of clairvoyance that warns her of danger called "spider-sense".  In her father, this ability was fairly limited and manifested itself as a tingling in the back of his skull.  It gave him a seconds warning and only told him enough about the threat to know that being in a certain spot was unsafe.  Spider-girl's form of spider-sense, on the other hand, actually tells her the direction a threat is coming from and the nature of the threat.  She can also use it to spot the weakness in an opponent and use it to her advantage.

*'''[[Phil Urich]]''', a former [[Green Goblin]] and a good friend of the Parker family. Occasionally, he even uses his Goblin powers to help May.
*'''Benjamin Parker''', May's little baby brother.

===Supporting cast===

*'''Jimmy''', an [[Asian]] science nerd with a crush on May, a fact that makes May - who likes Jimmy as a friend, but not more - embarrassed
*'''Courtney''', May's friend in school
*'''JJ''', the grandson of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and also one of May's secret crushes
*'''Moose''', a bully who constantly clashes with Jimmy
*'''Brad''', a good-looking, smart teenager and May's secret crush, whom she later dropped when she found out he had a hatred for mutants

*'''Felicity Hardy''', the daughter of [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]] and Flash Thompson. She knows that May is Spider-Girl and adopted the costume of [[Scarlet Spider]] when May took a break from superhero business. However, she abandoned it quickly and helps May in her civilian identity.

==Mutant question==

It is unclear whether Spider-Girl is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]].  She did not receive her powers in an accident but inherited them from a parent who was exposed to radiation, as is typical for mutants in the Marvel Universe.  The series never uses the word "mutant" to describe her, nor does it ever say explicitly that her powers result from a genetic change as is true of mutants.  As of yet, Spider-Girl has not been shown to register on a mutant detector or otherwise be unambiguously identified as a mutant.

==Spider-Girl's Uncle Ben==

Like her father, Mayday also has an Uncle Ben. However, unlike her dad, May never knew her Uncle Ben. May's Uncle Ben, is Ben Reilly, the Spider-Man clone. However, when Mayday asked her dad about him, Peter left out the fact that Ben was really Peter's clone. 

Also, if Spider-Girl had any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben - May's baby brother, and Peter & MJ's second child. However, it is unknown after who the young Ben was named after - As Peter & MJ named May after Peter's Aunt May, Mayday asked which Uncle Ben the new born was named after, her Uncle Ben, or his (Peter's) Uncle Ben. Peter then asked if it really mattered, which May responded to with "I guess not".

==Alternate versions==

There are two variant and alternate universe versions of Spider-Girl. One is which Peter Parker died during her babyhood and is raised by a surviving Ben Parker, as seen in an [[What If]] issue and later revealed in [[Paradise X: Heralds]] mini-series. Another version of Spider-Girl is actually [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] who is seen in [[Earth-X]] mini-series with its two sequels, [[Universe X]] and [[Paradise X]]. Note that [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] one-shot which focused on alternate unverses reveals that the world of MC2 is actually diverged when "the age of marvel heroes" began presumably 15 years earlier than its [[Earth-616]] timescale and is designated as ''Earth-982'' with an earth of Spider-Girl raised by Ben Reilly as ''Earth-1122'' and an earth of Venom along with heroes of "Earth-X" saga as ''Earth-9997''.
