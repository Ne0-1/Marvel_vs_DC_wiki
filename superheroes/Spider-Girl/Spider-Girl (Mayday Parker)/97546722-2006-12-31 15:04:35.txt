'''Spider-Girl''' (May "Mayday" Parker) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]]ine, active in an alternate future of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man]] character, and first appeared in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (Vol. 2) #105.  She later acquired her own ongoing comic book, '''''Spider-Girl''''', written by DeFalco and drawn by Frenz and [[Pat Olliffe]], which has become the longest-running superhero book with a lead female character ever published by Marvel.

==Publication history==

''Spider-Girl'' was a spin-off of the ongoing series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''.  According to Tom DeFalco, her first appearance was meant to be her last.  However, due to positive fan response, ''Spider-Girl'' and two other series (''[[A-Next]]'' and ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'') set in the same universe were launched under the [[MC2]] imprint.  All three were intended to be merely 12-issue limited series, however, ''Spider-Girl'''s sales justified its continuation.

Although ''Spider-Girl'' has had among the lowest sales of any ongoing series by Marvel, the book's sales were consistent.  Its active fanbase caused Marvel to revoke several cancellation announcements.   Reprints of the series in [[digest size]] [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] sold well, and Marvel Associate Editor Nick Lowe revealed in a November 2005 interview that "Spider-Girl, for the first time in her history, is completely safe from cancellation." [http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004386]

Marvel announced that #100 would be the title's final issue.  However, although the ''Spider-Girl'' title was indeed cancelled, the book was relaunched as '''''The Amazing Spider-Girl''''' with issue #0 published in October 2006. 

In ''The Amazing Spider-Girl'', May has promised to give up costumed superheroics, dates Eugene Thomson, and runs for student council.  When Mary Jane becomes aware that the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] poses a threat to her daughter's teen-aged friends, she allows Mayday to resume her activities as Spider-Girl (a situation they both hope to keep secret from Peter).

==Character history==
May "Mayday" Parker is the child of [[Peter Parker|Peter]] and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane Parker]] in a future, alternate universe continuity.  In the [[MC2]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|continuity]], they were reunited with their baby daughter by [[Kaine]], who found the child living with Alison Mongraine, the con artist who had kidnapped the baby on instruction from the Green Goblin.  After they were reunited, Peter lost a leg during the horrific final conflict with the [[Green Goblin]]. After the battle Peter received a bionic replacement from Mr. Fantastic and considering it a wake-up call decided to retire and focus on being a husband and father  (The battle is glimpsed in SG# 7, and fully explained in SG #49).  For many years, the duo chose to keep their past from Mayday and hoped that she wouldn't develop powers of her own.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:SpiderGirl.jpg|left|thumb|Daughter of Peter Parker, the former Spider-Man.]] -->

Despite her parents' hopes, May began developing versions of her father's Spider-powers when she was 15.  At the same time, [[Normie Osborn]] (Green Goblin's grandson) set out to restore the family name (as he saw it).  Mayday donned [[Ben Reilly]]'s Spider-Man costume to stop him and soon took to crime fighting, at first hindered, then helped, by her worried parents.

May shares traits of both of her parents.  Like her mother, she is a good-looking and popular student, and she is intelligent and bright, just as her father was.  She also inherited his love for in-fight bantering. In addition, she is a very good athlete and excelled in her girls' [[basketball]] team until she quit after her powers emerged.  On the other hand, May seems to have inherited the "Parker luck" in which her dual identity wreaks havoc in her private life.

==Powers and abilities==
May Parker inherited many of the [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|same abilities]] as her father, Peter Parker. She has enhanced strength, can leap several stories high, and can cover the width of a city block. She is also tougher and heals faster than a normal human.

Spider-Girl can adhere to almost any surface through a static-electric field her body generates, allowing her to scale the sides of a building, just like a spider.  Wall-crawling doesn't come as naturally to May as Peter; she has to concentrate to keep herself from slipping off surfaces.  In addition to adhering to surfaces, May can also repel herself like an opposing magnet, or she can repulse and adhere another object or person through a shared medium.  For example, she can cause a person to stick to a wall they're touching just by touching that same wall and willing them to, or she can just as easily violently push them away.

May Parker inherited her "spider-sense," a form of clairvoyance that warns her of danger.  Spider-Girl's is somewhat more powerful and reliable than her father's, and tells her the direction a threat is coming from with a high level of precision.  Through intensive training, she learned to fight blindfolded using only her spider-sense.  She can use it to spot weaknesses in an opponent and use them to her advantage.  She can also sense mundane threats or observation like her father, but unlike him she can use it to sense deception.  By touching her father's clone, [[Kaine]], she experienced a shared precognitive vision, but she does not normally have that ability.

[[Image:Spider Girl 75.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Cover to ''Spider-Girl'' #75.  Art by Ron Frenz.]]

May also has mechanical [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Web-shooters|web-shooters]] based on [[Ben Reilly]]'s web-shooter design, but longer and narrower.  Her [[mobile phone]] is modified to attach to one of her web-shooters, and looks like one of its cartridges. She occasionally uses spider-tracers, but as they are tuned to her father's spider-sense and not hers, she needs a receiver to detect them.

Spider-Girl once lost her powers due to being electrocuted.  However, she borrowed the [[Green Goblin]] equipment from [[Normie Osborn]] until she regained them.

May has also received some [[martial arts]] training from the [[Ladyhawk|Ladyhawks]] and [[Elektra Natchios]], as well as being drilled in the use of her powers by her father.  

Since Spider-Man's power and abilities were upgraded in [[Spider-Man: The Other]], (an event which takes place outside of the [[MC2]] continuity), any comparison of May's powers to her father's must apply to his status prior to that event.

===The mutant question===
It is unclear whether Spider-Girl is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]].  She did not receive her powers by accident or design, but was born with them, which fits the usual definition of "mutant" in the Marvel Universe, but the series never uses the word "mutant" to describe her.  Before her birth, a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot found her to be "beyond the range of embryonic normalcy," but not specifically a mutant (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #415).

==Cast==
===Main cast===
*'''[[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]''', May's father, who has retired from superhero business and works as a police scientist.  He lost his leg after the final battle with the first Green Goblin, a.k.a. Norman Osborn.  He occasionally dons his costume to assist May.
*'''[[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane Watson-Parker]]''', May's mother.  In this universe, MJ is a very responsible and sharp-witted character, knowing every thought of her superhero husband and daughter inside out.
*'''[[Green Goblin|Phil Urich]]''', a former Green Goblin (the only hero to use that name) and a good friend of the Parker family. (He has been a friend of the family for so long, that May calls him "Uncle Phil.") Phil works with Peter Parker at his job in the crime lab. Occasionally, he uses his Goblin powers to help May, at one point taking on the identity of the "Golden Goblin." Later, with the assistance of Normie Osborn, Phil was able to come out of retirement and take on the identity of the Green Goblin once more.  

*'''[[Benjamin Richard Parker]]''' is May's little baby brother.

===Supporting cast===
*'''[[Darkdevil]]''', a.k.a Reilly Tyne, is a mocking [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]]-like superhero who constantly taunts Spider-Girl for her various weaknesses, but has also proven to be a valuable ally.  Tyne is later discovered to be May's cousin.
*'''Courtney Duran''' is May's pigtailed friend in school.  She is a level-headed and bespectacled "Miss Normal" who is in her Science Club.
*'''[[Felicity Hardy]]''' is the daughter of [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]] and [[Flash Thompson]].  She knows that May is Spider-Girl and adopted the costume of [[Scarlet Spider]] when May took a break from superhero business.  However, she abandoned it quickly and helps May in her civilian identity.
*'''Gene Thompson''' is the son of [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]] and [[Flash Thompson]], and the older brother of Felicity Hardy. He is currently dating May (as of ''Amazing Spider-Girl #1'').  
*'''[[The Buzz (comics)|Jack Jameson]]''', also called "JJ", is the grandson of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and is one of May's secret crushes.  He is secretly a superhero called '''The Buzz'''.
*'''Davida Kirby''' is May's best friend in school and her teammate in her basketball team.
*'''Moose Mansfield''' is a burly footballer who constantly clashes with Jimmy Yama (see below).  He also has a crush on Spider-Girl.  On a field trip, he witnessed Spider-Girl running out of a toilet in which Courtney had been, and from then on, thought Courtney was Spider-Girl.  This led to comic results.  He has recently moved away to live with his uncle while his father is in the hospital.
*'''Brad Miller''' is a good-looking, smart teenager and May's secret crush.  Later, she dropped him when she found out he had a hatred for mutants.
*'''[[Normie Osborn]]''' is the grandson of Norman Osborn and was this universe's [[Green Goblin]] until he ceded that role to Phil Urich.  Former enemy and former crush of May's.  In recent issues, he had obtained the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]-[[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] for his own use until it died in the final battle against Hobgoblin and the Scriers. After the final battle, he married Brenda Drago (Raptor) though he still has feelings for May.    
*'''[[Raptor (comics)|Raptor]]''' (Brenda "Blackie" Drago) daughter of the second Vulture and former rogue until Spider-Girl convinced her to quit crime.  She is a member of Kaine's superteam of reformed supervillains and was recently married to Normie Osborn.  
* '''[[Kaine]]''' is very protective of Spider-Girl (his niece, and ultimately the source of his redemption).  He currently leads a government team of reformed supervillains. 
*'''[[Flash Thompson]]''' is the trainer of May's basketball squad.  He was once married to Felicia Hardy and had a daughter Felicity with her (see above), but is unaware that both are superheroes.
*'''Jimmy Yama''' is a nerdy Asian schoolmate of May who is on her Science Club.  He has a crush on May, a fact that makes May - who likes Jimmy as a friend, but not more - embarrassed.  He has a cousin named Zane, who happens to be the superhero [[J2 (comics)|J2]], the son of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].
*'''[[Push (comics)|Nancy Lu]]''' is an Asian schoolmate of May who was secretly a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers, until she was outed by her classmates, and forced to leave the high school.  She later returned as an [[X-Men|X-Man]] in-training known as "Push".
*'''[[Spider-Man (Gerry Drew)|Gerry Drew]]''' is the son of '''Jessica Drew''', the first [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. He has spider-powers because of her mother but he has an illness because of her radiation exposure. He once used the name '''Spider-Man''' but was stopped by Peter Parker.

==Spider-Girl's Uncle Ben==
Like her father, May also has an [[Uncle Ben]].  However, unlike her dad, May never knew her uncle: [[Ben Reilly]], Spider-Man's clone.  His last words before his death are about her: "Take care of my 'niece,' Peter... tell her about... her Uncle Ben" (''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' vol. 1 #75). Her first costume and web-shooters are in fact his, kept in storage since his death.  When May asks her father about him, however, Peter leaves out the fact that Ben was really a clone, instead referring to him as a [[Cousin chart|cousin]].

If Spider-Girl has any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben - May's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]].  As Peter and MJ named May after Peter's [[Aunt May]], May asks which Uncle Ben the newborn is named after: her Uncle Ben, or Peter's Uncle Ben.  Peter asks if it really matters, and May simply responds, "I guess not."

==Alternate versions==
===Earth-616===
May Parker also exists in the primary [[Earth-616]] timeline in which most [[Marvel Comics]] are set.  However, her status is unknown and she is believed to be dead.

[[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] became pregnant at the beginning of the [[Clone Saga]].  Impending fatherhood was one of the main reasons Peter retired as Spider-Man during that storyline, passing the mantle to [[Ben Reilly]].  However, at the end of the story, Mary Jane was poisoned by Alison Mongraine, an agent of the [[Green Goblin]], and the baby was stillborn (or seemed to be, as Mongraine  took the sedated infant away with her). Ben Reilly died at the Green Goblin's hands the same night, and Peter Parker became Spider-Man again.

There were hints during the "[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #434-435, one of Tom DeFalco's last storylines on the title, that Baby May would be returned. Instead, the subplot was dropped, and a few issues later DeFalco was replaced by [[Howard Mackie]] and [[John Byrne]].  Under that team, [[Aunt May]] was brought back instead.<ref>http://www.comicboards.com/spidergirl/view.php?rpl=000705182940&q</ref> In a flashback in ''Spider-Girl'' #49, an alternative version of this story was presented, with the younger May returned instead of the elder.
[[Image:Usm91.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] in her "Spider-Girl" costume, with [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], on the cover of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #91. Art by [[Mark Bagley]]]]
However, unlike developments in the MC2 continuity, baby May and her parents were never reunited in Marvel's main continuity. Editors have repeatedly stated that the baby died, or at the very least will not be seen again; the baby was considered a major factor in the "aging" of the characters. However, no proof of her death was ever shown, it was clearly implied that she was kidnapped, and Alison Mongraine and Kaine were never conclusively shown to have died either.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #439 (Defalco's last on the title), the issue takes place 1,000 years (2998 based on the release date of the issue) in the future.  Two archaeologists stumble across relics belonging to Spider-Man (such as his webshooters).  They speculate on his career, and discuss the other heroes who were inspired by him, such as Spider-Girl, [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Spider-Man 2211]].

===Earth X===
There are two variant and alternate universe versions of Spider-Girl.  One was raised by a Ben Reilly who survived after her father died during her childhood, as seen ''What If?'' vol. 2 #86, and later revealed in the ''Paradise X: Heralds'' mini-series.  Another version of Spider-Girl is actually Venom, who is seen in the ''[[Earth X]]'' mini-series and its two sequels, ''[[Universe X]]'' and ''[[Paradise X]]''.

The world of MC2 is designated as "Earth-982".  The world where Spider-Girl was raised by Ben Reilly is known as "Earth-1122" and the world featuring Venom as Spider-Girl along with the other heroes of the ''Earth X'' saga is known as "Earth-9997".

===[[Ultimate Spider-Man|Ultimate Universe]]===
In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', Peter's girlfriend [[Kitty Pryde]] (a.k.a. [[Shadowcat]]) adopts a second costumed identity in order to be able to fight crime at his side (it is already public knowledge that she and Shadowcat are one and the same; hence, she cannot work with him as Shadowcat). She first wears the costume in issue #91, and Peter jokingly suggests "Spider-Girl" as her crime-fighting name..<ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/news/113995099618514.htm Silver Bullet Comics preview of Ultimate Spider-Man #91]</ref>

{{spoiler}}
The ultimate universe's Spider-heroine was introduced in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #98; issue #102 reveals her to be a clone of Peter Parker whose chromosomes were manipulated to make her female. She resembles Peter, retains his memories, and appears to be the same age.  Cassandra Webb was preparing to erase the clone's memories in order to implant a new identity as "Jessica Drew," but she managed to escape before the process could be carried out.  This character is an analogue to the mainstream Marvel universe's [[Spider-Woman_%28Jessica_Drew%29|Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]].

==Appearances in other media==
===Novels===
*An older, more cynical alternate version of May Parker/Spider-Girl appears in the Spider-Man/[[X-Men]] team-up novel ''Time's Arrow 3: The Future'' by Tom DeFalco and [[Rosemary Edghill|eluki bes shahar]] (ISBN 0-425-16500-0). In that novel, Spider-Man travels to the alternate future known for its [[Iron Man 2020]] (Arno Stark). This universe's Earth is designated Earth-8410. In this reality, Spider-Girl wears a costume almost identical to the one worn by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], except the colors have been modified to look like Spider-Man's costume. She also has the ability to fire venom blasts as well as webs.

===Action Figures===
*[[Toy Biz]]'s 8-inch scale "Famous Covers" action figure line included a Spider-Girl with a cloth costume and removable mask.
*Toy Biz's 5-inch scale "First Appearances" line included a  Spider-Girl (as well as her allies, [[Cassandra Lang|Stinger]] and [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]).
*Toy Biz's preschool-oriented "Spider-Man & Friends" line has included several Spider-Girl figures and toys.  These feature an exposed lower face, visible eyes, and [[pigtails]] or a [[ponytail]], to make it easier for very young children to differentiate Spider-Girl from Spider-Man.
*According to some rumors, Spider-Girl is currently being considered for the [[Marvel Legends]] action figure series.

===Video games===
*Spider-Girl appeared as one of the alternate costumes for Spider-Woman in the multi-platform action-RPG ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
