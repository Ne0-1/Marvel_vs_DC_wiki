'''Spider-Girl''' ('''May "Mayday" Parker''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]ine active in an alternate future of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]].  The character was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man]] character, and first appeared in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (Vol. 2) #105 (1998).  She later acquired her own ongoing comic book, ''Spider-Girl'', written by DeFalco and drawn by Frenz and [[Pat Olliffe]], which is the longest-running superhero book with a lead female character ever published by Marvel.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

==Publication history==
Spider-Girl first appeared in a one-shot story in the ongoing series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''.  Following positive fan response to the concept, ''Spider-Girl'' and two other series (''[[A-Next]]'' and ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'') set in the same alternate future universe were launched under the [[MC2]] imprint.  Although each of these titles were slated to be 12-issue limited series, ''Spider-Girl'''s initial sales justified their continuation as ongoing titles.

After initial interest, ''Spider-Girl'' drew low sales.  However, the book's active fanbase caused Marvel to revoke several cancellation announcements.   Reprints of the series in [[digest size]] [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] sold well. Marvel Associate Editor Nick Lowe revealed in a November 2005 interview that "Spider-Girl, for the first time, is completely safe from cancellation."<ref>[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004386]</ref>

However, despite Lowe's statement, Marvel announced that #100 would be the title's final issue.  Although the ''Spider-Girl'' title was indeed canceled, the book was relaunched as ''The Amazing Spider-Girl,'' with issue #0 appearing in October 2006.

A prequel series, ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man]]'', will be written by DeFalco for the anthology magazine [[Spider-Man Family]]. DeFalco has implied strongly that the series will be the definitive history of the MC2 Spider-Man Universe.

On October 11th, Tom DeFalco announced that ''Amazing Spider-Girl'' will be canceled with issue 30, though he revealed that, due to the company's love of the character, she could possibly be given a sixteen-page back-up strip in ''Amazing Spider-Man Family''.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18419 DeFalco Confirms Amazing Spider-Girl Cancelation], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 13, 2008</ref>. On [[November 8th]] 2008, Marvel EIC [[Joe Quesada]] confirmed that Spider-Girl would indeed become a feature in ''Amazing Spider-Man Family''

==Cast==

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Maydayparker.png|thumb|225px|left|frame|May "Mayday" Parker. Art by [[Pat Olliffe]].]]
May "Mayday" Parker is the child of [[Spider Man|Peter]] and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane Parker]] in a future, alternate universe continuity. In the [[MC2]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|continuity]], they were reunited with their baby daughter by [[Kaine]], who found the child living with Alison Mongraine, the con artist who had kidnapped the baby on instruction from the Green Goblin. After they were reunited, Peter lost a leg during the horrific final conflict with the [[Green Goblin]]. After the battle Peter was offered a bionic replacement from Mr. Fantastic and, considering it a wake-up call, decided to retire and focus on being a husband and father (the battle is glimpsed in ''Spider Girl'' #7, and fully explained in ''Spider Girl'' #49). For years, they chose to keep their past from Mayday and hoped that she wouldn't develop powers of her own.

Despite her parents' hopes, May began developing versions of her father's Spider-powers when she was 15.  At the same time, [[Normie Osborn]] (Green Goblin's grandson) set out to restore the family name (as he saw it). Mayday donned [[Ben Reilly]]'s Spider-Man costume to stop him and soon took to crime fighting, at first hindered, then helped, by her worried parents.

May shares traits of both of her parents. Like her mother, she is beautiful, charismatic and popular student, and she is intelligent and bright, just as her father was. She also inherited his love for in-fight bantering. In addition, she is a very good athlete and excelled in her girls' [[basketball]] team until she quit after her powers emerged. On the other hand, May seems to have inherited the "Parker luck" in which her dual identity wreaks havoc in her private life.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Girl,'' May has promised to give up costumed super heroics, dates Eugene Thompson, and runs for student council. When Mary Jane becomes aware that the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] poses a threat to her daughter's teenage friends, she allows Mayday to resume her activities as Spider-Girl (a situation they wanted to keep secret from Peter).  After a battle with the Hobgoblin, May tells her father the truth, and after a conversation with Mary Jane, they allowed May to resume her Spider-girl identity.

After an attempt at helping the S.H.I.E.L.D government agency, a case filled with a piece of the Carnage symbiote was released. It attaches itself to May's friend Moose, who becomes the new Carnage. In exchange, Carnage will bond itself to Moose's terminally ill father, curing him in the process. Carnage causes a stir at May's school and kidnaps Peter and Baby Ben, forcing May to confront her friend. May tries to talk to Moose within the symbiote but fails, and it bonds with her brother Ben. Peter escapes as May battles the two symbiotes and gathers sonic gear that may be able to defeat the symbiote. However it is May who uses the weapons, thereby destroying the piece of the Carnage symbiote. Her success is not without a measure of collateral damage as well, however; not only is Moose furious at Spider Girl for dooming his father, but the sonic weapon renders Ben deaf, possibly forever.

Ben's hearing is eventually restored thanks to the intervention of Normie Osborn. Normie later stumbles on one of Norman Osborn's former labs, and discovers a fluid tank containing what appears to be a physical duplicate of Mayday Parker. Notes left behind by his grandfather indicate that this Mayday is the original he kidnapped years ago, hinting that the Mayday who has lived a full life is yet another clone.

Mayday continues to date Gene, but her jealously over Gene's relationship with Symone enrages and confuses her, she has found some mild release from her problems due to her close friendship with Wes Collins, which in turn has incensed Gene. During an encounter between the three in a bar, Gene almost knocks out Wes with a firm fist, but the punch is blocked by a concerned Mayday. Gene's punch being obstructed by Mayday humiliates him in front of his entire football team. 

Mayday eventually starts to feel the weight of her relationship, and chews out Wes for intervening on her behalf. Wes, however, remains deeply concerned about Mayday and discovers a plot by Symone to blackmail Gene and discredit her in front of the entire High School. Meanwhile, Fury The Goblin Queen activates a signal that awakens the Mayday inhabiting the tank within Osborn's labs, and she escapes, confronting Mayday on the roof of her high school just as she is changing into Spider-Girl. It is revealed that The Clone can mimic Mayday's clothing as well as her appearance, thus making her more of a hybrid of traditional cloning templates and the metamorphic powers displayed by [[Spidercide (comics)|Spidercide]].

Having been caught in the heart of an explosion that decimates New York City, a critically injured Mayday, her costume torn away by the impact, is rescued from the debris by Araña's forces. Araña, realizing that Mayday might not survive her ordeal, offers to merge with her, but she intervenes in a vision quest that Mayday is undergoing, and by aiding her overcome a force she was meant to overcome alone, she obstructs Spider-Girl from uncovering whether or not she is the true Mayday. Araña successfully completes the merging and assumes control of Mayday's body, leaving Mayday and a third, blond woman who shares her name (possibly the spirit of [[Aunt May]]) trapped within her own subliminal consciousness.

Meanwhile, The Changeling assumes Mayday's life and picks up where she left off, however her prescience deeply disturbs Benjy and a crestfallen Mayday also discovers that she has split up with Gene. Gene angrily retaliates when Mayday visits him, forcing her to take physical action and slam him through a table, which produces adulation and applause from the crowd.

==Powers and abilities==
May Parker inherited many of the [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|same abilities]] as her father, Peter Parker.  May possesses superhuman strength but has less than her father, can leap several stories high, and can cover the width of a city block. Spider-Girl's reflexes are also heightened to levels well beyond that of an ordinary human.  She heals somewhat faster than a normal human, and is more agile than Spider-Man.

Spider-Girl can adhere to almost any surface through a bio-magnetic field her body generates, allowing her to scale the sides of a building, just like a spider.  Wall-crawling doesn't come as naturally to May as Peter; she has to concentrate to keep herself from slipping off surfaces.  In addition to adhering to surfaces, May can also repel herself like an opposing magnet, or she can repulse and adhere another object or person through a shared medium.  For example, she can cause a person to stick to a wall they're touching just by touching that same wall and willing them to, or she can just as easily violently push them away.

She can also manipulate the length and speed at which her hair grows, a power that seems useless but actually has assisted May several times in doing undercover work.

May Parker has inherited a "spider-sense", a clairvoyance that warns her of danger that is somewhat more powerful and reliable than her father's.  It tells her the direction a threat is coming from with a high level of accuracy.  Through intensive training, she learned to fight blindfolded using only her spider-sense.  She can use it to spot weaknesses in an opponent and use them to her advantage.  She can also sense mundane threats or observations like her father, but unlike him she can use it to sense deception.  By touching her father's clone, [[Kaine]], she experienced a shared precognitive vision, but she does not normally have that ability.

May also has mechanical [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Web-shooters|web-shooters]] based on [[Ben Reilly]]'s web-shooter design, but longer and narrower. They can fire impact webbing and metal needles called "Stingers". May rarely uses the stingers, thinking them to be "too brutal". Her [[mobile phone]] is modified to attach to one of her web-shooters, and looks like one of its cartridges. She occasionally uses spider-tracers, but as they are tuned to her father's spider-sense and not hers, she needs a receiver to detect them.

Spider-Girl once lost her powers due to being electrocuted.  However, she borrowed the [[Green Goblin]] equipment from [[Normie Osborn]] until she regained them.

May has also received [[martial arts]] training from the [[Ladyhawk]]s and [[Elektra Natchios]], as well as being drilled in the use of her powers by her father.  

===Mutant question===
Whether Spider-Girl is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] has not been established. Before her birth, a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot found her to be "beyond the range of embryonic normalcy", but not specifically a mutant (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #415).

==Other versions==
===Earth-616===

May Parker also existed in the primary [[Earth-616]] timeline in which most [[Marvel Comics]] are set.

[[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] became pregnant at the beginning of the [[Clone Saga]].  Impending fatherhood was one of the main reasons Peter retired as Spider-Man during that storyline, passing the mantle to [[Ben Reilly]].  However, at the end of the story, Mary Jane was poisoned by Alison Mongraine, an agent of the [[Green Goblin]], and the baby was stillborn (or seemed to be, as Mongraine  took the sedated infant away with her). Ben Reilly died at the Green Goblin's hands the same night, and Peter Parker became Spider-Man again.

There were hints during the "[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #434-435, one of Tom DeFalco's last storylines on the title, that Baby May would be returned. Instead, the subplot was dropped, and a few issues later DeFalco was replaced by [[Howard Mackie]] and [[John Byrne]].  Under that team, [[Aunt May]] was brought back instead.<ref>[http://www.comicboards.com/spidergirl/view.php?rpl=000705182940&q Tom D. - Re: Tom I'm Very Curious<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>   In a flashback in ''Spider-Girl'' #49, an alternative version of this story was presented, with the younger May returned instead of the elder.

However, baby May and her parents were never reunited in Marvel's main continuity. Editors repeatedly stated that the baby died, or at the very least would never be seen again; the child was considered a major factor in the aging of the characters. In [[Marvel Knights Spider-Man]] issue #09 [[Mac Gargan]] while speaking of Norman Osborn states "He kills your unborn child, you kill his son". To date this is the most conclusive evidence of the infant's fate.

The action in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #439 (Defalco's last on the title) takes place 1,000 years in the future.  Two archaeologists stumble across relics belonging to Spider-Man (such as his webshooters).  They speculate on his career, and discuss other heroes who were inspired by him, such as Spider-Girl, [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Spider-Man 2211]].

In several interviews at [[Comic Book Resources]] following the publication of "One More Day," Joe Quesada mentioned that the Spider Girl title would be the ideal place for disgruntled readers to follow the development of an aged, married Peter and MJ as they raise a family.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}  Quesada's comments were followed by a feature article on Spider-Girl with an interview with Tom Defalco, who acknowledged that Quesada was a fan of the character and the title.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===Earth X===

There are two variant and alternate universe versions of Spider-Girl.  One was raised by a Ben Reilly who survived after her father died during her childhood, as seen ''What If?'' vol. 2 #86, and later revealed in the ''Paradise X: Heralds'' mini-series.  Another version of Spider-Girl is actually Venom, who is seen in the ''[[Earth X]]'' mini-series and its two sequels, ''[[Universe X]]'' and ''[[Paradise X]]''.
The world of MC2 is designated as "Earth-982".  The world where Spider-Girl was raised by Ben Reilly is known as "Earth-1122" and the world featuring Venom as Spider-Girl along with the other heroes of the ''Earth X'' saga is known as "Earth-9997"

===Ultimate Spider-Girl===
[[Image:Usm91.jpg|thumb|[[Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] in her "Spider-Girl" costume, with [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], on the cover of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #91. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', Peter's girlfriend [[Kitty Pryde]] ([[Shadowcat]]) adopts a second costumed identity in order to fight crime at his side.  (It is already public knowledge that she and Shadowcat are one and the same; hence, she cannot work with him as Shadowcat). She wears the costume in issue #91, and Peter jokingly suggests "Spider-Girl" as her crime-fighting name.<ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/news/113995099618514.htm Preview of Ultimate Spider-Man #91], [[Comics Bulletin]]</ref>

==Spectacular Spider-Man==

In a time-travel arc taking place in the U.K based publication ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'', aimed at a much younger audience, Peter meets a Spider-Girl whilst trailing [[The Sandman]] in the future. With the aid of Spider-Girl and [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]], Peter defeats The Sandman and returns to his own time with H.E.R.B.I.E. At the conclusion of the strip, Spider-Girl returns home to her parents, revealed as Peter and Mary Jane Parker, and unmasks to reveal the features of Mayday Parker. Mayday tells her parents of her experience with a "new Spider-Man", before Peter assures her that the individual she met was a past version of himself. Peter also reveals in the conversation that, like his MC2 counterpart, he was forced to abandon his career as Spider-Man due to a leg injury. This continuity is separate from both MC2 and 616, making this the second continuity to incorporate Mayday and adapt the MC2 version of how Peter relinquished the Spider-Man identity.

==In other media==
===Novels===
*An older, more cynical alternate version of May Parker/Spider-Girl appears in the [[Spider-Man]]/[[X-Men]] team-up novel ''Time's Arrow 3: The Future'' by Tom DeFalco & [[Rosemary Edghill]] (ISBN 0-425-16500-0). In that novel, Spider-Man travels to the alternate future known for its [[Iron Man 2020]] (Arno Stark). This universe's Earth is designated Earth-8410. In this reality, Spider-Girl wears a costume almost identical to the one worn by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], except the colors have been modified to look like Spider-Man's costume. She has the ability to fire venom blasts and webs.

===Action Figures===
*[[Toy Biz]]'s 8-inch scale "Famous Covers" action figure line included a Spider-Girl with a cloth costume and removable mask.
*Toy Biz's 5-inch scale "First Appearances" line included a  Spider-Girl (as well as her allies, [[Cassandra Lang|Stinger]] and [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]).
*Toy Biz's preschool-oriented "Spider-Man & Friends" line has included several Spider-Girl figures and toys.  These feature an exposed lower face, visible eyes, and [[pigtails]] or a [[ponytail]], to make it easier for very young children to differentiate Spider-Girl from Spider-Man. According to one of the children's books released for the "Spider-Man & Friends" toyline, this Spider-Girl is actually Spider-Man's cousin.

===Video games===
*Spider-Girl appeared as one of the alternate costumes for Spider-Woman in the multi-platform action-RPG ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
