'''Turner D. Century''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  He first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #33.

== Character history ==

He was born '''Clifford F. Michaels''', the son of a millionaire's [[chauffeur]]. His father's employer, Morgan MacNeil Hardy, had been responsible for rebuilding much of [[San Francisco]] after the [[Great Fire]], and was disturbed by the alleged degeneration of manners and mores in subsequent decades.  After a movement he started to turn the tide failed, he retreated, with young Clifford (whose father had died) as a surrogate son whom he sheltered from the current world and taught to idealize earlier times.  

Turner D. Century was a young man with dark hair worn in the style of 1900, and a handlebar [[moustache]] of the sort popular at that time.  He wore a costume consisting of typical [[summer]] clothing as would be worn by a young man of the middle classes in the year [[1900]] in the [[United States]] &mdash; a straw "boater" hat, a striped jacket, and white trousers.

His motivation was a hatred of the social changes that had come about since the time-period he idealized (the period just before [[World War I]]), and many of his crimes involved striking out at things or people that represented, in his view, these changes. To that end, he tried to eradicate the current population of San Francisco using a hyper-sonic weapon of his own design and rebuild the old society again. He was opposed by [[Spider-Man]] and the aging adventurer [[Dominic Fortune]], and his scheme turned out to be in vain; although the weapon affected all within its range, it had only rendered them unconscious, not killed them.

Turner D. Century was killed by the assassin [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] along with several other villains in the "Bar with No Name" in ''[[Captain America]]'' #319. Later, he became one of the deceased people cloned and used as servants by [[Arnim Zola]].

== Powers and abilities ==

Century had no inherent superpowers. He owned and used an [[umbrella]] that concealed a [[flamethrower]], and rode a [[tandem bicycle]] (the rear seat was taken by a dummy wearing fashionable women's clothes of the pre-World War I era) that could fly by unknown means.
