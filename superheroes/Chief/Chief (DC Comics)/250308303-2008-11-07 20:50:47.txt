==Fictional character history==

Dr. Niles Caulder is a [[paraplegic]] gifted with a [[genius]]-level intellect. Caulder uses his scientific knowledge to develop numerous inventions and innovations that has made him wealthy. Caulder founded and organized the team called Doom Patrol to protect the innocent and fight crime, and to teach humanity to accept others who live as ostracised "freaks," who have been radically transformed from terrible accidents.<ref name="dc-doom"/> It is Caulder's genius that allowed the team members to survive (e.g., designing [[Robotman (comics)#Cliff Steele|Robotman]]'s body, devising [[Negative Man]]'s medicated bandages), and helped grant their freakishness and amazing abilities.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Caulder growing up had developed an interest in creating better life, based on the concept of the story "[[Frankenstein]]" (in which a fanatical scientist demonstrates a similar idea through the being he creates), as well as "[[The Singing Ringing Tree]]" (in which 'well-to-do' people, who were transformed into beasts, have to prove their worth to the world by becoming selfless). Proving at a young age to be both a brilliant inventor and engineer, Caulder received funding from a mysterious benefactor.  Thanks to the funding, Caulder succeeded in creating a chemical capable of prolonging life. Ultimately, it was revealed that the benefactor was a man called [[General Immortus]], who hired Caulder to create a chemical to replace the one that had been prolonging his life for centuries but was now failing. When the young scientist discovered the truth about his employer, he refused to continue the work. Immortus responded by implanting an explosive device in Caulder's upper torso, which he could set off remotely, and any attempt to remove it while Niles lived would also detonate it. Caulder eventually devised a plan to get the bomb out, but it cost him his ability to walk.<ref name="dc-immo">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = General Immortus | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 136 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> The incident inspired and reminded Caulder that a better life may come from surviving a tragic event, such as his own.

Per later retcons, this led to Caulder engineering the "accidents" that cause the original Doom Patrol members to gain their powers, since his personal philosophy is that true greatness comes through overcoming tragic events. However, in the original continuity of the 1960s, he played no role in the future Doom Patrol members' mutations but merely located and gathered them to give them a sense of purpose.

In the early years of the Patrol, Caulder not only kept his true identity and appearance secret from the public, even his team knew him only as the Chief. In issue #88 (June 1964), their third battle against Immortus forces him to tell the rest of the Patrol his back-story and real name, which suddenly and with no explanation becomes common public knowledge for the rest of the original 60s series (even two "flashback" miniseries that ran in the back of the comic, detailing how Cliff Steele and Larry Trainor became "freaks" and were recruited by Caulder, casually used the name).

In recent years, in keeping with the above retcons that he manipulated the original Doom Patrol's transformations, it has been revealed that Caulder had also experimented on other characters in the world who would both benefit and destroy humanity. The most noted are a bitter group called the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], a group of people who also live like "freaks" lead by [[Brain (comics)|the Brain]]. The Brotherhood exists as an elitist paramilitary organization involved in terrorist acts around the world such as the destruction of the American city Bl√ºdhaven, occasionally attempting global control of humanity, and the death and destruction Niles Caulder for causing their tragic transformations. 

Towards the end of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''Doom Patrol'' run, Caulder is discovered working on a nanotechnology bomb that will destroy half the world and replace it with humans transformed into freaks of nature &mdash; his theory being that from the destruction would rise a better human race. He murders the original Tempest, [[Joshua Clay]], to protect his secret but the Doom Patrol succeed in stopping his plans.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

During these events, he is decapitated by a creation of Dorothy Spinner's known as [[The Candlemaker (DC Comics)|The Candlemaker]]. Doctor Will Magnus of the [[Metal Men]] builds a new body for the Chief, telling him that he should try helping the Patrol to make up for what he did. Becoming suicidal with guilt, the Chief states that he can never do enough to make up for his actions, and uses his new body to rip off his head. Magnus is able to save the Chief by getting the head to a cryogenic chamber, but after this the Chief exists solely as a [[decapitation|severed head]] in a bucket of [[ice]], subsisting on [[milkshake]]s. He expresses remorse at his actions and rebuilds the Doom Patrol to continue their efforts in the war against weird crime.

In the final issues of the series, the Chief had combined himself with Alice Wired-for-Sound, one of the SRS (Sexually Remaindered Spirits), who powered the DP Teleporter, as a means for more mobility. During the last story arc, ''Imagine Ari's Friends'', the Chief died entering the Tree of Life, the Sephirot.

===Post Infinite Crisis===
After [[Superboy-Prime]]'s pounding on the barriers to reality, certain events are rewritten, and Niles has his body back and still acts as the team leader. It has been revealed that he apparently still is responsible for the creation of the original members of the Patrol, though they claim to have forgiven him. 

Caulder now seems to be intent on expanding the Doom Patrol's ranks; he has already convinced [[Beast Boy]] to return to the team and formally join it for the first time, and gotten [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] and [[Mal Duncan|Vox]] to join.  However, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] doubts the Chief's motives, and after seeing him appear to manipulate [[Elasti-Girl]], Robin accuses him of brainwashing the Doom Patrol by keeping them dependent on him.  For his part, Caulder maintains that by joining the Doom Patrol, team members "won't have to be freaks anymore." Later, when Caulder is overheard telling [[Kid Devil]] that his teammates don't like him and he should join the Doom Patrol, the others finally see that he is controlling them with fear and self-loathing. While Caulder tells them that they need him, [[Mento (comics)|Mento]] finally takes off his helmet, allowing him to think clearly.  Mento then informs the Chief that he is no longer their leader and if he ever speaks to Elasti-Girl or Beast Boy like that ever again, he will destroy Caulder's intellect.  Shocked by this, the Chief rushes off to his lab.

Also in the Teen Titans story{{issue|date=April 2008}}, it is also revealed that Caulder brutally murdered the scientist who would become "[[Brain (comics)|The Brain]]" because they were both working on General Immortus' potion and Caulder was jealous of the Brain's genius and tried to blow up the other scientist's lab in order to force him to become Robotman prior to Cliff Steele's accident that made him the character of the same name. Brain also reveals that he and the Doom Patrol are not the only innocent humans whose bodies are mutilated against their will by Caulder to create his own personal super-hero team.  Two never before mentioned characters (Electric Blu and the Human Cannon) and a Negative Girl (possibly a retcon of ([[Valentina Vostok]]) are said to be out there somewhere, having rejected Caulder for the damage he inflicted upon them.

Recently, Caulder designed a new training room for the [[Justice League]]. He also appears in ''Four Horsemen'' #4, apparently back in charge of the Doom Patrol.
