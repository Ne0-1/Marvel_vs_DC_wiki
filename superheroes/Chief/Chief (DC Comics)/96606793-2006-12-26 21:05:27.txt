'''The Chief''' (Dr. Niles Caulder) is a [[fictional character]] from [[DC Comics]] and starred in the [[Doom Patrol]] [[comic books|comic]].
==Character history==
===Origins===
Dr. Niles Caulder was a [[paraplegic]] gifted with a [[genius]]-level intellect. Caulder used his scientific knowledge to develop numerous inventions and innovations that made him wealthy. It was Caulder who organized the Doom Patrol to protect the innocent and fight crime, and it was his genius that allowed the team members to survive (e.g., building [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]]'s body, obtaining [[Negative Man]]'s medicated bandages). 
===The manipulator===
It was later revealed that he engineered the accidents that caused the original Doom Patrol members to gain their powers, since his personal philosophy was that true greatness could only come through tragedy. Towards the end of [[Grant Morrison|Grant Morrison's]] Doom Patrol run he was discovered to be working on a nanotechnology bomb that would destroy half the world and replace it with humans who would have been transformed into freaks of nature- his theory being that from the destruction would rise a better human race. He murdered the original Tempest, [[Tempest (comics)|Joshua Clay]], to protect his secret but the Doom Patrol succeeded in stopping his plans.

During these events, he was decapitated. Doctor Will Magnus of the [[Metal Men]] built a new body for the Chief, telling him that he should try helping the Patrol to make up for what he did. Becoming suicidal with guilt, the Chief stated that he could never do enough to make up for his actions, and used his new body to rip off his head. Magnus was able to save the Chief by getting the head to a cryogenic chamber, but after this the Chief existed solely as a [[decapitation|severed head]] in a bucket of [[ice]], feeding on [[milkshake]]s. He expressed remorse at his actions and rebuilt the Doom Patrol to continue their efforts in the war against weird crime.

===A new start===
After [[Superboy-Prime]]'s pounding on the barriers to reality, certain events were rewritten, and Niles currently has his body back and still acts as the team leader. It has been revealed that he apparently still is responsible for the creation of the original members of the Patrol, though they claim to have forgiven him. 

Caulder now seems to be intent on expanding the Doom Patrol's ranks; he has already convinced [[Beast Boy]] to return to the team, and [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] and [[Mal Duncan|Vox]] to join.  However, [[Tim Drake|Robin]] doubts the Chief's motives, and after seeing him appear to manipulate [[Elasti-Girl]], Robin accuses him of brainwashing the Doom Patrol by keeping them dependent on him.  For his part, Caulder maintains that by joining the Doom Patrol, team members "won't have to be freaks anymore." However, later on when Caulder is overheard telling [[Kid Devil]] that his teammates don't like him and he should join the DP, the others finally see that he is controlling them with fear and self-loathing. While Caulder tells them that they need him, [[Mento (comics)|Mento]] finally takes off his helmet, allowing him to think clearly.  Mento then informs the Chief that he is no longer their leader and if he ever speaks to Elasti-Girl or Beast Boy like that ever again, he would destroy the man's brilliant intellect.  Shocked by this, the Chief rushed off to his lab.

In the following above Teen Titans story, it was also revealed that Niles brutally murdered the scientist who would become "[[Brain (comics)|The Brain]]" in order to force him to become Robotman. Brain also revealed that he and the Doom Patrol were not the only innocent humans whose bodies were mutilated against their will by Niles to create his own personal super-hero team.  Three never before mentioned characters (Electric Blu, the Human Cannon, and Negative Girl) were said to be out there somewhere, having rejected Caulder for the damage he inflicted upon them.
