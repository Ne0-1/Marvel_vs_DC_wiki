|}}'''Donald & Deborah Ritter''' are [[fictional character]]s from [[Marvel Comics]]. They are the [[twin]] children of [[Thena]], leader of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], and [[Kro (comics)|Kro]], sometime leader of the race of [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. The Ritter twins were created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Dann Thomas]] and [[Mark Texeira]]. The twins first appeared in the one-shot special ''Eternals: The Herod Factor''.

==Fictional character biographies==
Thena and Kro, despite being members of two offshoots of humanity who have been traditional enemies, have had a relationship for over 25,000 years. During the [[Vietnam war]], the two had a sexual encounter, and Thena discovered she was pregnant. Using her powers, she secretly implanted the [[embryo]]s into an infertile human woman, and the two grew up unaware of their ancestry.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

When Dr. [[Daniel Damian]], a human who was aware of the existence of Deviants and Eternals, sent a monster (formerly [[Ajak]]) to slay the two children, killing numerous other sets of twins in the process, Thena took the two to [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]], the city of Eternals, but did not inform them of their heritage. However, even Olympia proved unsafe, and the monster captured the two to [[Peru]], where they confronted Damian. The Twins learned of their true origin, and were rescued by Kro and Thena.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The Ritter twins have been shown twice since then; In ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #370-371, the two joined Kro's [[Delta Network]], and demonstrated the ability to merge into a two-mouthed, four-eyed and four-armed creature calling itself Tzabaoth. In [[Heroes for Hire]] #6, they again merged, this time forming into a sleek, winged metallic creature called Dark Angel. In both stories, the twins were supposedly merging for the "first" time, and both stories also portrayed the "resurrection" of the Deviant [[Ghaur]], suggesting that perhaps the writers of these stories were unaware that these characters had already been used in this way.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Both Tzabaoth and Dark Angel had Eternal-like abilities, including great strength and durability, flight, and the power to fire energy beams from its eyes.{{issue|date=December 2012}}
