'''Amadeus Cho''', also known as '''Mastermind Excello''', '''Prince of Power''', and '''The Hulk''' as of 2015, is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by American writer [[Greg Pak]] and Canadian artist [[Takeshi Miyazawa]], the character first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' vol. 2 #15 (January 2005). Cho usually appears in books featuring [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] or individual members of that group, such as [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]] or [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].

A 19-year-old [[Korean American]] genius who is one of the eight smartest people on Earth, Cho succeeded [[Bruce Banner]] as the Hulk in ''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #1 (2015), which is one of the first Marvel series with an [[Asian American]] character as the title character. In contrast with Banner, who found his Hulk powers to be a burden, Cho is a confident character who revels in his newfound abilities.<ref>https://news.marvel.com/comics/25115/amadeus_cho_becomes_the_totally_awesome_hulk/</ref>

==Publication history==
Amadeus Cho was created by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Takeshi Miyazawa]], and first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy#Volume 2|Amazing Fantasy]]'' (volume 2) #15, in one of an anthology of stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pakbuzz.com/amadeus_cho/ |title=Greg Pak: Amadeus Cho |website=Pakbuzz.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref> Pak brought Cho back as a major character in the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' storyline, and then as one of the primary characters in ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]''. He subsequently starred in his own miniseries, ''Heroic Age: Prince of Power''.

In December 2015, Cho began headlining the new series ''The Totally Awesome Hulk'', written by Pak and drawn by [[Frank Cho]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-reveals-new-hulks-totally-awesome-identity |title=Marvel Reveals New Hulk's "Totally Awesome" Identity - CBR |website=Comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Amadeus Cho took part in the Excello soap company's "young genius" contest, winning easily. After his abilities were discovered, [[Pythagoras Dupree]], the man behind the contest, had Amadeus' house blown up, killing his parents, [[Philip and Helen Cho]], and leaving Amadeus on the run for his life, distrusting almost everyone he meets. Shortly after going on the run on his characteristic [[Vespa]] scooter, he adopted an orphaned [[coyote]] pup, whom he sometimes uses to gain sympathy. After once being saved from his pursuers by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], he considers the latter as a friend and strictly views him as heroic and reactive to the aggression of others.

Amadeus Cho has stated to Hercules, just before he first encountered [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] at her house, that he is [[Korean American]], and mentions to Athena later at an Olympian dinner when questioned about his namesake that, due to his parents' love for [[Mozart]]'s music and [[Methodist]] beliefs, they named him this.

The character is next seen during the events of the crossover event, [[World War Hulk]], where he first comes across a de-powered [[She-Hulk|Jen Walters]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' 106 (2007) World War Hulk pt. 2</ref> He then gathers a team of the Hulk's former colleagues of the super-group [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], both of whom considered themselves in debt to the Hulk for mistakenly attacking him on a previous occasion. With the assistance of [[Namora]] they attempt and fail to stop the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #107</ref>

===The Incredible Hercules===
The ''Incredible Hulk'' series is then retitled ''Incredible Hercules'' from #112, and the character's adventures as the sidekick of Hercules are detailed. Due to them helping the Hulk they go on the run, but are chased by Hercules' half-brother [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]. The character then participates in a number of adventures, including helping Hercules and other Earthly gods defeat the pantheon of [[Skrull]] gods during the [[Secret Invasion]] storyline. During this, [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] finds out Cho's greatest fears at the time is finding out all the bad events in his life are his fault. It is revealed that Cho reminds Hercules of Hylas, a young companion who he lost during the Argonaut's voyage.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #116-120</ref>

Following this storyline the pair battle [[Amazons]], led by Princess Artume, who need him to decipher an Atlantean tablet that will lead to the [[Omphalos]]. Amadeus is attracted to the Amazon warrior [[Delphyne Gorgon]], but upon her becoming queen she is obliged to end any flirtation, to his sadness.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #121-125</ref>

Together with Athena, Amadeus and Hercules next confront the new head of the Olympians, [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]],<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #127-128</ref> and travel to the underworld to rescue [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] from Hades. There it is revealed that Cho's sister is still alive and missing. Upon learning this, and realizing that Athena had to have known this all along, he tearfully leaves Hercules, determined to find out what happened to his sister.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129-131</ref>

Venturing to the town of Excello, Utah, he encounters former FBI Agent Sexton, who had contacted him shortly after the death of his parents, and does battle with Pythagoras Dupree, who claims to be the sixth-smartest man in the world. Cho realizes the incredible potential of his brain to serve as a 'hypercomputer', and figures out that Sexton is in fact Athena in disguise.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #133, 135</ref>

Amadeus finally confronts Dupree in person, and learns that Dupree was not aware of Amadeus' sister being missing, meaning she is still missing. Amadeus also learns that his destiny is to be the new hero of the modern era of reason, and to stop the "Primordial darkness" (this is revealed to the reader to be the return of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]). Dupree then challenges Amadeus to a specialized version of Russian Roulette, which Amadeus refuses to do, leaving Dupree to simply shoot himself. After grieving about the situation, he then discovers the truth about Hera's mysterious "Continuum" project, which makes Athena and Amadeus both say in unison, "We need to get Hercules."<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #137</ref>

Parallel to those stories, in the aftermath of the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, the character is used by writer [[Dan Slott]] in his run on the ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' title.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref>

Athena reveals to Cho that he is her choice to be the next Prince of Power, the "Hero of the mind", as opposed to the hero of strength that Hercules represented. Furthermore, there cannot be more than one Prince of Power at any one time; this means that Hercules will soon meet his death. Cho vows to prevent this.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #138</ref> Delphyne then uses a weapon forged by Hephaestus to turn Athena to stone, seemingly killing her.<ref>''Incredible Hercules''#139</ref> Hercules and Cho aim to retrieve her body and Delphyne changes sides in the process, though it is ultimately the arrival of the divine thunderbolt after Zeus and Hera are killed by Typhon that restores Athena to life. Hercules successfully defeats Typhon, but Athena reveals to Hercules that he must now die and seemingly allows him to perish by destroying the Continuum, causing the Universe Hercules is in to be destroyed. She claims he must die so Cho can take over the group, and that he rid the world of monsters so that intelligence could take over.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #141</ref>

A funeral service is held at the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, where a tearful Amadeus demands Athena show herself and pay her respects. In her place appear a collection of Earth's heroes including [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Warriors Three]], [[Bruce Banner]], [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]], [[Namor]], Namora, the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Angel, and [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]]. They share memories of their adventures with Hercules until Athena finally arrives. She reveals to Amadeus that he is the new leader of the Olympus Group.<ref>''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' #1</ref> Some of the other gods object and each chooses a mortal proxy to do battle for them. Amadeus is chosen by Athena and he is joined by Namor and Bruce Banner, representing Poseidon and Hebe. They are pitted against Skaar and Phobos representing Artemis and Apollo. Nyx, goddess of night also arrives and chooses Nightmare as her mortal champion. Poseidon gives Namor his trident which greatly increases his power, and helps him in his fight against Skaar. Cho and Banner manage to get rid of Nightmare and convince Phobos not to fight them. The combatants turn against the gods and Phobos uses his power over fear to manipulate Hades into opening a portal to the underworld. Amadeus travels into the land of the dead to look for Hercules and meets Persephone, wife of Hades. She tells him that Hades would not have allowed him in if Hercules' soul had been there. The following Monday Athena arrives at Olympus Group headquarters to find that Amadeus has accepted her offer and is now acting as CEO. He tells her that he is not her champion, he's Hercules' champion, and that he will be using all the powers given to him to find Hercules.<ref>''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' #2</ref>

===Prince of Power===
Athena is shown meeting with the Council of Godheads to discuss the new [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]], and who should be selected to confront the coming darkness of Mikaboshi. Other Skyfathers suggest Thor, [[Iron Man]], and [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]], but Athena states that Cho will save the world. Cho, now in charge of the Olympus Group, with Hebe working as his assistant, spends half a trillion dollars in order to have [[Bruce Banner]] build a device capable of scanning the multiverse to find Hercules. However, it is determined that this will take over a billion years to work. After a battle with the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], Cho is visited by [[Agamemnon (comics)|Vali Halfling]], the leader of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], who proposes an alliance in order to gather the necessary ingredients to become as powerful as the Skyfathers: Hebe's [[ambrosia]], the golden apples of [[Idunn (Marvel Comics)|Idunn]], the spells of [[the Book of Thoth]], and the [[amrita]] cup of [[Dhanavantari]]. Cho steals the list from Vali and goes to Asgard himself, only to find that Vali had already stolen the apples, framing him for the theft. Cho convinces Thor that he is innocent, and Thor then joins his quest to both stop Halfling and resurrect Hercules. With some additional assistance from Delphyne, who is now his girlfriend, Cho succeeds in thwarting Halfling and using the elixir to assume true godhood. However, he realizes that he is inadequate to wield this power permanently, and he instead transfers it to the returned Hercules, as Hercules warns that the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Chaos King]] is coming.<ref>''Heroic Age: Prince of Power'' #1-4</ref>

===Chaos War===
Amadeus Cho is among the characters present when Hercules warns the heroes of the coming of Amatsu-Mikaboshi.<ref>''Chaos War'' #1</ref> After what happened to [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], Amadeus Cho helps Hercules and Thor gather [[Sersi]], [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], [[Silver Surfer]], and [[Galactus]] together as the second incarnation of the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]].<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref> Amadeus Cho calculates that Amatsu-Mikaboshi by now has consumed most of the Multiverse. Amadeus Cho urges humanity to escape to an unpopulated and sealed-off continuum of which he knows.<ref>''Chaos War'' #4</ref> While Hulk and his allies, the God Squad, [[Alpha Flight]], and the surviving Dead Avengers fight Amatsu-Mikaboshi's forces, Amadaeus Cho and Galactus work on a machine that will transfer Earth to the sealed-off continuum, but Amatsu-Mikaboshi is eventually defeated when ''he'' is thrown into the continuum in question himself.<ref>''Chaos War'' #5</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Amadeus Cho ends up in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with [[X-23]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]], and [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]. During the battle, they are attacked by samurai sharks.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #5</ref> It's revealed that Amadeus assembled them in the hopes that they would join him as a new super team. The others get angry because he was manipulating them and they turn down his offer.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #6</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event in the pages of ''[[Savage Wolverine]]'', Amadeus Cho appeared on an island in the [[Savage Land]] where he stops the fight between Wolverine and a tribe of [[Neanderthal]]s after one of them had killed [[Shanna the She-Devil]]. He convinces them that he is their god and to help save Shanna's life.<ref>''Savage Wolverine'' #3</ref> Using the lifeblood of a [[Man-Thing]] that was native to the Savage Land, the Neanderthal tribe resurrected Shanna. Amadeus Cho told Shanna what the Neanderthal natives had explained to him. The machine powering the damping field was also powering a prison, one holding an ancient hostile alien presence. Realizing that Wolverine would be releasing this creature, Shanna raced to stop him. She arrived in time with Amadeus Cho right behind her and was able to stop Wolverine. Suddenly, Hulk appeared before them, however, and quickly entered a scuffle with Wolverine in which the machine was damaged anyway.<ref>''Savage Wolverine'' #4</ref>

Following an eight-month time skip as seen in the ''Time Runs Out'' storyline, Cho is seen as a member of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. He is captured by a joint S.H.I.E.L.D./Avengers task force led by [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]].<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 5) #35</ref>

===The Totally Awesome Hulk===
In 2015, Amadeus Cho was announced as the new Hulk in the series ''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' as part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event. Eight months after the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, following an incident where the original Hulk absorbed a lethal amount of radiation, Cho used special nanites to remove the Hulk from Bruce Banner and place it into his body, allowing him to become his own version of Hulk. With the help of his sister Maddy, he starts hunting down dangerous monsters that are loose on Earth, but is criticized for his irresponsible approach. During this time, he encounters [[She-Hulk]] and the second [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] who aid him in the battle against the various monsters and Lady Hellbender, a humanoid female alien whose strength almost matches that of the Hulk's. Cho is eventually captured by Lady Hellbender. With the help of Maddy, She-Hulk breaches Lady Hellbender's ship, releasing the horde of monsters. Cho and She-Hulk defeat the monsters. He also battled [[Fin Fang Foom]] in the course of the event. Later, Amadeus begins to experience strange dreams about his parents' death just at the same time when he starts to have some "blackouts" (becoming the Hulk without even remembering it). After an argument with Maddy, who fears the Amadeus' Hulk starts to be like Banner's Hulk, he wanders through the desert until he encounters the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], who manipulates him into helping her take over the Ten Realms. When he wakes up, he's found by Maddy when [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]] arrives. After a brief battle, Maddy convinces Thor that Amadeus is innocent. They go to Iceland where Thor reveals that Hulk had stolen a supply of uru and gave it to the Enchantress and her partner [[Malekith the Accursed]]. Upon finding her, Thor and Hulk battle her army, who had the upper hand because of their uru-made weapons. At first, Amadeus tries to keep himself out of the fight, fearing he might lose control again, until Maddy gives him a pep talk that allows him to take control of himself. He transforms into Hulk and defeats Enchantress by using the giant axe she gave him to destroy the uru weapons. Thor then defeats her army and gives the uru back to the dwarves.<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #1-6</ref>

While in Manhattan, Amadeus meets [[Old Man Logan]] who thought that Hulk was Bruce Banner. As Old Man Logan was too weak to fight him due to his age, he learned that the Hulk was Cho and not Bruce Banner. Old Man Logan then fled from the police.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Amadeus Cho rescues Bruce Banner from a bar fight and reveals to him that he is gamma free. Later, he found Bruce on a beach in [[California]], sick with influenza, and takes him to his secret base in Arizona. He and Maddy also bring Rick Jones and She-Hulk to help heal him. Meanwhile, Amadeus begins to worry over the fact that the gamma radiation is affecting him emotionally, which causes him to black out. After a conversation with the others, he talks to Bruce about it who in turn tells him that he's not a monster but a hero. Amadeus then finds out about Bruce Banner's death through the news. He gets angry towards [[Carol Danvers]], for following the prediction of [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses Cain]] about a massacre made by Banner's Hulk form, leading to Bruce Banner's death, while claiming that Bruce was cured. He then teases Carol by jumping through the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in West Virginia and smashing the ground, leaving a writing saying "Made you look". Cho then heads towards the East Coast, where he plans to confront Banner's murderer [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] despite the objections of Maddy and the other heroes. He finds a cabin where he supposedly comes across Hawkeye but it was actually [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], who fights Cho with his own version of the Hulkbuster as he believes Cho's emotional distraught makes him a threat. Just when he's defeating Black Panther, Amadeus receives a distress call from Maddy, who located a giant insectoid monster in [[Austin]], [[Texas]]. During the battle, Hulk discovers that the monster feeds off people's emotions, which makes him bigger, stronger and faster. Though Hulk is able to knock him down, the monster rises and defeats him. The monster then kidnaps a baby, leaving the mother devastated and Hulk shocked, while Black Panther arrives to arrest Hulk. After Maddy convinces Black Panther to stand down, they work together to track the monster, finding him underground with the baby. Amadeus tries to reason with the monster, who transformed back into a human named Christian Sung. After refusing to talk, Sung throws the baby whoi saved by Black Panther. Amadeus transforms into Hulk and fights Sung, who's teleported to the [[Negative Zone]] by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jake Oh. Maddy then yells at Amadeus, saying she's done with helping him, and leaves. A week later, in [[Topeka, Kansas]], Amadeus finds Hawkeye in a diner where he expresses a desire to kill him out of revenge until he calms down leading both of them to cry over Bruce Banner's death.<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #7-12</ref>

Weeks later, Amadeus, while attempting to contact Maddy, meets NBA basketball player [[Jeremy Lin]], who invites him to a charity game. The next day, during the game, the stadium is attacked by robot dragons. Amadeus manages to destroy one of them but the others escape, taking Jeremy Lin and Arch-E hostage. Amadeus is able to rescue Jeremy Lin, but the robot dragon escapes with Arch-E. When attempting to call for reinforcements, Amadeus is approached by Maddy, who injects him with a temporary gamma inhibitor and tells him to stand down. Amadeus and Jeremy then encounter a robot car, who reveals that it's controlled by [[List of Marvel Comics characters: Q#Quasimodo|QUASI/MO/DO]] who was planning to assimilate all technology. After rescuing a rebuilt Arch-E-5912 from a robotic octopus, Amadeus reveals an auto-scan that exposes a weakness in the robot. The four of them manage to defeat the robot octopus by placing a small robot within the weak point that downloads a virus. He later appears alongside Ms. Marvel, [[Shang-Chi]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], Jake Oh and [[Jimmy Woo]], performing in a charity event and then hanging out in New York, until an alien army arrives. During the battle, the heroes and a number of civilians are transported to a base near Seknarf Seven, the aliens' home planet, and learn that they'll be consumed. Amadeus then rallies the civilians to prepare for battle. After elaborating an escape plan, Prince Regent, ruler of Seknarf Seven, arrives with his soldiers and demands that three of the humans turn themselves in. When Amadeus, Jimmy and Jake offer themselves to the aliens, the civilians use their gadgets to disable the alien equipment enabling the heroes to fight them easily. But when the aliens kill Jeffrey, one of the civilians, the group charge towards them. During the battle, the [[Alpha Flight]] Space Program arrives to rescue the group and arrest Prince Regent, who was revealed to be an exile. Amadeus and Jimmy later have a discussion until they're transported back home. A few days later, Amadeus, Ms. Marvel and Silk visit a children's hospital while Jimmy watches the event on TV.<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #13-18</ref>

Sometime later during the ''[[Weapons of Mutant Destruction]]'' storyline, Amadeus rescues a Russian spacecraft when he's attacked by two killer Adamantium cyborgs. After destroying them, he finds Old Man Logan, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] who tell him that the robots were created by the [[Weapon X]] Project to exterminate them. While researching the metal samples gathered by the mutants, Amadeus remembers that the robots were able to get a sample of his DNA after he destroyed them. The DNA samples of Amadeus Cho's Hulk form were given to the Weapon X Project's director who turns out to be a somehow-revived [[William Stryker]].<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #19</ref> When Amadeus Cho's Hulk form and the mutants on Old Man Logan's side raid the Weapon X Project's base and frees [[Lady Deathstrike]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], William Stryker sets the base to self-destruct where its employees were killed in the process.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> It was also shown that William Stryker was starting a project that involves the blood from Amadeus Cho's Hulk form that is part of the ingredients for the Mutant/Hulk hybrids.<ref>''Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha'' #1</ref> Following some further investigations, Old Man Logan's group and Amadeus Cho's Hulk raided the Weapon X Project's central command. Amadeus Cho's Hulk form did not want Old Man Logan, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike to kill him. At the same time Doctor Alba unleashes Bobby Andrews in his mutated H-Beta form.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #6</ref> As Old Man Logan, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike disputed with Amadeus Cho's Hulk form, William Stryker took the opportunity to get away. As Amadeus Cho's Hulk form shows up to help fight H-Beta and try to reason with it, it gave Doctor Alba the opportunity to unleash the H-Alpha which beheads H-Beta. Cho fights with H-Alpha as William Stryker and Doctor Alba get away in a helicopter upon them being unable to control H-Alpha. The resulting fight destroys the Weapon X Project's base. After H-Alpha gets away, Cho angrily takes his leave while Old Man Logan and his allies make plans to take the Weapon X name back and keep the Weapon X Project from reclaiming control of H-Alpha. Later, Cho (with help from Maddy, T'Challa, Ms. Marvel, Silk and Jake Oh) unsuccesfully tries to confront his Hulk personality, but he ends up launching himself to the space as a contingency plan.<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #22-23</ref>

===The Champions===
Following the "Civil War II" storyline, Cho, in his Hulk form, had finished some rescuing in Kentucky when he is approached by [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]], [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]], and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man II]] into joining the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] so that they can "put the world back together". Cho suggests that they also recruit Vision's daughter [[Viv Vision|Viv]], which they managed to do. Later, during a camping trip, the team is visited by the teenage version of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], who wants to join them. After the others agree to recruit him, Hulk is later seen kissing Viv in the forest. They later head to Lasibad, Sharzad to help a group of women and girls that are being gunned down by terrorists. After rescuing a small group, they form a plan to drive the oppressors away. After their victory, the team argues over who should be the leader when their ship gets hit by a bazooka. Upon surviving the crash, Hulk and Cyclops propel the vehicle forward because Viv saw land. Unfortunately, the 'land' they saw turned out to be an Atlantean ship and they were kidnapped. They manage to break free of their captors, escape the ship and fly away. But somewhere else, the Champions also inspired another well-known, but troublesome hero: [[Gwenpool]]. They later appear in a small town that is experiencing a wave of hate crimes. Gwenpool arrives to help them and they figure out that the town sheriff is responsible for the spread of the hate crimes. They later encounter the Freelancers, a group of super powered delinquents who were hired to tarnish the name of Champions. After being defeated, the Freelancers decide to do good but later revealed to have bought the rights to the Champions name. While dealing with the fallout, the team learns that the Freelancers have been using the Champions name for financial purposes, until Nova posts a video online that convince the people to burn the Freelancers' merchandise.<ref>''Champions'' Vol. 2 #1-8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Amadeus Cho's Hulk form was with the Champions when they joined up with the Underground following Hydra's takeover of the United States. The Champions later followed [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] when she makes her own plans for Captain America. During their training, the Champions argue over Black Widow's brutality and mercilessness on Hydra. During a mission, they infiltrate a Hydra base to find someone crucial to Black Widow's plan. Black Widow then assembles the team when she discovers that the Underground resistance was attacked and possibly killed. In [[Washington DC]], during their assault, Spider-Man goes to fight Captain America until Black Widow intervenes and gets killed. Spider-Man then tries kill Steve out of revenge until the others convince him to not do it and they get arrested.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1-7</ref> They're later released by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and Black Ant, who defected from Hydra, and join the Underground resistance during their attack at the Capitol, until Steve Rogers arrives wearing a Cosmic Cube-powered armor. They later witness the final battle of the Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers against the real Captain America and the restoration of the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9-10</ref> While looking for Ms. Marvel following the defeat of Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers, Spider-Man, Hulk and Viv find a walled off compound, disguised as a normal small town, that houses Inhuman prisoners. Amadeus reveals that he helped build the facility years ago, which was meant as a prison for the original Hulk. The heroes manage to defeat the robot guards and prevent Hydra from finding them. After Hydra's attack on [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], the Champions unsuccessfully search for survivors only for [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] to arrive with a baby, the sole survivor of the attack. Sometime later, the Champions encounter [[Psycho-Man]], who was searching for an upgrade to his emotion controlling equipment. During the first encounter, Cyclops gets affected by the device. The team then manages to defeat Psycho-Man and cure Cyclops.<ref>''Champions'' Vol. 2 #10-12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Amadeus is a teenager gifted with a super-genius mind, bearing the "natural ability to identify the variables and quantum possibilities in any situation". He is described by [[Reed Richards]] as being the seventh most intelligent person in the world,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk #106'' (July 2007)</ref> though [[Hank Pym]] claims that, with his return to Earth from Skrull captivity, Amadeus is actually the eighth.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref> Meanwhile, [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] claims he is actually the tenth,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol.2 #607</ref> but later says to the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] that Cho is one of the eighth smartest.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol.2 #610</ref> The Eternal [[Ajak]] believes that Cho is actually more intelligent than some immortals,<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #118</ref> and he has claimed to [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]], who says that intelligence is essentially "pattern recognition", that he sees patterns better than 99.999999993% of people on Earth.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #116</ref> Hercules has claimed twice, the first instance to Athena herself, that Amadeus is smarter than even she,<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #124</ref><ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref> and the super-genius Olympian god of fire and invention [[Hephaestus (comics)|Hephaestus]] himself admits that Cho is more intelligent than he is.<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #140</ref>

Amadeus is able to rapidly and without mechanical aid perform mental calculations of almost unimaginable complexity enabling him to, with minimal stimuli on his part, set multiple physical reactions into motion in his vicinity, forestalling technological and human activity with equal ease. This intelligence is portrayed in the comics as various numbers and other details labeled on everything he sees as relevant, shown from his [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. He has shown himself capable of doing anything from redirecting a laser-guided missile with a [[wing mirror]] or tracking the Hulk based on his [[trajectory]] and jump height. However, performing mental calculations in rapid succession costs him immense amounts of energy, requiring him to consume large amounts of food thereafter. He previously rode a Vespa scooter and carried a phone/radio, Walkman, or other device altered to control nearby electrical signals.

In ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #610, Amadeus, along with hundreds of others, is zapped with the Cathexis Ray, which further enhances his intelligence. It also allows him to alter the laws of physics within a ten-foot radius of himself. He uses this power to shut down [[Leader (comics)|the Leader's]] equipment and revert [[MODOK]] to his original human form. He loses this power when [[Bruce Banner]] uses a recalibrated Cathexis Ray to remove the powers of the newly created Hulks.

When the helmet of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]], also known as the second Ant-Man, fell into Amadeus' possession, he, with [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]]'s blessing, chose to use it as a telepathic enhancer, downplaying the size changing aspect of the Ant-Man power to focus on the mind-controlling abilities on the insect mind instead.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Also, he has inherited Hercules' adamantine mace. He also uses [[Bruce Banner|Bannertech]] to augment himself with devices including scanners and forcefields.<ref>''Heroic Age - Prince of Power'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the "death" of Hercules, Amadeus is made the new Prince of Power and head of the Olympus Group by Athena. This status somehow protected him from certain effects of the Chaos King. He also has access to all of the Olympus Group's wealth and resources.{{issue|date=January 2017}}

Amadeus was once usually accompanied by a coyote pup who peered out the front of Cho's jacket. He picked him up along the side of the road, near a roadside diner where he met the Hulk for the first time. The coyote's mother had been hit and killed by a car, but the pup had remained with her body. Cho, not failing to see the similarity, took him in. Cho has since trained him to distract opponents and perform simple search operations.

Kerberos' name was chosen in a contest held by the writers of the comic; the winner was a reader from Montevideo, Uruguay, Martín "MaGnUs" Pérez. The name was chosen by the reader both because of the [[Cerberus|mythological connotations]] and [[Kerberos (protocol)|the computer network authentication protocol of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=8977 |title=Incredible Hercules (2008) #118 &#124; Secret Invasion &#124; Comics |website=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TEoH2Eg8LgA/SFsSOPBKZeI/AAAAAAAAAvo/bitYYbeac7g/s1600-h/kerberos.jpg|format=JPG|title= Scan of the panel where the name is revealed|website=4.bp.blogspot.com|accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref>

During the Secret Invasion, it was revealed that Kirby was abducted immediately following ''World War Hulk'' by Skrulls posing as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents after they knocked out Amadeus with gas; Kirby was then replaced with a Skrull agent. The infiltrator was able to destroy the ship by driving it off course after disguising himself as Cho. He is slain by Cho's ally, Aton, who sees him transform back to Kirby and bites his head off. Using a tracking system he had implanted in the pup beforehand, Amadeus manages to track Kirby down, finding him in the Mojave desert. Once there, he discovers that the now full-grown Kirby has adapted to the wild, even gaining a mate. Amadeus decides to leave Kirby where he is, reasoning that his life had become too dangerous for him.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #126 (2008)</ref>

This version is a 13-year-old genius who was accredited by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] to be at least the seventh smartest being on Earth. [[Peter Parker]] is jealous of Cho due to the fact that his enrollment at Midtown High took away Peter's title of being the smartest student. He is also a fan of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Cho ends up becoming the new [[Iron Spider]] after he proves himself perfect to operate the armor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/18445-disneyxd-s-ultimate-spider-man-renewed-for-3rd-season-hulk-s-m-a-s-h-clip.html |title=DisneyXD's ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN Renewed For 3rd Season, HULK-S.M.A.S.H.

He is attacked by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] attempting to steal the Iron Spider armor, but [[Spider-Man]] assists him and saves innocents. This changes Amadeus' view of Spider-Man and realizes the truth of Spider-Man. Taskmaster uses a nanobot to hack the armor which causes Cho to fight Spider-Man uncontrollably. Amadeus manages to fix the problem but Taskmaster gets away and the nanobot nearly causes the Iron Spider armor to explode. However, Spider-Man removes the nanobot and Cho resolves the virus. Spider-Man lets him keep the Iron Spider armor and recruits him as a member of the [[New Warriors]] along with [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]]. He ends up accidentally causing the reawakening of [[Arnim Zola]], but Spider-Man takes the blame not wanting Amadeus to get kicked out of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] In the Season 3 finale four-parter "Contest of Champions", Amadeus, along with Flash Thompson, discover that Peter Parker is, in fact, Spider-Man. In season four, the Web Warriors gain [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Kid Arachnid]] as members and take on the newly formed Sinister Six. In "Beached" Cho and Spider-Man's morals clash when the former accuses the latter of being too lenient with certain villains; Spider-Man, in turn, feels Cho has a black-and-white view of the world and this causes him to be judgmental. When Sandman is revealed to be a pawn in Dr. Octopus's attempt to use his powers, Cho relents that he should be more open-minded, and Spider-Man agrees to not be so quick to give the benefit of the doubt. In "The Spider-Slayers - Part 2", Amadeus, Flash and Miles was to see [[Mary Jane Watson]] to become [[Spider-Woman]] as new member of Web Warriors.
