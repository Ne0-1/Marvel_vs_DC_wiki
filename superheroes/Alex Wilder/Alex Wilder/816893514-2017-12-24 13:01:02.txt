==Fictional character biography==
The son of Geoffrey and Catherine Wilder, Alex is the first character to be introduced to the series; Alex is the one to initially suggest spying on their parents' supposed charity organization. After witnessing their parents' (who were revealed to be a secret crime ring called "the Pride") murder of an innocent teenage girl, Alex organizes the mass escape from their parents.<ref name="Vol1#1"/><ref name="Vol1#2">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #2</ref> Alex then obtains [[The Yorkes|the Yorkes']] copy of The Abstract, a magical book that records the past, present, and future deeds of the Pride.<ref name="Vol1#3">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #3</ref> After a few fights with their parents, Alex and the Runaways escape to [[Chase Stein|Chase's]] dilapidated [[mansion]] hideout called "the Hostel".<ref name="Vol1#6">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #6</ref> The group vows to work together and take down their parents' organization.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> The majority of the group (with the exception of Alex) decide to take superhero codenames for themselves as they begin their new lives as full-time vigilantes.<ref name="Vol1#6"/>

Alex distances himself emotionally from many of the Runaways, even refusing to take a codename or bond with the rest of the team.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> Alex spends most of his time deciphering the Abstract, presumably plotting how he will carry out his plan to save his parents from the Dean and Hayes couples.<ref name="Vol1#7">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #7</ref> Since he expected that all the other Runaways would die in a few months time, he limited his emotional connection.<ref name="Vol1#17"/>

Alex eventually deciphers the Abstract and reveals that the Pride works for the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]], three monstrous [[giant (mythology)|giants]] who require the sacrifice of twenty-five innocent souls over twenty-five years to gain enough power to destroy Earth and restore it to the paradise it once was.<ref name="Vol1#13">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #13</ref> Alex determines the location for the yearly sacrificial [[rite]] and convinces the Runaways that the rite would be the best place to launch an assault.<ref name="Vol1#15">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #15</ref> Chase is critically injured, and decides to stay back, and gives Alex his [[x-ray]] goggles and Fistigons for the final fight.<ref name="Vol1#16">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #16</ref> When Gert is injured during the fight, she gives control of [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] to Alex so the dinosaur can remain in the fight, and when Nico is frozen solid, Alex begins to use the Staff of One as well.<ref name="Vol1#16"/> When the fight is finally finished, only Alex and Karolina remain standing, at which point Alex knocks out Karolina and outs himself as a [[mole (espionage)|mole]] for his parents.<ref name="Vol1#16"/>

He reveals that he'd known about the Pride for over a year and had learned about the Pride's secret previously.<ref name="Vol1#17">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #17</ref> Alex then reveals that the Deans and Hayeses had plotted to kill all the human members of the Pride, and take the six seats in paradise for themselves and their daughters.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Alex's master plan was to use his friends to take down the entire Pride as a group but save his own parents, thus securing three seats in the paradise the Gibborim had prophetically promised to the Pride previously for himself and his own parents selfishly, and to give the remaining three seats to Nico and her parents, but Nico refuses and Alex quickly loses control over the situation.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Gert wakes up, prompting her to reclaim Old Lace, who steals back Nico's Staff and destroys the Fistigons, leaving Alex with nothing.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> When Molly awakens, she destroys the Gibborim's newest sacrifice; when the Gibborim arrive, Alex takes full responsibility in place of his father for the soul being gone.  While the Gibborim openly respect Alex's honesty, they promptly incinerate him.<ref name="Vol1#17"/>

Alex was the intended subject of two resurrection spells in the series' second volume. Nico reveals the reason why she couldn't resurrect [[Gertrude Yorkes]]' future self was because she had already attempted the spell. She says it didn't work because "even the Staff of One has its limits".<ref name="Vol2#2"/> Later on, Alex's online role-playing friends also attempted a resurrection when they learned about the Pride.<ref name="Vol2#14">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #14</ref> The spell they used killed one of their members, but replaced him with a 1985 version of [[Geoffrey Wilder]], Alex's soon-to-be father.<ref name="Vol2#14"/>

In volume two, issue twenty-two, Molly began to hear a disembodied voice in her head telling her to go find Chase.<ref name="Vol2#22">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #22</ref> She hears it again in volume two, issue twenty-four when it tells her how to repair [[Victor Mancha]].<ref name="Vol2#24">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #24</ref> Molly believed that it was Gert's voice, but at the end of the issue, it was revealed it was actually Alex speaking from a white void dimension he shares with the recently killed Gibborim.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> Alex informs the giants that he helped Molly in order to atone for his past deeds and he intends to earn his way out of the dimension.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> The Gibborim ask why they and Alex are in the dimension, and Alex whilst explaining how they and himself are very alike for thinking only of their parents previously through their actions (quoting the [[Pat Benatar]] song) states "Hell Is for Children".<ref name="Vol2#24"/>

In the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'', Alex was resurrected by [[Daimon Hellstrom]] to guide Nico during her transition into the [[Masters of Evil]], to become her teacher in battle strategy, and to help her cope with her increased [[Dark magic|dark magical powers]].<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #5</ref> After helping the young heroes escape and reunite with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Alex leaves telling Nico that while he enjoyed seeing her again, he had to sign a contract to escape Hell and leaves to assist the Masters of Evil. He is seen with the Young Masters attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #9</ref> At the close of the series, Alex Wilder is seen as part of the [[Young Masters]].<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #10</ref>

Alex Wilder later approached [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Mr. Fish]] telling them about his father's business as the two of them knew Geoffrey Wilder back when he was still alive. He also tells Tombstone and Mr. Fish that he is starting a new incarnation of the Pride where he will start in Harlem. Afterwards, Alex Wilder beats up Tombstone and uses a magic spell to send Mr. Fish to Hell. It was shown that Alex Wilder has gotten [[Black Mariah (comics)|Black Mariah]], [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Cottonmouth)|Cottonmouth]], [[Dontrell Hamilton|Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton]], and Gamecock on his side.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' Vol. 3 #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Alex Wilder has genius-level intellect where he sports an advanced skill with [[logic]] and [[strategy]].

==Relationships==
Alex distances himself emotionally from many of the Runaways, even refusing to take a codename or bond with the rest of the team.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> Alex did not think very highly of Nico in the years before the series' beginning, but changes upon seeing Nico for the first time in her new [[goth subculture|goth]] [[gothic fashion|wardrobe]] and [[contact lenses]], volume one, issue one. In the first volume, Nico and Alex share a brief relationship. She kisses him for the first time during the Runaways' attempted rescue of [[Molly Hayes]];<ref name="Vol1#5">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #5</ref> it's later revealed Alex was Nico's first kiss.<ref name="Vol2#22"/> She kisses and expresses love for Alex after he saves her from the vampire [[Topher (comics)|Topher]]; it is generally accepted that Nico and Alex are a couple at this point.<ref name="Vol1#10">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #10</ref> Despite her professed love for Alex, Nico chooses to side with the Runaways after Alex reveals his plan to bring her to the Gibborim's new world with her parents, firmly establishing her dedication to the team. However, despite the betrayal, Nico demonstrates willingness to forgive when she unsuccessfully tries to resurrect Alex, and states that even though Alex was a traitor, he did not deserve death.<ref name="Vol2#2"/> It is also revealed that she still loves him and always will.<ref>''MYSTIC ARCANA: SISTER GRIMM'' #4</ref>

Alex's relationship with his father is not strained, but also not the closest of relationships. Alex's obsession with superheroes never boded well with Geoffrey.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> It is revealed in volume one, issue seventeen, that Alex is devoted to his family above all, outing himself as the Pride's mole, a role he undertook solely to show that he is willing to go to great lengths to keep his parents safe.<ref name="Vol1#16"/> Alex explains in volume two, issue twenty-four, that he committed all of his evil actions to gain his father's approval and love, two things Geoffrey never explicitly demonstrated to Alex during the series.<ref name="Vol2#24"/>

==In other media==
Alex Wilder appears in the [[Hulu]] television series, ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' portrayed by [[Rhenzy Feliz]].<ref name="CastAnnounce">{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/59021/marvels-runaways-finds-cast/ |title='Marvel's Runaways' Finds Its Cast |last=Strom |first=Marc |publisher=Marvel.com |date=February 2, 2017 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6nz9EbsJq?url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/59021/marvels-runaways-finds-cast/ |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |deadurl=no }}</ref> This version of Alex actually misses his friends and attempts to get back together with them, specifically Nico due to his feelings for her, and begins suffering from isolation. As opposed to his comic book counterpart, he is much more optimistic, at least when it comes to hanging out with his friends, and his desires are more noble rather then selfish. He is also the one that invites them over to his house while the parents are away with his effort simply wanting to rebuild their broken relationship after the death of Nico's sister Amy, whose funeral Alex did not attend.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Reunion (Runaways)|Reunion]]|series=Marvel's Runaways|credits=Morgen, Brett (director); Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (writer)|network=[[Hulu]]|airdate=November 21, 2017|season=1|number=1}}</ref>
