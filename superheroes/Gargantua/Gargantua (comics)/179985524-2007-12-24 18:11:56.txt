'''Gargantua''' ('''Edward Cobert''') is a [[fictional]] character and exists in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He first appeared in Defenders  #126. 

==Fictional character biography==
Edward Cobert started out as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent working on an experiment called Project: Lazarus that went horribly wrong when he tested it on himself. This caused Edward to be stuck in giant-size and he went on a rampage dubbed as Leviathan until he was subdued by S.H.I.E.L.D. He was later freed by the [[Secret Empire]] who arranged for his release only to be defeated by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

The Secret Empire freed him again when the Defenders infiltrated the Secret Empire's HQ and he helped capture the Defenders. Even so, the Defenders escaped and overthrew the Secret Empire again. Leviathan later became the guardian of another incarnation of the Secret Empire only to be defeated by [[U.S. Agent]] (posing as [[Captain America]]) and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]] (posing as [[Bucky]]).

Edward Cobert later became a pawn of the [[Mad Thinker]] who gave him a costume guise of Gargantua. He used Gargantua hoping that he would by publicly defeated by [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Wonder Man]] (who were engaged at the time in high-profile protests against the government's first proposed legislation regarding superhero registration/regulation). As planned, they defeated Gargantua and Mad Thinker helped sway the public opinion against the legislation.

Gargantua later became a part-time member of [[Doctor Octopus]]' [[Masters of Evil]] where they plotted to storm the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Mansion while they were away. This was made easier when many of the superheroes were replaced with evil [[Doppelg√§nger|doppelgangers]] of them during the ''[[Infinity War]]''. The Masters of Evil were thwarted by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] who were visiting the Avengers Mansion at the time. Both teams had to work together to stop the doppelgangers. Gargantua was among the members who revolted against Doctor Octopus when he wanted to continue the fight against the Guardians. After Doctor Octopus fled, his Masters of Evil disbanded.

When it came to a small town that was renamed ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'', Gargantua joined [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] into attacking it to lure out the Hulk. They retreated when they realized that the Hulk wasn't there.

In the JLA/Avengers crossover, Gargantua was among the villains pulled from time and space by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] to guard his stronghold from the Avengers and the [[Justice League]].

==Powers and abilities==
Gargantua possesses the ability to draw upon mass from another dimension in order to grow in stature and strength. Since his first appearance, he remains stuck at a minimum height of approximately 20-25 feet.
