'''Molten Man''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and first appeared  in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #28 (September 1965).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Mark Raxton''' was born in [[New York City]].  He was a scientist who could not wait to use his skills to become rich, and once worked at Oscorp Industries, Inc., as the laboratory assistant to Dr. [[Spencer Smythe]], creator of the [[Spider-Slayer]]s. Raxton and Smythe developed an experimental new liquid metallic alloy for the Spider-Slayers from a radioactive meteor, but Raxton attempted to steal it and sell it for his own profit. In the ensuing fight with Smythe in the laboratory, Raxton spilled the liquid alloy all over himself, his skin absorbing it and turning golden. Fearing for his life, Raxton ran for the nearest hospital, only to discover that the alloy had changed him for the better when he angrily punched an irate motorist's hood, buckling it. Realizing the great potential his new abilities afforded him, Raxton, now calling himself the Molten Man turned to crime to further his gains. Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, was forced to nearly miss his high school graduation to stop the Molten Man's first crime spree.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28</ref> He was released from jail before long, only to continue his criminal activities. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #35</ref>

Eventually, his body begins to give off intense heat and to consume itself. His metal skin became molten, and he stole meteor fragments from a museum to attempt a cure. An encounter with Spider-Man resulted in his submergence in the polluted East River, which temporarily reversed the deterioration.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #132-133</ref>

After a few more encounters with Spider-Man, it was revealed that Peter's friend [[Liz Allan]] was Raxton's stepsister. Raxton broke into a pharmaceutical company to steal chemicals which would reverse his condition permanently. When the procedure failed, he went berserk and kidnapped Liz. Liz was saved by Spider-Man, but the Molten Man was buried beneath the laboratory.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #172-173</ref> He later resurfaced at the same site and once again sought his sister out. Spider-Man prevented the Molten Man from hurting her, knocking him into a swimming pool, thus extinguishing his flames and cooling his molten properties. He was then taken to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #63</ref> Raxton realized that his stepsister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. He was eventually released from the Vault and approached Liz once again, this time to apologize. Spider-Man misunderstood his intentions and battled him once more. Reconciled with Raxton, Liz and her husband [[Harry Osborn]] gave Raxton a job as head of security at Osborn Industries.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #62</ref> Molten Man later teamed up with Spider-Man and the second Green Goblin against [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66</ref> Molten Man was then kidnapped along with Liz, Normie Osborn, and Spider-Man by Harry Osborn, who had suffered a mental lapse, making him the evil Green Goblin once again. Molten Man was saved by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #189</ref> Molten Man and Spider-Man have since become friends, and Molten Man has occasionally used his powers to come to Spider-Man's aid against other supervillains. A few times he has been a bodyguard for Peter Parker's friends and family when disasters overwhelm the city. 

However, in the months following the [[Clone Saga]], Raxton was abducted by Norman Osborn, the [[Green Goblin]], and brainwashed. Under mind control, Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchwoman Alison Mongraine, the only person who knew of the location of Peter and Mary Jane's baby. While Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident.

Sometime after Harry Osborn's death, Raxton is called in when mysterious forces kidnap Liz Allan's son, [[Normie Osborn|Normie]]. He uses his brawn and brains to help Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle reporter [[Ben Urich]] uncover what happened. 

Raxton is later pressed into a super-villain group again when the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] approaches him and threatens to kill Normie if Raxton does not join his 'Exterminators'.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/exterminatorschamln.htm Marvel Universe Appendix]</ref> Raxton is then forced to attack Liz Allan.

During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Molten Man and [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] were used as bait for Captain America's Secret Avengers only for the [[Punisher]] to arrive. Raxton is left in critical condition after being attacked by Punisher.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Raxton next appears, still in bad condition, under the care of Liz Allen. When Harry Osborn comes to visit Liz and Normie, he and Liz get into an argument. Hearing Liz speak Harry's name, Raxton suddenly awakens and attacks him, screaming that Harry has hurt his family for the last time, and will "die for real".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #581</ref> Spider-Man intervenes, but has trouble fighting Raxton, whose powers have grown greatly out of control. Spider-Man manages to trap Raxton in asphalt, and Harry provides him with a cure that Oscorp had been working on upon using volunteer [[Charlie Weiderman]], the other "Molten Man". The cure works perfectly, returning Raxton to his original human state.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #582</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Molten Man was given superhuman powers after exposure to an organic liquid metal alloy obtained from a meteor discovered by [[Spencer Smythe]]. His skin completely absorbed the experimental alloy, turning all of the external tissues of his body into a solid metallic substance, as well as the trunks, belt, and boots he was wearing at the time of the accident. As a result, Molten Man possesses superhuman strength and his skin is composed of a frictionless metal that grants him a high degree of resistance to physical injury. Raxton's metallic fingers are sensitive enough to pick locks (making him an expert safe cracker), and his skin is so slick he cannot be restrained with Spider-Man's webbing. Molten Man's skin can also generate intense heat, burning anybody who tries to touch him and shooting flaming projectiles at his foes. At one time, his skin was like molten lava, allowing him to project radiation and heat up to {{convert|300|°F|°C}}. In his molten form, the Molten Man's skin may reach a critical stage at which point his skin could actually melt off him.

Additionally, unlike most of Spider-Man's more thuggish villains, Molten Man had brains to complement his raw physical strength. An intelligent and completely sane scientist, Molten Man was smart enough to learn from his mistakes and not fall for the same trick twice. He is a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Molten Man===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Mark Raxton is a guitarist in a local [[punk rock]] band, the name of which is later revealed to be "Molten Man" (''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]] #78''). In #78 one of their songs has the lyrics "I am your molten man, and I'm melting on you".

He first appears in the story 'Dumped', in #78, where he asks [[Mary Jane Watson]] on a date, and she reluctantly accepts, but she spends most of the evening talking about Peter Parker, who had just broken up with her.  Raxton remains a gentleman the entire time.  Later, he encounters Mary Jane at the mall, and upon learning that the boy she was with was Peter, tells her "Good for you," and leaves without further incident.

He later appears in #88, part four of the 'Silver Sable' storyline, where a class member of Peter's high school dresses up as Spider-Man and runs out in front of the press. He is revealed to be Mark Raxton, who shouts advertisements for his band 'Molten Man' before being dragged away by police.

* Molten Man appears in the second season of [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''The Spectacular Spider-Man'']]<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/14/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Monday, January 14, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> voiced by Eric Lopez. In this version, he is renamed '''Mark Allan''' and is [[Liz Allan]]'s biological brother (rather than stepbrother). Mark Allan also incorporates elements of [[Betty Brant]]'s brother, Bennett Brant from the original comics, with his gambling connections to [[List of Spectacular Spider-Man supporting characters#Blackie Gaxton|Blackie Gaxton]]. Mark is introduced in "First Steps", the fifth episode of Season 2, as a troubled youth recently returning to Midtown High after spending six months in juvenile hall. He is regretful about his criminal past, having stolen a car to repay debts accumulated through gambling losses. Similar to his Ultimate universe counterpart, he has a romantic connection to Mary-Jane Watson who (along with his sister, Liz) try to convince Mark not to gamble his life away. In "Subtext", the eleventh episode of Season 2, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] combine to transform the unwitting Mark into the Molten Man, by injecting [[Nanorobotics|nanobots]] into his bloodstream, under the pretence that undergoing the procedure will clear the debt accrued by his recent backslide into gambling. Mark is then blackmailed by Osborn, in the guise of the [[Green Goblin]], to eliminate Spider-Man in exchange for the device which controls his transformation process. During the ensuing confrontation with Spider-Man, he is suspended between two lamp posts by webbing and deluged by a fire hydrant in an effort to quell his flames, but it fails to work. Green Goblin (watching the incident from a safe distance) exclaims to himself, "''Oh well, that's what I get for betting on an amateur!''" and deactivates the nanobots by remote before Mark is taken to jail. In "Opening Night", Molten Man is shown as an inmate at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. The Green Goblin releases him and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] from solitary as Green Goblin reactivates Molten Man's powers since Molten Man is still in debt to the Green Goblin. Molten Man does his part by flooding the ventilation system with lava. He gets knocked out by the knock-out gas unleashed by Walter Hardy.

In the Anti-Registration campaign, he and She-Hulk are shown attacking Cloak and Dagger until the heroes arrive. When the nanites take a mind of their own, Molten Man is among the supervillains that attacks both sides. He will attack the heroes after they replaced the power cores needed to power up the portal that leads out of Prison 42.
