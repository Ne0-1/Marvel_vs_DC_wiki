==Fictional character biography==
Mark Raxton was born in [[New York City]].  He was a scientist who could not wait to use his skills to become rich, and once worked at [[Oscorp]] Industries, as the laboratory assistant to Dr. [[Spencer Smythe]], creator of the [[Spider-Slayer]]s. Raxton and Smythe developed an experimental new liquid metallic alloy for the Spider-Slayers from a radioactive meteor, but Raxton attempted to steal it and sell it for his own profit. In the ensuing fight with Smythe in the laboratory, Raxton spilled the liquid alloy all over himself, his skin absorbing it and turning golden. Fearing for his life, Raxton ran for the nearest hospital, only to discover that the alloy had changed him for the better when he angrily punched an irate motorist's hood, buckling it. Realizing the great potential his new abilities afforded him, Raxton, now calling himself the Molten Man turned to crime to further his monetary gains. Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, was forced to nearly miss his high school graduation to stop the Molten Man's first crime spree.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #28</ref> He was released from jail before long, only to continue his criminal activities. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #35</ref>

Eventually, his body begins to give off intense heat and to consume itself. His metal skin became molten, and he stole meteor fragments from a museum to attempt a cure. An encounter with Spider-Man resulted in his submergence in the polluted East River, which temporarily reversed the deterioration.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #132-133</ref>

After a few more encounters with Spider-Man, it was revealed that Peter's friend [[Liz Allan]] was Raxton's stepsister. Raxton broke into a pharmaceutical company to steal chemicals which would reverse his condition permanently. When the procedure failed, he went berserk and kidnapped Liz. Liz was saved by Spider-Man, but Molten Man was buried beneath the laboratory.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #172-173</ref> He later resurfaced at the same site and once again sought his sister out. Spider-Man prevented the Molten Man from hurting her, knocking him into a swimming pool, thus extinguishing his flames and cooling his molten properties. He was then taken to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. (a prison for superhuman criminals)<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #63</ref> Raxton realized that his stepsister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. He was eventually released from the Vault and approached Liz once again, this time to apologize. Spider-Man misunderstood his intentions and battled him once more. Reconciled with Raxton, Liz and her husband [[Harry Osborn]] gave Raxton a job as head of security at Osborn Industries.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #62</ref> Molten Man later teamed up with Spider-Man and the second Green Goblin against [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66</ref> Molten Man was then kidnapped along with Liz, Normie Osborn, and Spider-Man by Harry Osborn, who had suffered a mental lapse, making him the evil Green Goblin once again. Molten Man was saved by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #189</ref> Molten Man and Spider-Man have since become friends, and Molten Man has occasionally used his powers to come to Spider-Man's aid against other supervillains. A few times he has been a bodyguard for Peter Parker's friends and family when disasters overwhelm the city.

However, in [[The Gathering of Five and The Final Chapter|the months following]] the [[Clone Saga]], Raxton was abducted by Norman Osborn, the [[Green Goblin]], and brainwashed. Under mind control, Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchman [[Alison Mongraine]], the only person who knew of the location of Peter and Mary Jane's baby.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #440-441</ref>  While Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident.

Sometime after Harry Osborn's death, Raxton is called in when mysterious forces kidnap Liz Allan's son, [[Normie Osborn|Normie]]. He uses his brawn and brains to help Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle reporter [[Ben Urich]] uncover what happened.

Raxton is later pressed into a super-villain group again when the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] approaches him and threatens to kill Normie if Raxton does not join his 'Exterminators'.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/exterminatorschamln.htm Marvel Universe Appendix]</ref> Raxton is then forced to attack Liz Allan.

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Molten Man and [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] were used as bait for Captain America's Secret Avengers only for the [[Punisher]] to arrive. Raxton is left in critical condition after being attacked by Punisher.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/760/punishers_hit_list|title=Punisher's Hit List|publisher=''[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]''|date=January 24, 2007|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>

Raxton next appears, still in bad condition, under the care of Liz Allan. When Harry Osborn comes to visit Liz and Normie, he and Liz get into an argument. Hearing Liz speak Harry's name, Raxton suddenly awakens and attacks him, screaming that Harry has hurt his family for the last time, and will "die for real".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #581</ref> Spider-Man intervenes, but has trouble fighting Raxton, whose powers have grown greatly out of control. Spider-Man manages to trap Raxton in asphalt, and Harry provides him with a cure that Oscorp had been working on upon using volunteer [[Charlie Weiderman]], the other "Molten Man". The cure works perfectly, returning Raxton to his original human state. Although he finally was rid of the alloy, he still retained his powers such as his super strength and energy manipulation and a new power to incinerate anything by producing fire from his palms. Harry built him a special suit using a part of the alloy and his DNA, to help him control his powers.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #582</ref>

When Liz Allan became the head of [[Alchemax]], she used the company's cutting-edge technology to cure Mark Raxton from his condition. Even though he was constantly monitored, Mark was no longer a threat to society and started working as a member of Alchemax's security force. As Alchemax and [[Parker Industries]] competed for a contract to build a new prison, Mark and Tiberius Stone used Mark's connections to hire [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] to sabotage Parker Industries.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3, #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Molten Man was given superhuman powers after exposure to an organic liquid metal alloy obtained from a meteor discovered by [[Spencer Smythe]]. His skin completely absorbed the experimental alloy, turning all of the external tissues of his body into a solid metallic substance, as well as the trunks, belt, and boots he was wearing at the time of the accident. As a result, Molten Man possesses superhuman strength and his skin is composed of a frictionless metal that grants him a high degree of resistance to physical injury. Raxton's metallic fingers are sensitive enough to pick locks (making him an expert safe cracker), and his skin is so slick he cannot be restrained with Spider-Man's webbing. Molten Man's skin can also generate intense heat, burning anybody who tries to touch him and shooting flaming projectiles at his foes. At one time, his skin was like molten lava, allowing him to project radiation and heat up to {{convert|300|°F|°C}}. In his molten form, the Molten Man's skin may reach a critical stage at which point his skin could actually melt off him.

Additionally, unlike most of Spider-Man's more thuggish villains, Molten Man had brains to complement his raw physical strength. An intelligent and completely sane scientist, Molten Man was smart enough to learn from his mistakes and not fall for the same trick twice. He is a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering.

* Molten Man appears in the second season of ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/14/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Monday, January 14, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> voiced by Eric Lopez. In this version, he is renamed '''Mark Allan''' and is [[Liz Allan]]'s biological brother, and like her is re-imagined as Hispanic. Mark Allan also has gambling connections to [[List of Spectacular Spider-Man supporting characters#Blackie Gaxton|Blackie Gaxton]]. Mark is introduced in "First Steps", the fifth episode of Season 2, as having recently returned after spending six months in juvenile hall. He is regretful about his criminal past, having stolen a car to repay gambling debts. He at one point went on a date with [[Mary Jane Watson]]. In the episode "Subtext", the eleventh episode of Season 2, Gaxton tells Mark he can repay his debts by letting [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] inject [[Nanorobotics|nanobots]] into his bloodstream, which turns him into the Molten Man. Their boss, the [[Green Goblin]], then blackmails Mark into killing Spider-Man in exchange for the device that controls his transformation. Liz and Mary Jane both try to dissuade Mark, but he insists on fighting Spider-Man and is defeated, and is depowered by the Goblin for his failure. In the episode "Opening Night", Molten Man is shown as an inmate at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], where he and the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] are kept in a special section (supposedly for superpowered inmates). Like the others, he is released when the Green Goblin takes control of the prison with Spider-Man inside. Despite his reluctance the Goblin re-activates Mark's powers and orders him to help the other inmates kill Spider-Man. He is defeated along with them when [[Walter Hardy]] releases knock-out gas. In both battles Mark proves dangerous but easily fooled, with Spider-Man goading him into making costly mistakes, such as destroying a [[Mysterio]] robot simply because Spider-Man dared him to try to hit him.
* Molten Man appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Inhumanity",<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDkoseUbGfk</ref> voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. He was shown causing havoc on the waterfront where he was robbing some gold until he fights Spider-Man and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. Molten Man's heat gives Triton a disadvantage until Spider-Man helps him. Spider-Man then pursues Molten Man into the streets and into a construction site where he uses cement to help defeat Molten Man. In the episode "Contest of Champions" Pt. 1, [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] pairs up Molten Man with [[Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] King in a game of "Last Man Standing" against [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]'s team of Spider-Man, Hulk, and Iron Man. During the battle, Molten Man ambushed Iron Man enough to fuse the circuitry in the Iron Man armor removing Iron Man from the game. Spider-Man managed to defeat Molten Man by tricking him into standing on a dock enough to fall through and into the lake enough for him to be removed from the game.

===Video games===
* Molten Man appears in the PS3 and Xbox 360 version of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/all.9439.MUA2_NPC_Spotlight~colon~_Wizard%2C_Shocker~and~Molten_Man Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 NPC Spotlight: Wizard, Shocker and Molten Man]</ref> He is among the supervillains under the control of the Control Nanites used by S.H.I.E.L.D. In the Pro-Registration campaign, he is used to assist the heroes in fighting [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]]. In the Anti-Registration campaign, he and She-Hulk are shown attacking Cloak and Dagger until the heroes arrive. When the nanites take a mind of their own, Molten Man is among the supervillains that attacks both sides. He will attack the heroes after they replaced the power cores needed to power up the portal that leads out of Prison 42.
