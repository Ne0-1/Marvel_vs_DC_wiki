'''Alistair Smythe''' ({{IPAc-en|s|m|aɪ|ð}}) is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was one of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemies and the son of [[Spencer Smythe]]. At one point, Alistair used a wheelchair, but he later gained the ability to walk after transforming himself into what he called the '''Ultimate Spider-Slayer'''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
Alistair Smythe first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Annual 19 (November 1985), created by [[Louise Simonson]] and Mary Wilshire. Alistair Smythe died in ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' #13 (September 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
The [[Spider-Slayer]]s were a series of robots that sought to destroy Spider-Man. The initial generation of spider-slayers were created by Alistair's father, [[Spencer Smythe]], and commissioned by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. After Spencer failed to kill Spider-Man—and ended up dying as a result of prolonged exposure to the radioactive samples involved- Alistair inherited the legacy from his father and gained a new-found hatred toward Spider-Man. His initial attempt, however, failed when, in a rather humorous misunderstanding, he mistook [[Mary Jane Watson]] for Spider-Man (playing along with it to give Peter time to come up with a plan, Mary Jane claimed she used a super-powered suit designed by aliens) until he was defeated by the real wall-crawler. He initially worked for the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] but left in disagreement over how to deal with Spider-Man and went solo.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual 19</ref>

After being confined in an asylum, Alistair released himself and took several other inmates with him in order to construct a new series of spider-slayers that tracked Spider-Man across the city. With a plan of revenge, he forced the inmates to assist him in the machines' construction. After sending a series of slayers after Spider-Man (and all of their inevitable destruction with assistance from others including [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]), Alistair lured Spider-Man to his residence for one final battle. In order to defeat Spider-Man on his own, Alistair enhanced himself by encasing his entire body in a biorganic carapace that not only served as a full body armour, but increased his strength and gave him the ability to walk again by interconnecting with his spine. The physical structure of the carapace gave Alistair bird-like talons for feet; a long, curved blade-like weapon jutting from each shoulder; a pair of smaller, jagged blade weapons on each forearm; and a specially made web-shooter that fires from the forearm area. Eventually, Spider-Man defeated Alistair and made sure he'd been taken to custody as well as the other asylum inmates who survived the ordeal.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #368-373</ref>

During [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]]'s brief stint as sole web-slinger in town, Smythe (still carapaced as the Ultimate Spider-Slayer) started a war utilizing a new set of slayers he intended to sell on the black market. These Cyber-Slayers, which could be controlled remotely by turning one's thoughts into the slayers' actions, were initially targeted at [[Lady Octopus]] and her crew.<ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #2</ref> The Scarlet Spider ended up in the middle of things and temporarily allied with the Cyber-Slayers, a fact that did not go over well with Smythe.<ref>''The Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #2</ref>

Smythe, no longer in his carapace but with his ability to walk restored by his earlier use of it, found his way outside prison and sought revenge on both Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson for the death of his father. He coerced Jameson to alter the stories in the Daily Bugle or else he'd kill JJJ's wife and son [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]. Once Spider-Man caught on to Smythe's trail, he followed it back to the Bugle where Smythe assaulted him with recreated versions of every spider-slayer ever sent after Spider-Man in the past plus a pair of new creations—a miniature model designed to latch onto Spider-Man's face and penetrate his mind through use of radiation and a larger six-armed model arguably stronger than any other created. While attached to Spider-Man's head, the miniature spider-slayer psionically connected to Spidey's mind, copied thoughts of his loved ones, and broadcast that information to all the other mini-slayers. Smythe gave Spider-Man the choice of either stopping them or preventing the six-armed slayer from destroying Jameson. Spider-Man eventually shut down all the spider-slayers at the same time, but it was Jameson who beat Smythe to the verge of death with a baseball bat for threatening his family. Smythe made another return in which he used a poisonous spider he made and attacked John Jameson and caused him to end up in the hospital.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #20-21</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline, Alistair Smythe returns with a new metallic body armor and is hunting down all of J. Jonah Jameson's friends and families. He decides to seek out [[Mac Gargan]] for help, who is currently locked away in jail.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref> Posing as a scientist, Smythe infiltrates the Raft and makes off with Gargan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #650</ref> He then performs a cybernetic operation on him, turning him into a cyborg Scorpion, and convinces him to join his crusade against Jameson. At this point, Smythe has amassed a small army of cyborg minions, all of whom want revenge on Jameson.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #651</ref> Smythe, Scorpion, and a new villain named Fly-Girl lead their army to attack the site of John Jameson's latest space mission, sabotaging the launch and holding John for ransom.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #652</ref> Smythe's new plan was to kill all those close to Jameson, but not to kill Jameson himself so Jameson could feel the same suffering that he did losing his father. Smythe's actions get Jameson's wife [[Marla Jameson|Dr. Marla Jameson]] killed, as well as seemingly permanently negating Spider-Man's spider-sense when a device Spider-Man designed to overload a link between Smythe's current Slayers also damaged his spider-sense.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #654</ref> J. Jonah Jameson plans to have the death penalty given to Alistair Smythe for what happened to Marla.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #656</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, J. Jonah Jameson brings Alistair Smythe from Ryker's Island to demand his help in resolving the spider-flu plague transforming ordinary citizens into Homo Archanis. Alistair Smythe laughed at the irony of how Jameson has gained spider powers. At the moment, Jameson transforms and seriously wounds Smythe by biting a chunk out of his neck.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #670</ref>

Despite his injuries, Alistair Smythe is seen alive and well as a prisoner in the Raft.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #691</ref> Alistair Smythe is a witness of the escape of [[Doctor Octopus]] (who has swapped his mind with Spider-Man) and was denied to join up with him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #699</ref>

Mayor J. Jonah Jameson calls in [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] to help oversee the execution of Alistair Smythe so that he would not escape. Superior Spider-Man confronts Smythe, who tries to taunt him by mentioning Marla Jameson's death. Since Smythe is unaware of the mindswap and that Otto was not paying attention due to him remembering his time locked up during his final days as Doctor Octopus, Superior Spider-Man brushes him off. Mayor Jameson alongside Superior Spider-Man, his assistant Glory Grant, and Bugle reporter Norah Jones watch the procedure of Smythe's execution while he claims to be a "better person". Superior Spider-Man tries to reply that no one would buy that, only to stop himself once he remembers that he just pulled that trick. Just as Smythe's execution begins, a swarm of mini Spider-Slayers attack the place allowing Smythe to move freely. However, they are counteracted by Otto's Spider-Bots. Smythe attempts to escape, but he finds out that Otto has prepared himself for every method of escape he may try, prompting Smythe to shift his plan to kill Spider-Man for which he was also prepared. The mini Spider-Slayers enter the infirmary where they surround [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. The mini Spider-Slayers heal and enhance them where they get one request from Smythe to kill Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref>

Superior Spider-Man is seen fighting Smythe and is mocking him for being weak in comparison to his father [[Spencer Smythe]]. When Superior Spider-Man says that he has called the Avengers for backup, Smythe states that he has his own backup as Boomerang, Scorpion, and Vulture show up. Superior Spider-Man admits that the Mini-Slayers were clever but inadvertently reveals that his countermeasures are being powered by the Raft's Power Generators distracting him at the revelation. Smythe takes the upper hand until he is narrowly shot down by Mayor Jameson disguised as a Raft guard. Superior Spider-Man hunts Smythe through his comm system only to discover that he did the same trick and informed his allies (all heading for a full front assault against Superior Spider-Man) who tries to convince them that Smythe is using them and will take back their enhancements once he has out. All of them agree that even though that might happen, they will make the best of the situation against him. Smythe manages to reach the Raft's generators, destroying them to shut down the power in the entire island, allowing the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] to escape. Once Smythe tries to escape, Superior Spider-Man reminds him about the emergency generators. Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that just like he does with his Spider-Bots, he can see through his Mini-Slayers catching up on Mayor Jameson and the trapped civilians sending their locations to the group. Scorpion rejects it at first, but is easily convinced once Smythe tells him that one of his targets is Mayor Jameson himself. After Boomerang is defeated, Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that he is still caught in a predicament since Scorpion is heading to his personal vengeance against Jameson and Vulture is ready to kill the group of civilians so he must make a choice only to be surprised when Superior Spider-Man replies that he will not follow any of them. Instead, Superior Spider-Man determined to complete his mission of slaying him.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

Superior Spider-Man succeeds in killing Smythe but only physically his corpse, with his mind intact, attacks the survivors, disarming the guards. Superior Spider-Man tackles Smythe and they fall onto the shore below, Smythe attempts to transfer his mind into Superior Spider-Man and assume his life. However, due to Superior Spider-Man (identical to Doctor Octopus scheme in "[[Dying Wish]]") having already done this, he has equipped his mask with armored plating. Before Alistair Smythe dies, the Superior Spider-Man taunts him revealing his true identity as Doctor Octopus and that he already beat him to the mind transfer. His body is presumably carried away.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Doctor Octopus' conscious in an Octobot infiltrates New U Technologies and finds that [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] has obtained the body of Alistair Smythe.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #20</ref> Jackal managed to make a clone of Alistair Smythe alongside his father Spencer Smythe.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Alistair Smythe is a scientific genius specializing in [[robotic]]s, [[cybernetic]]s and genetics. His most notable inventions are the [[Spider-Slayers]], robots built for the express purpose of capturing or killing Spiderman. Though the creation and idea for these originally came from his father, Alistair has made advances and improvements on the originals and current generations are extremely sophisticated and formidable. The Slayers often operate in groups and Alistair is tactically skilled in his deployment of them.

Smythe invented a bio-organic carapace that serves as a full body armor. It gives him increased strength and the ability to walk again by interfacing with his spine. The carapace has bird-like talons for feet, a long, curved bladed weapon jutting from each shoulder and smaller, jagged blades on each forearm. It also has web-shooter that fires from the forearm area. While wearing this armor, Smythe has superhuman strength, durability, speed and agility.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:Spidermanep35.jpg|thumb|right|Alistair Smythe as the Ultimate Spider Slayer, from ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|the Spider-Man animated series]]'']]
* Alistair Smythe appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Maxwell Caulfield]]. This version had worked for various villains. He witnessed [[Spencer Smythe]]'s failure to destroy [[Spider-Man]] which (as in the comics) caused his apparent death and was convinced to create the Spider-Slayers to attack Spider-Man as part of a deal with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Smythe became the Kingpin's primary accomplice for some time, even after Smythe's technology failed to kill Spider-Man. His association with the Kingpin came to an end when Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] teamed up to fight the Kingpin, resulting in [[Richard Fisk]]'s arrest. The angered Kingpin blamed the incident on Smythe's 'incompetence' and that his 'days here are numbered'. Fearing for himself, Smythe planned to sell out the Kingpin, but was caught in the act. He was turned against his will into the "Ultimate Spider-Slayer" cyborg by his replacement Herbert Landon with genetic manipulation. With this change, Alistair was strong enough to crush Spider-Man in a bearhug and possesses even greater agility than the wall-crawler. His back's "horns" can fire lasers. He soon broke free of the Kingpin's programming and recovered his father's body (which had been kept alive in stasis by the Kingpin unbeknownst to him) thanks to Spider-Man. Smythe later went to work for Alisha Silver. Smythe is later contacted by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] to have [[Silvermane]] send men to help repair Warren's underwater lab. Alistair was later transported to the alien planet where he worked with the [[Red Skull]]. However, it is revealed that he doesn't want to rule the planet like the Red Skull and [[Doctor Octopus]], but that he just wants to get back to his father. An alternate version appeared in two-part series finale  where he is seen working for the Kingpin and [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Carnage]] in order to build a mind-control device to take over the world (but Spider-Carnage's real intentions were to destroy all reality). After Spider-Man foiled these plans, Spider-Carnage fled to another reality but leaves a bomb in the Kingpin's building to which Smythe and everyone else in the building were saved by Spider-Man and [[Madame Web]].
* Alistair Smythe appears in 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jason Spisak]]. This version is depicted as being around the same age as Peter Parker and shares Spencer Smythe's rivalry with [[Max Modell]]. In the episode "Osborn Academy", he is among the students that are interviewed for a spot in Osborn Academy. In the episode "Party Animals", Smythe controls another of the Spider-Slayers to fight with Spider-Man. After setting the Spider-Slayer to self-destruct enough for Spider-Man to fling far away from civilian population, Alistair is told by [[Norman Osborn]] that he passed the audition to get into Osborn Academy. In the episode "Ultimate Spider-Man", Alistair controls a giant Spider-Slayer on Osborn's behalf where he competes with his own father while stating that Norman has started to been a better father figure; Spider-Man and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] were able to defeat the Spider-Slayers. While Spencer gets webbed up by Spider-Man and handed over to the police, Alistair gets away and tells Osborn what happened. He later appears in the episode "The Rise of Doc Ock: Part 4" as a member of the Sinister Five, using the Spider-Slayers armor on. In the episode "Hobgoblin, Part 1", Smythe helps the Sinister Five wear down Spider-Man so that Doctor Octopus can brainwash and expand to the [[Sinister Six]]. With [[Harry Osborn]]'s help in the Hobgoblin armor, Spider-Man frees Smythe, [[Steel Spider]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and Vulture from Doctor Octopus's mind control technology.

===Film===
Alistair Smythe appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', portrayed by [[B. J. Novak|B.J. Novak]]. This version is a supervisor at [[Oscorp]]. He is shown to be insulting to Max Dillon and orders Max to check the electrical fault on Dillon's birthday which causes the man's transformation into [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/MarcW/statuses/430457648157171712?screen_name=MarcW]</ref>

===Video games===
* Alistair Smythe appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'' as one of the enemies of [[Spider-Man]].
* Alistair Smythe appeared as a major boss in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] versions of the ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man Animated Series]]'' game.
* In ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', there are newspapers in both timelines about Alistair Smythe.
* Alistair Smythe appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Nolan North]]. He is seen as the main antagonist of the game, although he doesn't have any super powers like in the comics. After the events of the ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|film]]'' and Connors’ inglorious dismissal from the company, Oscorp hired Smythe and funneled all of Connors’ resources to its new robotics division. Smythe became "the new face of Oscorp," determined to change the world, and erase the stain of Connors’ biological freak show. But Connors' legacy was not that easy to destroy and all of the so-called "cross-species" created by injecting animals with human DNA remained locked and hidden in Oscorp, as the scientists weren't able to develop a "cure" for them. But things got real bad when Gwen sneaked Peter in Oscorp to find more about them. Smythe offered to assist them on the rest of the tour. But when the cross-species came in contact with Peter's half-human, half-spider DNA, they broke out and infected all the scientists, including Gwen and Smythe. Smythe and other scientists managed to get to the quarantine zone along with Gwen (who was brought there by Spidey) and began looking for a cure while releasing all of his robots over the city to eliminate the escaped cross-species. Spidey managed to destroy one of his robots, S-01(which, because of his spider DNA detected him as a cross-species too) and, after he brought Connors out of Beloit Psychiatric Hospital, began looking for a cure too. He found Vermin and took a sample of his blood for Connors' cure, but was interrupted by a new type of Smythe's robots, The Hunters. After he destroyed them, he took the sample to Connors who managed to make a "cure". But when he sneaked inside Oscorp (now under quarantine) and gave the cure to Gwen, Smythe took it and decided to test it on him because, if it worked, he would start analayzing and producing more, so that he could be the one to save the city. But it didn't work and paralyzed his legs, making him very angry and wanting to kill Spider-Man and Connors. He sent another giant robot, S-02, to kill Spidey, but he managed to destroy it too and returned to Connors. He made a new cure, using Peter's DNA this time, and Spidey infiltrated Oscorp again and gave it to the scientists and Gwen, discovering it worked now. But Smythe didn't stop there and, while Spider-Man fought criminals in the city, he managed to discover his secret identity, found his apartment and captured Connors. When Spidey returned, he was attacked by some Hunters again, but destroyed them and infiltrated his robot factory. There, he rescued Connors but was captured instead. Smythe injected him with some nanobots which took away all his powers and weakened him. Spider-Man managed to escape and return to the city, only to find it destroyed and terrorized by Smythe's newest and biggest robot, S-03, which was spreading the same nanobot toxin all over the city. Spider-Man returned to Connors' old sewer lab where Connors managed to create enough of the cure for the hole city and injected himself with the Lizard serum, considering that, with a powerless Spider-Man, it was the only creature able to stop Smythe. But Spidey didn't give up and went to S-03 to help Lizard. There he electrocuted himself to destroy all the nanobots and restore his powers. With his powers back, Spider-Man and Connors destroyed Smythe's robot and stopped him for good, but the serum took Connors' mind and transformed him back into a killer monster. After he left Smythe (who finally realized the bad he was done) to the police, Spider-Man went to the sewers where he gave Lizard the cure and saved Connors. The city was saved, no one was infected anymore, Connors asked to be taken back to the asylum and everyone saw Spider-Man as their hero, except for Smythe who refused to take the cure and still wanted to use his own one. In a post-credits scene, Smythe enters his facility and, succumbing to the virus and guilt, allows a Hunter-Bot to kill him.
