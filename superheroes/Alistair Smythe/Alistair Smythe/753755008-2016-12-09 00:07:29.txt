==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
Alistair Smythe first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Annual 19 (November 1985), created by [[Louise Simonson]] and Mary Wilshire. Alistair Smythe died in ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' #13 (September 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
The [[Spider-Slayer]]s were a series of robots that sought to destroy Spider-Man. The initial generation of spider-slayers were created by Alistair's father, [[Spencer Smythe]], and commissioned by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. After Spencer failed to kill Spider-Manâ€”and ended up dying as a result of prolonged exposure to the radioactive samples involved- Alistair inherited the legacy from his father and gained a new-found hatred toward Spider-Man. His initial attempt, however, failed when, in a rather humorous misunderstanding, he mistook [[Mary Jane Watson]] for Spider-Man (playing along with it to give Peter time to come up with a plan, Mary Jane claimed she used a super-powered suit designed by aliens) until he was defeated by the real wall-crawler. He initially worked for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] but left in disagreement over how to deal with Spider-Man and went solo.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual 19</ref>

In the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline, Alistair Smythe returns with a new metallic body armor and is hunting down all of J. Jonah Jameson's friends and families. He decides to seek out [[Mac Gargan]] for help, who is currently locked away in jail.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref> Posing as a scientist, Smythe infiltrates the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] and makes off with Gargan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #650</ref> He then performs a cybernetic operation on him, turning him into a cyborg Scorpion, and convinces him to join his crusade against Jameson. At this point, Smythe has amassed a small army of cyborg minions, all of whom want revenge on Jameson.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #651</ref> Smythe, Scorpion, and a new villain named Fly-Girl lead their army to attack the site of John Jameson's latest space mission, sabotaging the launch and holding John for ransom.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #652</ref> Smythe's new plan was to kill all those close to Jameson, but not to kill Jameson himself so Jameson could feel the same suffering that he did losing his father. Smythe's actions get Jameson's wife [[Marla Jameson|Dr. Marla Jameson]] killed, as well as seemingly permanently negating Spider-Man's spider-sense when a device Spider-Man designed to overload a link between Smythe's current Slayers also damaged his spider-sense.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #654</ref> J. Jonah Jameson plans to have the death penalty given to Alistair Smythe for what happened to Marla.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #656</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, J. Jonah Jameson brings Alistair Smythe from [[Ryker's Island]] to demand his help in resolving the spider-flu plague transforming ordinary citizens into Homo Archanis. Alistair Smythe laughed at the irony of how Jameson has gained spider powers. At the moment, Jameson transforms and seriously wounds Smythe by biting a chunk out of his neck.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #670</ref>

Despite his injuries, Alistair Smythe is seen alive and well as a prisoner in the Raft.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #691</ref> Alistair Smythe is a witness of the escape of [[Doctor Octopus]] (who has swapped his mind with Spider-Man) and was denied to join up with him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #699</ref>

Mayor J. Jonah Jameson calls in [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] to help oversee the execution of Alistair Smythe so that he would not escape. Superior Spider-Man confronts Smythe, who tries to taunt him by mentioning Marla Jameson's death. Since Smythe is unaware of the mindswap and that Otto was not paying attention due to him remembering his time locked up during his final days as Doctor Octopus, Superior Spider-Man brushes him off. Mayor Jameson alongside Superior Spider-Man, his assistant Glory Grant, and Bugle reporter Norah Jones watch the procedure of Smythe's execution while he claims to be a "better person". Superior Spider-Man tries to reply that no one would buy that, only to stop himself once he remembers that he just pulled that trick. Just as Smythe's execution begins, a swarm of mini Spider-Slayers attack the place allowing Smythe to move freely. However, they are counteracted by Otto's Spider-Bots. Smythe attempts to escape, but he finds out that Otto has prepared himself for every method of escape he may try, prompting Smythe to shift his plan to kill Spider-Man for which he was also prepared. The mini Spider-Slayers enter the infirmary where they surround [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. The mini Spider-Slayers heal and enhance them where they get one request from Smythe to kill Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref>

Superior Spider-Man is seen fighting Smythe and is mocking him for being weak in comparison to his father [[Spencer Smythe]]. When Superior Spider-Man says that he has called the Avengers for backup, Smythe states that he has his own backup as Boomerang, Scorpion, and Vulture show up. Superior Spider-Man admits that the Mini-Slayers were clever but inadvertently reveals that his countermeasures are being powered by the Raft's Power Generators distracting him at the revelation. Smythe takes the upper hand until he is narrowly shot down by Mayor Jameson disguised as a Raft guard. Superior Spider-Man hunts Smythe through his comm system only to discover that he did the same trick and informed his allies (all heading for a full front assault against Superior Spider-Man) who tries to convince them that Smythe is using them and will take back their enhancements once he has out. All of them agree that even though that might happen, they will make the best of the situation against him. Smythe manages to reach the Raft's generators, destroying them to shut down the power in the entire island, allowing the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] to escape. Once Smythe tries to escape, Superior Spider-Man reminds him about the emergency generators. Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that just like he does with his Spider-Bots, he can see through his Mini-Slayers catching up on Mayor Jameson and the trapped civilians sending their locations to the group. Scorpion rejects it at first, but is easily convinced once Smythe tells him that one of his targets is Mayor Jameson himself. After Boomerang is defeated, Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that he is still caught in a predicament since Scorpion is heading to his personal vengeance against Jameson and Vulture is ready to kill the group of civilians so he must make a choice only to be surprised when Superior Spider-Man replies that he will not follow any of them. Instead, Superior Spider-Man determined to complete his mission of slaying him.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

Superior Spider-Man succeeds in killing Smythe but only physically his corpse, with his mind intact, attacks the survivors, disarming the guards. Superior Spider-Man tackles Smythe and they fall onto the shore below, Smythe attempts to transfer his mind into Superior Spider-Man and assume his life. However, due to Superior Spider-Man (identical to Doctor Octopus scheme in "[[Dying Wish]]") having already done this, he has equipped his mask with armored plating. Before Alistair Smythe dies, the Superior Spider-Man taunts him revealing his true identity as Doctor Octopus and that he already beat him to the mind transfer. His body is presumably carried away.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Doctor Octopus' conscious in an Octobot infiltrates New U Technologies and finds that [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] has obtained the body of Alistair Smythe.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #20</ref> Jackal managed to make a clone of Alistair Smythe alongside his father Spencer Smythe.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Alistair Smythe is a scientific genius specializing in [[robotic]]s, [[cybernetic]]s and genetics. His most notable inventions are the [[Spider-Slayers]], robots built for the express purpose of capturing or killing Spiderman. Though the creation and idea for these originally came from his father, Alistair has made advances and improvements on the originals and current generations are extremely sophisticated and formidable. The Slayers often operate in groups and Alistair is tactically skilled in his deployment of them.

Smythe invented a bio-organic carapace that serves as a full body armor. It gives him increased strength and the ability to walk again by interfacing with his spine. The carapace has bird-like talons for feet, a long, curved bladed weapon jutting from each shoulder and smaller, jagged blades on each forearm. It also has web-shooter that fires from the forearm area. While wearing this armor, Smythe has superhuman strength, durability, speed and agility.
