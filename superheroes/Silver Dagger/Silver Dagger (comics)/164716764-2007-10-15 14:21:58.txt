'''Silver Dagger''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Silver Dagger was a former criminal who was also a former Cardinal in the Catholic Church.  He was driven mad by reading the [[Darkhold]] in the form of the Shiatra Book of the Damned.  He became a religious zealot and a sorcerer and began destroying other sorcerers and magical beings, believing them to be great sinners. He took his name from his weapon, a silver dagger dipped in holy water, a traditional means of destroying [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]].

Silver Dagger once infiltrated the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] and threw a silver dagger into [[Doctor Strange]]'s back.  He stole the [[Eye of Agamotto]] while Strange was pulled into the necromantic [[Orb of Agamotto]].
