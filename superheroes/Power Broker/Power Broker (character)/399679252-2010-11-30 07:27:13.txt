'''Curtiss Jackson''', later known as the '''Power Broker''', is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Machine Man]]'' Vol. 1 #6 (September 1978), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

'''Power Broker, Inc.''' is a fictional criminal corporation in the [[Marvel Universe]] which provides individuals with [[superhuman]] physical abilities for a price. The organization first appeared in ''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]'' #35, in May 1986, and was created by [[Mike Carlin]] and [[Paul Neary]].

==Fictional character biography==
Curtiss Jackson was born in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. He became a professional criminal, and an executive with the criminal organization known as the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]].

As a member of the Corporation, Jackson attempted to take control of [[Machine Man]].<ref>''Machine Man'' Vol. 1 #6</ref> With Eugene Stivak, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], and the [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp]], he later battled [[Captain America]], [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Marvel Man]], the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Captain America'' #230; ''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #232-233</ref> Jackson kidnapped Trish Starr, and battled the Hulk and Machine Man again.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #234237</ref>

Dr. [[Karl Malus]], a [[mad scientist]] who had experimented on various superhuman individuals, went to work for the Power Broker Corporation founded by Curtiss Jackson, using technology to augment the strength of paying customers to superhuman levels. The strength augmenting process was tremendously risky, with half the subjects dying or becoming severely deformed, but this information was kept a closely guarded secret. Power Broker and Malus also used highly addictive drugs on their subjects, telling them that the chemical was necessary to stabilize their powers, but in fact it only served to keep the subjects working for-- and paying --the Power Broker. Many wrestlers of the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]], which is only open to those with super-strength, were revealed to have used the Power Broker's services, and wound up indebted to them. Power Broker was also responsible for the strength augmentation of the [[U.S. Agent]] and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]].

The Power Broker offered to give [[Sharon Ventura]] superhuman strength. She was reportedly sexually abused while drugged. She broke free before Malus could administer the addictive drug, so the Power Broker sent the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]] to kill her.<ref>''Thing'' #35</ref> The Power Broker later kidnapped [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition-Man]], and battled Captain America and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] when they came to rescue him.<ref>''Captain America'' #329-331</ref>

When Power Broker, Inc. was attacked by the vigilante known as the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], Curtiss Jackson exposed himself to his own augmentation device in an attempt to gain the super-strength necessary for his self-defense. The process went awry, leaving him so grotesquely muscle-bound that he could not move.<ref>''Captain America'' #358-362</ref> Jackson was revealed to be a patient at Los Angeles County Hospital. Malus decided to take advantage of this situation by sending [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]], who knew Jackson (having previously approached him about gaining super-strength herself), to obtain a copy of his [[fingerprint]]s so that Malus could access all of Jackson's personal accounts and vaults. He used an explosive wristband to force Vagabond's cooperation, but she managed to knock Malus out, destroy the fingerprint mold, place the band on his wrist, and inject him with the drug he had planned to use on her.<ref>''Captain America'' #363-364</ref>

The Power Broker had Malus' legs broken for his betrayal, then promptly re-hired him to try to cure Jackson's condition. Malus captured and experimented on several augmented individuals, including [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]] to perfect the de-augmentation process, which drew the involvement of the [[U.S. Agent]]. Jackson appeared, revealed to be using an exo-skeleton to move. Together, Battlestar and the Agent defeated Jackson and freed the captured wrestlers, and forced Malus to restore their strength. The U.S. Agent then destroyed Malus' equipment and records, leaving Jackson in an over-augmented state.<ref>''Captain America'' #375-378</ref>

Power Broker has been responsible for providing augmented henchmen to various criminal organizations, such as the [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/sweatshop.htm Sweatshop] and the [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/powertools.htm Power Tools].

The Power Broker was later revealed as one of the Red Skull's division chiefs.<ref>''Captain America'' #394</ref>

Later, Jackson resurfaced following the [[Maximum Security]] event, when Earth was made into an intergalactic penal colony. His extra-muscular bulk had been shed in-between appearances, leaving him looking normal once again. Seeing an opportunity to recruit many of the exotic prisoners being dumped by the [[Kree]] and other alien races, Jackson raced to an area his computers determined would have a large amount of arrivals. Unfortunately for Jackson, the aliens were less than pleased at having been dumped on Earth, and attacked him. Playing dead, Jackson came upon a parasitic organism (Jackson calls it an alien, but U.S. Agent believed it to be an escaped SHIELD experiment to control the alien criminals) who had lost its host. In exchange for becoming its host, Jackson would be granted the use of the parasite's spawn to infect and control others. In his plan to take over the world, Jackson smuggled the parasite spawns to a [[HYDRA]] base and a rebel [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] group. These operations were broken up by [[S.T.A.R.S.]] and their main agent, [[U.S. Agent]], leading the group to take down the Power Broker once again. <ref>''USAgent'' #1-3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Curtiss Jackson was an ordinary man until he exposed himself to his own chemical and radiation strength augmentation process. This granted him superhuman strength and durability, but left him with a grotesquely overdeveloped muscular physique which renders him unable to move without artificial aids. Dr. [[Karl Malus]] invented a powerful steel alloy exo-skeleton with tongue controls and flight capabilities to enable the Power Broker to move. Jackson has managed to de-augment himself and no longer uses the exo-skeleton. 

Jackson was briefly the host to a parasitic organism. This allowed him to mind-control anyone infected with the organism's spawn.

Jackson has a college degree in business administration, and is a highly skilled administrator and planner.

==Successor==
A new Power Broker has appeared in ''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1. Very little is known about him, other than he wears a battle suit, and can project bolts of energy from his hands. This new Power Broker has apparently taken over Power Broker, Inc.; he was responsible for giving Paul Brokeridge super-strength to wrestle in the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation, a move that led to Paul attaining the championship and later being crippled by a stronger wrestler. He was also responsible for giving Paul's brother Roger super-powers; Roger later became the superhero [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]].
