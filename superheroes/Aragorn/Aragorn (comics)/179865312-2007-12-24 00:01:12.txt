'''Aragorn''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[wing]]ed [[horse]] that has served as a [[mount]] for various characters in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Professor Nathan Garrett, the criminal [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]], developed genetic engineering techniques capable of granting a horse wings. He uses it to create a mount to ride during his criminal adventures. After Garrett's final defeat by [[Iron Man]], this horse escapes, was further mutated and fell into the possession of the [[Dreadknight]].

As Garret was dying, he persuades his nephew Dane Whitman to take his scientific discoveries and use them for good.  Whitman thus became a new, heroic [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and used his uncle's techniques to create another flying horse. This one he names Aragorn and uses as his mount.<ref>''Avengers'' #48</ref> Aragorn helped the Black Knight and the the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battle the [[Masters of Evil]];<ref>''Avengers'' #55</ref> carried the Black Knight into battle against [[Le Sabre (comics)|Le Sabre]];<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 2 #17</ref> helped the Black Knight and [[Doctor Strange]] battle [[Tiboro]];<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 1 #178</ref> carried the Black Knight alongside Doctor Strange, and the Avengers as they battled [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] and [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]];<ref>''Avengers'' #61</ref> carried the Black Knight to [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]] to battle [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]],<ref>''Avengers'' #100</ref> among numerous other adventures together.

When the Black Knight was turned into stone by the Enchantress, Aragorn was placed in the custody of his fellow [[Defenders (comics)|Defender]], the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>''Defenders'' #4</ref> Aragorn carried the Valkyrie and [[Namorita]] into battle against the [[Omegatron]].<ref>''Defenders'' #5</ref> When Whitman left his own time to stay for a while in the 12th Century AD, he entrusted Aragorn to the care of the Valkyrie, who became his permanent companion.<ref>''Defenders'' #11</ref> He came to live at the Richmond Riding Academy.<ref>''Defenders'' #17</ref> He accompanied the Valkyrie to [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and Valhalla, and helped Valkyrie, [[Harokin]], and the Defenders battle [[Ollerus (comics)|Ollerus]] and [[Casiolena]].<ref>''Defenders'' #66-68</ref> With Valkyrie, Aragorn helped form the New Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #126</ref>

When [[Alyosha Kravinoff|Al Kraven]], the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]], began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal themed superbeings, Aragorn is clearly seen in one of the cages. However, after disobeying Kraven, Aragorn was killed to set an example to his other captives and then served up as food.<ref>[[Punisher War Journal]] Vol.2 #13-14</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Aragorn was a normal horse until [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]] used [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]'s techniques to give him large, fully feathered wings that allow him to fly via natural winged flight.  He is an experienced battle steed on land and aloft. Aragorn's enhanced intelligence gives him an excellent rapport with both the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and Dane Whitman, enabling him to understand and obey complex commands.
