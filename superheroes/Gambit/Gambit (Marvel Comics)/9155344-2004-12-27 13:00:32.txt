'''Gambit''' (Remy Etienne LeBeau) is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[comic book]] character in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]].  He has the ability to charge objects with [[kinetic energy]], usually causing them to explode.  He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #266.  One of his trademark tricks is to hurl a deck of cards at an opponent, charging each one and turning it into a deadly projectile.  His other tricks have included charging a wad of chewing gum when he was otherwise entirely tied up, and charging the floor of an entire room, causing it to explode with great force.  He has also often wielded a telescoping [[adamantium]] staff.

He was born in [[New Orleans]] and after growing up as an orphan on the streets, he was adopted by Jean-Luc LeBeau, head of the Thieves Guild.  Remy was then raised and became a master thief himself.  In an attempt to reconcile the Thieves and Assassins Guilds, Remy married Belladonna Boudreaux, daughter of the head Assassin.  Unfortunately, he was challenged by and killed her brother Julien in a duel after the wedding and he was exiled from the city and his relationship with Belle.

After much wandering around the world, he rescued [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] from the [[Shadow King]] when she had been transformed into a child.  After taking her on a stealing spree across America, she brought him back to the [[X-Men]]. There, he fell in love with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and pursued her constantly, despite the fact that he could never touch her due to her power of uncontrolled mental and physical absorption through skin contact.

It was always hinted that Remy had a guilty secret.  [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] was so traumatized by absorbing his memories in Israel that she ran away from the [[X-Men]] for a time.  Later, at a mockery of a trial, she was forced to kiss him again, revealing that he had assembled the team for [[Mister Sinister]] that later killed most of the [[Morlocks]], outcast mutants living in [[New York]]'s sewers.  This revelation and Gambit's guilty memories caused Rogue to reject him, leaving him in [[Antarctica]].

He made it back to America and eventually rejoined the team, at one point becoming the field leader of a branch of X-Men.  His love for Rogue was still intact, but her inability to control her powers made her break it off out of fear of hurting him.  However, he later joined the team searching for the [[Books of Truth]].  He was captured and used as a 'human battery' by the interdimensional warlord Khan which drained his powers to such an extent that, despite remaining alive, he could no longer charge objects.  He and Rogue, also drained of her powers while saving him, went on leave for a time to try and sort out their relationship.

When they returned, they were still both powerless. Shortly afterwards, however, Sage "jump-started" his powers, with Rogue's aid. However, this proved to be more of a curse than a blessing when one of his cards quite literally blew up in his face, blinding him.

==Television and film==

Gambit was one of the starring X-Men in the ''[[X-Men animated series|X-Men]]'' animated series of the [[1990s]].

In the more recent ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated TV series, Gambit appeared in later episodes as a henchman of [[Magneto]], and he was voiced by [[Alessandro Juliani]].

Due to a brief mention of his name in the movie '''X2: X-Men United''' (when Mystique looks through a registry of mutants and several comic book names are mentioned, including that of Remy Lebeau), as well as recent information released that several mutants are to be introduced in the third movie, it is hoped that Gambit will appear in the third X-Men movie.  [[Bryan Singer]], director of the first two movies, is on record claiming that Gambit was rejected for inclusion because his powers are too similar to Cyclops's, and his personality too similar to Wolverine's; and indeed, Rogue's romantic interests were focused on Bobby "[[Iceman]]" Drake in the second movie.  But Singer has declined the chance to direct '''X3''' (in favor of a new [[Superman]] project), so the possibility of a Gambit film incarnation remains undecided.
