'''Gambit''' (Remy LeBeau) is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[comic book]] character in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]].  He has the ability to charge inanimate objects with [[kinetic energy]], usually causing them to explode.  He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #266 (August [[1990]]).

==Character history==

He was born in [[New Orleans]], yet abandoned at birth due to his burning red eyes. The child who would one day become Remy LeBeau was kidnapped by members of the New Orleans Thieves Guild. They referred to the child as "le diable blanc" - the white devil - and believed he was prophesied to unite the warring Thieves and Assassins Guilds. Soon after, Remy was placed in the care of a gang of street thieves who raised the child and taught him the ways of thievery. After living as an orphan on the streets, Remy attempted to pick the pocket of Jean-Luc LeBeau, then patriarch of the Thieves Guild. Jean-Luc took the boy in off the streets and adopted him into his own family.  In an attempt to reconcile the Thieves and Assassins Guilds, Remy married [[Bella Donna]] Boudreaux, daughter of the head Assassin. Unfortunately, he was challenged by her brother Julien to a duel after the wedding. In the duel, Gambit killed Julien, and he was exiled from the city and his relationship with Bella.

Not much is known of Gambit’s life over the following years since his exile from New Orleans, except that he wandered the world and became a master thief. He also made many contacts (and quite a few enemies) during that time. At one point Remy approached the master geneticist [[Mister Sinister|Mister Sinister]] for help in controlling his powers. Sinister surgically altered Remy's brain to reduce his power levels, thus affording him a greater degree of control. Gambit undertook several missions for Sinister, since he was indebted to him. Eventually, Gambit refused to serve him longer and Sinister decided to declare their debt settled after one last mission.

This mission included collecting a group of superpowered mercenaries (among them a deadly enemy – [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] – and a good friend – Grey Crow aka Scalphunter) and lead them into the tunnel of the subterranean mutant tribe called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. Remy was under the mistaken belief that Sinister just wanted to gather knowledge on mutants or capture them. However, he was horrified to learn the truth, as the Marauders started slaughtering all [[Morlock]]s upon arriving. Unable to stop the killers, he managed to at least save one little girl named Sarah from them and took her to safety. The young Morlock girl grew up to become the X-Man named [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]].

After much wandering around the world, he rescued [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] from Nanny when she had been transformed into a child.  After taking her on a stealing spree across America, she brought him back to the [[X-Men]]. Gambit fought alongside the X-Men, learning as much as he could about them without revealing details of his past, not even his real name. Only [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] had his doubts about the Cajun, which led to a [[Danger Room]] duel between them that Gambit easily won (which might have to do with his rigging the fight). 


When the original five rejoined and the X-Men were divided into two squads, Gambit became part of the Blue team under [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops’]] leadership.  He became interested in one of his teammates in particular, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and started flirting with her, despite her off-putting manner and the obstacle of her uncontrollable power that prevented anyone from touching her. They started becoming more and more interested in each other, even though their first date was disrupted by a villain’s attack. Even still, the two fell in love.

It was eventually revealed that Remy had a dark secret.  Rogue was so traumatized by absorbing his memories in Israel that she ran away from the X-Men for a time.  Later, at a mockery of a trial, she was forced to kiss him again, revealing that he had assembled the team of Marauders for Sinister that later killed most of the Morlocks, outcast mutants living in [[New York]]'s sewers, regardless of the previously written story that showed the Marauders had followed one of the Morlocks' own members, Tommie, to their home beneath the city.  This apparent revelation and absorbing Gambit's own guilty memories caused Rogue to reject him.  

Remy was subsequently captured and brought before a mock trial held by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], the mutant master of magnetism, then disguised as Erik the Red. Remy was summarily cast out of the X-Men and was abandoned in the frozen wastes of [[Antarctica]]. Starving to death, Remy made his way back into Magneto's citadel, where he encountered the psionic essence of a dead mutant named Mary Purcell. The wraith-like Mary bonded with him, allowing him to survive until he reached the Savage Land, a hidden jungle nestled in the icy wasteland. There, Remy struck a deal with the enigmatic being known as the New Sun. In exchange for passage back to America, Remy agreed to run errands for the New Sun.

When Gambit's psyche absorption had worn off, Rogue spent months searching for Gambit, to no avail.  Remy encountered the X-Men again when he attempted to steal the fabled [[Juggernaut (comics)|Crimson Gem of Cyttorak]] for his new employer.  He agreed to return to the team, mainly for his self-respect and for Rogue.  At one point he became the field leader of a branch of X-Men. His love for Rogue was still intact, but her inability to control her powers made her break it off out of fear of hurting him.  He later joined the team searching for the [[Books of Truth]].  He was captured and used as a 'human battery' by the interdimensional warlord Khan, which drained his powers to such an extent that, despite remaining alive, he could no longer charge objects.  He and Rogue, also drained of her powers while saving him, went on leave for a time to try and sort out their relationship.

Meanwhile, the New Sun revealed his true identity after organising an assassination game for a cadre of super-powered mercenaries with Remy as the target. The attempt failed, and Remy learned that the New Sun was an alternate reality version of himself. In his reality, the New Sun's kinetic charging powers had flared out of control, burning the world and killing everyone but himself. As a result, the New Sun hunted down and killed versions of himself in other realities to ensure that they would not repeat his mistakes. During their final battle, Remy burned through his enhanced powers to defeat the New Sun, ending his threat and returning his powers to their normal level.

Remy was later framed by mutant businessman [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] for the death of the Australian crime lord named Viceroy. With the assistance of Rogue, her team of X-Treme X-Men, and former Triad member Red Lotus, Gambit was able to clear his name. Soon after, Remy became embroiled in the X-Men's fight against an alien invasion of Earth. He was captured and used as a power source for the invaders to open a portal that would allow their full invasion fleet to pass through and complete the conquest of Earth. The X-Treme team's enemy, the enhanced human named Vargas, halted the process by plunging his sword into Remy's chest. Remy survived, but found that he had lost his mutant abilities. As a result, he and the also powerless Rogue sought to live a normal life together and retired from the X-Men.

When they returned, they were still both powerless. Shortly afterwards, however, [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] "jump-started" his powers, with Rogue's aid. However, this proved to be more of a curse than a blessing when one of his cards quite literally blew up in his face, blinding him. Gambit remained blind for several months, until Sage managed to restore his eyesight with her abilities once more. As Storm felt he needed time in rehab, Gambit – along with Rogue – is not on her team anymore. Apparently feeling differently, Cyclops assigned both of them to another X-Men squad led by [[Havok]], despite the fact that neither one (or any of the other members on the squad) is happy with being there.

Note: It might be observed that Gambit's cultural baggage as a "cajun" and native of New Orleans is deeply inaccurate and indicative of Claremont and subsequent writers' lack of knowledge of the area. Many details, from the spelling of his name, the use of supposedly "cajun" french phrases that are in entirely the wrong dialect, and innumerable other minor but telling cultural errors are obvious to those actually from New Orleans. Those from outside the area might be unaware of these errors, but natives might find the character to be an offensively inaccurate stereotype.

==Alternate versions==
===Exiles===
[[image:gambit023.jpg|Gambit<br>in Weapon X|thumb|left|160px]]In [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]] Gambit was the team leader of [[Weapon X]] (exactly like the Exiles but more ruthless). He first showed up in ''Exiles'' #23-#25 where Weapon X had to work with [[Iron Man]] to kill all of the [[Inhumans]]. They succeeded and went to the next reality. 

He later appeared again with Weapon X in Exiles #38-#40 and #43-#45. It appeared that he and Storm had been in a relationship and that back in his alternate reality he and Storm (another one from his alternate reality) were married. Storm was now dead and replaced by [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]]. In this mission Weapon X was supposed to kill the ten remaining mutants in this reality but this evil version of Hyperion wanted to be the ruler of this Earth. The heroes didn't want to murder anyone anyway, but a battle with Hyperion soon followed. Hyperion shot off Gambit's arm, forcing Gambit to retreat into the Morlock tunnels. Hyperion murdered most of the Weapon X team.

Finally the Exiles appeared and  figured out what the true nature of the mission was, although they initially refused to go through with it. They were to kill six members of Weapon X and the Exiles. Hyperion and an evil version of [[Ms. Marvel]] (who had already taken care of most of the killing) forced them to fight. In the end Hyperion was ''seemingly'' killed by Gambit after [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] had injured him sufficiently to make him vulnerable. Gambit was disintegrated in the blast. It was revealed later that Hyperion was accidentally reanimated by extradimensional aliens.

===X-Men: The End===
In the miniseries ''[[X-Men the End]]: Heroes and Martyrs'' Gambit was revealed to be the son of [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]], cloned from the DNA of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. This technically makes him the third Summers brother in this reality.

==Powers and abilities==
Gambit can charge inanimate objects with [[kinetic energy]] giving them explosive power. One of his trademark tricks is to hurl a deck of cards at an opponent, charging each card and turning it into a deadly projectile.  His other tricks have included charging a wad of chewing gum when he was otherwise entirely tied up, and charging the floor of an entire room, causing it to explode with great force.

He often wields a telescoping staff, and has enhanced agility and stamina.  On several occasions he has shown an ability to charm people through mild hypnosis, and seems able to scramble attempts at mind reading and psychic attacks because of the charged potential energy always in his body. This charming ability may not be a result of hypnosis but appears to have the potential to be an empathy-based power.

==Television and film==
[[Image:Remy_xmen_evolution.jpg|right|frame|Gambit, as he appears in ''X-Men: Evolution''.]]
Gambit was one of the starring X-Men characters in the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated television series]] of the [[1990s]], in which he was voiced by [[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] until Potter left in [[1996]] and was replaced in by [[Tony Daniels]] until the series ended. One particular episode of the series features the time traveler [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. He accuses Gambit of betraying the X-Men by assassination of the president. Though it turns out to be an attempt by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] disguised as Gambit. A reference to the comics.  

In the more recent ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated TV series, Gambit appeared in a few episodes as a henchman of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and was voiced by [[Alessandro Juliani]]. This version of Gambit is noteworthy for taking liberties with the character- he didn't join the X-Men and appeared to enjoy working for Magneto, displaying sociopathic tendencies behind his charming exterior. Originally, his flirtatious moments with Rogue were meant to be an inside reference for fans of the comic books, but fan demand led the producers to pursue the relationship a little more seriously. Towards the end of the show's run, an episode featured Gambit kidnapping Rogue in an attempt to manipulate her into helping him rescue Jean-Luc LeBeau from the Assassins Guild (re-named The Rippers to be more kid-friendly), and parting ways at the end on friendly terms. Some criticized the episode for 'dumbing down' the character of Rogue, who had up to that point been betrayed so often to the point where she shut herself off from the world and stopped trusting others. It seemed unlikely that Gambit- who had drugged her, bound her, and taken her on a train to Louisiana- would somehow win her trust and sympathy because he had done it to rescue his adoptive father (who he had issues with). The reasoning was that Gambit's relationship with Jean-Luc reflected Rogue's relationship with her own adopted mother Mystique, but critics felt the comparison was flimsy at best, and that the producers were trying to appease the fans rather than create a legitimate storyline. Ultimately, it didn't matter- the show only lasted three more episodes.

{{wikibooks|Fighting Game Moves/Capcom/Gambit}}
It is only in recent years that Gambit has become popular in video games. Beginning with the [[Sega Genesis]] games ''[[X-Men (video game)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]'', both featured him as a starting playable character. He was a playable character in the ''[[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]]'' game for the [[Super Nintendo]]. He is a playable character in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' and is also playable in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''. Gambit was also featured in some games from the [[Marvel vs. Capcom series]]. He also appeared in both of the [[X-Men: Mutant Academy]] games.

Gambit was rumored for a short time to appear in the first X-Men film, but the character never made it to the screen. In [[X2 (film)|X2]] his name was seen on screen among a list of other mutants as [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] hacked the system of [[William Stryker]] for information on different [[mutants]]. The spelling of his name in the movie was actually different from the comic book version. In the movie his name was spelled "Remy LeBeaux" as where his name is spelled without the "X" in the comic books. A cameo of him was also filmed with stuntman James Bamford playing the part. The scene was cut from the film. One early leaked script suggests that Gambit will be included in ''[[X-Men 3 (film)|X-Men 3]]'' as a minor character. At one point, [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was attached to the role, but was never cast. Latest reports indicate Gambit will not appear in X3, although it is still possible that he could appear in the film. And if the rumor of Wolverine films are true, Gambit may be used by the next X-Men movie(X4) seeing how X3's Producers thought he was too similar to both Wolverine(who would now be absent) and Cyclops collectively. It turns out that the real reason why there was no Gambit was because the actor the producers wanted, Josh Holloway, was on an other project; the TV series Lost.
