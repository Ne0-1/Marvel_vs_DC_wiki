'''Anton Arcane''' is a [[DC Comics]] villain who first appeared in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' vol. 1 #2, and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Arcane is a scientist whose obsession with gaining immortality has led him to create monstrous creatures known as "[[Un-Men]]" as well as other monstrous biogenetic experimentations involving the dead. He was able to resurrect his deceased brother Gregori as the [[Patchwork Man]]. He is also a skilled magician, which he is able to channel through his horrific experiments. 

Living in the mountains of Europe with his niece [[Abigail Arcane|Abigail]], Arcane was introduced in Swamp Thing Volume 1 #2 after luring the plant based hero to his castle home. Arcane sought to use his scientific and magic abilities to transform his body into Swamp Thing's form, while changing Swamp Thing back into Alec Holland. At first very grateful to be human again, Alec soon overheard Arcane discussing his evil intentions now that he can carry them out. Alec then succeeds in breaking the spell Arcane cast, and sacrifices his humanity, so Arcane becomes a frail old man again. Pursued by Swamp Thing, Arcane fell to his death, only to be resurrected by his minions in a new body. He then attacked Swamp Thing twice more before truly dying, the first time as a hulking corpse-like beast (only to be destroyed by vengeful ghosts) and later as a spider-like cyborg piloting a massive dragonfly-like vehicle. It is after his second death that his soul was consigned to [[Hell]]. 

Arcane's soul later escaped from Hell, and ultimately helped to summon the [[Monkey King (comics)|Monkey King]] into the world.

After a fight with Abigail that culminated in her leaving on foot to find Swamp Thing, Matt Cable (Abigail's husband) had an attack of conscience and drove after her. He'd been drinking heavily and wound up crashing his car, leaving him mortally wounded.  Ultimately Arcane managed to possess Cable's body, and with it gained access to Cable's godlike power. 

In his body, he masquerades as Cable, claiming a new job called Blackriver Recorporations and buying a mansion for them to live. Arcane combined his own magic with Cable's inherent [[psychic]] powers to alter reality and the employees of Recorporations were the resurrected souls of deceased serial killers returned from Hell. He finally revealed himself, tormenting his niece and causing havoc and insanity by altering reality on a massive scale. For miles around natural and unnatural disasters occurred, people succumb to homicidal instincts and the resurrected serial killers returned to killing.

He once again battled Swamp Thing, accompanied by monstrous forms resembling Un-men, after killing Abigail and condemning her soul to Hell, all the while declaring the earth as his now.

It was during this battle that Arcane found that the Swamp Thing was an elemental and thus possessed semi-magical abilities allowing the Swamp Thing to combat him on a more even ground. The battle was enough for Matthew Cable to regain control of his body, and Arcane was [[exorcism|exorcised]] directly back to Hell. Cable uses his awakened power to resurrect Abigail's body, but not having sufficient power to repair himself, becomes [[coma]]tose and finally dies, whereupon he becomes [[Matthew (Sandman)|Matthew]], a [[raven]] living within [[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]].

Arcane next appears as a [[demon]], having been promoted to this status by the Lords of Hell.  He attacks Swamp Thing yet again, only to be defeated. In a later episode, Arcane temporarily repents his evil ways after having briefly found [[God]], who eventually banishes him back to Hell. Arcane is [[torture]]d by the demon Josephine, whom he seduces into helping him escape. Swamp Thing defeats the two demons, causing their forms to morph together, and when last seen, it is revealed that the Arcane/Josephine being is pregnant.

After Abigail was able to fight off the mental control of [[Sethe (comics)|Sethe]], Sethe revives Anton Arcane from the dead.<ref name=st9>''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 5) #9 (July 2012)</ref>

In the wake of [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Anton Arcane is a regular antagonist in the monthly Swamp Thing comics.<ref name=st9 /> Arcane is now the new avatar of The Black (AKA The Rot) trying to take over The Red (colliding with [[Animal Man]] as well) and The Green. Anton also has a son named William Arcane and Abigail is his daughter in this timeline.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 5) #0 (November 2012)</ref><ref>''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 5) #11 (September 2012)</ref>

During Animal Man and Swamp Thing's one year in The Rot, Anton Arcane and the forces of The Rot were able to take over parts of Earth. It was mentioned by [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] that Anton Arcane had imprisoned someone beneath Metropolis.<ref>''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #15 (February 2013)</ref> When the forces of The Red and the forces of The Green converge outside of Anton Arcane's castle, Anton Arcane unleashes corrupted versions of Maxine Baker and Abigail Arcane.<ref>''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #17 (April 2013)</ref> Anton Arcane and The Rot's conquest of Earth is thwarted and undone when Maxine breaks the hold of the remaining Hunter's Three on her.<ref>''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #18 (May 2013)</ref>
After being defeated by Swamp Thing, Arcane is put in a hell specifically made for him by the Parliament of Decay when nothing ever rots and all is forever pure. Abigail as the new avatar of the rot comes to him demanding information about her mother. Arcane revels that when she was a baby she already had power over the Rot and she accidentally killed her by 'filling' her with the Rot. To make him talk Abigail let him feel rot but she now says he will never escape his hell and will never touch rot again. Arcane says that when he touched it when she gave it to him he became stronger than he been in ages and he will escape and take revenge on both her and Alec Holland. As she teleports away Arcane rips out one of his eyes and throws it in the portal. On earth a boy is about to eat an apple when it turns rotten. He throws it away and Arcane's eye appears in it. <ref> "Swamp Thing" (vol 5) #23.1 (September 2013) </ref>
In Swamp Thing #36, vol 5, when Swamp Thing goes in the Rot to warn Abigail about the new realm of machines she initially assumes he is there because of Arcane who has escaped. <ref> "Swamp Thing" (vol 5) #36 (November 2014) </ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Anton Arcane possesses genius-level intellect. He possess the knowledge of creation of synthetic organs and skin through which he made his Un-men. He initially wanted to create a body and transfer his consciousness into it so he could make himself immortal within a tireless form instead of in his normal aged, worn body. He also possessed many arcane artifacts. He possesses necromancy which enables him to control the dead.
 
In the New 52, Arcane was brought in as the avatar of the Rot just as Alec Holland is avatar of the green. As the avatar he could rot, death and decay to his will. He main objective was to simply help the spread of rot but he caused a wave of carnage as he thought that killing was the best sacrifice for the rot. He then found a way of allowing rot in a living being, causing decay before death. When Swamp Thing and Animal Man are trapped within the Rot Arcane uses this 'living' rot on everyone except those who have a strong enough connection to the Red (Animals) or the Green, such as Poison Ivy or [[Man Bat]]. There are ways to prevent the living rot such as using the Man Bat serum but only if used before completely controlled by it. These rot zombies can be weakened or even killed with Alec Holland's bio-restorative formula. Arcane's un-men were normal people who gave themselves to the Rot.
