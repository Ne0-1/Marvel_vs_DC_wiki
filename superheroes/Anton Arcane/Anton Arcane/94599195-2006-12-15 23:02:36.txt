'''Anton Arcane''', sometimes simply known as '''Arcane''', is a [[DC Comics]] villain who first appeared in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (first series) #2. He is an evil sorcerer who created a group of monsters that he dubbed the Un-Men. One of his creations was the Patchwork Man, a creature created with an intentional similarity to [[Frankenstein's monster]]; the [[Patchwork Man]] had once been Anton's own brother Gregori. 

He had an odd obsession with the superheroic swamp creature called the [[Swamp Thing]]. He took control of Swamp Thing's body, but was defeated and thrown out a window to his apparent death. 
However, he managed to hold onto life, though his injuries were such that he had to have some of his Un-Men build him a new, misshapen Un-Man-like body.  In this form, he attacked the Swamp Thing once more before truly dying; his soul then went to Hell.  

Arcane's soul later escaped from Hell, where it took over the body of Matt Cable, who was married to Gregori Arcane's daughter Abby. Arcane combined his own magic with Matt's inherent psychic powers to battle the Swamp Thing, but he was exorcised directly to Hell. Matt later entered a coma and died, whereupon he became [[Matthew (Sandman)|Matthew]], a raven living within [[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]].

Arcane next appeared as a demon, having been promoted to this status by the Lords of Hell in recognition of his evil.  He attacked Swamp Thing yet again, and was defeated.  In a later story, he was shown to have repented his evil ways after having found God, but that was short-lived and he eventually became evil once more. After God banished him back to Hell, Arcane was tortured by a demon named Josephine, whom he seduced into helping him escape. Swamp Thing defeated the two demons, causing their forms to morph together, and when last seen, it was revealed that the Arcane/Josephine being was pregnant.

==In adaptations==
[[Louis Jourdan]] portrays Arcane in the 1982 [[Swamp Thing (film)|''Swamp Thing'' film]] directed by Wes Craven and in the 1989 sequel ''[[The Return of Swamp Thing]]''.  In the live-action ''Swamp Thing'' television series, [[Mark Lindsay Chapman]] played Arcane, and [[Don Francks]] voiced Arcane in the short-lived ''Swamp Thing'' animated series.
