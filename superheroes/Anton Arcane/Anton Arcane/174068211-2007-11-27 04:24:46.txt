'''Anton Arcane''' is a [[DC Comics]] villain who first appeared in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' vol. 1 #1. 

==Character overview==
Arcane is an [[evil]] sorcerer/scientist who creates a group of monsters that he dubs the [[Un-Men]]. One of his creations is the [[Patchwork Man]], a creature intentionally similar to [[Frankenstein's monster]]; the Patchwork Man had once been Anton's own brother, Gregori. 

Arcane is obsessed with the swamp creature called [[Swamp Thing]]. He takes control of Swamp Thing's body, but is defeated and falls out of a window to his apparent death. He survives, though his injuries are so severe that he orders a few of his Un-Men build him a new body. He then attacks Swamp Thing twice more before truly dying, after which his soul goes to [[Hell]]. 

Arcane's soul later escapes from Hell, and takes over the body of Matt Cable, who has been married to Gregori Arcane's daughter Abby. Arcane combines his own magic with Cable's inherent [[psychic]] powers to battle the Swamp Thing, but is instead [[exorcism|exorcised]] directly back to Hell. Cable later 
becomes [[coma]]tose and dies, whereupon he becomes [[Matthew (Sandman)|Matthew]], a [[raven]] living within [[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]].

Arcane next appears as a [[demon]], having been promoted to this status by the Lords of Hell.  He attacks Swamp Thing yet again, only to be defeated. In a later episode, Arcane temporarily repents his evil ways after having briefly found [[God]], who eventually banishes him back to Hell. Arcane is [[torture]]d by the demon Josephine, whom he seduces into helping him escape. Swamp Thing defeats the two demons, causing their forms to morph together, and when last seen, it is revealed that the Arcane/Josephine being is pregnant.

==In adaptations==
[[Louis Jourdan]] portrayed Arcane in the 1982 [[Swamp Thing (film)|film adaptation of ''Swamp Thing'']] directed by [[Wes Craven]]. He also appeared in the 1989 sequel ''[[The Return of Swamp Thing]]''.  In the live-action ''Swamp Thing'' television series, [[Mark Lindsay Chapman]] played Arcane, and [[Don Francks]] voiced Arcane in the short-lived ''Swamp Thing'' animated series.
