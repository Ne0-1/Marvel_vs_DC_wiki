'''Anton Arcane''', sometimes simply known as '''Arcane''', is a [[D.C. Comics]] villain who first appeared in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (first series) #2. He is an evil sorcerer who created a group of monsters that he dubbed the Un-Men. One of his creations was the [[Patchwork Man]], a creature created with an intentional similarity to [[Frankenstein's monster]]; the Patchwork Man had once been Anton's own brother Gregori. He had an odd obesesson with the superheroic swamp creature called the Swamp Thing. He took control of Swamp Thing's body, but was defeated and thrown out a window to his death. His soul later escaped from Hell, where it took over the body of Matt Cable, who was married to Gregori Arcane's daughter Abby. Arcane combined his own magic with Matt's inherent psychic powers to battle the Swamp Thing, but he was exorcised directly to Hell. Matt later entered a coma and died, whereupon he became [[Matthew (Sandman)|Matthew]], a raven living withing [[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]].
