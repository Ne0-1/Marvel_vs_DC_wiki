'''Anton Arcane''' is a [[DC Comics]] villain who first appeared in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' vol. 1 #2. He is largely considered to be Swamp Thing's arch-nemesis.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

==Character overview==
Arcane is a scientist who's obsession with gaining immortality has led him to create monsterous creatures known as "[[Un-Men]]" as well as other monsterous biogenetic experimentations involving the dead. Indeed, Arcane was able to resurrect his deceased brother Gregori as the [[Frankenstein's monster]]-esque [[Patchwork Man]]. He is also a skilled magician, which he is able to channel through his horrific experiments. 

Living in the mountains of Europe with his niece [[Abigail Arcane|Abigail]], Arcane was introduced in Swamp Thing Volume 1 #2 after luring the plant based hero [[Swamp Thing]] to his castle home. Arcane sought to use his science (and considerable magic ability) to transplant his mind into Swamp Thing's body. His attempt failed and was tossed to his death, where his minions (trained by their master to resurrect him in a new body. He then attacks Swamp Thing twice more before truly dying, the first time as a hulking corpse-like beast and the second as a spider-like cyborg piloting a massive dragonfly-like vehicle. It is after his second death which his soul goes to [[Hell]]. 

Arcane's soul later escapes from Hell, and observes [[Matthew Cable]], who has been married to Abigail. It is also during this time that Arcane helps summon the [[Monkey King (comics)|Monkey King]] into the world

After a fight with Abigail that culminated in her leaving on foot to find the Swamp Thing, Matthew had an attack of conscience and drove after her. He had been drinking heavily and ended up crashing his car, mortally wounding himself. A large fly landed by him and Matthew thought it to be a manifestation of his power. The fly said it would revive him, and he agreed. In reality, the fly was Anton Arcane. He possesses Cable's body and with it gains Cable's godlike power. 

In his body, he masquerades as Cable, claiming a new job called Blackriver Recorporations and buying a mansion for them to live. Arcane combined his own magic with Cable's inherent [[psychic]] powers to alter reality and the employees of Recorporations were the resurrected souls of deceased serial killers returned from Hell. He finally revealed himself, tormenting his niece and causing havoc and insanity by altering reality on a massive scale. For miles around natural and unnatural disasters occurred, people succumb to homicidal instincts and the resurrected serial killers returned to killing.

He once again battled Swamp Thing, accompanied by monstrous forms resembling Un-men, after killing Abigail and condemning her soul to Hell, all the while declaring the earth as his now.

It was during this battle that Arcane found that the Swamp Thing was an elemental and thus possessed semi-magical abilities allowing the Swamp Thing to combat him on a more even ground. The battle was enough for Matthew Cable to regain control of his body, and Arcan was [[exorcism|exorcised]] directly back to Hell. Cable later 
becomes [[coma]]tose and dies, whereupon he becomes [[Matthew (Sandman)|Matthew]], a [[raven]] living within [[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]].

Arcane next appears as a [[demon]], having been promoted to this status by the Lords of Hell.  He attacks Swamp Thing yet again, only to be defeated. In a later episode, Arcane temporarily repents his evil ways after having briefly found [[God]], who eventually banishes him back to Hell. Arcane is [[torture]]d by the demon Josephine, whom he seduces into helping him escape. Swamp Thing defeats the two demons, causing their forms to morph together, and when last seen, it is revealed that the Arcane/Josephine being is pregnant.

==In adaptations==
[[Louis Jourdan]] portrayed Arcane in the 1982 [[Swamp Thing (film)|film adaptation of ''Swamp Thing'']] directed by [[Wes Craven]]. He also appeared in the 1989 sequel ''[[The Return of Swamp Thing]]''.  In the [[Swamp Thing (TV series)|live-action ''Swamp Thing'']] television series, [[Mark Lindsay Chapman]] played Arcane, and [[Don Francks]] voiced Arcane in the short-lived [[Swamp Thing (1991 TV series)|''Swamp Thing'' animated series]]. In these adaptations, Arcane is portrayed as younger and more physically attractive or capable than the elderly, frail figure of the comics. Jourdan, who looked far younger than his actual years, was in his late sixties when the second Swamp Thing film was made. The even younger Chapman portrayed Arcane as more contemporary and American in attitude.
