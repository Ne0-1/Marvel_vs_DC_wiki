The '''Radioactive Man''' ('''Chen Lu''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand|date=October 2008}}
The Radioactive Man character first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #93 (Jun. 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character was originally a Communist agent, and often worked with other Communist characters, which were consistently portrayed as villains, or at the very least at odds with superheroes. The Radioactive Man was a member of the original [[Masters of Evil]],<ref name="Avengers #6 July 1964">''Avengers'' #6 (July 1964)</ref> and often worked with other supervillains against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Iron Man]] in particular. The character remained a villain for decades until reforming as a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref> of which he has remained a member until ''Thunderbolts'' #126 (2008).

==Fictional character biography==
Chen Lu is a [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], and is ordered to find a way to defeat the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who thwarts the Red Army's invasion of [[India]]. Hiding away in a laboratory, Lu exposes himself to small doses of radiation until he is able to withstand a massive barrage. Becoming a living "Radioactive Man," Lu displays his newfound powers to his superiors and travels to [[New York City]] to battle Thor. While the newly-named Radioactive Man is able to initially match Thor, the Thunder God creates a vortex to transport Lu back to China, where he apparently self-detonates.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #93 (Jun. 1963)</ref>

The Radioactive Man survives and is coerced by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]] to join the original [[Masters of Evil]] in a what becomes a failed bid to destroy the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. <ref name="Avengers #6 July 1964"/> Years later, Lu joins another version of the group formed by killer robot [[Ultron]], which is also defeated.<ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (July - Aug. 1968)</ref> This group once again battled the Avengers, and the [[Lady Liberators]].<ref>''Avengers'' #83 (Dec. 1970)</ref> Sometime later the Radioactive Man escapes confinement and travels to [[Vietnam]], where he joins Soviet villains the [[Titanium Man]] and [[Crimson Dynamo]] and forms a team called the Titanic Three. Acting as free-agent crime fighters in Vietnam, the trio is duped by a con man and petty thief called the Slasher and battle the Avengers until the deception is revealed and the battle ends. <ref>''Avengers'' #130 (Dec. 1974)</ref> With the Titanium Man, he witnessed the departure of Crimson Dynamo to battle Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #73</ref> After a humiliating defeat by [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]], the group finally disbands when the Crimson Dynamo decides to leave to fight [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Giant Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975)</ref> The Titanic Three are placed under house arrest by Col. Sin Li.<ref>''Iron Man'' #74</ref> Lu joins another incarnation of the Masters of Evil, this time led by [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], but is defeated by [[Henry Pym]] and deported back to China. <ref>''Avengers'' 228 - 230 (Feb. - Apr. 1983) </ref> Whilst in China, the Radioactive Man is employed by master villain the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] to kill Iron Man but is ultimately unsuccessful. <ref>''Iron Man'' #179 - 181 (Feb. - Apr. 1984)</ref>

Later, Radioactive Man was employed by Stane International as a physicist; he then battles [[Spider-Man]] and Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #234</ref> Alongside other superhuman criminals, Radioactive Man attempted to escape from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. He battled the Avengers and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. Alongside Iron Man, he absorbed radiation and prevented a reactor meltdown.<ref>''Deathtrap: The Vault'' Graphic Novel</ref> Alongside [[Lightmaster]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], and a [[Plantman]]-simulacrum, he battled [[She-Hulk]] and [[Death's Head]].<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #24</ref>

Tired of the constant defeats, Lu attempts to reform and joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a team comprised almost entirely of reformed supervillains. <ref>''New Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref> The [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] notes Lu's efforts to reform and allows him to assist [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] in building a holding prison for dissenting super-powered beings during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Lu also joins the group that battles against Captain America's anti-registration invasion force.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (2006 - 2007)</ref>

During a recent battle with the Thunderbolts against the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], the Radioactive Man absorbs an excessive amount of radiation and is forced to wear a radiation suit at all times. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2, #106 (Nov. 2006)</ref> The radiation eventually subsides, but industrialist [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] convinces the Radioactive Man to retain the suit to distract the American public from his clearly Asian features and quell any lingering fears about his radioactivity. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2, #112 (May 2007)</ref> His suit is later destroyed during a battle with the [[Steel Spider]], exposing the Radioactive Man to an on-looking public. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2, #114 (July 2007)</ref> 

In ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]]'', Radioactive Man was with the Thunderbolts when it came to capturing Spider-Man only for him and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] to run afoul of [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]].<ref>Spider-Man: New Ways To Die</ref>

Following the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Radioactive Man is recalled to China and leaves the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #126</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lu is exceptionally intelligent and a brilliant scientist, and as the Radioactive Man can control radiation along the entire spectrum as a result of mutation by exposure to radiation. Lu has the ability to manipulate and project radioactive particles for various effects, including radiation emission as heat (sufficient to incinerate a city block), "hard" radiation (inflicting opponents with nausea, dizziness, and radiation poisoning), or blinding hypnotic light. He can emit potentially lethal amounts of radioactive energy in concentrated blasts or across a wide area; absorb nuclear radiation without harm and convert it to enhance his physical strength; and erect [[List of comic book superpowers#force field generation|force field]]s that are powerful enough to deflect Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]]. He can also emit electromagnetic radiation to deactivate machinery and can concentrate radiation to high temperatures to cauterize wounds.  <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #93 (Jun. 1963)</ref> Chen Lu emits nuclear radiation in direct proportion to the level of superhuman strength exerted, and also emits radiation even in a relaxed state, thereby preventing prolonged human contact. <ref>''Thunderbolts, Breaking Point'' (2007)</ref> His null-radiation body harness, or a full radiation suit, allows him to remain safely in the presence of unshielded persons for more than short periods of time. Radioactive Man can also apparently manipulate the ambient energies powering some others' superhuman abilities, as he defeated the villain [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] by draining him of all his energy. <ref>''New Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #107</ref> The Radioactive Man has iridescent green skin which he can cause to appear normal by lowering his radiation level for short periods.

Chen Lu is an expert on the effects of radiation on the human body, including mutation, and has a Ph. D. in nuclear physics.

==Radioactive Man II==
A second Radioactive Man appears forms part of a group of mercenaries invading the African kingdom of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]]. This version is a [[Russians|Russian]] named Igor Stancheck and his powers are derived from an unknown source. Launched via missile into the "Great Mound", a large deposit of the mineral [[vibranium]] located in Wakanda, the villain kills a scientist and then plans to cause vibrations strong enough to destroy the entire nation. He is, however, defeated by Shuri, the sister of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], who uses the [[Ebony Blade]] of a [[Black Knight (comics)#Vatican Black Knight|Black Knight]] <ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 4, #5 - 6 (Aug. - Sep. 2005)</ref>
