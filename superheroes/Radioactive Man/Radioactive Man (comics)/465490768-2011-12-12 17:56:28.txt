==Fictional character biography==
===Chen Lu===
A [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]] and [[Communist]] agent in the [[China|People's Republic of China]], Chen Lu first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #93 (June 1963). Ordered to find a way to defeat [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] - who thwarts the Red Army's invasion of [[India]] - the character exposes himself to small doses of [[radiation]] until he is able to endure a massive barrage, becoming a living "Radioactive Man."

Traveling to [[New York City]], Chen finds and battles Thor, who is first defeated when Chen hypnotizes him into throwing his hammer away, and turns back. But Thor is able to recover his hammer from a river, and defeats the villain by creating a [[vortex]], sending Chen back to China, where he apparently explodes.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #93 (June 1963).</ref>

Radioactive Man becomes a recurring foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], being found and coerced by [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]] to join the original [[Masters of Evil]] in a failed bid to destroy the Avengers. He is the first member to be met by the Avengers, and sticks [[Captain America]] and [[Giant-Man]] to the pavement with an adhesive, which Thor dodges. He is defeated by Giant-Man and [[Iron Man]] using a device that imprisons him in [[lead]] coils. He is then deported back to China.<ref>''Avengers'' #6 (July 1964)</ref> The character reappears as part of the second incarnation of the Masters of Evil, with this version formed by the [[robot]] [[Ultron]]. The villains, however, are betrayed by the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (July - Aug. 1968)</ref> The Radioactive Man and his teammates appear once again during a [[Halloween]] [[parade]] and are defeated by a loose coalition of superheroines called the [[Lady Liberators]].<ref>''Avengers'' #83 (Dec. 1970)</ref>

Chen escapes confinement and travels to [[Vietnam]], where he joins [[Soviet]] villains the [[Titanium Man]] and [[Crimson Dynamo]] as part of a team called the [[Titanic Three]]. Acting as free-agent crime fighters in Vietnam, the trio is duped by a [[confidence trick|con man]] and petty [[thief]] called the ''Slasher'' and battle the Avengers until the deception is revealed.<ref>''Avengers'' #130 (Dec. 1974)</ref> After an encounter with the hero Iron Man,<ref>''Iron Man'' #73 - 74 (Mar & May 1975)</ref> the characters go their separate ways after a humiliating defeat by time-traveling villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] in ''Giant-Size Avengers''.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975)</ref> Reappearing in ''Avengers'', Chen joins another incarnation of the Masters of Evil - led by [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]] - but is defeated by [[Henry Pym]] and [[deported]] back to China.<ref>''Avengers'' #228 - 230 (Feb. - Apr. 1983)</ref> 

Radioactive Man continued to feature in ''Iron Man'', and is employed by the hero's arch-enemy the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], but is ultimately defeated.<ref>''Iron Man'' #179 - 181 (Feb. - Apr. 1984)</ref> Chen is employed in his civilian capacity as a physicist by Stane International (formerly [[Stark Industries|Stark International]], taken over by [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]) and eventually battles Iron Man and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #234 (Sep. 1988)</ref> The Radioactive Man appears in the [[graphic novel]] ''Deathtrap: The Vault'', among other supervillains attempting to escape from the holding facility the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. Chen, however, aids the heroes in preventing a [[nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].<ref>''Deathtrap: The Vault'' (1991)</ref> The Radioactive Man also features in an issue of the humor title ''Sensational She-Hulk''<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #24 (Feb. 1991)</ref> and once again in ''Avengers''.<ref>''Avengers'' #400 (July 1996)</ref>

After appearing in the second volume of ''Avengers'' that takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 2, #8 - 9 (June - July 1997)</ref> and briefly in ''Thunderbolts'',<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #9 (Dec. 1997)</ref> the one-shot ''Heroes Reborn: Masters of Evil'',<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Masters of Evil'' #1 (Feb. 1999)</ref> the third volume of the ''Avengers'',<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #0 (July 1999)</ref> and alternate universe title ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'',<ref>''Exiles'' #42 (May 2004)</ref> Radioactive Man features in the limited series ''Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes''.<ref>''Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes'' #3 (Feb. 2005)</ref> 

Chen attempts to reform and in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)#The New Thunderbolts|New Thunderbolts]]'' joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a team composed almost entirely of reformed supervillains.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref> During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] storyline the character aids heroes [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] in building a holding [[prison]] for dissenting superpowered beings, and also battles the anti-registration heroes.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> A major development occurs in the title ''Thunderbolts'' when the group encounter the [[Elders of the Universe]] member the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]; the Radioactive Man absorbs an excessive amount of radiation and is forced to wear a radiation suit at all times.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #106 (Nov. 2006)</ref> The radiation eventually subsides, but industrialist [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] convinces the character to retain the suit to distract the American public from his clearly Asian features and quell any lingering fears about his radioactivity.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #112 (May 2007)</ref> The Radioactive Man features in the one shot ''Thunderbolts: International Incident'',<ref>''Thunderbolts: International Incident'' (Apr. 2008)</ref> the limited series ''Avengers/Invaders'',<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #1 (July 2008)</ref> one shot ''King-Size Hulk'',<ref>''King-Size Hulk'' #1 (July 2008)</ref> and ''Thunderbolts: Reason In Madness''<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason In Madness'' #1 (July 2008)</ref> before featuring briefly in the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline.<ref>'''Secret Invasion'' #1 - 8 (Apr. - Dec. 2008)</ref>

As part of the Thunderbolts, Radioactive Man fought Spider-Man and [[Eddie Brock#Anti-Venom|Anti-Venom]] during the ''[[New Ways to Die]]'' storyline; during the fight, Radioactive Man had a portion of his radiation powers drained by Anti-Venom.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'': "New Ways To Die" #568 - 569 (Oct. 2008); #570 - 572 (Nov. 2008); #573 (Dec. 2008)</ref> He continued with the team however, going after the super-hero ''[[Moon Knight]]'',<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 4, #24 - 25 (Jan. - Feb. 2009)</ref> with the group. Radioactive Man was one of Songbird's strongest allies within the team, often supporting her when she fought against Osborn. 

Ultimately, following the events of the Secret Invasion, Norman Osborn and Moonstone began the process of neutralizing the members of the Thunderbolts who would oppose Osborn in his plan to exploit the invasion for his own personal agenda, in order to gain more power. Osborn arranged for Chen to be deported back to China, leading to a bittersweet departure involving himself and Songbird.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #126 (Jan. 2009)</ref>

The Radioactive Man reappears in ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' as part of ''The People's Defense Force'',  China's [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] group of [[metahuman#Marvel Comics|metahumans]]. The Radioactive Man demonstrates that at close proximity he can safely absorb the radiation of Inhuman Xerogen crystals and also, presumably, safely absorb [[Terrigen Mist]].  However, the People's Defense Force is largely defeated by an invading entity known as ''The Unspoken'', a [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] former king of the [[Inhumans]]. The Unspoken is defeated in China by the Mighty Avengers.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #27 - 28 (Sep. - Oct. 2009)</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, a young man named Warhead appeared as a member of the [[Bastards of Evil]], claiming to be the son of Radioactive Man.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #2 (Oct. - 2010)</ref> He has been shown to have similar powers, but killed himself in a mass explosion that killed hundreds of people.<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2 #1</ref>

===Igor Stancheck===
A second Radioactive Man features in the fourth volume of ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]''. The character is a [[Russians|Russian]] mutant named '''Igor Stancheck''' and is one of several [[mercenaries]] invading the fictional [[African]] kingdom of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]. The group makes an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the huge mound of the metal [[vibranium]] located at the heart of the kingdom.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #5</ref> He was killed in battle by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s sister Shuri.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Chen Lu was a normal human until exposed to excessive amounts of radiation, which changed his skin coloring to an [[iridescent]] [[green]], and allows him to manipulate radiation across the microwave spectrum. Abilities include radiation emission as heat, "hard" radiation (inflicting opponents with nausea, dizziness, and radiation poisoning), and [[hypnotic]] light. He can also absorb nuclear radiation without harm and convert it to energy for personal use such as strength enhancement or to [[cauterize]] wounds, create [[force field]]s, and emit electromagnetic radiation to deactivate machinery. As the character constantly emits radiation, he has limited human contact and wears a full radiation suit when in the presence of unshielded persons. As a member of the Thunderbolts, Chen comments multiple times how he is not radioactive and the suit serves no purpose. Norman Osborn requires Chen to wear the suit to reassure the public that he is safe and to disguise the fact that he is a foreigner. Chen Lu holds a Ph. D. in nuclear physics.

Igor Stancheck has the same powers as Chen Lu.
