===Chen Lu===
A [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]] and [[Communist]] agent in the [[China|People's Republic of China]], Chen Lu first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #93 (June 1963).

The Radioactive Man reappears in ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' as part of ''The People's Defense Force'', China's [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] group of [[metahuman#Marvel Comics|metahumans]]. The Radioactive Man demonstrates that at close proximity he can safely absorb the radiation of Inhuman Xerogen crystals and also, presumably, safely absorb [[Terrigen Mist]].

The Unspoken is defeated in China by the Mighty Avengers.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #27 - 28 (Sep. - Oct. 2009)</ref>

===Igor Stancheck===
A second Radioactive Man features in the fourth volume of ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]''. The character is a [[Russians|Russian]] mutant named '''Igor Stancheck''' and is one of several [[mercenaries]] (including [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]], and the Vatican [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]]), orchestrated by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and invading the fictional [[Africa]]n kingdom of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]].

==Powers and abilities==
Chen Lu was a normal human until exposed to excessive amounts of radiation, which changed his skin coloring to an [[iridescent]] [[green]], and allows him to manipulate radiation across the microwave spectrum. Abilities include radiation emission as heat, "hard" radiation (inflicting opponents with nausea, dizziness, and [[radiation poisoning]]), and [[hypnotic]] light. He can also absorb nuclear radiation without harm and convert it to energy for personal use such as strength enhancement or to [[cauterize]] wounds, create [[force shield|force fields]], and emit electromagnetic radiation to deactivate machinery. He has shown the ability to leave behind "radiation pills", i.e. infusing a single individual with enough radiation to give him severe [[radiation poisoning]] and let the contamination spread in a large population. While it was briefly implied that his radioactive makeup and some further enhancements of his powers had left him radioactive and unable to have contact with unshielded people, he was [[retcon]]ned to have always been in full control of his abilities. Even so, during his tenure in the Dark Avengers, Norman Osborn had his original costume replaced with a customized radiation suit, hiding his oriental features and quelling every lingering fear about his radioactive makeup. Chen Lu holds a Ph. D. in nuclear physics.

Igor Stancheck has the same powers as Chen Lu.
