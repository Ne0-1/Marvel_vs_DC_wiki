The '''Radioactive Man''' ('''Chen Lu''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The character was a supervillain who has since reformed to become a superhero and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The Radioactive Man first appeared in ''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #93. 

==Fictional character biography==
Chen Lu is a [[nuclear physicist]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], and is ordered to find a way to defeat the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who thwarts the Red Army's invasion of [[India]]. Hiding away in a laboratory, Lu exposes himself to small doses of radiation until he is able to withstand a massive barrage. Becoming a living "Radioactive Man," Lu displays his new found powers to his superiors and travels to [[New York City]] to battle Thor. While the newly-named Radioactive Man is able to initially match Thor, the Thunder God creates a vortex to transport Lu back to China, where he apparently self-detonates.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery vol. 1, #93</ref>

The Radioactive Man survives and is coerced by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]] to join the original [[Masters of Evil]] in a what becomes a failed bid to destroy the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #6</ref> Years later, Lu joins another version of the group formed by killer robot [[Ultron]], which is also defeated.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, 54 - 55 + 83</ref> Sometime later the Radioactive Man escapes confinement and travels to [[Vietnam]], where he joins Soviet villains the [[Titanium Man]] and [[Crimson Dynamo]] and forms a team called the Titanic Three. Acting as free-agent crime fighters in Vietnam, the trio are duped by a con man and petty thief called the Slasher and battle the Avengers until the deception is revealed and the battle ends.<ref>Avengers vol. 1, # 130</ref> After a humiliating defeat by [[Kang (comics)|Kang]], the group finally disbands when the Crimson Dynamo decides to leave to fight Iron Man.<ref>''Giant Size Avengers'' vol. 1, #4</ref> Lu joins another incarnation of the Masters of Evil, this time led by [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], but is defeated by [[Henry Pym]] and deported back to China.<ref>Avengers vol. 1, 228 - 230</ref> Whilst in China, the Radioactive Man is employed by master villain the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] to kill Iron Man but is ultimately unsuccessful.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #179 - 181</ref>

Tired of the constant defeats, Lu attempts to reform and joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a team comprised almost entirely of reformed supervillains.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #1 - present</ref> The [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] notes Lu's efforts to reform and allows him to assist [[Mr. Fantastic]] and [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] in building a holding prison for dissenting super-powered beings during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]. Lu also joins the group that battles against Captain America's anti-registration invasion force.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (2006 - 2007)</ref>

During a recent battle with the Thunderbolts against the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], the Radioactive Man absorbs an excessive amount of radiation and is forced to wear a radiation suit at all times.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #106</ref> The radiation eventually subsides, but industrialist [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] convinces the Radioactive Man to retain the suit to distract the American public from his clearly Asian features and quell any lingering fears about his radioactivity.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #112</ref> Unfortunately, his suit is later destroyed during a battle with the [[Steel Spider]], exposing the Radioactive Man to an on-looking public. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #114</ref> The suit still acts as a powerful deterrent, making opponents more fearful about physical confrontation, as they now fear the risks of casual [[radioactive contamination]] upon tearing his rad-suit. <ref>''Thunderbolts, Breaking Point'' (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lu is exceptionally intelligent and a brilliant scientist, and as the Radioactive Man can control radiation along the entire spectrum. Lu can emit potentially lethal amounts in concentrated blasts or across a wide area; absorb and convert radiation to physical strength and form force-fields that are powerful enough to deflect Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. He can also emit electromagnetic radiation to deactivate machinery and can concentrate radiation to high temperatures to cauterize wounds.  <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol.1, #93</ref> The Radioactive Man can also apparently manipulate the ambient energies powering some others' superhuman abilities, as he recently drained the villain [[Hyperion (Marvel Comics)|Hyperion]] of all energy, thereby defeating him. <ref>''New Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #107</ref>. Chen Lu however emits a low amount of radiations even in a relaxed state, not enough to pose an health hazard but enough to advise others in avoiding prolonged skin-to-skin contact <ref>''Thunderbolts, Breaking Point'' (2007)</ref>
