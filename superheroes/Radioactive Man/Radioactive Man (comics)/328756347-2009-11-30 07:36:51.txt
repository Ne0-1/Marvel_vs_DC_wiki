==Powers and abilities==
Chen Lu was a normal human until exposed to excessive amounts of radiation, which changed his skin coloring to an [[iridescent]] [[green]], and allows him to manipulate radiation across the entire [[spectrum]]. Abilities include radiation emission as heat, "hard" radiation (inflicting opponents with nausea, dizziness, and radiation poisoning), and [[hypnotic]] light. He can also absorb nuclear radiation without harm and convert it to energy for personal use such as strength enhancement or to [[cauterize]] wounds, create [[force field]]s, and emit electromagnetic radiation to deactivate machinery. As the character constantly emits radiation, he has limited human contact and wears a full radiation suit when in the presence of unshielded persons. 

Chen Lu holds a Ph. D. in nuclear physics.

==Radioactive Man II==
A second Radioactive Man features in the fourth volume of ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]''. The character is [[Russians|Russian]] and is one of several [[mercenaries]] invading the fictional [[African]] kingdom of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]. The group makes an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the huge mound of the metal [[vibranium]] located at the heart of the kingdom.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #5 - 6 (Aug. - Sep. 2005)</ref>
