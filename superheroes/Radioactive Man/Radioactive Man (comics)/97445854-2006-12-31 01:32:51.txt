The '''Radioactive Man''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who has since reformed to become a [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}.

== Fictional character biography ==
Chen Lu is a [[nuclear physicist]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] who is ordered to find a way to defeat the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] after the hero thwarts the Red Army's invasion of [[India]]. Hiding away in a laboratory, Lu exposes himself to small doses of radiation until he is able to withstand a massive barrage. Becoming a living "Radioactive Man," Lu displays his new found powers to his superiors and travels to [[New York City]] to battle Thor. While the newly-named Radioactive Man is able to initially match Thor, the Thunder God creates a vortex to transport Lu back to China, where he apparently self-detonates.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery vol. 1, #93</ref>

The Radioactive Man survives and is coerced by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]] to join the original [[Masters of Evil]] in a what becomes a failed bid to destroy the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #6</ref> Years later, Lu joins another version of the group formed by killer robot [[Ultron]], which is also defeated. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, 54 - 55 + 83</ref> Sometime later the Radioactive Man escapes confinement and travels to [[Vietnam]], where he joins Soviet villains the [[Titanium Man]] and [[Crimson Dynamo]] and forms a team called the Titanic Three. Acting as free-agent crime fighters in Vietnam, the trio are duped by a con man and petty thief called the Slasher and battle the Avengers until the deception is revealed and the battle ends.<ref>Avengers vol. 1, # 130</ref> After a humiliating defeat by [[Kang (comics)|Kang]], the group finally disbands when the Crimson Dynamo decides to leave to fight Iron Man.<ref>''Giant Size Avengers'' vol. 1, #4</ref> Lu joins another incarnation of the Masters of Evil, this time led by [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], but is defeated by [[Henry Pym]] and deported back to China.<ref>Avengers vol. 1, 228 - 230</ref> Whilst in China, the Radioactive Man is employed by master villain the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] to kill Iron Man but is ultimately unsuccessful.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #179 - 181</ref>

Tired of the constant defeats, Lu attempts to reform and joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a team comprised almost entirely of reformed supervillains.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #1 - present</ref> The [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] notes Lu's efforts to reform and allows him to assist [[Mr. Fantastic]] and [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] in building a holding prison for dissenting super-powered beings during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].

==Powers and abilities==

The Radioactive Man can control radiation along the entire spectrum, and can emit potentially lethal amounts in concentrated blasts or across a wide area. Lu can also absorb and convert radiation to physical strength to the point whereby he is capable of holding his own against beings such as the [[Sub-Mariner]] when fully energized. Lu can also form force-fields that are powerful enough to deflect Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. Lu is also exceptionally intelligent and a brilliant scientist.

A second Radioactive Man - Russian in origin - was involved in a failed invasion of [[Wakanda]].
