==Fictional character biography==
Hermod is a young god who is shrouded in mystery. It is known, however, that [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] will usually employ Hermod as a messenger because of his great speed. Hermod's greatest mission was when he traveled to Hel in order to ask the goddess [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] for information on how to revive [[Balder (comics)|Balder the Brave]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Hermod was among the few Asgardians who agreed with Thor and helped Loki, [[Sif (comics)|Sif]], and the [[Warriors Three]] into freeing Thor after Odin imprisoned him for objecting to his plans to raze the Earth in order to eliminate the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]. When Hermod offered to help Thor escape to Midgard, Odin found out about this.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #3</ref> Odin returns to Asgard with the corpse of the Serpent sealing off Asgard from Hermod and a number of other Asgardians who are left on Earth.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7</ref>

* Hermod appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode "Asgard War Part One: Lightnin' Strikes," voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. He is among the Asgardians that are still on Asgard at the time when Thor was leading some Asgardians in their war against Spartax. When Hermod asks Loki what he plans to do when Thor returns and finds that he has run Asgard in his place, Loki claims to Hermod and the other Asgardians present that Thor won't be coming back ever.
