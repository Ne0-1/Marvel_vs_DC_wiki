==Powers and abilities==
Mad Dog gained superhuman powers as a result of bionic engineering and cellular augmentation by the Roxxon Mutagenic Department and by the third [[Secret Empire]]. Baxter was given superhuman strength, stamina, and durability, and superhumanly acute senses of hearing and smell. He possesses bionically strengthened jaw muscles, and has been given large hollow, fang-like canine teeth. His teeth can emit a foaming chemical poison, to which he himself is immune, which can induce paralysis and possibly death if it enters a victim's bloodstream through Mad Dog's bite.  However, the process which gave Mad Dog his powers also gave him insanity which clouds his judgment and behavior.

Robert Baxter has received combat training from the U.S. Air Force.
