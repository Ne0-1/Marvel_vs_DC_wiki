'''Lord Dark Wind''' ('''Professor Kenji Oyama''') is a [[fictional character]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the father of [[X-Men]] [[supervillainess]] [[Lady Deathstrike]], and a figure who would have an impact on the life of X-Men member [[Wolverine]].

== Character history ==

Professor Kenji Oyama was a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[scientist]] who was also a powerful crime lord known as Lord Dark Wind. Kenji is most famous for creating the [[adamantium]]-to-bone bonding process that would be used on the Canadian operative who would become the X-Man known as Wolverine. He is also the father of Yuriko Oyama, the woman who would later become [[Lady Deathstrike]]. 

A former Japanese kamikaze pilot during [[World War II]], his face was horribly scarred in a failed suicide attack on an American battleship. Feeling shamed by his failure decades earlier, he scarred the faces of Yuriko and her two brothers in a ritual design. Her two brothers would later die while in the service of their father.

Yuriko later teamed up with [[Daredevil]] to free her lover, Kiro, from her father's servitude, and to gain vengeance for her scarring and the death of her two brothers; when Yurkio slew her father (just as he was about to kill Daredevil), the devoted Kiro chose [[suicide]] to honor his master. Devastated, Yuriko would later embrace her father's ideals and go on a quest to track down the person who dishonored him. Her trail led to Wolverine, who had by this time undergone the adamantium bonding process at the hands of his Canadian government masters.

In their first encounter, Lady Deathstrike tried to kill Wolverine to restore her family's honor, but was thwarted by [[Alpha Flight|Alpha Flight's]] [[Vindicator]].

Sometimes Deathstrike would postpone her quest to kill Wolverine, most notably when Wolverine had his adamantium forcibly removed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. When she learned of this, she preferred to wait when it was restored to him, feeling that it would be dishonorable to kill Wolverine when he was defenseless.
