'''G.I. Robot''' is the name of a series of fictional robots in comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. It first appeared in ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' #101 (July 1981) and was created by comic book writer [[Robert Kanigher]].

G.I. Robot was a robot designed by a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professor named Thompson. He was deployed to a Pacific island to fight the Japanese military during [[World War II]] alongside the United States Marines and was placed under the control of a sergeant named Coker. Although the robot was technically named Jungle Automatic Killer - Experimental Number 1 (J.A.K.E. 1), Coker gave the robot the nickname G.I. Robot. Coker was skeptical of the robot's abilities, but it soon earned his trust.

J.A.K.E. 1 was later destroyed and replaced by J.A.K.E. 2, which also went by the nickname G.I. Robot. The second G.I. Robot continued to fight on Pacific islands, including [[Dinosaur Island]]. It later teamed with the [[Creature Commandos]].
