'''Molly Hayes''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] and a member of [[Runaways (comics)|the Runaways]] who first appeared in ''Runaways (vol. 1) #1.''

==Character History==
Molly Hayes is a [[mutant]] born with the abilities of super-strength and invulnerability.  Her parents are [[The Pride (comics)|Gene and Alice Hayes]], telepathic mutants who posed as a [[doctor]] and a [[speech therapist]]. Their identical power signatures and an off hand comment about their "pureblood" marriage has led to speculation that their union was actually [[incestuous]].  Like her parents, Molly's eyes glow a purplish pink whenever she uses her powers. As a side effect of her mutation, Molly becomes extremely tired after using her super-strength and often falls asleep. 

===Runaways===
{{Spoiler}}
Molly Hayes is by far the youngest of the group, and while na√Øve, she is quite precocious, seeming to know more than she should for an eleven year old. She is the most idealistic member of the Runaways, and is the only one who makes a [[super-hero]] costume. Molly thinks that running away is a great adventure, but has to be continually reminded that her parents are [[supervillains]]. Out of all the Runaways, she is the only one who truly misses her family. 

During a fight with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], who were hired by underlings of [[comics|The Pride]] to capture the Runaways, Molly rips the cloak off of [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], turning him back into an ordinary human. Molly admires fellow mutant super heroes, such as the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Statix]], and has a crush on [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. Originally she wanted the codename Princess Powerful, but instead Chase dubs her "'''Bruiser'''" as payback for laughing at the codename Gert sticks him with. 

When the Runaways were split up by the Social Services, Molly was picked up by a local branch of [[X-Corp]]. Three months pass and Karolina organizes a reunion, the kids decide to stay together rather than return to their new lives in the ''Leapfrog''. As [[Excelsior (comics) |Excelsior]] and the Runaways face off against each other, she fights [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], pointing out his "fakey" accent.

Whenever the team separates to buy supplies, Molly is paired with new teammate [[Victor Mancha]]. Victor wonders if this is because Molly is the only member of the team strong enough to take him down if he unwillingly goes rogue. Molly promises not to treat the [[cyborg]] (who is actually "younger" than her) like a baby, which reveals her own need to be treated as a young adult. 

Molly has a collection of cute hats that rotate within each story arc, and she has a deep love for the cereal [[Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs]]. 

Molly is one of the 198 mutants to keep their powers after [[House of M]]. (X-Men The 198 Files)

Given that her parents are both [[telepaths]], it could be speculated that Molly's strength may be [[psionic]] in nature. This is supported by the observation that no physical change is evident in Molly when her strength is used (her muscles do not grow bigger), and the fact that she tore [[Cloak (comics)|Cloak's]] cape off his body, a feat which should not be possibile through sheer physical force.
