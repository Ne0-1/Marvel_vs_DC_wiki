'''Molly Hayes''' (self-referred to as '''Princess Powerful''' or '''Bruiser''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] award-winning series, ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''. She was created by author [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in ''Runaways'' vol. 1 #1 with most of the other main characters. Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil villains with special abilities; in Molly's case, telepathic [[Mutants (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Molly began the series at age eleven, is currently twelve and until new recruit [[Klara Prast]] joined the group, Molly was youngest on the team.  Molly's innocence usually serve as humor in the series, but she has been shown to have a smart mind when it comes to action.

Molly is the team's sole [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and despite having telepathic parents, Molly's mutant powers are superhuman strength and invulnerability. She is extremely proud of her mutant heritage and admires the [[X-Men]]. Her trademark is an expansive lineup of hats displayed throughout the series.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Pride===
[[Image:Runaways Vol1-15.jpg|left|thumb|Cover to ''Runaways'' vol. 1 #15<br>Art by [[Jo Chen]].]]
Molly is with friends [[Alex Wilder]], [[Karolina Dean]], [[Gertrude Yorkes]], [[Chase Stein]], and [[Nico Minoru]] when they observe their parents calling themselves [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]] and preparing the ritual sacrifice of a young girl.  Molly is preemptively escorted away by Karolina while the older children watch the sacrifice commence.  They inform Karolina and decide to run away from their homes that very night.  After discovering their powers and gifts, the older five kids rescue Molly from her home.  Molly awakes from a psychically-induced slumber during the runaways' rescue and sees her mother being threatened by Nico.  Molly's mutant powers manifest at that moment in a display of glowing pink hair and eyes.  However, Molly first uses her strength to knock Leslie Dean out of the sky, saving Gert.  Molly promptly falls asleep from exhaustion and the Runaways take her to their new hideout, a dilapidated mansion called "the Hostel."

Throughout the first volume of the series, Molly is skeptical that her parents were accomplices to murder and is unsure why the group ran away in the first place.  However, she is excited at the prospect of becoming a superhero and enthusiastically takes the codename "Princess Powerful," while her teammates dub her "Bruiser."  Shortly after their "superhero" careers begin, the Runaways take in fellow runaway Topher, who turns out to be a vampire.  He dies by ingesting Karolina's solar-irradiated blood and when Molly witnesses Topher's death, she realizes that the superhero life is not a game, and cries for her mother.

Alex later deciphers a text kept by his parents called the Abstract, and informs the Runaways about their parents' activities as The Pride, their ties to the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]] (the Pride's [[Bible|Biblical]] benefactors), and their ultimate goal of exterminating all human life save for the six most loyal Pride members.  Molly expresses disinterest in the Pride's motivations, but is excited when Alex plots to disrupt the Pride's ritual sacrifice to the Gibborim.  When the Runaways encounter the Pride, Molly witnesses first-hand why she and her friends have been in hiding for months and destroys the sacrifice prepared for the Gibborim. She escapes with the Runaways when the Gibborim attack the Pride for losing the sacrifice. After the Pride's demise, Molly is sent to [[X-Corporation|X-Corp]] for foster care, but breaks out with Gert's help and runs away with the rest of the team.

===Runaways===

In the second volume, Molly fights under Nico's command and witnesses the future Gert die in Chase's arms as she warns the Runaways about the future supervillain named [[Victor Mancha]].  Molly participates in the search, and during the second fight with [[Loners|Excelsior]], Molly discerns [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]]'s fake accent; he is later revealed to be [[Geoffrey Wilder]] in disguise.

After Victor joins the team, Molly accompanies him on group shopping trips under Nico's orders because she believes that Molly is the only individual member of the Runaways capable of bringing Victor down should he betray the team.  During the runaways' trip to [[New York City]] to exonerate [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], Molly meets her idol [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], but he scares her and she hurls him out of a church.  After the Runaways solve the case, they return to Los Angeles, but Wolverine and the [[X-Men]] follow them, looking to enroll Molly in [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters]].  After a short altercation, the X-Men leave Molly alone, realizing that it would be unfair to force her to enroll.

During one mission, Molly gets separated from the team and the Provost abducts her.  He coerces Molly and other children into robbing banks for him.  Molly rallies the children to stage a coup, and she finds her way back to the Runaways.

Molly is abducted in a battle with a second incarnation of the Pride, made up of Alex's [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] friends and led by a younger version of Alex's father, [[Geoffrey Wilder|Geoffrey]], (whom she refers to as "an evil black man from the 1980s" when a member of the Pride temporarily removes her gag). Nico rescues Molly with Xavin's aid, but Gert dies covering their escape.  After Gert's death, Molly asks the Leapfrog, the group's transport, if Gert went to [[Heaven]], but it cannot reply since Heaven is not on any of the maps in its database.  Soon afterwards, Molly begins hearing a disembodied voice she believes is Gert's, and follows its instructions to help revive Victor.  She helps Victor rescue Nico from the Gibborim and subsequently joins the team on their cross-country trek to evade [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  The voice Molly heard is later revealed to have been Alex's.

Molly is referenced in ''[[New X-Men]]'' (v2); when [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] researches for the youngest mutant, [[Hellion (comics)|Hellion]] asks for Molly - he believes her to be five.

==Powers and Abilities==
Molly's mutant powers include [[superhuman strength|super strength]] and [[List of comic book superpowers#invulnerability|invulnerability]], with which she has toppled a giant monster bigger than [[skyscraper]]s, tunneled through miles of rock, and broken solid objects over her head.  While in her powered form, Molly's hair gains purple highlights and her eyes glow violet.  Like fellow mutant [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], Molly must consciously activate her powers when she wants to use them and also displays a change of physical appearance when using those powers.  However, Molly can only use her powers for a limited amount of time before she becomes extremely fatigued and falls asleep.  When she first used her powers, Molly fell asleep after only throwing one punch, but as the series continued, Molly has been able to use her powers for increasingly longer periods of time and to greater extremes without tiring. Nico once used the Staff of One to give Molly a caffeine rush while fighting a giant monster to keep her awake longer.

==Relationships==
Although Molly enjoys being independent and a superhero, she is still just a pre-adolescent girl who wants to have fun.  Most of her close relationships are based on who is willing to spend the most time playing with her.  Molly also has a tendency throughout the series to gravitate towards people that she can look up to as a big sibling.

===[[Chase Stein]]===
In the beginning of the series, Molly and Chase engage in a big brother/little sister relationship: they bicker, call each other names, and horse around.  Chase always stands up to protect Molly.  As the series progresses, Chase and Molly grow apart, primarily due to his romantic involvement with [[Gertrude Yorkes|Gert]]. In issues #18-#24 of volume 2, Chase distances himself from Molly and the rest of the Runaways to deal with his grief over Gert's death.  However, in the ''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' miniseries, Chase expresses jealousy over Molly's growing attachment to [[Speed (comics)|Speed]].  Though they are not as close as before, Chase and Molly's relationship seems to have been repaired after Chase moved past grieving for Gert.

===[[Victor Mancha]]===
Molly meets Victor when the Runaways abduct him from his high school, hoping to preempt the prophecy that Victor will one day kill the Earth's heroes.  Molly adjusts rather quickly to Victor's addition to the team; she spends more time off the battlefield with Victor than most, playing board games with him and pairing up to go shopping. During one of their trips, it's revealed that [[Nico Minoru|Nico]] has ordered Molly to "babysit" Victor, because she is the only individual member strong enough to take Victor down if he goes haywire. Molly tells Victor that she's not particularly scared of him, and is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt regarding his supposed future. Victor surmises that Molly is simply using flattery to get him to buy her favorite cereal, but since she treats him as an equal and consistently spends time with him, he concludes that Molly was not just "sucking up." As Molly's relationship with Chase deteriorated, her relationship with Victor grew stronger.

===[[Xavin]]===
Though Xavin was initially hostile towards all the Runaways, excepting [[Karolina Dean|Karolina]], he has shown a great amount of concern for Molly's well-being. He returned to Earth with Karolina after their failed wedding as the Runaways were attempting to locate Molly after she was abducted by the second Pride; Xavin immediately volunteered to help the search efforts to locate "the hatchling." Xavin is another one of Molly's frequent board game partners; during one of their gaming sessions, Molly expressed her discomfort with Xavin constantly shifting between forms and said that most of the team felt the same way. Despite this, Xavin still fought the Gibborim without hesitation to protect the team, after which Molly admitted that Xavin's consistent selflessness more than makes up for the shapeshifting. The two now share a close comraderie.

===[[Gertrude Yorkes]]===
During the series, Gert was a sort of a role model for Molly.  Gert was usually the one that Molly asked most of her questions to and they were normally paired together to guard the Hostel and their getaway car.  When Gert was killed at the hands of Geoffrey Wilder, Molly spent time sitting in front of a photo of Gert in the new Hostel's photo wall.  Molly would talk to Gert as if she were really there.  She even asked the Leapfrog if Gert went to heaven (although it was unable to answer because heaven was not on any of the Leapfrog's maps). In at least once instance, Molly seems to gain specific information from an unknown voice only she can hear, which she assumed to be the voice of Gert; in reality it was the voice of Alex Wilder, in an attempt to redeem himself and escape limbo.

===[[Klara Prast]]===
When they travel to the past, Karolina introduced Molly to a girl in distress named Klara, to help reach out to her because they are closer in age. Molly invites her to join the team, and together they manage to convince her to come with them to escape her tragic fate of being married to an abusive husband (the details of which Molly does not fully seem to understand due to her comparatively sheltered life). When Klara is upset by Karolina's seemingly interracial (actually interspecies) lesbian relationship, it causes a rift between her and Molly, as Molly defends Karolina and can't relate to Klara's homophobic/racist attitudes, a result of her upbringing. Klara is visibly saddened by the confrontation (her emotions reflected in her roses) and leaves. Later, she returns, beaten by her husband, and the team accepts her back.

While Molly has come to be close with Xavin, Klara has not (Xavin was the one she saw Karolina kissing) and this is one thing the two twelve year olds will have to resolve in the process of solidifying their friendship. Klara's abilities are of an almost opposite nature to Molly's, being more defensive and transportive, whereas Molly's are offensive and sturdy. They also have very different personalities, with Molly feeling young compared to Klara who has weathered a lot of difficulties in her life.
