'''Molly Hayes''' (also briefly known as '''Princess Powerful''' or '''Bruiser'''<ref name="runv1#6">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian K. Vaughan]] | Penciller =  [[Adrian Alphona]] | Inker = Craig Yeung | Story = Pride & Joy | Title = Runaways | Volume = 1 | Issue = 6 | Date = September 2003 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>), is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] award-winning series, ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''. She was created by author [[Brian K. Vaughan]] & artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in ''Runaways'' #1 ([[2003 in comics|April 2003]]) with most of the other main characters. Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil villains with special abilities; after the other older Runaways learn more about themselves, they raid Molly's home to find out her mutant abilities had already manifested. Often called "Mol" for short, Molly is the youngest Runaway and her innocence usually serves as humor in the series, but she has demonstrated great insight at critical moments.

Molly was originally the team's sole [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]; despite having telepathic mutant parents, Molly's mutant powers are superhuman strength and invulnerability. She used to be the youngest member of the team, but after inviting fellow mutant [[Klara Prast]] to join, Molly takes comfort in having another mutant and someone her own age. She is extremely proud of her mutant heritage and admires the [[X-Men]]. ''Runaways'' creator Brian K. Vaughan played a significant role in the character's subsequent development as well as artist/writer Adrian Alphona. Molly was named after Runaways creator Brian K. Vaughan's younger sister, Molly Hayes Vaughan.<ref name="hardcover">{{cite book|last=K.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Pride===
[[Image:Runaways Vol1-15.jpg|left|thumb|Cover to ''Runaways'' vol. 1 #15<br>Art by [[Jo Chen]].]]
Molly is with friends [[Alex Wilder]], [[Karolina Dean]], [[Gertrude Yorkes]], [[Chase Stein]], and [[Nico Minoru]] when they observe their parents calling themselves [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]] and preparing the ritual sacrifice of a young girl.  Molly is preemptively escorted away by Karolina while the older children watch the sacrifice commence.  They inform Karolina and decide to run away from their homes that very night.  After discovering their powers and gifts, the older five kids rescue Molly from her home.  Molly awakes from a psychically-induced slumber during the runaways' rescue and sees her mother being threatened by Nico.  Molly's mutant powers manifest at that moment in a display of glowing pink hair and eyes.  However, Molly first uses her strength to knock Leslie Dean out of the sky, saving Gert.  Molly promptly falls asleep from exhaustion and the Runaways take her to their new hideout, a dilapidated mansion called "the Hostel."

Throughout the first volume of the series, Molly is skeptical that her parents were accomplices to murder and is unsure why the group ran away in the first place.  However, she is excited at the prospect of becoming a superhero and enthusiastically takes the codename "Princess Powerful," while her teammates dub her "Bruiser."  Shortly after their "superhero" careers begin, the Runaways take in fellow runaway Topher, who turns out to be a vampire.  He dies by ingesting Karolina's solar-irradiated blood and when Molly witnesses Topher's death, she realizes that the superhero life is not a game, and cries for her mother.

Alex later deciphers a text kept by his parents called the Abstract, and informs the Runaways about their parents' activities as The Pride, their ties to the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]] (the Pride's [[Bible|Biblical]] benefactors), and their ultimate goal of exterminating all human life save for the six most loyal Pride members.  Molly expresses disinterest in the Pride's motivations, but is excited when Alex plots to disrupt the Pride's ritual sacrifice to the Gibborim.  When the Runaways encounter the Pride, Molly witnesses first-hand why she and her friends have been in hiding for months and destroys the sacrifice prepared for the Gibborim. She escapes with the Runaways when the Gibborim attack the Pride for losing the sacrifice. After the Pride's demise, Molly is sent to [[X-Corporation|X-Corp]] for foster care, but breaks out with Gert's help and runs away with the rest of the team.

===Runaways===
[[File:MollyHayesStrength.jpg|thumb|200px|right|After energized, Molly tosses the weight of a skyscraper-sized monster in ''Runaways'' vol. 2 #22. Art by Adrian Alphona.]]

In the second volume, Molly fights under Nico's command and witnesses the future Gert die in Chase's arms as she warns the Runaways about the future supervillain named [[Victor Mancha]].  Molly participates in the search, and during the second fight with [[Loners|Excelsior]], Molly discerns [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]]'s fake accent; he is later revealed to be [[Geoffrey Wilder]] in disguise.

After Victor joins the team, Molly accompanies him on group shopping trips under Nico's orders because she believes that Molly is the only individual member of the Runaways capable of bringing Victor down should he betray the team.  During the runaways' trip to [[New York City]] to exonerate [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], Molly meets her idol and childish crush  [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], but he scares her and she hurls him out of a church, thereafter maintaining a severe dislike of him. After the Runaways solve the case, they return to Los Angeles, but Wolverine and the [[X-Men]] follow them, looking to enroll Molly in [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters]].  After a short altercation, the X-Men leave Molly alone, realizing that it would be unfair to force her to enroll.

During one mission, Molly gets separated from the team and the [[Provost]] abducts her.  He coerces Molly and other children into robbing banks for him.  Molly rallies the children to stage a coup, and she finds her way back to the Runaways.

Molly is abducted in a battle with a second incarnation of the Pride, made up of Alex's [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] friends and led by a younger version of Alex's father, [[Geoffrey Wilder|Geoffrey]]. Nico rescues Molly with Xavin's aid, but Gert dies covering their escape.  After Gert's death, Molly asks the Leapfrog, the group's transport, if Gert went to [[Heaven]], but it cannot reply since Heaven is not on any of the maps in its database.  Soon afterwards, Molly begins hearing a disembodied voice she believes is Gert's, and follows its instructions to help revive Victor.  She helps Victor rescue Nico from the Gibborim and subsequently joins the team on their cross-country trek to evade [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  The voice Molly heard is later revealed to have been Alex's.

Molly is referenced in ''[[New X-Men]]'' #42 (November 2007): when [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] researches for the youngest mutant in the world, [[Hellion]] asks about Molly, who he believes to be five years-old. [[The Stepford Cuckoos]] inform Julian he is incorrect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=4142|title=New X-Men (2nd series) #42|first=Binaryan|publisher=Uncanny X-Men.net|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref>

===Mollifest Destiny===

In ''Runaways'' #10, the Runaways travel to [[San Francisco]] after Molly receives [[Emma Frost]]'s psychic message inviting all mutants to a new safe Haven. Molly's non-stop chatter quickly annoys several of the X-Men and Wolverine gives her a tour of the X-Men's new base of operations. Molly begins to annoy Wolverine and the two argue until he insults Molly's parents and calls her a brat, causing her to throw him through the roof.<ref name=run#10>''Runaways'' #10 (May 2009)</ref>

Wolverine is urged by Cyclops and Emma Frost to take Molly outside, and complies. The two tour San Francisco before they are kidnapped by a villain that was an enemy of the Pride. The villain and his soldiers had attempted to claim a portion of Los Angeles, although the Hayes stopped him, massacring his men and putting him in a traumatizing seven-year coma where he could not close his eyes, all for their own [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] enjoyment. He recovered and seeks revenge against them by telling Molly her parents were evil and sadistic, having killed innocent people and children.  He calls them far worse than any super villain, and ultimately plans on killing her as his final act of revenge.  Wolverine and Molly manage to defeat him, though Molly realizes she'll never think of her parents the same way again. She is, however, comforted by Wolverine, who says that despite their villainous ways, her parents must have genuinely loved her in order to "raise a kid as good as her."<ref name=run#10/>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Molly's mutant power was [[superhuman strength]], with which she has toppled a giant monster bigger than [[skyscraper]]s, tunneled through miles of rock, and broken solid objects over her head. However, Molly was only able to use her powers for a limited amount of time before she became fatigued and fell asleep. When she first used her powers, Molly fell asleep after only throwing one punch, but as the series continued, Molly has been able to use her powers for increasingly longer periods of time and to greater extremes without tiring. Nico once used the Staff of One to give Molly a caffeine rush while fighting a giant monster to keep her awake longer.

Molly was later revealed to have [[List of comic book superpowers#invulnerability|invulnerability]] as well, as evident when a member of [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|the Wrecking Crew]] smashes his enchanted shovel over Molly's head, causing the shovel to crack into pieces. Despite the fact Molly's mutation is entirely different from her telepathic parents, her eyes still glow a violet-pink when using her powers, just like her parents.

Molly's strength has failed her on two occasions - she wasn't able to punch the adamantium armor of a Doctor Doombot, and she wasn't able to get out of Leslie Dean's unbreakable Majesdanian bonds.

===Hidden intellect?===
Throughout the series, Molly's been implied to have some hidden intellect, and is implied to be very manipulative.

In the first volume of Runaways, the Deans and Hayes wonder who the mole could be. The Deans believe it could be their own daughter, but the Hayes scoff at the idea and are adamant that Molly is the mole. The two believe that Molly only pretends to be dumb, but may in fact actually be very intelligent - why she hides her supposed intelligence wasn't revealed. Not too long after, it was implied Molly knew that [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] was really [[Geoffrey Wilder]]. She was also able to tell Xavin a better way to use her force field power, figures out Chase and Old Lace could be alive after being shot at on a rooftop, and correctly predicts Chase will return to 1907 with Fistigons to save them, and cures the zombified Los Angelinos. Molly also tells Klara playing dumb is much easier, because that way, no one knows your real potential. 

Perhaps the most notable instance was when Geoffrey kidnaps Molly. After tying her to a chair with unbreakable binds, Molly begs him to let her go. Geoffrey snaps at her, and tells her to stop playing dumb because "the others aren't around." Molly immediately drops the innocent act, and darkly counters, "Fine. But just so you know, your son was a failure - just like you." Geoffrey is satisfied.

==Reception==
In 2009, Molly was named the fourth (out of ten) toughest female in the [[Marvel Universe]], after [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[She-Hulk]] and [[Ms. Marvel]].<ref name="take10girlpower">{{cite news|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.6773|title=Take 10: Girl Power|first=Secret Cabal|date=2009-02-04|publisher=Marvel|accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> In 2008, Marvel.com's list of ten best teen heroes featured Molly as a hypothetical number eleven, citing her too-young age as the reason she could not be on the regular list.<ref name="take10teenheroes">{{cite news|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.2722.Take_10~colon~_Teen_Heroes|title=Take 10: Teen Heroes|last=Morse|first=Ben|date=2008-06-05|publisher=Marvel|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> In 2007, the Runaways made the list at number five of ten for best teams, citing the best Runaway's moment was when Molly and Victor made their version of the X-Men's "[[Fastball Special]]".<ref name="take102007'stopteams">{{cite news|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.2247.Take_10~colon~_2007~apos~s_Top_Teams|title=Take 10: 2007's Top Teams|last=Morse|first=Ben|date=2008-06-05|publisher=Marvel|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>

==Relationships==
Although Molly enjoys being independent and a superhero, she is still a pre-adolescent girl who wants to have fun.  Most of her close relationships are based on who is willing to spend the most time playing with her.  Molly also has a tendency throughout the series to gravitate towards people that she can look up to as a big sibling.

===[[Chase Stein]]===
In the beginning of the series, Molly and Chase engage in a big brother/little sister relationship: they bicker, call each other names, and horse around.  Chase always stands up to protect Molly.  As the series progresses, Chase and Molly grow apart, primarily due to his romantic involvement with [[Gertrude Yorkes|Gert]]. In issues #18-#24 of volume 2, Chase distances himself from Molly and the rest of the Runaways to deal with his grief over Gert's death.  However, in the ''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' miniseries, Chase expresses jealousy over Molly's growing attachment to [[Speed (comics)|Speed]].  Though they are not as close as before, Chase and Molly's relationship seems to have been repaired after Chase moved past grieving for Gert.

===[[Victor Mancha]]===
Molly meets Victor when the Runaways abduct him from his high school, hoping to preempt the prophecy that Victor will one day kill the Earth's heroes.  Molly adjusts rather quickly to Victor's addition to the team; she spends more time off the battlefield with Victor than most, playing board games with him and pairing up to go shopping. During one of their trips, it's revealed that [[Nico Minoru|Nico]] has ordered Molly to "babysit" Victor, because she is the only individual member strong enough to take Victor down if he goes haywire. Molly tells Victor that she's not particularly scared of him, and is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt regarding his supposed future. Victor surmises that Molly is simply using flattery to get him to buy her favorite cereal, but since she treats him as an equal and consistently spends time with him, he concludes that Molly was not just "sucking up." As Molly's relationship with Chase deteriorated, her relationship with Victor grew stronger.

===[[Xavin]]===
Though Xavin was initially hostile towards all the Runaways (except [[Karolina Dean|Karolina]]) he has shown a great amount of concern for Molly's well-being. He returned to Earth with Karolina after their failed wedding as the Runaways were attempting to locate Molly after she was abducted by the second Pride; Xavin immediately volunteered to help the search efforts to locate "the hatchling." Xavin is another one of Molly's frequent board game partners; during one of their gaming sessions, Molly expressed her discomfort with Xavin constantly shifting between forms and said that most of the team felt the same way. Despite this, Xavin still fought the Gibborim without hesitation to protect the team, after which Molly admitted that Xavin's consistent selflessness more than makes up for the shapeshifting. The two now share a close camaraderie.

===[[Gertrude Yorkes]]===
During the series, Gert was a quasi-role model for Molly.  Gert was usually the one that Molly asked most of her questions to and they were normally paired together to guard the Hostel and their getaway car.  When Gert was killed at the hands of Geoffrey Wilder, Molly spent time sitting in front of a photo of Gert in the new Hostel's photo wall.  Molly would talk to Gert as if she were really there.  She also asked the Leapfrog if Gert went to Heaven (although it was unable to answer because "Heaven" was not on any of the Leapfrog's maps). In at least one instance, Molly seems to gain specific information from an unknown voice only she can hear, which she assumed to be the voice of Gert; in reality it was the voice of Alex Wilder, in an attempt to redeem himself and escape [[Limbo]].

===[[Klara Prast]]===
When they travel to the past, Karolina introduced Molly to a girl in distress named Klara, to help reach out to her because they are closer in age. Molly invites her to join the team, and together they manage to convince her to come with them to escape her tragic fate of being married to an abusive husband (the graver physically and possibly sexually abusive aspects of which Molly does not fully seem to understand due to her comparatively sheltered life). When Klara is upset by Karolina's seemingly interracial lesbian relationship, it causes a rift between her and Molly, as Molly defends Karolina and cannot relate to Klara's homophobic and racist attitudes, a result of her upbringing. Klara is visibly saddened by the confrontation (her emotions reflected in her roses) and leaves. Later, she returns, beaten by her husband, and the team accepts her back.  While the two girls have very different personalities, with Molly feeling young compared to Klara who has weathered a lot of difficulties in her life, they remain close.
