'''Molly Hayes''', sometimes known as '''Bruiser''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], and a member of [[Runaways (comics)|the Runaways]] who first appeared in ''Runaways'' vol. 1 #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Molly Hayes is a 12-year-old [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the abilities of superhuman strength and nigh-invulnerability. Her parents, Gene and Alice Hayes, are  a [[Physician|doctor]] and a [[speech therapist]], who are secretly telepathic mutants and members of a crime organization called the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]. She has numerous cute animal hats and a fondness for "Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs", a cereal from the ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' [[comic strip]].  Molly is also a fan of the mutant singer [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]].

When the other children of the Pride witness their parents' murdering a girl as part of a ritual sacrifice, they run away from home, determined to defy their evil legacy. They attempt to rescue Molly from her parents, and in the scuffle, she discoverse her mutant powers. Molly admires other mutant superheroes such as the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Statix]], and she sleeps with a [[Doop (comics)|Doop]] doll. She makes a superhero costume and declares her codename to be "Princess Powerful", but [[Chase Stein]] calls her "Bruiser". 

Molly possesses superhuman strength and near invulnerability, and whenever she uses her powers, Molly's eyes gain a purplish pink glow that spreads across her entire body when she gets pumped up. Initially, Molly becomes extremely tired after she uses her strength and falls asleep but becomes capable of using her powers for extended periods of time without requiring sleep afterward. Among Molly's feats of strength are lifting a 60-meter-tall monster and tearing [[Cloak (comics)|Cloak's]] supposedly irremovable cape from his body.

Molly and her friends are split up by [[California]] [[Social Services]] after their parents' deaths, and Molly stays at a local branch of [[X-Corp]]. [[Karolina Dean]] organizes a reunion, and the teenagers escape their new homes to regroup and fight the supervillains that fill the power vacuum in the Los Angeles crime world caused by their parents' departure.

Molly has a crush on [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] until he threatens her and she throws him out of a building. After this encounter, the [[X-Men]] try to take Molly to the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]] to train. The two teams fight until [[Emma Frost]] decides they shouldn't force someone to come with them against their will. Later, Molly is knocked unconscious and wakes to find that she has been kidnapped by the Provost, who uses children to commit thefts. Molly organizes her fellow captives, defeats the Provost, and returns home. After [[Gertrude Yorkes]] is killed, Molly convinces the group's transport, the Leapfrog, to say that Gert is in Heaven. In the wake of Gert's death, Chase, who usually acts like a big brother toward Molly, becomes withdrawn; he is jealous, however, when [[Speed (comics)|Speed]] of the [[Young Avengers]] plays with Molly in much the same way<ref>''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'' #2</ref>

==Trivia==
*Brian K. Vaughan named Molly after his younger sister.
