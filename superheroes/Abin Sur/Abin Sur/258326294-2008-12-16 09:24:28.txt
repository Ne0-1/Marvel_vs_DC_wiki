'''Abin Sur''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[superhero]] from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''Showcase'' #22 (September-October 1959): "SOS Green Lantern". He was a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and recruited Hal Jordan as a [[Green Lantern]].

==Fictional character biography==
Originally a history professor on the planet Ungara, Abin Sur is appointed [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lantern]] of [[List of Green Lanterns#Green Lanterns by Sectors of the Universe|Space Sector 2814]] in the mid 1860s.  As a child, he became best friends with Ruch Ehr and later, by association, Munni Jah.  The two of them were a couple and Abin secretly loved Munni, but never spoke overtly of this.

Recruited by the Green Lantern known as [[Starkaor]], he is known to have come to Earth on several occasions.  In the [[American Old West]], he teams up with an ancestor of [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]]'s to battle an alien named [[Traitor (Comics)|Traitor]] (who was responsible for the death of Starkaor).  During [[World War II]], he encounters [[Starman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Starman]] and [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl|Bulletman]] when the three battle an alien being under the control of [[Monster Society Of Evil|Mr. Mind]]. On a later visit, his ring's power i neutralized by the foe he was tracking.  He discovers the unconscious forms of [[Alan Scott]] and [[Jay Garrick]], and borrows Scott's slightly different ring.  He used it against his adversary, taking advantage of the ring's effectiveness against the color yellow. He also visits Earth at some point between the Golden and Silver Ages, when he encountered the [[Martian Manhunter]].

While on patrol, he is attacked and pursued by the being known as [[Legion (DC Comics)|Legion]] while on its way to [[Oa]].  Badly injured and with his [[starship|spaceship]] seriously damaged, he makes an emergency landing on the nearest [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]] ([[Earth]]).  Due to his injuries, Sur was aware that his death was inevitable and he uses his ring to search for a successor.  The first possibility was [[Superman|Clark Kent]]. Since he was not native to earth, he is not chosen. The next candidates were Hal Jordan and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]. As Jordan was closer, the ring chose him as the most suitable replacement right before Sur's death.

For a brief time during [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], he was pulled into the present, where he assists the [[Darkstars]] in their battle against [[Entropy (DC Comics)|Entropy]]. He is then returned to his own time.

In the afterlife Sur is able to help Jordan again when Jordan enters the realm of the death lord, [[Nekron|Nekron]]. Jorday is attempting to stop Nekron from entering the living universe and destroying it.  Jordan manages to incite the spirits of the deceased members of the Corps to destroy the god long enough for the Guardians to drive [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and his forces back and seal the portal.  Before the sealing was complete, Sur helpes his successor exit the realm while saying how proud he was of Jordan. Abin Sur later sacrifices his soul to assist the [[Swamp Thing]] in rescuing his infant daughter [[Tef√© Holland]] from the [[demon]] [[Nergal]] in [[Hell]]. 

It is later revealed that part of his soul was still being tortured in Hell while his spirit was acting as a companion to [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]] during his brief stint as the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].  Eventually, he frees his soul from Hell and assisted [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Jordan]] on several spiritual adventures and metaphysical dilemmas.  Eventually, Abin Sur engaged in the Karamm-Jeev Descent, an Ungaran form of reincarnation, and was reborn as Lagzia, daughter of Sur's old friends Ruch Ehr and Munni Jah.

During some point in his life, Abin sires a son, [[Amon Sur]], who grew up to become leader the Black Circle crime syndicate. Amon is angry at his deceased father for abandoning him for the Corps, and decides to take his anger out on all Green Lanterns.  Amon is eventually stopped by Hal Jordan's successor, [[Kyle Rayner]] and a second-generation Guardian of the Universe called [[Lianna (DC comics)|Lianna]].  Amon eventually has a confrontation with Hal Jordan himself, who had returned to his position as Green Lantern after being both resurrected and freed from the influence of [[Parallax]].  Hal defeats Amon, but Amon received a duplicate of Sinestro's ring from the Qwardians and vanishes.  After Hal finally took Abin's body home and buried it, a mysterious yellow light appears in the sky after Hal left.

During ''[[The Sinestro Corps War]],''  it is revealed that Abin discovered a prophecy concerning of the Multiverse and "[[Green Lantern: The Blackest Night|The Blackest Night]]" prior to his death. ''Green Lantern: Secret Origin'', reveals details of Abin's quest to learn more about The Blackest Night as he interrogated a group of demons who had foreseen the prophecy.  He learned that Earth is the birthplace of The Black: the antithesis of the emotional spectrum that the prophecy predicts will "one day consume all light and all life." <ref>Green Lantern #30 vol. 4</ref> He discovered that the prophecy foretells his own death, when his ring fails him in his time of greatest need.  He subsequently journeys to Earth in an effort to learn more about The Blackest Night, so that he might stop the prophecy's fulfillment.  During his quest, Abin Sur begins to lose his faith in his willpower and his ring, and begins to feel fear.  His weakened willpower results in his ring creating correspondingly weaker constructs, allowing his prisoner (the demon [[Atrocitus]] he captured on the planet Ysmault) to break free, attack him, and cause his ship to crash on Earth.  Abin Sur is critically injured in the crash, leading him to instruct his ring to seek out a successor - and the ring settles on Hal Jordan.

==Spaceship==
In the [[Silver age of comic books|Silver Age]] comics, as the abilities of Hal Jordan's power ring began to show it was capable of practical long range space travel, that raised the question of why Abin Sur needed a ship. 

===Pre-Crisis explanation=== 
In the story "Earth's First Green Lantern," Jordan revealed that he wondered that himself and asked  his ring to explain.

The ring told the story of how Abin Sur discovered a parasitic energy being species  that fed on sentient beings' "I-factor," a substance that enabled inventiveness, attacking civilizations and stalling their development.  Sur captured them to stop their destruction, but one of their number had escaped and vowed to free his brethren.  To do so, he tracked down Sur's planet and created a disaster to force him to appear to stop it.  Since Sur did not mask himself, the being recognized him immediately and followed him to his home.  As Sur neglected to charge his ring before going to sleep, he was unable to stop the being from taking control of him.

With the being in control of his body and about to force him to go and free his fellows, Sur tricked the being into thinking that he would not be able to do so because the ring would be low on power after the trip there while in reality the ring's charge is purely time based.  The being decided to have Sur take a ship to the destination, but before leaving, Sur managed to get a hold of his invisible power battery.  On the ship, Sur piloted the ship and waited until he moved into a green colored planetary [[radiation belt]] which allowed Sur to charge his ring without the being noticing.  Thus armed, Sur battled and captured the being.  However during the fight, the ship wandered into Earth's radiation belt.  With his ring useless, Sur lost control of the battered ship and crashed.  Mortally wounded, Sur sought out his replacement and drew Jordan to him.

According to Jordan, this account prompted him to keep a secret identity as a security precaution and to carefully navigate around Earth's radiation belts.

===Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] explanation=== 
In ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' Annual #2 (1986), writer [[Alan Moore]] answered the question with a story of how the [[hero]] once visited '''Ysmault''', a [[prison]] planet for an ancient race of [[demon]]s, the '''Empire of Tears''', vanquished millennia ago by the Oans. He was on a rescue mission and felt he could not wait for instruction from the Guardians.

While there, Abin Sur met a demon named '''Qull of the Five Inversions''', a [[humanoid]] with a gaping mouth in his chest and a tongue-shaped head, [[Crucifixion|crucified]] by three glowing spikes topped with the symbol of the Green Lantern Corps.  This unholy [[messiah]] predicted the hero would die when his power ring ran out of energy at a critical moment, while he was fighting an opponent or unprotected in hard [[vacuum]].  Abin Sur, worried by this [[prophecy]], began using a starship for interstellar voyages, as an additional safeguard. 

A decade later, fleeing his enemy, his spaceship collided with a girdle of [[yellow]] [[radiation]] around Earth that rendered his starship and his power-ring useless within moments.  Had he relied on his ring alone, he realized, he might have tested the planet's [[magnetosphere]] before rashly entering it.  Thus, while [[Legion (DC Comics)|Legion]] may have wounded him, it could be argued that it was Qull that was actually responsible for Abin Sur's death, having sown the seeds of doubt in the Green Lantern's mind.

===Post-[[Infinite Crisis]] explanation===
In the new ''Secret Origins'' of Green Lantern (''Green Lantern'' #30, 2008) Abin Sur's final fate was tweaked again, incorporating elements of the [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] impurity. Still forced to use a starship due to his growing fear of his impending death, he dies while escorting [[Atrocitus]], another prisoner of the [[Empire of Tears]], on Earth in his search for the ''Black Energies'' who he were foretold would bring on the ''[[Green Lantern: The Blackest Night|Blackest Night]]''. Atrocitus, caged in the starship, reawakens Abin Sur fears, allowing the ''yellow weakeness'' to seep into his constructs enough to weaken his restrains and be able to escape. While Atrocitus, successfully manages to free himself, Abin Sur is left to choose between a crash landing on Coast City, or a riskier one in the desert nearby. Abin Sur chooses sacrifice, and lands in the deserts. He dies of his wounds after warning [[Sinestro]], still a loyal Lantern at the time, and designating [[Hal Jordan]] as his successor.

==Other versions==
In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', Sur's spacecraft was the [[UFO]] that [[Roswell UFO Incident|crashed at Roswell]]. Sur died shortly after the crash, and it is mentioned that [[J. Edgar Hoover]] arranged for Sur and his ship to be hidden in [[Area 51]]. In [[1978]], [[John F. Kennedy]] arranges for [[Lex Luthor]] to be allowed to examine the wreckage to develop weapons to use against [[Superman]], in this setting the ruler of the [[Soviet Union]].
