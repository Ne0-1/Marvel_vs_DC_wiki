'''Abin Sur''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[superhero]] from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''Showcase'' #22 (September-October 1959): "SOS Green Lantern". He was a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and recruited Hal Jordan as a [[Green Lantern]].

==Fictional character biography==
Originally a history professor on the [[planet]] Ungara, Abin Sur was soon appointed [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lantern]] of [[List of Green Lanterns#Green Lanterns by Sectors of the Universe|Space Sector 2814]] in the mid [[1860s]].  As a child, he became best friends with Ruch Ehr and later, by association, Munni Jah.  The two of them were a couple and Abin secretly loved Munni, but never overtly spoke of this.

Recruited by the Green Lantern known as Starkaor, he is known to have come to Earth on several occasions.  In the [[American Old West]], he teamed up with an ancestor of [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]]'s to battle an alien named [[Traitor (Comics)|Traitor]] (who was responsible for the death of Starkaor).  During [[World War II]], he briefly encountered [[Starman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Starman]] and [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl|Bulletman]] when the three battled an alien being under the control of [[Monster Society Of Evil|Mr. Mind]]. On a later visit, his ring was immobilised by the foe he was tracking, but, after discovering [[Alan Scott]] and [[Jay Garrick]] (who had been knocked out by the foe), he borrowed Alan's ring and used it against his adversary, taking advantage of its lack of a yellow weakness. He also visited Earth at some point between the Golden and Silver Ages, when he encountered the [[Martian Manhunter]].

While on patrol, he was attacked and pursued by the being known as [[Legion (DC Comics)|Legion]] while on its way to [[Oa]].  Badly injured and with his [[starship|spaceship]] seriously damaged, he made an emergency landing on the nearest [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]] ([[Earth]]) and began using his power ring to search for a successor to wield the ring after he passed on. The first possibility was [[Superman|Clark Kent]]. Since he was not native to earth, he was not chosen. Next, Hal Jordan and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] were chosen. As Jordan was closer, the ring settled on [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]] as the most suitable replacement right before his death.

For a brief time during [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], he was pulled to the present, where he assisted the [[Darkstars]] in their battle against [[Entropy (DC Comics)|Entropy]] before being returned to his own time.

In the afterlife, Sur was able to help Jordan again when Jordan entered the realm of the death lord, [[Necron (comics)|Necron]], to stop his attempt to enter the living universe and destroy it.  Jordan managed to incite the spirits of the deceased members of the Corps to destroy the god long enough for the Guardians to drive [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and his forces back and seal the portal.  Before the sealing was complete, Sur helped his successor exit the realm while saying how proud he was of Jordan. Abin Sur later sacrificed his soul to assist the [[Swamp Thing]] in rescuing his infant daughter [[Tef√© Holland]] from the [[demon]] [[Nergal]] in [[Hell]]. It was later revealed that part of his very own soul was still being tortured in Hell while his spirit was acting as a companion to [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]] during his brief stint as the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].  Eventually, he freed himself from Hell and assisted [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Jordan]] on several spiritual adventures and metaphysical dilemmas.  Eventually, Abin Sur engaged in the Karamm-Jeev Descent, an Ungaran form of reincarnation, and was reborn as Lagzia, daughter of Sur's old friends Ruch Ehr and Munni Jah.

During some point in his life, Abin sired a son, [[Amon Sur]], who grew up to become the man in charge of the Black Circle crime syndicate. Amon was angry at his deceased father for abandoning him for the Corps and decided to take his anger out on all Green Lanterns.  Amon was eventually stopped by Hal Jordan's successor, [[Kyle Rayner]] and a second-generation Guardian of the Universe called [[Lianna (DC comics)|Lianna]].  Amon eventually had a confrontation with Hal Jordan himself, who returned to his Green Lantern role after being freed from the influence of Parallax.  Hal defeated the insane youth, but Amon received a duplicate of Sinestro's ring from the Qwardians and vanished.  After Hal finally took Abin's body home and buried it, a mysterious yellow light appeared in the sky after Hal left, presumbly Amon arriving to visit his father's grave.

During ''[[The Sinestro Corps War]],''  it is revealed that Abin discovered a prophecy concerning of the Multiverse and "The Blackest Night" prior his death.

==Spaceship==
In the [[Silver age of comic books|Silver Age]] comics, as the abilities of Hal Jordan's power ring began to show it was capable of practical long range space travel, that raised the question of why Abin Sur needed a ship. 

===Pre-Crisis explanation=== 
In the story "Earth's First Green Lantern," Jordan revealed that he wondered that himself and asked  his ring to explain.

The ring told the story of how Abin Sur discovered a parasitic energy being species  that fed on sapient beings' "I-factor," a substance that enabled inventiveness, attacking civilizations and stalling their development.  Sur captured them to stop their destruction, but one of their number had escaped and vowed to free his brethren.  To do so, he tracked down Sur's planet and created a disaster to force him to appear to stop it.  Since Sur did not mask himself, the being recognized him immediately and followed him to his home.  As Sur neglected to charge his ring before going to sleep, he was unable to stop the being from taking control of him.

With the being in control of his body and about to force him to go and free his fellows, Sur tricked the being into thinking that he would not be able to do so because the ring would be low on power after the trip there while in reality the ring's charge is purely time based.  The being decided to have Sur take a ship to the destination, but before leaving, Sur managed to get a hold of his invisible power battery.  On the ship, Sur piloted the ship and waited until he moved into a green colored planetary [[radiation belt]] which allowed Sur to charge his ring without the being noticing.  Thus armed, Sur battled and captured the being.  However during the fight, the ship wandered into Earth's radiation belt (which was apparently yellow colored in the Earth-1 universe).  With his ring useless, Sur lost control of the battered ship and crashed.  Mortally wounded, Sur sought out his replacement and drew Jordan to him.

According to Jordan, this account prompted him to keep a secret identity as a security precaution, to carefully navigate around Earth's radiation belts and presumably he made a point of usually keeping his ring charged to prevent similar sneak attacks.

===Post-Crisis explanation=== 
In ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' Annual #2 (1986), writer [[Alan Moore]] answered the question with a story of how the [[hero]] once visited '''Ysmault''', a [[prison]] planet for an ancient race of [[demon]]s, the '''Empire of Tears''', vanquished millennia ago by the Oans.   He was on a rescue mission and felt he could not wait for instruction from the Guardians, who likely could have warned the Lantern of the planet's inhabitants and their dangerous psychological manipulation powers.

While there, Abin Sur met a demon named '''Qull of the Five Inversions''', a [[humanoid]] with a gaping mouth in his chest and a tongue-shaped head, [[Crucifixion|crucified]] by three glowing spikes topped with the symbol of the Green Lantern Corps.  This unholy [[messiah]] predicted the hero would die when his power ring ran out of energy at a critical moment, while he was fighting an opponent or unprotected in hard [[vacuum]].  Abin Sur, worried by this [[prophecy]], began using a starship for interstellar voyages, as an additional safeguard. 

A decade later, fleeing his enemy, his spaceship collided with a girdle of [[yellow]] [[radiation]] around Earth that rendered his starship and his power-ring useless within moments.  Had he relied on his ring alone, he realized, he might have tested the planet's [[magnetosphere]] before rashly entering it.  Thus, while Legion may have wounded him, it could be argued that it was Qull that was actually responsible for Abin Sur's death, having sown the seeds of doubt in the Green Lantern's mind.

==In other media==
Abin Sur was featured in an animated episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' involving [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Sinestro]].  The episode was called "In Brightest Day", likely a nod to the Green Lantern Oath.

In the episode, Abin is used for Kyle's GL origin in much the same way he was used for [[Hal Jordan]]'s. Abin battles with Sinestro, who is hunting Green Lanterns and stealing their rings. He crashes his spaceship on earth and sends his ring off to find a suitable replacement just before his death. {{-}}
