'''Abin Sur''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[superhero]] from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''Showcase'' #22 (September-October 1959): "SOS Green Lantern". He was a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and recruited Hal Jordan as a [[Green Lantern]].

==Character Biography==
{{spoiler}}
Originally a history professor on the [[planet]] Ungara, Abin Sur was soon appointed [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lantern]] of [[Space Sector 2814]] in the mid 1860's.  As a child, he become best friends with Ruch Ehr and later, by association, Munni Jah.  The two of them were a couple and Abin secretly loved Munni, but never overtly spoke of this.

Recruited by the Green Lantern known as [[Starkaor]], he is known to have come to Earth on several occasions.  In the Old West, he teamed up with an ancestor of [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]]'s to battle an alien named [[Traitor (Comics)|Traitor]] (who was responsible for the death of Starkaor).  During [[World War Two]], he briefly encountered [[Starman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Starman]] and [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl|Bulletman]] when the three battled an alien being under the control of [[Monster Society Of Evil|Mr. Mind]].  He also visited Earth at some point between the Golden and Silver Ages, when he encountered the [[Martian Manhunter]].

While on patrol, he was attacked and pursued by the being known as [[Legion (DC Comics)|Legion]] while on its way to [[Oa]]. Badly injured and with his [[spaceship]] seriously damaged, he made an emergency landing on the nearest habitable planet ([[Earth]]) and began using his power ring to search for a successor to wield the ring after he passed on. The ring settled on [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]] as the most suitable replacement right before his death.

For a brief time during [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], he was pulled to the present, where he assisted the [[Darkstars]] in their battle against [[Entropy (DC Comics)|Entropy]] before being returned to his own time.

In the afterlife, Abin Sur assisted [[Swamp Thing]] in rescuing his daughter Tef√© from [[Hell]].  It was later revealed that part of his very own soul was being tortured in [[Hell]] while his spirit acting as a companion to [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]] during his brief stint as the Spectre.  Eventually, he freed himself from [[Hell]] and assisted [[Green Lantern#The Silver Age Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Jordan]] on several spiritual adventures and metaphysical dilemmas.  Eventually, Abin Sur engaged in the Karamm-Jeev Descent, an Ungaran form of reincarnation, and was reborn as Lagzia, the daughter of Sur's old friends Ruch Ehr and Munni Jah.

During some point in his life, Abin sired a son, Amon Sur, who grew up to become the man in charge of the Black Circle crime syndicate. Amon was angry at his deceased father for abandoning him for the Corps and decided to take his anger out on all Green Lanterns. Amon was eventually stopped by Abin's successor's successor, Kyle Rayner and a second-generation Guardian of the Universe called Lianna.

==Spaceship==
In ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps ANNUAL #2'' (1986), writer [[Alan Moore]] pointed out an odd discrepancy in Hal Jordan's origin story: why would Abin Sur, capable of flying through space on his own, need a spaceship? He answered this question with a story of how the [[hero]] once vistited '''Ysmault''', a [[prison]] planet for an ancient race of [[demon]]s, the '''Empire of Tears''', vanquished millennia ago by the Oans. 

While there, Abin Sur met a demon named '''Qull of the Five Inversions''', a [[humanoid]] with a gaping mouth in his chest and a tongue-shaped head, [[Crucifixion|crucified]] by three glowing spikes topped with the symbol of the Green Lantern Corps. This unholy [[messiah]] predicted the hero would die when his power ring ran out of energy at a critical moment, while he was fighting an opponent or unprotected in hard [[vacuum]]. Abin Sur, worried by this [[prophecy]], began using a starship for interstellar voyages, as an additional safeguard. 

A decade later, fleeing his enemy, his spaceship collided with a girdle of [[yellow]] [[radiation]] around Earth that rendered his starship and his power-ring useless within moments. Had he relied on his ring alone, he realized, he might have tested the planet's [[magnetosphere]] before rashly entering it. Thus, while Legion may have wounded him, it could be argued that it was Qull that was actually responsible for Abin Sur's death, having sown the seeds of doubt in the Green Lantern's mind.

==Other Media Appearances==
Abin Sur was featured in an animated episode of ''Superman Adventures'' with [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Sinestro]].  The episode was called "In Brightest Day."
