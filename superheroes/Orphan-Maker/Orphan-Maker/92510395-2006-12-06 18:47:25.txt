'''Orphan-Maker (Peter)''' is a fictional [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''X-Factor 1st. series #31''.

The full story behind the Orphan-Maker has yet to be revealed. Apparently, Peter was held captive in [[Mister Sinister]]'s "orphanage" for some purpose, but Mr. Sinister had instead decided that Peter was too uncontrollable and must be killed. Somehow, the mutant/cyborg [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]] discovered this and rescued Peter, making him into the first of her "Lost Boys (and Girls.)" Then, under Nanny's direction, Peter, as the Orphan-Maker, began to kill the parents of young mutants (and thus "orphaning" them)  and abducting them for Nanny.

===Powers===
Orphan-Maker is a mutant, but has yet to exhibit powers aside from those of his hi-tech battle suit. Also, he presumably has had his age frozen, so that he remains intellectually and physically a child.

===Battle Suit===
Orphan-Maker is highly resistant to most form of attack, and has certain reflective properties that allow him to deflect energy attacks such as [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' optic blasts. Orphan-Maker is equipped with large guns that fire destructive energies. When he was outfitted with his new armour the suit had the capability of forming guns out of its hands.
