'''The Flag-Smasher''' is the name used by two [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original was most often a foe of [[Captain America]] while other adversaries of the Flag-Smasher include The [[Punisher]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], The [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], The [[Liberteens]] and [[Deadpool]].

==Flag-Smasher (Karl Morgenthau)==

===Concept and creation===
[[Mark Gruenwald]] created Flag-Smasher as a character in the tradition of the [[Red Skull]]: a villain with a symbolic aspect that would make him a nemesis specifically for Captain America. Whereas the Red Skull symbolizes [[Nazism]], Flag-Smasher symbolizes [[anti-patriotism]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dwight Jon |last=Zimmerman |date=January 1988 |title=Mark Gruenwald |work=Comics Interview |issue=54 |page=14 |publisher=Fictioneer Books}}</ref>

===Fictional character biography===
The first Flag-Smasher was born Karl Morgenthau,<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update'' (2010) #1</ref> the son of a wealthy [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[banker]]-turned-[[diplomat]], in [[Berne|Bern, Switzerland]]. He wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and become a diplomat until his father was trampled to death in a riot at a [[Latveria]]n embassy. He came to believe that humanity needed to do away with the concept of countries and nationalism that made people feel superior to those of different nationalities.

The Flag-Smasher uses [[terrorism]] to spread [[anti-nationalist]] sentiment. He conducts a one-man terrorist campaign in New York City against nationalist symbols, and holds hundreds as hostages until he is captured by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #312</ref> He founds [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], the '''U'''nderground '''L'''iberated '''T'''otally '''I'''ntegrated '''M'''obile '''A'''rmy '''T'''o '''U'''nite '''M'''ankind. He serves as the Supreme Commander of the anti-nationalistic terrorist organization. With ULTIMATUM, he hijacks an American airliner, holds its passengers hostage, and demands the surrender of Captain America. His plot is thwarted by Captain America and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Captain America'' #321–322</ref>

The Flag-Smasher later learns that the [[Red Skull]] was funding ULTIMATUM. He survives assassination attempts by ULTIMATUM, and captures the current [[U.S. Agent|Captain America]], John Walker. The Flag-Smasher teams with Captain America, [[Battlestar (comics)|Battle Star]], and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition-Man]] in thwarting an ULTIMATUM plot to set off a worldwide electromagnetic pulse that would render all electrically operated machinery useless, feeling that completing such an operation using funding provided by a national symbol such as the Red Skull would compromise his own integrity.<ref>''Captain America'' #348–349</ref>

The Flag-Smasher again becomes head of ULTIMATUM, and attempts to supply American subversives with arms, but is thwarted by [[Moon Knight]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Marc Spector, Moon Knight'' #8–9</ref> He makes a new attempt to create anarchy in the United States through distribution of arms to malcontents, but is thwarted this time by the Punisher and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #5–6</ref>

The Flag-Smasher later captures an amnesiac Demolition-Man, but during a battle with U.S. Agent he falls into the Arctic Ocean.<ref>''Captain America'' #400</ref> [[Roxxon Oil]] turned him into a berserker with super-strength,{{issue|date=October 2013}} but he later lost these powers.{{issue|date=October 2013}}

The Flag-Smasher was installed as the ruler of [[Rumekistan]] by the V-Battalion as a compromise between powers.<ref>''[[Citizen V]] & The V-Battalion: The Everlasting''</ref> It was later revealed that the Flag-Smasher was allegedly assassinated by Domino as part of a series of events which installed [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] as leader of that nation.<ref>[[Cable & Deadpool]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=3424 |title=10 Years! |publisher=UncannyXmen.Net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The Flag-Smasher is an athletic man who is a gifted hand-to-hand combatant with great proficiency in the martial art of ''[[Shotokan|shotokan karate-do]].'' He is also a brilliant terrorist strategist, and has fluency in English, French, German, Russian, Italian, Japanese, and [[Esperanto]].

[[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]] personnel have supplied him with a number of weapons and other devices, including a flame-throwing pistol, a teargas gun, a spiked mace, a shield, jet-propelled skis used for flight, teleportation devices, submarines, and rocket-propelled hovercrafts.

==Flag-Smasher (Guy Thierrault)==
Following the assassination of the original Flag-Smasher, [[Canadian]] ULTIMATUM agent Guy Thierrault assumed the role to continue the spread of anti-nationalism agenda.<ref>''Civil War Files'' one-shot</ref><ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' (vol. 2) #4</ref><ref>''Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul'' one-shot</ref> During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] story arc, he attacks the [[Third Street Promenade|Santa Monica Farmers' Market]] to show his opposition to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Super-Human Registration Act]], but is defeated by [[Runaways (comics)|The Runaways]].<ref>''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'' #1</ref>

Later, a fight is described between the Flag-Smasher and [[Anya Corazon|Araña]]. Flag-Smasher strikes Araña with his mace, but is later defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''[[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]: The Oath''</ref> He is next seen being described as the ''new'' Flag-Smasher.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]] Annual'' #1</ref>

After this he was seen fighting against [[Liberteens]], but was defeated and imprisoned.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1</ref> Flag-Smasher then returned and launched an attack on a New York diner, where Nomad (Rikki Barnes) was having a chat with her friend John. The explosion caused John to get hurt, and Rikki quickly put on her new Nomad uniform to fight the Flag-Smasher, who was now wearing a similar suit to the original Flag-Smasher. The [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and his "sidekick" Redwing helped Nomad defeat the Flag-Smasher, who was again arrested and jailed.<ref>''[[Nomad: Girl Without a World]]'' #2</ref>

Flag-Smasher later kidnapped a Middle Eastern banker, but was confronted by the new [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], [[Flash Thompson]]. Venom then succumbed to his [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]'s murderous tendencies.  After killing Flag-Smasher's cohorts, he then bit off Flag-Smasher's right arm.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #654.1 (February 2011)</ref>

After an ULTIMATUM [[helicarrier]] is infiltrated and many of its members are slaughtered by Deadpool,<ref>''Deadpool'' #23</ref> Flag-Smasher confronts, and is defeated by Deadpool, who orders him and his followers to stay away from the Merc and his daughter.<ref>''Deadpool'' #33</ref>

Flag-Smasher is later murdered by another ULTIMATUM member named Carl, who then takes on the mantle in order to achieve a vengeance against Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' #43</ref>

Eventually, this Flag-Smasher, along with all of the ULTIMATUM forces are slaughtered after attacking Deadpool a final time, thus ending ULTIMATUM and Flag-Smasher.<ref>''Deadpool'' #45</ref>
