'''Flag-Smasher''' is the name used by two [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The original was most often a foe of [[Captain America]] while other adversaries of the Flag-Smasher include [[Punisher|The Punisher]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], [[Runaways (comics)|The Runaways]], and The [[Liberteens]].

==History==
===Original===
Flag-Smasher was born in [[Berne|Bern, Switzerland]], the son of a wealthy [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[banker]]-turned-[[diplomat]]. He wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and become a diplomat until his father was trampled to death in a riot at a [[Latveria]]n embassy. He came to believe that humanity needed to do away with the concept of countries and nationalism that made people feel superior to those of different nationalites.

Today, Flag-Smasher uses [[terrorism]] to spread anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment. He founded [[Ultimatum (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], the Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind. [[Roxxon Oil]] turned him into a berserker with super-strength, but he later lost these powers.

During the events of ''[[Citizen V]] & The V-Battalion: The Everlasting'', Flag-Smasher was installed as the ruler of Rumekistan by the V-Battalion as a compromise between powers.  In a recent story-arc of [[Cable & Deadpool]], Flag-Smasher was allegedly assassinated by Domino as part of a series of events which installed [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] as leader of that nation.[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=3424]

==New Flag-Smasher==
The Flag-Smasher character reappears in ''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'' #1, though the ''Civil War Files'' one-shot confirms that this is not the original but an an impostor. He attacks the [[Third Street Promenade|Santa Monica Farmers' Market]] to show his opposition to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Super-Human Registration Act]], but is defeated by [[Runaways (comics)|The Runaways]].

In the mini-series, ''[[Dr. Strange]]: The Oath'', a fight is described between Flag-Smasher and [[Araña]].

The Flag-Smasher character next appears in the ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]] Annual'' #1, where he is described as the ''new'' Flag-Smasher.
