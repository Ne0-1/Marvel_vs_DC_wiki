'''The Flag-Smasher''' is the name used by two [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Flag-Smasher (ULTIMATUM)==
===Fictional character biography===
The Flag-Smasher was born in [[Berne|Bern, Switzerland]], the son of a wealthy [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[banker]]-turned-[[diplomat]]. He wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and become a diplomat until his father was trampled to death in a riot at a [[Latveria]]n embassy. He came to believe that humanity needed to do away with the concept of countries and nationalism that made people feel superior to those of different nationalities.

In modern times, the Flag-Smasher uses [[terrorism]] to spread [[anti-nationalist]] sentiment. He conducted a one-man terrorist campaign in New York City against nationalist symbols, and held hundreds as hostages until he was eventually captured by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #312</ref>

He founded [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], the '''U'''nderground '''L'''iberated '''T'''otally '''I'''ntegrated '''M'''obile '''A'''rmy '''T'''o '''U'''nite '''M'''ankind. He served as the Supreme Commander of the anti-nationalistic terrorist organization. With ULTIMATUM, he hijacked an American airliner and held its passengers hostage. He demanded the surrender of Captain America for execution in return for the hostages' freedom.  His plot was thwarted by Captain America and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Captain America'' #321-322</ref>

The Flag-Smasher later learned that the [[Red Skull]] was funding ULTIMATUM.  He survived assassination attempts by ULTIMATUM, and captured the current [[U.S. Agent|Captain America]], John Walker. The Flag-Smasher teamed with Captain America, [[Battlestar (comics)|Battle Star]], and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition-Man]] in thwarting an ULTIMATUM plot to set off a worldwide electromagnetic pulse that would render all electrically operated machinery useless.<ref>''Captain America'' #348-349</ref>

The Flag-Smasher again became head of ULTIMATUM, and attempted to supply American subversives with arms, but was thwarted by [[Moon Knight]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Marc Spector, Moon Knight'' #8-9</ref> He made a new attempt to create anarchy in the United States through distribution of arms to malcontents, but was thwarted this time by the Punisher and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #5-6</ref>

The Flag-Smasher later captured an amnesiac Demolition-Man, but during a battle with USAgent he fell into the Arctic Ocean.<ref>''Captain America'' #400</ref>

[[Roxxon Oil]] turned him into a berserker with super-strength, but he later lost these powers.  

The Flag-Smasher was installed as the ruler of Rumekistan by the V-Battalion as a compromise between powers<ref>''[[Citizen V]] & The V-Battalion: The Everlasting''</ref>. It was later revealed that the Flag-Smasher was allegedly assassinated by Domino as part of a series of events which installed [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] as leader of that nation<ref>[[Cable & Deadpool]]</ref>.[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=3424]

===Powers and abilities===
The Flag-Smasher is an athletic man who is a gifted hand-to-hand combatant with great proficiency in the martial art of ''[[shotokan karate-do]].'' He is also a brilliant terrorist strategist, and has fluency in English, French, German, Russian, Italian, Japanese, and [[Esperanto]].

[[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]] personnel have supplied him with a number of weapons and other devices, including a flame-throwing pistol, a tear-gas gun, a spiked mace, jet-propelled skis used for flight, teleportation devices, submarines, and rocket-propelled hovercrafts.

==Flag-Smasher (Civil War)==
A new Flag-Smasher appears,<ref>''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'' #1</ref> though it is later confirmed that this is not the original but an impostor.<ref>''Civil War Files'' one-shot</ref> He attacks the [[Third Street Promenade|Santa Monica Farmers' Market]] to show his opposition to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Super-Human Registration Act]], but is defeated by [[Runaways (comics)|The Runaways]].

Later, a fight is described between the Flag-Smasher and [[Araña]].<ref>''[[Dr. Strange]]: The Oath''</ref>  He is next seen being described as the ''new'' Flag-Smasher.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]] Annual'' #1</ref>

After this he was seen fighting against [[Liberteens]], but was defeated and imprisoned.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} Flag-Smasher then returned and launched an attack on a New York diner, where Nomad (Rikki Barnes) was having a chat with her friend John. The explosion caused John to get hurt, and Rikki quickly put on her new Nomad uniform to fight the Flag-Smasher, who was now wearing a similar suit to the original Flag-Smasher. The Falcon and his "sidekick" Redwing helped Nomad defeat the Flag-Smasher, who was again arrested and jailed. .<ref>''[[Nomad: Girl Without A World]]'' #2</ref>
