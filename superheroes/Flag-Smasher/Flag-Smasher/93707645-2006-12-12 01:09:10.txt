'''Flag-Smasher''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He has most often been a foe of [[Captain America]].  Other adversaries include [[the Punisher]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Ghost Rider]], and [[Runaways (comics)|The Runaways]].

==History==
Flag-Smasher is the son of a wealthy [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[banker]]-turned-[[diplomat]]. He wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and become a diplomat until his father was trampled to death in a riot at a [[Latveria]]n embassy. He came to believe that humanity needed to do away with the concept of countries and nationalism that made people feel superior to those of different nationalites.

Today, Flag-Smasher uses [[terrorism]] to spread anti-[[nationalist]] sentiment. He founded [[Ultimatum (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], the Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind. [[Roxxon|Roxxon Oil]] turned him into a berserker with super-strength, but he later lost these powers.

During the events of ''[[Citizen V]] & The V-Battalion: The Everlasting'', Flag-Smasher was installed as the ruler of Rumekistan by the V-Battalion as a compromise between powers.  In a recent story-arc of [[Cable & Deadpool]], Flag-Smasher was assassinated by Domino as part of a series of events which installed [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] as leader of that nation.[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=3424]

==Civil War==
Flag-Smasher reappears in ''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'' #1, though the ''Civil War Files'' one-shot describes him as an imposter. He attacks the [[Third Street Promenade|Santa Monica Farmers' Market]] to show his opposition to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Super-Human Registration Act]], but is defeated by [[Runaways (comics)|The Runaways]].

The mini-series, ''[[Dr. Strange]]: The Oath'' describes a fight between Flag-Smasher and [[Ara√±a]], but doesn't specify if it is the original Flag-Smasher or an imposter.
