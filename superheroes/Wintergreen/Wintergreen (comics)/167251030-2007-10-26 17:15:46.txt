'''William Randolph Wintergreen''', is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]] ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' comics. He was introduced in ''New Teen Titans'' #2 (Dec 1980) as the butler of [[Deathstroke]] the Terminator. In later issues, and Deathstroke's own title, it was revealed that Wintergreen was a former member of the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] who rescued Sgt Slade Wilson (the future Deathstroke) from a bomb, who in turn would rescue him from a [[Viet Cong]] prison.

Although Wintergreen did not have Deathstroke's abilities, he had more experience and often acted as his mentor. Since Deathstroke was devised as the criminal version of [[Batman]], Wintergreen was his counterpart to [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

When Deathstroke (temporarily) retired, Wintergreen honoured him by running Vigilance Inc., a search-and-rescue operation originally set up as a mercenary organization by Slade's ex-wife, Adeline. He was subsequently killed (and has his head mounted on a wall) when [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] took over Slade's body and attacked him. Although Jericho was in control of Slade, Wintergreen apparently had believed he would be murdered by Slade eventually, evidenced by his apparent last words of "I suppose it was only a matter of time."

==''Teen Titans'' animated series==
Wintergreen makes occasional appearances in ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]''. Unlike Slade, Wintergreen is never referred to by name; he is first seen in the episode "Divide and Conquer" when [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Cinderblock|Cinderblock]] delivers [[Plasmus]] to Slade. He is almost never seen out of his master's lair, except in "The Lost Episode" (which never aired on TV but was a promotional episode for [[Post Cereals]]) where he is part of the crowd running from [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Punk Rocket|Punk Rocket's]] Rock N' Roll rage, and in Season Five where he joins the [[Brotherhood of Evil]].
