'''William Randolph Wintergreen''', is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]] ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics.

==Fictional character biography==
He was introduced in ''New Teen Titans'' #2 (Dec 1980) as the butler of [[Deathstroke]] the Terminator. In later issues, and Deathstroke's own title, it was revealed that Wintergreen was a former member of the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] who rescued Sgt Slade Wilson (the future Deathstroke) from a bomb, who in turn would rescue him from a [[Viet Cong]] prison.

Although Wintergreen did not have Deathstroke's abilities, he had more experience and often acted as his mentor. Since Deathstroke was devised as the criminal version of [[Batman]], Wintergreen was his counterpart to [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

When Deathstroke (temporarily) retired, Wintergreen honoured him by running Vigilance Inc., a search-and-rescue operation originally set up as a mercenary organization by Slade's ex-wife, Adeline. He was subsequently killed (and has his head mounted on a wall) when [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] took over Slade's body and attacked him. Although Jericho was in control of Slade, Wintergreen apparently had believed he would be murdered by Slade eventually, evidenced by his apparent last words of "I suppose it was only a matter of time."

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Wintergreen was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], hunting down and attacking his former student.<ref>''Teen Titans'' Vol. 3 #77</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Wintergreen makes occasional appearances in ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]''. Unlike Slade, Wintergreen is never referred to by name. He is first seen in the episode "Divide and Conquer" when [[Cinderblock (comics)|Cinderblock]] delivers [[Plasmus]] to Slade. He is almost never seen out of his master's lair except in "The Lost Episode" (which never aired on TV but was a promotional episode for [[Post Cereals]]) where he is part of the crowd running from Punk Rocket's Rock N' Roll rage. He later pops up as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]].
