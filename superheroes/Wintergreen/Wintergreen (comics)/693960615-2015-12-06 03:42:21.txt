'''William Randolph Wintergreen''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
He was introduced in ''New Teen Titans'' #2 (Dec 1980) as the [[butler]] of [[Deathstroke]] the Terminator. In later issues, and Deathstroke's own title, it was revealed that Wintergreen was a former member of the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] who rescued Sgt Slade Wilson (the future Deathstroke) from a bomb, who in turn would rescue him from a [[Viet Cong]] prison.<ref>''New Teen Titans'' #2</ref>

Although Wintergreen did not have Deathstroke's abilities, he had more experience and often acted as his mentor. Since Deathstroke was devised as the criminal version of [[Batman]], Wintergreen was his counterpart to [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

When Deathstroke (temporarily) retired, Wintergreen honoured him by running Vigilance Inc., a search-and-rescue operation originally set up as a mercenary organization by Slade's ex-wife, Adeline. He was subsequently killed (and has his head mounted on a wall) when [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] took over Slade's body and attacked him. Although Jericho was in control of Slade, Wintergreen apparently had believed he would be murdered by Slade eventually, evidenced by his apparent last words of "I suppose it was only a matter of time."<ref>''Teen Titans'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Wintergreen was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], hunting down and attacking his former student.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #77</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Wintergreen makes occasional appearances in ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]''. Unlike Slade, Wintergreen is never referred to by name. He is first seen in the episode "Divide and Conquer" when [[Cinderblock (comics)|Cinderblock]] delivers [[Plasmus]] to Slade. He is almost never seen out of his master's lair except in "The Lost Episode" (which never aired on TV but was a promotional episode for [[Post Cereals]]) where he is part of the crowd running from Punk Rocket's Rock N' Roll rage. He later appeared as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], participated in the final battle against the Titans, and was frozen along with the most of the Brotherhood, once they were defeated.

* Wintergreen (known as '''Bill Wintergreen''') appears in the [[The CW Television Network|CW]] TV show ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', portrayed by stuntman Jeffrey C. Robinson. Wintergreen is a close friend of Slade Wilson, and the [[Godparent|godfather]] of his son, [[Jericho (comics)|Joe]], and like Slade is [[Australian]] (and is mentioned to be an [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] Agent and former member of [[Team 7 (comics)|Team-7]]). In this version, Wintergreen is as evenly skilled in swordsmanship, armed and unarmed combat and peak athletic as Slade is. In the fifth episode, "Damaged", Wintergreen (wearing the iconic Deathstroke mask) is part of mercenary unit led by [[Eddie Fyers|Edward Fyers]] to locate [[Yao Fei]] on the island, Lian-Yu. He is sent by Fyers to [[torture]] [[Oliver Queen]] over Yao-Fei's location at Fyer's tent, until Yao Fei launches a surprise attack and subdues Wintergreen. In "Year's End", Wintergreen rescues Fyers from Yao Fei's capture and bests the latter in combat. Up until episode thirteen "Betrayal" he is believed to be Deathstroke, until the appearance of Slade Wilson himself, in which he is explained to be Slade's former partner. It was revealed that both Slade and Bill were members of the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] who arrived on the island to rescue Yao Fei. After their plane is shot down by Fyers, Wintergreen defects to Fyers' side while Slade refused. In the fourteenth episode "The Odyssey", Wintergreen is stabbed in the eye by Slade, and seemingly killed.

===Video Games===
In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', Batman's profile on Deathstroke says that William Randolph Wintergreen is an associate of Slade.
