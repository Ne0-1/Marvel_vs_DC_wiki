'''W.R. Wintergreen''', is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]] ''[[Teen Titans ]]'' comics. He was introduced in ''New Teen Titans'' #2 (Dec 1980) as the butler of [[Deathstroke]] the Terminator. In later issues, and Deathstroke's own title, it was revealed that Wintergreen was a former member of the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] who rescued Sgt Slade Wilson (the future Deathstroke) from a bomb, and was in turn rescued from a [[Viet Cong]] prison by Wilson.

Although Wintergreen did not have Deathstroke's abilities, he had more experience and often acted as his mentor. Since Deathstroke was devised as the criminal version of [[Batman]], Wintergreen was his counterpart to [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

When Deathstroke (temporarily) retired, Wintergreen honoured him by running Vigilance Inc., a search-and-rescue operation originally set up as a mercenary organiation by Slade's ex-wife, Adeline. He was subsequently killed by [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] in Slade's body. 

==In the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]] animated series==
Unlike Slade, Wintergreen is never referred to by name; he is only seen in the episode "Divide and Conquer" when [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Cinderblock|Cinderblock]] delivers [[Plasmus]] to Slade. He is almost never seen out of his master's lair, except in "The Lost Episode" (which never aired on TV but was a promotional episode for Post Cereals) where he is part of the crowd running from Punk Rocket's Rock N' Roll rage, and in Season Five where he joins the [[Brotherhood of Evil]].
