'''William Randolph Wintergreen''', is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]] ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' comics. He was introduced in ''New Teen Titans'' #2 (Dec 1980) as the butler of [[Deathstroke]] the Terminator. In later issues, and Deathstroke's own title, it was revealed that Wintergreen was a former member of the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] who rescued Sgt Slade Wilson (the future Deathstroke) from a bomb, who in turn would rescue him from a [[Viet Cong]] prison.

Although Wintergreen did not have Deathstroke's abilities, he had more experience and often acted as his mentor. Since Deathstroke was devised as the criminal version of [[Batman]], Wintergreen was his counterpart to [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

When Deathstroke (temporarily) retired, Wintergreen honoured him by running Vigilance Inc., a search-and-rescue operation originally set up as a mercenary organization by Slade's ex-wife, Adeline. He was subsequently killed (and has his head mounted on a wall) when [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] took over Slade's body and attacked him. 

==''Teen Titans'' animated series==
Wintergreen makes occasional appearances in ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]''. Unlike Slade, Wintergreen is never referred to by name; he is first seen in the episode "Divide and Conquer" when [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Cinderblock|Cinderblock]] delivers [[Plasmus]] to Slade. He is almost never seen out of his master's lair, except in "The Lost Episode" (which never aired on TV but was a promotional episode for [[Post Cereals]]) where he is part of the crowd running from [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Punk Rocket|Punk Rocket's]] Rock N' Roll rage, and in Season Five where he joins the [[Brotherhood of Evil]].
