'''Hepzibah''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  She is a member of the intergalactic enforcers known as the [[Starjammers]] and currently a member of the [[Uncanny X-Men]].  She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #107 (October 1977) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
'''Hepzibah''' was born on the planet Tryl'sart, while under Shi'ar Imperial Rule. She had also spent some time in the prison on the planet Alsibar, where she met [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] (Christopher Summers) for the first time.

===The Starjammers===
While Corsair was imprisoned by the authority of the then Shi'ar Emperor [[D'Ken]], brother of [[Deathbird]] and [[Lilandra]] of the Royal House of Neramani, Hepzibah, with the help of several other prisoners who would later form the Starjammers (i.e., [[Raza Longknife]] and [[Ch'od]]), aided Corsair in their mutual escape from Shi'ar prison. Corsair won the respect of the trio (becoming their leader) and eventually the heart of Hepzibah, becoming her lover.

===Encounters with the X-Men===
Hepzibah and the [[Starjammers]] teamed up with X-Men on multiple occasions. In one such occurrence, Hepzibah and the Starjammers helped the [[New Mutants]] neutralize the threat of [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]]. Hepzibah also aided the Hulk in rescuing some of the Hulk's people from the alien forces of Troyjan. The [[Silver Surfer]] personally saved her life, an incident which led her to believe she simply intimidated the forces threatening her.

===The Rise and Fall of The Shi'ar Empire===
Recently, after Corsair reunited with his son Havok and the Starjammers participated in a conflict between Lilandra's and D'Ken's forces, Corsair was killed by his own son [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. Hepzibah raided the X-Men's stolen Shi'ar ship's weapons locker and was ready to take vengeance on Vulcan. However, she was forced to return with the repowered [[Professor Xavier]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] when [[Lilandra]], hoping to save her beloved Xavier from death and protect some of the X-Men (believing that the battle was not going well) locked the ship into a jump course for Earth. Consequently, Hepzibah, separated from her fellow Starjammers, is currently residing with the X-Men on Earth, with no foreseeable way to return to Shi'ar space to help the Starjammers and Lilandra continue to fight Vulcan.

===Member Of The X-Men===
Since she is stuck on Earth and has nowhere else to go, Hepzibah has joined Professor X's team of X-Men. She and Warpath have already created a bond of sorts, with Hepzibah remarking that his presence has helped her through her mourning of Corsair. Together, they confront one of the X-Mansion's guardian Sentinels when [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a long time X-Men ally, runs onto the grounds.

She is seen in an altered standard X-Uniform and entering the Morlock Tunnels alongide Warpath, Storm, and Caliban<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #488</ref>. As a group, they are attempting to discover the reason for the Morlocks' increased activity, which has included the capturing of X-Men ward [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]. Hepzibah, as a furred female with enhanced senses, has multiple problems with the sewers. Hepzibah's name has been written on a Morlock wall, along with the names of the other X-Men team members.

After the Morlock encounter, she speaks with Scott, who accepts her having Warpath as her new mate.

===World War Hulk===
Hepzibah is one of the X-Men who answers The Stepford Cuckoo's call for help when Hulk attacks Professor Xavier.

===Messiah Complex===
Hepizabah disables one of the giant robot ''O*N*E Sentinels'' after they become corrupted and attack the X-Mansion. Soon after she becomes a member of the new incarnation of [[X-Force]].

==Powers and abilities==
Relative to a human, Hepzibah possesses enhanced agility, speed, reflexes, coordination, balance, hyper-keen senses, and night vision. Mephitisoids also have retractable claws, and the ability to generate mind/mood-altering pheromones.

Hepzibah is a brilliant natural athlete and skilled hand-to-hand combatant. She is also an expert marksman, and is knowledgeable in the operation of a wide variety of ship-sized weaponry.

===Appearance===
As a member of the Mephisitoid race, Hepzibah's features resemble that of a humanoid cat, with her fur having the colors and markings of an earth skunk. She was originally apparently a homage to [[Miss Mam'selle Hepzibah]] from the comic strip, [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]],<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hepzibah Marvel Comics bio]</ref> but her character was later changed to a more catgirlesque appearance.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Most recently, she has inexplicably lost her feline heavily furred appearance and black coloring, along with her feline ears (originally on the top of her head), and is currently depicted incorrectly as more [[elven]] in appearance, with white fur, no black coloring, and pointed elf-like ears.
