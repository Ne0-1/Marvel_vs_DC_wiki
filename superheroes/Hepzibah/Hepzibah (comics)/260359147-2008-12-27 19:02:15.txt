'''Hepzibah''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  She is a member of the intergalactic enforcers known as the [[Starjammers]] and currently a member of the [[Uncanny X-Men]].  She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #107 (October 1977) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
'''Hepzibah''' was born on the planet Tryl'sart, while under [[Shi'Ar]] Imperial Rule. She had also spent some time in the prison on the planet Alsibar, where she met [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] (Christopher Summers) for the first time.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #15</ref>

===The Starjammers===
While Corsair was imprisoned by the authority of the then Shi'Ar Emperor [[D'Ken]], brother of [[Deathbird]] and [[Lilandra]] of the Royal House of Neramani, Hepzibah, with the help of several other prisoners who would later form the space pirate [[Starjammers]] (i.e., [[Raza Longknife]] and [[Ch'od]]), aided Corsair in their mutual escape from Shi'Ar prison. Corsair won the respect of the trio (becoming their leader) and eventually the heart of Hepzibah, becoming her lover.

===Encounters with the X-Men===
Hepzibah and the Starjammers teamed up with X-Men on multiple occasions. The first time, the Starjammers came to the aid of the X-Men against D'Ken's [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #107</ref> Later, with the other Starjammers, she fought of an alien attack on the ''HMSS Starjammer'' starship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #156</ref> After that, she helped save [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s life in outer space, and then engaged in mock combat with [[Carol Danvers]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #157-158</ref> Hepzibah and the Starjammers helped the [[New Mutants]] neutralize the threat of the [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]]. <ref>''New Mutants'' #50</ref>

Together with Ch'Od, she sought the "map-rod" holding information on the location of the "Phalkon" power source.  The Phalkon turned out to be the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]].  She and the Starjammers were attacked by [[Deathbird]]'s Shi'Ar starships.  With the other Starjammers, she first met [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] on Earth and aided a rebellion against Deathbird on a Shi'Ar border world.<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On: Starjammers'' #1-2</ref>

Later, she was captured by [[Skrull|Warskrulls]] and impersonated by one of them, until she was freed by the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275-277</ref>

===Other encounters===
During the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree/Shi'ar War]], she battled [[Wonder Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]] while escorting the Shi'Ar nega-bomb to the [[Kree]] Empire.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #8</ref> With Raza, she accepted an assignment from the former Kree admiral to kill the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].  With the Starjammers, she visited the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Ms. Marvel|Binary]] on Earth.  She was thwarted in her attempt to poison the Black Knight, and the plan was foiled.  She then returned with the Starjammers to the Shi'Ar Empire.<ref>''Avengers'' #350-351</ref>

Hepzibah also aided the Hulk in rescuing some of the Hulk's people from the alien forces of Troyjan. The [[Silver Surfer]] personally saved her life, an incident which led her to believe she simply intimidated the forces threatening her.

===The Rise and Fall of The Shi'Ar Empire===
After Corsair reunited with his son Havok and the Starjammers participated in a conflict between Lilandra's and D'Ken's forces, Corsair was killed by his own son [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. Hepzibah raided the X-Men's stolen Shi'Ar ship's weapons locker and was ready to take vengeance on Vulcan. However, she was forced to return with the repowered [[Professor Xavier]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] when [[Lilandra]], hoping to save her beloved Xavier from death and protect some of the X-Men (believing that the battle was not going well) locked the ship into a jump course for Earth. Consequently, Hepzibah, separated from her fellow Starjammers, is currently residing with the X-Men on Earth, with no foreseeable way to return to Shi'Ar space to help the Starjammers and Lilandra continue to fight Vulcan.

===Member of the X-Men===
Since she is stuck on Earth and has nowhere else to go, Hepzibah has joined Professor X's team of X-Men. She and Warpath have already created a bond of sorts, with Hepzibah remarking that his presence has helped her through her mourning of Corsair. Together, they confront one of the X-Mansion's guardian Sentinels when [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a long time X-Men ally, runs onto the grounds.

She is seen in an altered standard X-Uniform and entering the Morlock Tunnels alongside Warpath, Storm, and Caliban<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #488</ref>. As a group, they are attempting to discover the reason for the Morlocks' increased activity, which has included the capturing of X-Men ward [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]. Hepzibah, as a furred female with enhanced senses, has multiple problems with the sewers. Hepzibah's name has been written on a Morlock wall, along with the names of the other X-Men team members.

After the Morlock encounter, she speaks with Scott, who accepts her having Warpath as her new mate.

===World War Hulk===
Hepzibah is one of the X-Men who answers the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]' call for help when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks Professor Xavier.

===Messiah Complex===
Hepzibah disables one of the giant robot [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E]] [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] after they become corrupted and attack the X-Mansion. Soon after, she becomes a member of the new incarnation of [[X-Force]]. After checking a Cooperstown Hospital for [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], they track him to the Canadian wilderness where the team gets into a fight with the newly re-formed [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. When Caliban is killed, Warpath becomes overprotective of Hepzibah telling her this isn't her fight only to be told off by her and later Wolverine.

Later, X-Force tracks the mutant child to Muir Island where it is being guarded by the Acolytes and the Marauders. They manage to hold them off for sometime when the rest of the X-Teams arrive. When the New X-Man [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] teleports [[Predator X]] to the island, Cyclops orders X-Force to take it out. Hepzibah throws some bombs at it which don't do anything; Predator X turns around and spays her with acid hurting her arm. She is later seen standing around Professor X's body.

===Divided We Stand===
Archangel goes to [[San Francisco, California]], to meet up with Hepzibah, [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. All four are caught in the effects of a city-wide illusion created by [[Martinique Jason]], who, thanks to her powers has transformed the city into a [[hippie]] paradise.  Jason sends Hepzibah, now calling herself "Lady Kitten," and the others to confront Cyclops and Emma Frost.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #498</ref>

===Manifest Destiny===
Hepzibah relocates with the X-Men to San Francisco. Her most recent appearance features her thinking she doesn't know how to operate a telephone when the reality is that Warpath just wants to hear her voice and doesn't know how to talk to her after the things he's done.<ref>''X-Force'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Relative to a human, Hepzibah possesses enhanced agility, speed, reflexes, coordination, balance, hyper-keen senses, and superhumanly acute night vision and sense of smell. Mephitisoids also have retractable claws, and the ability to emit specific mind/mood-altering [[pheromones]] at will.

Hepzibah is a brilliant natural athlete and acrobat, and skilled hand-to-hand combatant, trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat known in the Shi'Ar Galaxy. She is also an expert marksman, and is knowledgeable in the operation of a wide variety of ship-sized weaponry. She is often armed with Shi'Ar energy guns.

===Appearance===
As a member of the Mephisitoid race, Hepzibah's features are supposed to resemble that of a humanoid skunk, with cat ears on the top of her head and fur having the colors and markings of an Earth skunk. However, modern Marvel artists have begun giving her an [[elf]]-like appearance, giving her pointed ears on the side of her head and removing the black markings. No explanation for the change has been given in the comic books.

She was originally apparently a homage to [[Miss Mam'selle Hepzibah]] from the comic strip, [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hepzibah Marvel Comics bio]</ref>.
