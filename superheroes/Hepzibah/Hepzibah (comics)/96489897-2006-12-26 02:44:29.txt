'''Hepzibah''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  She is a member of the intergalactic enforcers known as the [[Starjammers]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Hepzibah''' was born on the planet Tryl'sart, while under Shi'ar Imperial Rule. She had also spent some time in the prison on the planet Alsibar, where she met [[Corsair]] (Christopher Summers) for the first time. 

Corsair was imprisoned by the authority of the then Shi'ar Emperor [[D'Ken]], brother of [[Deathbird]] and [[Lilandra]] of the Royal House of Neramani, after having destroyed Corsair's life and murdering his wife Kate. Through her friendship and courage as well as support from the others, Corsair had regained his self esteem and with this new-found emotion aided [[Raza Longknife]], [[Ch'od]] and Hepzibah to escape from the prison. He won the respect of the trio, who were a group of mercinaries called The Starjammers and eventually the heart of Hepzibah as well and soon became her lover. 

As a member of the Mephisitoid race, Hepzibah's features resemble that of a humanoid cat, with her fur having the colors and markings of an earth skunk.
