'''Hepzibah''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She is a member of the intergalactic enforcers known as the [[Starjammers]] and currently a member of the [[Uncanny X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #107 (October 1977) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
'''Hepzibah''' was born on the planet Tryl'sart, while under [[Shi'ar]] Imperial Rule. She had also spent some time in the prison on the planet Alsibar, where she met [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] (Christopher Summers) for the first time.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #15</ref>

===The Starjammers===
While Corsair was imprisoned by the authority of the then Shi'ar Emperor [[D'Ken]], brother of [[Deathbird]] and [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] of the Royal House of Neramani, Hepzibah, with the help of several other prisoners who would later form the space pirate [[Starjammers]] (i.e., [[Raza Longknife]] and [[Ch'od]]), aided Corsair in their mutual escape from Shi'Ar prison. Corsair won the respect of the trio (becoming their leader) and eventually the heart of Hepzibah, becoming her lover.

===Encounters with the X-Men===
Hepzibah and the Starjammers teamed up with the [[X-Men]] on multiple occasions. The first time, the Starjammers came to the aid of the X-Men against D'Ken's [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #107</ref> Later, with the other Starjammers, she fought off an alien attack on the ''HMSS Starjammer'' starship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #156</ref> After that, she helped save [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s life in outer space, and then engaged in mock combat with [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #157-158</ref> Hepzibah and the Starjammers helped the [[New Mutants]] neutralize the threat of the [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #50</ref>

Together with Ch'od, she sought the "map-rod" holding information on the location of the "Phalkon" power source. The Phalkon turned out to be the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]. She and the Starjammers were attacked by [[Deathbird]]'s Shi'ar starships. With the other Starjammers, she first met [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] on Earth and aided a rebellion against Deathbird on a Shi'ar border world.<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On: Starjammers'' #1-2</ref>

Later, she was captured by [[Skrull|Warskrulls]] and impersonated by one of them, until she was freed by the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275-277</ref>

===Other encounters===
During the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree/Shi'ar War]], she battled [[Wonder Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]] while escorting the Shi'ar nega-bomb to the [[Kree]] Empire.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #8</ref> With Raza, she accepted an assignment from the former Kree admiral to kill the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. With the Starjammers, she visited the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Ms. Marvel#1980's|Binary]] on Earth. She was thwarted in her attempt to poison the Black Knight, and the plan was foiled. She then returned with the Starjammers to the Shi'ar Empire.<ref>''Avengers'' #350-351</ref>

Hepzibah also aided the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in rescuing some of the Hulk's people from the alien forces of Troyjan.{{issue|date=November 2012}} The [[Silver Surfer]] personally saved her life, an incident which led her to believe she simply intimidated the forces threatening her.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
Relative to a human, Hepzibah possesses enhanced agility, speed, reflexes, coordination, balance, hyper-keen senses, and superhumanly acute night vision and sense of smell. Mephitisoids also have retractable claws, and the ability to emit specific mind/mood-altering [[pheromone]]s at will.

Hepzibah is a brilliant natural athlete and acrobat, and skilled hand-to-hand combatant, trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat known in the Shi'ar galaxy. She is also an expert marksman, and is knowledgeable in the operation of a wide variety of ship-sized weaponry. She is often armed with Shi'ar energy guns.

==Appearance==
As a member of the Mephitisoid race, Hepzibah's features are supposed to resemble that of a humanoid skunk, with cat ears on the top of her head and fur having the colors and markings of an Earth skunk. However, modern Marvel artists have begun giving her a more [[cat]]-like appearance, removing the black markings. No explanation for the change has been given in the comic books.

She was originally apparently an [[homage]] to Miz Mam'selle Hepzibah from the comic strip ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' by [[Walt Kelly]].<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hepzibah Marvel Comics bio]</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Hepzibah appeared in the "[[Phoenix Force (comics)#Television|Phoenix Saga]]" of the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series. She appears as a member of the Starjammers. In reference to their relationship in the comics, one scene shows her and Corsair sharing a kiss. She re-appears with the other Starjammers in "Orphan's End" in which an uncredited actress provides some dialogue.
