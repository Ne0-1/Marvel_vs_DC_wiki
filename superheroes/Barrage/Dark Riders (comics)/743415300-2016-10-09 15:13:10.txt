The '''Dark Riders''', also known as the '''Riders of the Storm''', are a team of [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]], [[Jim Lee]], and [[Whilce Portacio]] in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' Volume 1 #65 (April 1991). The group is composed of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and [[Inhumans]] who are devoted to the philosophy of the [[survival of the fittest]] and serves the immortal mutant, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

==Organization history==

===Apocalypse leadership===

===Origins===
Apocalypse's first assembled team were known as "The Riders of the Dark", human soldiers and warriors, gathered from all over the Earth during the fifteenth century.<ref>''X-Men: Apocalypse vs Dracula'' #1</ref> This army was so strong and powerful that some were led to believe that they were just a myth to scare soldiers before their first battle. They disbanded centuries ago when Cable first defeated Apocalypse. The most recent reincarnation of the Dark Riders is a group of mute, techno-organic or cybernetic warriors who guard Apocalypse's tomb. The creatures never speak and don't seem to have any personality beyond complete loyalty to the strongest.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #26-27</ref>

===First modern incarnation===
When Apocalypse conquered the city of [[Attilan]], home of the Inhumans, he enslaved part of its population. He selected six Inhumans among them: Gauntlet, HardDrive, Tusk, Foxbat, Psynapse and Barrage.<ref>''X-Factor (1st series)'' #67</ref> They became the Riders of the Storm, rechristened after Apocalypse's earliest army.<ref>''X-Factor (1st series)'' #65</ref> Apocalypse sent them to Earth to battle his enemies [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and infect the infant [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Christopher Summers]] and [[Ship (comics)|Ship]] with a [[techno-organic material|techno-organic]] [[virus]]. Ship launched and self-destructed, but the [[artificial intelligence|AI]] that controlled Ship was saved.<ref>''X-Factor (1st series)'' #66</ref> X-Factor made it to the [[Moon]], where Atillan was then located, and joined with the royal family of the Inhumans in their battle against Apocalypse. Apocalypse was defeated, seemingly killed, and the enslaved Inhumans were freed. Despite this loss, the Riders of the Storm remained loyal to Apocalypse, and took his body back to Earth to regenerate in his base.<ref>''X-Factor (1st series)'' #68</ref>

===Stryfe's leadership===
Several months later, the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], another team serving Apocalypse, kidnapped [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]], two members of the [[X-Men]] who had been members of X-Factor during the battle for Attilan. This was done at the behest of [[Mister Sinister]], who was using his shapeshifting powers to pose as Apocalypse. The Riders, now calling themselves the Dark Riders, raised Apocalypse from his regenerative sleep and told him that somebody was impersonating him.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #14</ref> Soon afterwards, [[Stryfe]] attacked Apocalypse and his Dark Riders, seeking revenge against Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #15</ref> He managed to defeat Apocalypse, but Apocalypse escaped. The Dark Riders, following Apocalypse's tenet of survival of the fittest, now followed Stryfe.<ref>''X-Force (1st series)'' #17</ref>

Apocalypse allied himself with the X-Men, and they fought Stryfe and the Dark Riders.<ref>''X-Factor'' #86</ref> While the X-Men pursued Stryfe, Apocalypse fought the Riders and was fatally wounded by them.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #16</ref> After their new leader Stryfe and Cable seem to die in a battle, the Dark Riders escape from the moon in a stolen spacecraft.<ref>''X-Force (1st series)'' #18</ref>

===Leaderless===
Following Apocalypse's apparent demise,<ref>''X-Force (1st series)'' #18</ref> the Dark Riders would still follow his teachings and try to 'test' mutants, eliminating all they considered unworthy. They targeted the mind-controlling [[Mesmero]] and seemingly killed him,<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #21</ref> but in fact he used his hypnotic powers to escape.<ref>''Alpha Flight (2nd series)'' #4</ref> For his weak performance during this fight, the Riders apparently killed one of their own, [[Psynapse (comics)|Psynapse]]. Their next target was Cyclops, who at the time was in discussion with Sinister. Sinister proved himself to be far more powerful than the Riders and warned them not to kill Cyclops, but added that he didn't object to them 'roughing Cyclops up.' Sinister teleported away and the Riders fought Cyclops, who managed to keep the fight to a draw. HardDrive appeared and told Cyclops that he was the first to pass their test. Cyclops tried to convince the Riders to stop with their useless actions, but they teleported away to continue their quest.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #23</ref>

===Genesis===
[[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] became the new leader of the team and even added new members to the Dark Riders in the form of the mutants known as Deadbolt, Hurricane, Lifeforce and Spyne. They soon began testing themselves to see if they’re worthy to stay on the team, unfortunately, that wasn't the case for Foxbat, who was considered unworthy and was apparently killed by Lifeforce. Soon afterwards [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a former Horseman of Apocalypse, was also targeted, but he was saved by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Cable (1st series)'' #17</ref> They captured one of Tusk's Underlings, who claimed that the Riders had killed Tusk Prime and the other Underlings. The Underling led them to the Dark Rider's base, but it turned out to be a trap. Genesis appeared and revealed himself as Cable's son, Tyler.<ref>''Cable (1st series)'' #18</ref> Genesis told them that he wanted to replace Apocalypse. Cable and his friends fought the Dark Riders and Cable tried to save his son, but Tyler and the Riders teleported away again, not having the slightest idea that the fortress that they eventually destroyed was actually the place where Apocalypse was regenerating.<ref>''Cable (1st series)'' #19</ref> Genesis and the Dark Riders later battled Mister Sinister, Jean Grey and the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] after kidnapping Sinister's former lover, Faye Livingstone, in an attempt to crush Sinister's spirit. Although the Riders were defeated, Livingstone died.<ref>''X-Men Annual'' '95</ref>

Genesis then decided to recruit the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to his cause. To further this goal, the Dark Riders broke Wolverine's [[adamantium]]-skinned foe [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] out of prison.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #93</ref> Although Genesis led Cyber to believe that he was being recruited to Genesis's cause, Tyler instead fed Cyber to flesh-eating beetles and melted down Cyber's adamantium carapace.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #96</ref> Genesis tried to turn Wolverine into one of his soldiers by using this adamantium to replace Wolverine's adamantium skeleton, which had been forcibly removed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] some months earlier. Dirtnap, a parasitic lifeform that absorb the bodies of others into himself by manifesting an absurdly large mouth and “swallowing” them, allowing him to take on their appearance, memories, and special attributes while marking himself with a red, smiley face symbol, is revealed to be the new inclusion to the Dark Riders.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #99</ref> Wolverine's body forcibly rejected both Genesis's brainwashing and the adamantium which is expelled from his body in the form of shrapnel, killing Lifeforce and Hurricane. Wolverine becomes a feral, noseless savage and hunts down and kills Spyne, Deadbolt and Genesis himself. Gauntlet was also hunted down but managed to survive, while [[Dirtnap (comics)|Dirtnap]] escaped.<ref>''Wolverine (2nd series)'' #100</ref>

===Stryfe again===
Several months later, the surviving Dark Riders, joined by a very alive Psynapse (his apparent death was in reality an illusion created by him as the minds of the Dark Riders were already weakened from Mesmero's attack), worked again for Stryfe, who returned from death without any explanation. Stryfe ordered them to kill all other telepaths but when Gauntlet, Barrage and HardDrive attacked Jean Grey, [[Madelyne Pryor]] showed up and used her powers to defeat Barrage and HardDrive, leaving them for dead, although their status remains unconfirmed. The other Dark Riders attacked [[Nate Grey]], but Psynapse's attack only reactivated Nate's lost psychic powers, apparently killing Psynapse in the feedback, although he would soon reappear without explanation once more. Nate also discovered that Tusk is really a small, wormlike creature within Tusk Prime's large shell, although whether this was the true Tusk remains unknown.<ref>''X-Man'' #46</ref>

===Solo Work===
With the apparent demise of the team, the only two Dark Riders who are not incapacitated or dead are Dirtnap and Gauntlet. Dirtnap is later seen fighting both Wolverine and the anti-hero [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].<ref>''Venom: Tooth and Claw'' #1-3</ref> In a later battle with the X-Men's mutants-in-training, [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], Dirtnap apparently reformed, and seemingly sacrificed himself to save the young heroes.<ref>Generation X #39</ref>

Gauntlet showed up as a mercenary, secretly contracted by Blaquesmith to hunt down the merged being of Cyclops and Apocalypse, only to find Apocalypse killed when Phoenix rescued Cyclops from the merger. Gauntlet did not reveal to Cable the identity of his client.<ref>''X-Men: The Search for Cyclops'' #1-4</ref>

===Necrosha===
Spyne, Deadbolt, Hurricane, and Lifeforce were resurrected by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] during the Necrosha storyline.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol.3 #21</ref>

===All New, All Different Marvel===
The Dark Riders have recently resurfaced again in the aftermath of the Terrigen Mists being released across the Earth. Seeing this as a sign of natural selection, the Dark Riders have been targeting mutant healers around the world for execution so they do not interfere with natural selection. According to Gauntlet, mutants have had their chance at survival and delaying the end of mutantkind would be an affront to nature. They succeeded in killing Josh Foley, also known as [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] and have also targeted [[List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_T#Triage|Triage]] and [[Xorn|Shen Xorn]] for death. However, Triage is currently under the protection of Magneto and his team of X-Men, while Xorn fended off an assassination attempt made on him by several of the Dark Riders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #1-4</ref> It is assumed that the Dark Riders are dead, since Magneto tied them up in steel and then set off a bomb that blew them up and the entire island of [[Genosha]]. <ref> Uncanny X-Men Vol 4, Issue #5</ref>
