'''Hammerhead''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. He is a temperamental [[Gangster|mobster]] who often dresses and acts in the [[1920s]] style, and a prominent member of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], a fictional [[organized crime]] syndicate.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=6}}</ref> Following an accident, he had most of his skull replaced with an inflexible steel alloy by [[Jonas Harrow]], giving his head a flattened shape and near indestructibility, hence his nickname. The Hammerhead [[crime family]], of which he is a high-ranking member and occasional leader, is named after the character. 

Hammerhead has made appearances in several forms of media outside of comics, including animated series and video games. [[IGN]] ranked him as Spider-Man's 20th greatest enemy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|website=IGN}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=June 2019}}
Hammerhead made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #113, and was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]]<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 63|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Gerry Conway made his first major contribution to the Spider-Man saga...a new mobster was on the rise in New York's underworld - Hammerhead.}}</ref> 

Conway recalled that Hammerhead "was most directly influenced by the [[Frederick Foswell|Big Man]] and the Crime-Master, who were among the first villains in ''Amazing Spider-Man''. One of the more interesting things [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]], [[Jack Kirby]], and, of course, [[Steve Ditko]] did was combining the two different kinds of milieus: superhero and ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', with the unusual criminal characters who had some kind of physical deformity... Plus, Hammerhead—I liked [the] name, and John Romita came up with an interesting look.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 7|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Hammerhead's family immigrated from the [[Soviet Union]] to [[Italy]] when he was a child with help from a man known only as The General. His father ran a garage in Toirrano, where he insisted the young man speak only in Russian, beating him severely with a mallet when he would not. Although not much is known about his life before he became a criminal and supervillain, he is known to be married and has a sister named Antonia.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

All the while, Hammerhead dreamed of becoming a gangster. He is eventually recruited into one of the "families" of the criminal organization known as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] when a member oversees Hammerhead "making his bones" by murdering a childhood bully and his girlfriend in a theater showing ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Originally a small-time hitman, Hammerhead quickly rises through the ranks of the Maggia, while pretending to be ethnically Italian so he can be "made". In his final test, Hammerhead is brought to his father's garage (with the Maggia apparently unaware of their relationship), where he proceeds to kill his father, while telling him in Russian that he does not truly hate him, and that his abuse made him (Hammerhead) this way.<ref name="Extra #1">''Amazing Spider-Man EXTRA!'' #1 (July 2008)</ref>

One day, Hammerhead was found beaten, disfigured, and delirious with pain in an alley in New York City's [[Bowery]] by [[Jonas Harrow]], a surgeon who had lost his medical license due to his illegal experiments. Seeing the opportunity both to save this man's life and to redeem his reputation, Harrow operated on the gunman for three days, replacing much of his shattered skull with a strong steel alloy.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 18 | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> During the surgery, the unconscious thug fixated on the only memory he retained: an image of a poster for a movie called "The [[Al Capone]] Mob", which was hanging in the alley where he lay beaten and bloodied before Harrow found him. When he recovered, the memory of the poster and its images of 1930s-era gangsters prompted Hammerhead to start a gang of his own in the style of Capone and other mobsters of the 1920s. He even dressed as if he were living in that decade. Later on,{{issue|date=December 2015}} Hammerhead's entire skull was replaced with or reinforced with some type of nearly unbreakable metal (possibly [[vibranium]] or secondary [[adamantium]]).{{issue|date=December 2017}}

A gang war broke out between Hammerhead's mob and [[Doctor Octopus]]'s criminal organization. Hammerhead was forced to flee the country due to [[Spider-Man]]'s interference.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #113-115</ref> He later had a rematch with Doctor Octopus next to an atomic breeder reactor on a remote Canadian island which caused a chain reaction, blasting Hammerhead "out of phase" with this dimension.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131</ref> Some time later, he appeared as an immaterial ghost-like being to haunt Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus then unwittingly used a particle accelerator to restore Hammerhead to his corporeal form. Hammerhead kidnapped Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]], who was then rescued by Spider-Man as Doctor Octopus caused Hammerhead's helicopter to plummet into the Hudson River.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159</ref>

Hammerhead then proposed that all Maggia families unite under his leadership. Wearing a strength-enhancing exoskeleton, he battled the [[Human Torch]], who then fused the exoskeleton's power pack.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #233</ref> Hammerhead was nearly assassinated by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s minion the Arranger during a gang war. Despite surviving the assassination, Hammerhead was ultimately forced out of a major role in New York City organized crime by the Kingpin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #284-288</ref>

Hammerhead then allied himself with the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in the latter's bid to become the new crime lord of New York City. The two served as partners in a splinter group of the Maggia.<ref>''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #51</ref> Hammerhead hired [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] as a bodyguard and hitman.<ref>''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #157</ref> He hired the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] to kill [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]], who posed a threat to Tombstone; the assassination attempt failed.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161</ref> Hammerhead was kidnapped and beaten by Tombstone, who had gained superhuman powers and resented Hammerhead for not sending him to kill Joe Robertson.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #68</ref>

Hammerhead later attended a Las Vegas crime conference to divide the resources left by the Kingpin's downfall at the time.<ref>''Daredevil'' #307-309; ''Nomad'' #4-6; ''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #46-48</ref> Around this time, he participates in a multi-sided gang-war focused on the Kingpin's attempt to re-take New York City for his own.<ref>''Spider-Man: Made Men'' #1 (August 1998)</ref>

Hammerhead is a major player in underworld activities in the Marvel Universe and is highly sought after for elimination by the [[Punisher]].{{issue|date=November 2019}} He becomes one of several gang warlords struggling to control the criminal underworld in the major cities of the Eastern United States.{{issue|date=November 2019}} During one of the first meetings of such warlords, Hammerhead was almost killed by the [[Fenris (comics)|Strucker twins]].{{issue|date=November 2019}} This meeting was being manipulated by [[Baron von Strucker]], the head of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].{{issue|date=November 2019}} When [[Don Fortunato]] made a bid for control of the New York underworld, Hammerhead opposed him and was almost killed as a result.{{issue|date=November 2019}} When every other crime lord surrendered to Fortunato and his HYDRA allies, Hammerhead went rogue, launching a raid on Fortunato's home and successfully fighting off a HYDRA attack on his own headquarters. {{issue|date=November 2019}} He did have assistance from Spider-Man and [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius the Living Vampire]], however.{{issue|date=November 2019}} For a time, the hero known as [[S.H.O.C.]] also assists Hammerhead.{{issue|date=November 2019}} Later, he was hired by [[Norman Osborn]] to be a part of the [[Sinister Twelve]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

During the events of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Hammerhead used the vacuum left by the incarceration of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] to gain a greater foothold in the ranks of organized crime, attempting to organize an army of costumed villains (consisting of the [[Ani-Men]] V, the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] I, the Aura, [[Bloodshed (comics)|Bloodshed]], the [[Clown (comics)|Clown]], the [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]] III, the [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], the [[Great Gambonnos]], the [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II, [[Man Mountain Marko]], the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], [[Mindblast]], [[Gregory Herd|Override]], the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], the [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], [[Slyde]], the [[Trapster]], and the [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will O' The Wisp]]) to enforce his new criminal empire. When Slyde balked at the idea, Hammerhead had [[Underworld (comics)|Underworld]] kill him to serve as a warning to anyone who did not join up with him. The Kingpin manipulated various hero factions, most notably [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Iron Man]], into breaking up Hammerhead's first convening of his army. During the conflict, Hammerhead was shot numerous times by Underworld, who was revealed to be working for the Kingpin. Underworld later confronted Hammerhead while he lay in prison and shot him at point-blank range with adamantium bullets.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1 (February 2007)</ref>

The bullets, while not penetrating his skull, did cause severe trauma to his brain, resulting him in needing surgery, but the hospital he was brought to was unable to treat him. In mid-surgery however, men working for [[Mister Negative]], Kingpin's rival, came in, killed the hospital staff, and took Hammerhead away. Mister Negative then has his surgeon Doctor Trauma revive Hammerhead and offers to transplant his brain into a new robotic adamantium skeleton, which Hammerhead agrees to.<ref name="Extra #1"/>

The operation is a complete success, and Hammerhead is restored to full mobility without any ill effects. He swears loyalty to Mister Negative in exchange for his restored life, and proceeds to shape a gang of lowlife thugs into an effective army for his benefactor. He then proceeds to battle Spider-Man, besting him with no effort for the first time in years. Later, he has a rematch with Spider-Man, with Spider-Man dislocating Hammerhead's hip bone.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #575</ref>

Mister Negative sends Hammerhead to help Spider-Man (who Mister Negative corrupted) take down the Hood, who launches an attack on Negative's headquarters. He blackmails H.A.M.M.E.R. director [[Norman Osborn]] into forcing the Hood to pull out of Chinatown.<ref>''Dark Reign: Mister Negative'' #2-3</ref>

Hammerhead later begins to doubt his loyalty to Mister Negative when Silvermane, a deceased former Maggia don and old enemy of Kingpin's, appears to return.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Unknown to Hammerhead, "Silvermane" is actually an android controlled by [[Mysterio]] to plant seeds of rebellion. Nevertheless, he flees a shootout with the Maggia when the Silvermane robot calls him a traitor. It is shown that Mister Negative had a computer chip put in Hammerhead's head to deliver an electroshock when necessary, which he promptly uses to punish him and remind him who is in charge.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Hammerhead and Mister Negative are among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team, promising them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref>

Alongside his nephew and minions, Hammerhead formed an alliance with the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], where he sided with her gang.<ref>''Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Hammerhead has no superhuman abilities, yet his skull is now surgically reinforced with vibranium (or secondary adamantium), making his head flat on top; with this, he can charge and break through objects such as brick walls without causing any pain or damage to himself. This metal can absorb physical impacts that would otherwise fracture human bone. Hammerhead is in peak physical condition comparable to that of an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athlete. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant whose most dangerous tactic is charging head first like a bull toward an opponent. Hammerhead once utilized a strength-enhancing exoskeleton designed by the [[Tinkerer]].

After an assassin's adamantium bullet penetrated a part of his head not protected by his adamantium skull, Hammerhead is surgically rebuilt by [[Mister Negative]]. Breakout surgeries replace the upper half of his skeleton with an adamantium endo-skeleton (the skeleton is shown to have a network of hydraulic servomechanisms). The upper portion of his body is now superhumanly strong as a result of the additional hidden cybernetic musculature, making him able to effortlessly beat a superpowered foe such as Spider-Man. Mister Negative does not use on Hammerhead the same [[Lord Dark Wind]] bonding process, used on the similarly empowered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] for coating their bones in adamantium: instead he replaces Hammerhead's bones with replicas fashioned in the invulnerable metal. It is still unknown how his artificial skeleton can carry on biological functions.

The intervention of Mr. Negative also radically changed Hammerhead's personality. Hammerhead now recalls his life as Russian immigrant prior to the accident in which he adopted the 1920s gangster persona. Consequently, Hammerhead no longer speaks like a 1920s movie gangster, but instead behaves as a typical modern Russian mobster and hitman, as this was apparently his original personality prior to his head injury.

Hammerhead is highly skilled in the organization, concealment, and management of criminal enterprises. He is an effective hitman, a skilled marksman (his preferred weapon was the [[Thompson submachine gun]]), and an excellent street fighter. In his original incarnation, Hammerhead was able to hold his own against Spider-Man despite being an ordinary human by using his superhumanly durable skull as a blunt instrument. After his recent augmentation, he is now capable of grappling with and physically overpowering Spider-Man to the extent that he could eventually crush his foe.

He first appeared in the "Insidious Six" two-parter as one of Silvermane's loyal henchmen before Spider-Man interfered, got him fired, and hired by the Kingpin. After Kingpin's right hand, [[Alistair Smythe]], stole a powerful artifact called the Tablet of Time and Silvermane hired the thug [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to kidnap [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], Hammerhead deduced Kingpin's wife [[Vanessa Fisk]] was also kidnapped. In retaliation, he kidnapped Silvermane's daughter, [[List of Spider-Man (1994 TV series) characters#Alisa Silver|Alisa Silver]]. The two crime lords arranged a meeting, but Spider-Man and a robot Alistair built intervened. Hammerhead attempted to keep Alisa in his custody, but Spider-Man defeated him. During a fight between Silvermane, Tombstone, Alisa, and Dr. Connors after he became the Lizard, Hammerhead retrieved the tablet for Kingpin. Alisa attempted to kill everyone by detonating the building, but everyone escaped and presumed the tablet was destroyed with it. Though Kingpin was pleased by Hammerhead's loyalty, the former's life of crime led to the dissolution of his marriage, so he ordered Hammerhead to get rid of the tablet.

He also uses [[brass knuckles]] as weapons, though he retains his usual strength. An enforcer of the crime boss Tombstone, he acts on his boss' behalf by manufacturing supervillains to distract Spider-Man from Tombstone's operations.

While attending an auction organized by [[Oscorp]] on Tombstone's behalf, he re-encountered Sable and attempted to outbid out of spite, only to be beaten by [[Roderick Kingsley]]. Hammerhead tried to attack him and Sable, but when Spider-Man and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] interfered, he teamed up with his former lover to fight back before escaping police custody. Due to Hammerhead's numerous failures, Tombstone became fed up and started conducting business without him. While contacting [[Norman Osborn]] to create another supervillain, Hammerhead becomes inspired to betray his boss as part of his own plan to take Tombstone out of play. Secretly calling for a Valentine's Day meeting between Tombstone, [[Doctor Octopus]] and Silvermane, Hammerhead attempted to manipulate the assembled crime bosses into destroying each other. However, Spider-Man foils his plan by getting all of the bosses arrested, leading Tombstone to fire Hammerhead.

While she betrays him and attempts to keep the drives for herself, he anticipates this and plants a bomb to kill her. After her apparent death, Hammerhead's gang steals advanced weapons and technology from the private military company Sable International to wipe out the other families, even staging an attack on the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] that leaves several officers dead. Spider-Man foils Hammerhead's attempt to kill the other Maggia leaders in a public execution, but a vengeful Captain [[Wraith (Yuri Watanabe)|Yuri Watanabe]] nearly kills him before Spider-Man redirects her shot. By the time Hammerhead escapes police custody and undergoes a procedure to transform himself into a cyborg using Sable International's Project Olympus tech, the company's head, [[Silver Sable|Silver Sablinova]], returns to New York to put a stop to his crimes. After learning about Hammerhead's weakness (the plate in his head) from Black Cat, who faked her death, Spider-Man and Silver Sable work together to subdue Hammerhead and cripple his gang.
