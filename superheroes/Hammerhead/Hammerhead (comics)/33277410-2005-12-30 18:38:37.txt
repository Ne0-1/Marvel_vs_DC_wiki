'''Hammerhead''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Spider-Man]] comics published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''The Amazing Spiderman'' #113. The character is likely a homage to the [[Dick Tracy]] villains.

==Character biography==
Hammerhead is an enemy of Spider-Man and a member of organized crime. He is closely associated with the Maggia crime family. Hammerhead distinguishes himself from other villains in that he dresses up and acts somewhat like a gangster from the 1920's. Due to an injury he suffered in which his skull was reinforced with metal, his head has a flat shape to it.

Though Hammerhead's real name is not known, bits of his past have been revealed. He was a small-time member of the Maggia, the [[Marvel Universe]] version of the [[Mafia]]. He was found half-dead and [[amnesia]]c in the streets after a gang war by Dr. Jonas Harrow. Harrow took him to his lab where, to save his life, he installed a metal plate in his head, giving him "flat-top" look.  After being nursed back to health by Harrow, Hammerhead saw a poster of a movie about [[Al Capone]], prompting him to start a mob of his own, based on the gangsters of the 1930s. Though not much is known about his life before he became a supervillain, he is known to have a sister. Later on Hammerheads entire skull was replaced with or reinforced with some type of nearly unbreakable metal (possibly vibranium or secondary adamantium).

He is a major player in underworld activities in the Marvel Universe and is highly sought after for elimination by the Punisher. He is currently one of several gang warlords struggling to control the criminal underworld in the major cities of the Eastern United States.

==Powers and abilities==
Hammerhead has no superhuman abilities, yet his skull is now reinforced by a very durable form of metal (possibly vibranium or secondary adamantium). He tells Spiderman at one point in the television cartoon that his head is Adamantium. This metal can absorb physical impacts that would otherwise damage his brain. Though not superhumanly strong, he has achieved a peak level of human strength roughly equal to a champion Olympic weightlifter; he can lift between 500 and 600 pounds (about 250 kg). He is athletic in most other respects as well. 

He typically carries a 1920s style tommygun. He uses his head as a weapon in unarmed combat by charging his enemy.

Hammerhead is highly skilled in the organization, concealment, and management of criminal enterprises.  He is an effective hit-man, a skilled marksman, and an excellent street fighter.

==Ultimate Marvel==
In Ultimate Spider-Man, Hammerhead is again a mobster. He kills Alan Silvermane in the beginning of the Warriors story arc and becomes the new leader of the Enforcers. He doesn't wear 1920's style clothing and other mobsters have referred to him as a mutant, signifying that maybe this incarnation might be some form of mutant. However, every super powered human in Ultimate Spider-Man is labelled as a mutant, regardless of whether or not they are, so Hammerhead's head could still be made of reenforced metal. He burns down one of the Kingpin's warehouses. After an intense battle with [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Cat]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Iron Fist]], and [[Shang-Chi]], he was put in a coma when [[Elektra]] brutally stabs him in the chest with her sai.

Hammerhead also appears in [[Ultimate X-Men]] issues 13 and 14 as a mobster who has killed the parents of a little girl. The girl stumbles upon local street performer/magician [[Gambit]], who takes the girl in and decides to protect her from the mob. The girl is kidnapped and Gambit goes on a rampage to find her, blindly running into an ambush Hammerhead set up. Gambit gets out of the ambush and chases Hammerhead down.  In the end, Gambit charges Hammerhead full of bio-kinetic energy and explodes his head.  As far as Gambit is concerned, target neutralized.
