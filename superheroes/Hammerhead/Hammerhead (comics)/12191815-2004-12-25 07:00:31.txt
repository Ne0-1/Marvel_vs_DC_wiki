'''Hammerhead''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Spider-Man]] comics published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Though his real name is not known, bits of his past are known. He was a small-time member of the Maggia, the [[Marvel Universe]] version of the [[Mafia]]. He was found half-dead and [[amnesia]]c in the streets after a gang war by Dr. Jonas Harrow. Harrow took him to his lab where, to save his life, he installed a metal plate in his head, giving him "flat-top" look.  After being nursed back to health by Harrow, Hammerhead saw a poster of a movie about [[Al Capone]], prompting him to start a mob of his own, based on the gangsters of the [[1930s]]. Though not much is known about his life before he became a supervillain, he is known to have a sister.
