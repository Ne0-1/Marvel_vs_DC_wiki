Not much is know of Blindspot, (her real name is unknown) having only recently appeared in the "Rogue - Forget-Me-Not" Saga. What should be noted is that as her powers were so similar to those of Rogue, Rogue's powers seemed not to affect her. Blindspot's powers, however, work just fine on Rogue.

In the Forget-Me-Not saga, it was revealed that [[Sunfire]] had worked with Rogue and Mystique back when Sunfire was still working with his uncle, Tomo Yoshida and Rogue was a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]]. Working with them was a girl called Blindspot, who had the power to erase and restore memories. The four were on a mission to steal Lord Dark Wind's (the father of [[Lady Deathstrike]]) [[adamantium]] bonding process. Mystique would later cut her ties with Blindspot, who she and Destiny did not trust. Since she always erased her tracks once a contract ends, Blindspot wiped the minds of everyone who was involved so no one would remember her.

Blindspot discovered Lord Dark Wind wanted the four all dead for trying to steal his adamantium process. Realizing how the others would be in danger, with no memory of the mission to steal Dark Wind's adamantium process, Blindspot went back to [[Japan]] to erase his memory of the ordeal. When she got there, she discovered that his daughter (who has become Lady Deathstrike) had already killed him. Blindspot was able to erase Deathstrike's memories as well.

But now Deathstrike, who was more machine than woman, was able to restore her memories the same way one would a hard drive. Deathstrike kidnapped Blindspot, who released a photo of Sunfire, Rogue, and Mystique to attract their attention to save her. Though Mystique (to our knowledge) never came, Rogue joined Sunfire (whose reputation had been ruined by the photograph) in [[Tokyo]] to discover why they were framed and who was responsible. They ran into Lady Deathstrike, who in a heated battle cut off Sunfire's legs, leaving him in critical conditition. Rogue surrendered to Deathstrike, who imprisoned the two. There, Rogue met Blindspot, who restored Rogue's memories and explained to her what was going on.

When Deathstrike discovered that the three were not actually responsible for stealing the adamantium, she went to kill them to destroy any evidence of what she had done. A weak Sunfire asked Rogue to absorb his powers so she could properly battle Deathtrike (Rogue had previously lost the powers of [[Carol Danvers]] that she had taken). Rogue was hesitant, worried that she would harm Sunfire, but Blindspot pushed her on Sunfire's face, causing her to absorb all his powers and possibly killing him. With it, Rogue now also contained with her Sunfire's personality (similiar to how she also once had Danver's personality with her). Sunfire's personality controlling her, Rogue went out to get revenge on Deathstrike, severely injuring the woman. The [[X-Men]] arrived in time to intervene, but Blindspot erased Rogue's memories of being an X-Man, causing her to see her teammates as her enemies. After a brief altercation, Rogue's memories were restored and she told the X-Men what had happened to Sunfire. They went to where Rogue last saw Sunfire, but his body was missing, leading some of the X-Men to believe he was somehow still alive.
