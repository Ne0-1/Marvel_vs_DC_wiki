'''Kylun (Colin McKay)''' is a leonine [[fictional character]] of Scottish descent in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''Excalibur'' #2. He was briefly a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. 

==Character biography==
'''Colin McKay''' was a mutant child who was fleeing from soldiers sent to capture him by [[Vixen (Marvel Comics)|Vixen]]. He discovered the robot [[Widget (comics)|Widget]], who created a portal to transport Colin to another dimension. There, twenty years passed and Colin grew up, his name "Colin" degenerated into "Kylun" and his mutant abilities transforming his features into more cat-like ones. He became engaged to the sorceress ''Sat'neen'', an alternate reality version of [[Saturnyne]] and together they battled the evil sorcerer, [[Necrom]], who ruled the world with an iron fist. His enchanted swords were very potent weapons against Necrom's sorcery and Kylun became a legend, leading a rebellion against Necrom's forces. 

Finally Necrom managed to kill his world's protectors, known as Excalibur, and he captured Sat'neen and killed her as well, animating their bodies to attack Kylun. Filled with grief, Kylun slew the undead heroes and swore to kill Necrom and attacked him. Necrom fled to [[Earth 616]], Kylun's original home and Kylun followed, but appeared in a different time and place: the lighthouse that served as home to Earth 616's version of Excalibur. He saw [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and assumed that he was a demonic servant of Necrom. Kylun attacked Nightcrawler, but stopped his fight when he noticed his blades didn't hurt him. 

Kylun joined forces with Excalibur, and after Necrom's death even became a full member. He left the team shortly afterwards to seek out his parents and only returned occasionally to the team.

==Powers and abilities==
His [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] ability was to replicate any sound he heard with his vocal cords. 
He is also a fine swordsman, wielding two twin mystical blades, the Zz'ria Blades, that cannot hurt anyone with a pure heart. Should the blades hit somebody of pure heart they turn intangible and simply pass through the victim without any harm. The blades also have the ability to dispel any magic they hit and have cleaved rocks with a single blow.

==Notes==
* The symbol on Kylun's clothes is a representation of [[Widget (comics)|Widget]].
