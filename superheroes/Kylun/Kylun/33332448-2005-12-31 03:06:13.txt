'''Kylun''' (Colin McKay) is a lion-like fictional character of Scottish descent in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]] team, [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. His mutant ability was to replicate any sound he heard with his vocal chords. He is also a fine swordsman, wielding two twin mystical blades, the Zz'ria Blades, that cannot hurt anyone with a pure heart.  

Kylun first appeared in Excalibur #2, as a mutant child who was fleeing from soldiers sent to capture him by Viper.  He discovered the robot [[Widget (comics)|Widget]], who created a portal to transport Colin to another dimension.  There, twenty years passed and Colin grew up, his mutant abilites transforming his features into more cat-like ones.
