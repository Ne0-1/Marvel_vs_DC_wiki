The '''Black Cat''' ('''Felicia Hardy''') is a fictional [[comic book]] character created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Keith Pollard]]. She is a costumed [[cat burglar]] and sometime crimefighter who has been romantically involved with [[Spider-Man]] in the past. Although the character started out as a [[Catwoman]] homage, she has since evolved in a different direction than her predecessor.

The character has been the occasional star of mini-series, though she most frequently appears as a supporting character in the cast of various [[Spider-Man]] comics and other titles set in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The Black Cat's real name is Felicia Hardy, and the character first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #194 ([[1979]]). She began a career in crime out of respect and adoration for her cat burglar father, but kept it on as a misguided attempt to attract the attentions of Spider-Man. Felicia and Peter Parker/Spider-man have been very close in the past, and she is fully aware of his secret identity.

Initially, Felicia's abilities were 100% natural, with the 'accidents' which seemed to befall those who crossed her path being merely well-planned [[stunt]]s and [[trap]]s. After her near-death at the hands of [[Owl (comics)|The Owl]] and [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #72, Felicia feared that her lack of powers made her a vulnerability to Spider-Man, and that she would lose him. While Spider-man was away in the "[[Secret Wars]]", Felicia turned to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], and made a pact with him in return for his scientists giving her super-powers. She kept the secret from Peter for quite some time. What she didn't realise was that her newly-gained genuine 'bad luck' power was infectious, and that it was permanently jinxing Spider-Man. That of course was the Kingpin's plan all along.

She broke up with Spider-Man, and [[Doctor Strange]] removed her bad luck power, changing her other abilities in the process. Since then she has settled into a life of her own, albeit one which regularly intertwines with Peter's. She recently dated [[Flash Thompson]] for a while, primarily to irritate Peter. Recently, [[Mary Jane Watson]] and the Black Cat have become close friends - in spite of their once intense rivalry over Peter. She bought some equipment from the [[Tinkerer]], and occasionally teams up with Spider-Man.

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] began writing a ''Spider-Man/Black Cat'' miniseries in [[2002]]; [[as of 2004]], the series has yet to be completed.

Rumours are that Black Cat may also appear in the ''[[Spiderman 3]]'' film set to be released in [[2007 in film|2007]]. One actress said possibly to play the role is [[Eliza Dushku]].
