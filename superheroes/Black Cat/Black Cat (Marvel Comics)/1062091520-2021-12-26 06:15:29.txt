'''Black Cat''' ('''Felicia Hardy''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Throughout her history, Black Cat has sometimes been an enemy, love interest, and ally of the superhero [[Spider-Man]]. Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Keith Pollard]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Amazing Spider-Man (1963) #194 {{!}} Comic Issues {{!}} Marvel|url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/6587/the_amazing_spider-man_1963_194|access-date=2021-10-25|website=Marvel Entertainment}}</ref> she first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #194 (July 1979).<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Amazing Spider-Man (1963) #194 {{!}} Comic Issues {{!}} Marvel|url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/6587/the_amazing_spider-man_1963_194|access-date=2021-10-25|website=Marvel Entertainment}}</ref>

Felicia Hardy is the daughter of [[Walter Hardy]], a world-renowned cat burglar. After suffering from a traumatic assault by an ex-boyfriend as a college freshman, she trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics and, after deciding to follow in her father's footsteps, adopted the costumed identity of the Black Cat.<ref>''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]''</ref> She has the subconscious ability to affect [[probability]] fields, producing "bad luck" for her enemies. The character was originally depicted as a [[supervillain]] and adversary of Spider-Man, but over time the two fell in love, which motivated her into becoming both an [[antihero]]ine, and his partner. However, their relationship grew complicated after it became apparent that Black Cat was only attracted to the [[alter ego]] of Spider-Man and had little interest in the hero's [[Secret identity|civilian life]] as Peter Parker. After their break-up, Black Cat maintained her role as one of Spider-Man's most trusted allies and for years the pair shared an [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-again, off-again]] romance before she eventually lapsed back into her criminal ways (much to Spider-Man's dismay and annoyance).

Being a part of his [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters|supporting cast]] and one of his principal love interests, Black Cat has been featured in many media adaptations related to Spider-Man, including animated series and video games. [[Felicity Jones]] played Felicia Hardy in the 2014 film, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. [[IGN]] ranked her as Spider-Man's 24th greatest enemy in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|website=IGN|date=November 2021}}</ref>

[[File:Spider194.png|thumb|''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #194 (July 1979): The Black Cat's debut. Cover art by [[Al Milgrom]].]]
Felicia Hardy was born in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Her father [[Walter Hardy|Walter]] pretended to be a traveling salesman but was a world-renowned cat burglar who, before his arrest, encouraged her to never settle for second best. If she loved [[basketball]], she should work to become a basketball player and not just a [[cheerleader]].

In ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]'', Black Cat herself reveals that as a freshman at Empire State University, she was raped by her boyfriend Ryan. Hating the idea of being a victim, she trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics, intent on killing him. Finally, after months of preparing, she set out for revenge, but before she could find him, Ryan was killed in a drunk driving accident. Furious that she was denied the chance for revenge, Hardy decided to utilize her new skills to follow in her father's footsteps. After amassing a fortune in stolen items, Felicia adopted her costumed identity.

She first dons the Black Cat costume in order to break her father out of prison. On the same night, she meets Spider-Man. Her father dies, and she then fakes her own death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194-195</ref> Despite her antipathy towards men, Felicia feels a kinship with this lone hero; Spider-Man is the first man she felt she could trust and she grows to believe herself in love with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #204-205</ref> Felicia looks for a way to earn his trust and continues with the Black Cat persona as a misguided attempt to attract his affection. Seeing the good in Felicia, Spider-Man makes every attempt to have her criminal record expunged.

Felicia is placed in a mental institution but escapes. She joins forces with Spider-Man against the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. She is granted conditional amnesty, and again convinces Spider-Man that she has died.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #226-227. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Black Cat finally finds the opportunity to prove herself after learning the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] controls an incredibly powerful detonator. The [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] plans to use the weapon to hold New York City hostage. Meanwhile, [[Doctor Octopus]] plans to use the weapon to destroy the city altogether. However, the Black Cat uses her abilities to steal the item first and protect it from all parties. She gives the detonator to Spider-Man and becomes the target of Doctor Octopus' revenge. Although Spider-Man tears off his mechanical appendages, Octopus is still able to mentally control them and hold the Black Cat still while his men open fire. Spider-Man barely gets her to the hospital in time and as they operate on the dozens of bullet and knife wounds, Peter realizes just how much he cares for Felicia.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #74-76. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After she recovers, they begin a relationship and soon Peter reveals his identity to her. Felicia has difficulty accepting the fact that Peter is just a man beneath the mask and cannot understand his need for a civilian life. Peter is hurt, but continues the relationship since it was the first time he did not need to hide his life as Spider-Man from someone.

Initially, the "accidents" which seem to befall those who crossed the Black Cat's path are merely well-planned stunts and traps. After her near-death experience,<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #75</ref> Felicia fears her lack of superpowers make her a liability to Spider-Man. She is terrified that his overwhelming need to protect her will eventually get him killed, so Felicia seeks a way to make herself Spider-Man's equal. Felicia is offered an opportunity to undergo the same process that was used to create the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #87-89. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kingpin uses it on the Black Cat as payback for a theft she committed. Scared and ashamed of being empowered by the Kingpin of crime, she keeps her new abilities a secret from Peter.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Felicia then begins a "[[Robin Hood]] crusade", stealing from the rich to give to the poor.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #112. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Peter soon realizes something is amiss with his own luck and enlists the aid of [[Doctor Strange]] to remove the "hex" on him. By doing so, he alters the hex's source and changes the Black Cat's powers in the process. She finds she has heightened [[superhuman strength|strength]], agility, balance, vision, and retractable claws.

However, despite her anger during her ruse, Felicia begins to fall back onto her desire to love Peter. Spider-Man comes home to discover Black Cat discussing her plans to ruin his life by framing him for murder, during a telephone-conversation with The Foreigner. Before he can catch her, she escapes. Spider-Man tracks her down to the Foreigner's apartment by attempting to trick Lt. Keating into revealing evidence as Peter Parker. Peter then intercepts a phone-call on Keating's phone, which turns out to be Felicia, telling Keating to meet her. However this is a part of her plan, as she intentionally lured Spider-Man into finding her at the Foreigner's apartment, causing a fight to ensue between The Foreigner and Spider-Man. Later she clears Spider-Man of his murder charge. In the end, the Black Cat double-crosses the Foreigner and Spider-Man, detailing her plan and her feelings towards Peter in a letter, also explaining that she has fled to Paris in order to start a new-life.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #128-129.

In the Slide-Away Casino, [[Melter]] and [[Killer Shrike]] take [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] to the back room where Black Cat is waiting. Black Cat shows him various items and tells him that even she cannot steal everything and sometimes must pay for them and asks him how is she supposed to do that when nobodies like him do not pay her weekly cut. Ringer tells her he did not pay because he was captured by Silk, owed the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] for getting him out of jail, and had to pay the [[Tinkerer]] for new equipment. He also tells Black Cat they worked in some works before and remembers her having a heart and asks for compassion. Black Cat hesitates long enough for the Ringer to attack them, hitting her in her arm before she takes him down. Black Cat tells Ringer that he will make three times the cut and will also serve as an example by having Killer Shrike and Melter beat him up. Black Cat is surprised Ringer could tag her as she normally is more lucky. She wonder if it was luck to remind her of who she is now and tests her luck with one of the casino's machines and wins.

In the present day at a museum, Regina Venderkamp, the woman who bought all the items confiscated from the Black Cat in an auction, presents the same painting that Felicia did. However, the lights go out for a moment and the painting is gone. An enraged Regina and her bodyguards go to her apartment only to find all of her treasures gone. She goes upstairs to see if she also took everything there, despite a bodyguard protesting since Black Cat could still be there. Black Cat then appears and says she couldn't leave without Regina learning that no one takes from Black Cat without paying. Regina orders her bodyguards to attack, but Black Cat quickly takes them out. She reflects that her bad luck powers seem to work better when she is ruthless and she may have been holding back before. Black Cat throws one of her claws to Regina's neck causing her to pass out. Hours later, Regina wakes up handcuffed to a chair at Black Cat's hideout.

Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina Venderkamp tied up. Jay asks her why did she took them as she doesn't need money and they didn't do nothing to her. Felicia pours gasoline around her apartment and tells Jay he is wrong as they bought her things in the auction, a collection she spent years acquiring. She tells him that's the problem with possessions, they can break, you can lose them or they can be taken. And when that happens, everyone thinks they can take what's yours unless you prove them wrong. She says that nothing and no one will have that hold on him before setting the apartment on fire. When Spider-Man arrives, May warns him that the Black Cat is still in there and Peter asks Felicia for help. She tells him to save them if he wants as she made her point and the more people know the better. Parker tries to convince her that this isn't her but she tells him that the Felicia he knew is gone and she is done being who others want. She tells her that she controls her fate and anyone who stands before that will also be gone. Spider-Man manages to save Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina, who screams at him for not saving her things before May shushes her, telling her that people are what count, not things and Spider-Man knows that. In the Slide-A-Way Casino, Black Cat tells her men that they have seen what happens when they stay on her good side and what happens when they cross her. But from now on, there's nothing holding her back and no limit to what she will do.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Fresh Start ===
During Marvel's "[[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]]", Black Cat teamed up with Spider-Man to confront the Thieves Guild, a group of robbers established hundreds of years ago that was trying to make their name known again by stealing the equipment of various super heroes. As an honorary member of the Guild, she was able to allow the two to break in and fight off Guild members until the rest of the heroes showed up to reclaim their items. Later that night, Felicia tells Spider-Man that her darker mentality didn't start when Doctor Octopus arrested her, but instead when she forgot Spider-Man's secret identity as a result of Doctor Strange making everyone forget it after a ''Civil War'', feeling that she lost a significant part of her life in the process. In response, Peter takes off his mask and reveals his secret to Felicia, which she gladly accepts. Afterwards, Kindred ([[Harry Osborn]]) learns of Spider-Man's rekindled friendship with Black Cat and claims that Peter "drags everyone into his own Hell".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol 5. #9-10.

Black Cat reluctantly gives it to him in exchange that she helps to save Spider-Man's soul.<ref name="ReferenceB">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #51.LR. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Order of the Web helps Doctor Strange in fixing the Brooklyn Bridge, Black Cat is instructed by Doctor Strange to guard the Hand of the Vishanti as he takes [[Julia Carpenter|Madame Web]]'s advice to use in tracking Kindred.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

== Powers and abilities ==
Initially, the Black Cat had no [[superhuman]] abilities. Later, a test induced by the Kingpin gave her the psionic ability to affect [[probability]] fields; essentially, she could produce "bad luck" for her enemies.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #89</ref> The "bad luck" power entails that under stress she is subconsciously able to cause anyone in her immediate vicinity that she perceives as a threat to be susceptible to freak accidents, like guns jamming and exploding, or tripping on objects. This ability also had the [[side effect]] of eventually causing problems for anyone spending long periods of time around her.

[[Doctor Strange]] eventually tampered with her powers that briefly removed her bad luck abilities, along with the unwanted side effect. However, this magical tampering temporarily endowed her with cat-like abilities, giving her [[night vision]], retractable talons in her fingertips, superhuman speed, strength, agility and endurance, proportionate to a cat.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #116. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her "bad luck" powers were eventually restored by Doc Tramma through the use of cybernetics.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Black Cat has reflexes, agility, and stamina of an Olympic level acrobat. She is physically very strong and athletic and has great physical endurance. She is an excellent street fighter capable of taking on several armed assailants and incapacitating them without being injured herself. She is trained in several [[martial arts]] styles, including [[Judo]] and [[Goju Ryu]] Karate. Hardy is a talented photographer; while dating Spider-Man she takes pictures of the hero that he admits are better than his own work.{{issue|date=March 2018}}

The Black Cat has also acquired several devices from the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] that increase her agility and heighten her strength.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> She wears earrings that interact with the balance centers of her brain to grant her enhanced agility. She has contact lenses that let her see in various ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]. Her costume contains micro-[[Servomechanism|servos]] that enhance her strength above normal human levels. The gloves of her costume contain steel micro-filaments, which form retractable claws at the fingertips when she flexes her fingers (triggering a magnetic surge which condenses the filaments into polarized talons) which enable her to tear through most surfaces and easily scale walls. Using this equipment, the Black Cat has been able to beat enemies who have superhuman abilities.

The Black Cat has a miniature grappling hook device hidden in the "fur" of each glove, designed by her father [[Walter Hardy]], which enables her to swing from buildings in a manner similar to Spider-Man, though not quite as fast. She can also use the cable from this device as a tightrope, wall scaling device, swing line, or as a weapon in combat.

[[File:MangaBlackCat.jpg|thumb|right|Marvel Mangaverse Black Cat. Art by Tommy Ohtsuka.]]
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] continuity, Black Cat is cybernetically enhanced. She was originally a simple thief, who stole a cursed magical amulet for its monetary value, but this act attracted the attention of [[Alternative versions of Daredevil#Marvel Mangaverse|Matt Murdock, the Devil Hunter]], and she was cut in half. The Kingpin of Crime reconstructed her body with cybernetics, including a shut-down mechanism he planned to activate if she failed to serve him. After completing her mission for the Kingpin, he claimed to have permanently deactivated the mechanism, but whether he kept his word or not remains to be seen. She is still [[Spider-Man]]'s old flame, but in the New Mangaverse storyline (with Spider-Man having chosen [[Mary Jane Watson]] over her) she is trying to move on, and is now showing a romantic interest in [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Mangaverse|Wolverine]] though by the end of the story arc it is clear that she has a hidden agenda as she is later seen with [[Nick Fury]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

When asked about this during his Joe Friday 100, Joe Q explained that "the MZ world is not exactly like the regular Marvel Universe. Our Captain America is their "Colonel America".

The Cat Lady then gave Howard twelve hours to find the assassin, otherwise she would kill him. Howard figured out that the informant was playing possum on orders from a simian version of Wilson Fisk who wanted to take his main rival, the Cat Lady, down. She confronts him and Adrian Toomes at a bar but they are both arrested as Howard planned.

[[File:Black Cat (Ultimate Marvel character).jpg|upright|thumb|Ultimate Black Cat on the cover to ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #152 (November 2005). Art by [[Jeff Scott Campbell]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the Black Cat is Felicia Hardy, a young woman who blames her father's death on [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin]]. Seeking revenge, she stole a priceless tablet that he was going to use on his comatose wife. Kingpin hired the assassin [[Elektra (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Elektra]] to retrieve it. When Black Cat threw it into the harbor, Elektra threw one of her [[sai (weapon)|sai]] into the Black Cat's chest, sending the thief over the edge. She was presumed dead, though no body was found.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She later returned during a gang war, stopping [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Hammerhead|Hammerhead]] from shooting [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] in the right temple.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #81.

Marvel Comics.</ref> She later assisted Hammerhead and Elektra in a confrontation against Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, Iron Fist and Spider-Man.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #84. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, after the crisis was resolved, she passionately kissed Spider-Man through his mask, her previous interest in him having gotten stronger. She had apparently no idea of the age disparity between her and Peter, and mistakenly assumed, after he left in a rush, that he was a married man. When she managed to unmask him and realized how young he truly was, she was repulsed. The shock and embarrassment of such a discovery caused her to vomit on his costume.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is next seen trying to assassinate the Kingpin. However, [[Mysterio]] beats her to it.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #153. Marvel Comics.</ref> She then tries to steal the Zodiac Key from the Kingpin's vault. Mysterio, knowing that it contained great power, tried to steal it from her. Felicia tried to wish Mysterio to go away, but instead she accidentally caused the key to create a massive explosion. Shocked by what she did, she handed it over to Mysterio. Spider-Man came to the scene with [[Iron Man]]. Mysterio subdued Iron Man and then Spider-Man, Mysterio, and Felicia then fought over the key. Spider-Man won and then both he and Felicia decided to help the people who were caught in the middle of Felicia's mistake.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #152-154. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In this version, the Black Cat actually has short brunette hair, but wears a white-haired wig as part of her costume.

=== Spider-Gwen ===
On [[Spider-Gwen|Earth-65]], Felicia and her father are French and professional burglars. When her father stole Wilson Fisk's first dollar, Fisk sent [[Kingpin (Matt Murdock)|Matt Murdock]] to kill him. Felicia went on to become a famous musician after singing in the streets and has a band called the Black Cats. She had a concert in New York with Mary Jane as the opening act to which she invited Murdock with the intention to kill him. While there, Murdock unleashes the Hand where she is defended by [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]]. When she attempts to kill Matt, Spider-Woman knocks her out.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== What If? ===
In the ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if the Alien Costume had Possessed Spider-Man?'', after the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] forms a permanent bond with Spider-Man due to [[Mister Fantastic]] being unable to examine the web-slinger until it is too late to break them apart, Felicia goes on a brief crime spree until she learns that the symbiote—which here lives on adrenaline from superhumans—has abandoned the now-deceased Spider-Man in favor of the [[Hulk]]; she favors killing the Hulk over the objections of the other heroes. After Spider-Man's funeral, she is contacted by the Kingpin, who helps her develop a weapon that will kill the symbiote in exchange for a lifetime of service from her; despite the heroes having already defeated the symbiote thanks to the actions of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Black Bolt]], with [[Doctor Strange]] being about to banish it, Felicia kills the symbiote anyway, subsequently berating the heroes for not knowing the price she had to pay to ensure that justice was done.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In another storyline, Spider-Man marries the Black Cat rather than Mary Jane – [[Alistair Smythe]]'s attack having left Mary Jane injured in this reality, leaving Peter doubting his ability to look after her, with he and Felicia rekindling their romance while fighting supervillains together, but their relationship is complicated by such factors as Peter and Felicia being unable to live together in order to preserve his secret identity. After Felicia's carelessness results in Spider-Man's identity being discovered by an unidentified informant, combined with her own jealousy over Peter's continued friendship with Mary Jane, she is killed by [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] after he mistakenly assumes she attempted to kill Mary Jane, resulting in Peter forming a romantic relationship with [[Silver Sable]] as the two bond over their shared grief at the loss of their loved ones.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #20-21.

Her father, [[Walter Hardy|John Hardesky]], was tricked by the Nazis into sneaking into an American lab during [[World War II]] to memorize the super-soldier formula that created [[Captain America]] and report back to the [[Red Skull]]. At the last moment, Hardesky realized the deception and ran away to a life of crime. In the present, he was held in a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prison before the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] breaks him out. On Kingpin's behalf, [[Doctor Octopus]] kidnaps Felicia as leverage and to use her as a guinea pig for an improved super-soldier formula.

=== Film ===
* Black Cat appeared in early scripts for the live-action film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' as part of a subplot in which she tries to convince [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Spider-Man]] to give up being Peter Parker. This idea was to contrast with the other subplot of Peter giving up being Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/movie-legends-revealed-did-doc-ock-and-mary-jane-nearly-date-in-spider-man-2/ |title=Movie Legends Revealed: Did Doc Ock and Mary Jane Nearly Date in 'Spider-Man 2'? |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> Though she was removed in later scripts, the Black Cat and her subplot are used in the video game based on the film. Felicia Hardy was then originally supposed to appear in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'', though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat, as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new super-powered figure called the '''Vulturess'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieline.com/2009/12/exclusive-spider-man-4-circling-john-malkovich-anne-hathaway.php?page=all |title=EXCLUSIVE: Spider-Man 4 Circling John Malkovich, Anne Hathaway |publisher=MoveLine |date=December 8, 2009 |access-date=December 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213005246/http://www.movieline.com/2009/12/exclusive-spider-man-4-circling-john-malkovich-anne-hathaway.php?page=all |archive-date=December 13, 2009 }}</ref> In March 2013, Raimi stated that [[Anne Hathaway]] would have played Black Cat if ''Spider-Man 4'' had been made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/175363-sam-raimi-confirms-that-anne-hathaway-would-have-been-his-black-cat-in-spider-man-4 |title=Sam Raimi Confirms That Anne Hathaway Would Have Been His Black Cat in Spider-Man 4 |publisher=SuperHeroHype.com |date=March 5, 2013}}</ref>

* In March 2017, it was reported that [[Sony Pictures]] was developing a Black Cat and [[Silver Sable]]-centered film with writer [[Christopher Yost]]. It was intended to be a part of a [[shared universe]] called the [[Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters]], which is centered on characters from the ''Spider-Man'' mythology and began with the live-action film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' in 2018.

She later informs Spider-Man that [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] has kidnapped his wife [[Mary Jane Watson]] and the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] is attacking a power plant owned by Omni-Tech. Black Cat volunteers to go after Rhino on her own so he can save Mary Jane, but Spider-Man insists that they fight the Rhino together. After being injured in the ensuing fight, Black Cat is captured by [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Cletus Kasady|Carnage]], though Spider-Man is able to rescue her later on. At the end of the game, Black Cat calls Venom and [[Captain America]] to help rescue Spider-Man from Doctor Octopus' self-destructing base.
* Black Cat appears as a supporting character in the main console version of the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (2004 video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' film tie-in game, voiced by [[Holly Fields]].<ref name="btva" /> Similarly to the comics, this version is a master thief who develops an interest in Spider-Man. She steals an artifact from a museum and attempts to escape, but Spider-Man gives chase. After he catches up with her, he persuades her to return the artifact and the two of them eventually become close allies; working together to stop various crimes over the course of their subsequent meetings. Throughout the game, Black Cat tries to persuade Spider-Man to "ditch" his normal life for a permanent life as Spider-Man. While she is ultimately unsuccessful, she understands his decision.
* Black Cat appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Audrey Wasilewski]].<ref name="btva" /> She joins [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to help stop the P.H.A.N.T.O.M. invasion shortly before Spider-Man was sent to investigate the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s' presence in [[Tokyo]].

Following her defeat, Black Cat reveals that she is actually a [[double agent]] trying to thwart the Kingpin's illegal activities in an attempt to impress Spider-Man, for whom she still has feelings. The player is then presented with the choice of rejecting or returning her feelings; if the latter choice is made, Spider-Man will work with Black Cat against the Kingpin. Regardless of the choice made, Black Cat will become an ally. Later in the game, amidst a [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion, Black Cat gets infected by one of the creatures and attacks Spider-Man, who defeats her with Mary Jane Watson's help. However, Black Cat is left grievously wounded by the battle, forcing Spider-Man to choose between leaving her in Mary Jane's care or infecting her with another symbiote to heal her. If the latter choice is made, Black Cat will become Spider-Man's "queen" in one of the game's two endings, in which he takes over the symbiote army.
** In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] versions of the game, Black Cat is placed under mind control by [[Spencer Smythe]] before Spider-Man defeats her and is faced with the choice of either destroying the mind-control device to free her or allowing it to kill her so he can claim the device for himself.

Though she escaped after realizing the extent of Alchemax's corruption, they created clones of her as a security force. One in particular was given the [[Vanisher]]'s teleportation powers, instilled with extreme [[agoraphobia]] so that she would not be tempted to escape their corporate headquarters, upgraded with cybernetic weaponry, and led to believe they force-fed her anti-aging pills.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcBx6fBP8sA  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/OcBx6fBP8sA |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Spider-Man: Edge of Time Video – GC 11: Behind the Scenes with Katee Sackhoff |publisher=YouTube|access-date=June 29, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref> After defeating several other Black Cat clones, Spider-Man encounters and fights the special clone.
