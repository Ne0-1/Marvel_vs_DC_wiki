The '''Black Cat''' (Felicia Hardy), is a fictional character in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Vol.1'' #194 ([[July]], [[1979]]).  She was created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Keith Pollard]]. 

==Character biography==

The Black Cat is a costumed [[cat burglar]] and sometime crimefighter who has been romantically involved with [[Spider-Man]] in the past. Although the character started out as a [[Catwoman]] homage, she has since evolved in a different direction than her predecessor.

The character has been the occasional star of mini-series, though she most frequently appears as a supporting character in the cast of various [[Spider-Man]] comics and other titles set in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The Black Cat began a career in crime out of respect and adoration for her cat burglar father, but kept it on as a misguided attempt to attract the attentions of Spider-Man. Felicia and Peter Parker/Spider-Man have been very close in the past, and she is fully aware of his secret identity.

Initially, Felicia's abilities were 100% natural, with the 'accidents' which seemed to befall those who crossed her path being merely well-planned [[stunt]]s and [[trap]]s. After her near-death at the hands of [[Owl (comics)|The Owl]] and [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #72, Felicia feared that her lack of powers made her a vulnerability to Spider-Man, and that she would lose him. While Spider-Man was away in the "[[Secret Wars]]", Felicia turned to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], and made a pact with him in return for his scientists giving her super-powers. She kept the secret from Peter for quite some time. What she didn't realise was that her newly-gained genuine 'bad luck' power was infectious, and that it was permanently jinxing Spider-Man. That of course was the Kingpin's plan all along.

She broke up with Spider-Man, and [[Doctor Strange]] removed her bad luck power, changing her other abilities in the process. Since then she has settled into a life of her own, albeit one which regularly intertwines with Peter's. She recently dated [[Flash Thompson]] for a while, primarily to irritate Peter. Recently, [[Mary Jane Watson]] and the Black Cat have become close friends - in spite of their once intense rivalry over Peter. She bought some equipment from the [[Tinkerer]], and occasionally teams up with Spider-Man.

==Personality==
Originally portrayed as an unstable obsessive, Felicia Hardy evolved into a strong-willed and clever foil to Spider-Man.  While pursuing a life of crime, she very occasionally threw caution to the winds when her greed got the better of her.  She could be similarly reckless when it came to her relationships.  (When pursuing Spider-Man's affections, she once set him up so that he would be caught with her in the commision of a crime -- hoping he'd then be forced to turn outlaw and they could then be together.)  She could also be quite superficial (when Peter Parker revealed his identity to Felicia, she begged him to put his mask back on -- she couldn't deal with the thought of Spider-Man as an average guy) and, appropriately enough, catty.  Again, she has grown considerably since then.

Felicia is also a fun-loving, vivacious, thrillseeker who enjoys being the Black Cat for the adventure it provides.  She is also a loyal friend.

She is also quite sensual, a bit of a flirt, and enjoys companionship.

==Associates and Antagonists==
Virtually all of Felicia Hardy's enemies and acquaintances come from the [[Spider-Man Family]].
*'''Peter Parker/Spider-Man''' - Originally antagonists, Peter and Felicia fell into a intense (and primarily physical) romance when she reformed.  However, since her attraction was more towards Spider-Man than Peter Parker, their relationship was doomed to failure.  They are currently good friends and gladly help each other out of tight spots.  Felicia realizes now that breaking up with Peter was a mistake -- she is still "crushing" on Spider-Man . . . and Peter Parker.
*'''Mary Jane Watson-Parker''' - Peter's wife and erstwhile rival for his affections.  Surprisingly, the two women are quite close and friendly.
*'''Flash Thompson''' - Friend of the Parkers, Felicia began a relationship with him in order to dump him in order to get back at Peter for marrying someone else.  Ironically, she actually came to love Flash and was dumped by him instead.

==Powers and abilities==

Initially, the Black Cat had no [[superhuman]] abilities. It was later revealed that she had a latent [[mutant]] ability to affect [[probability]] fields. This ability was activated through artificial means. It entails that under stress she is subconsciously able to cause anyone in her immediate vicinity that she perceives as a threat to be susceptible to freak accidents, like guns jamming and exploding, or tripping on objects, etc. This ability also had the side effect of eventually causing problems for anyone spending long periods of time around her. Doctor Strange eventually tampered with her powers removing that unwanted side-effect.

The Black Cat has reflexes, agility, and stamina of an Olympic level acrobat. She is physically very strong and athletic and has great physical endurance. She is an excellent street fighter capable of taking on several armed male assailants and incapacitating them without being injured herself.

The Black Cat has also acquired several devices from the Tinkerer that increase her agility and heighten her strength. She wears ear rings that interact with the balance centers of her brain to grant her enhanced agility. Her [[costume]] enhances her strength in some unrevealed manner, but apparently not quite to a superhuman degree. The gloves of her costume have [[retractable]] [[claw]]s at the fingertips which enable her to tear through most surfaces and easily scale walls. In addition to this the costume is extremely distracting and [[provocative]], making it difficult for a male assailant to concentrate on what he is doing. Finally, she wears contact lenses that enable her to see in the dark. Using this equipment the Black Cat has been able to successfully best enemies who have superhuman abilities.

The Black Cat carries a repelling and grappling hook which enables her to swing from buildings in a manner similar to Spider-Man, though not quite as fast.

==Publication history==
Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] began writing the ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' miniseries in 2002. After the third issue the series went on a hiatus until [[2005]], when Smith revealed he had finally finished writing the scripts. [http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=36769]. Smith has stated "While I have zero defense for my lateness (particularly when folks like [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis]] turn out great stories in multiple books on a monthly basis), I will say this: it's a much better story now that it would've been had I completed it back in '02."

===[[Ultimate Marvel]]===

The Black Cat is Felicia Hardy, a young woman who blames her fatherâ€™s death on [[Wilson Fisk]], aka Kingpin. Seeking revenge, she stole a priceless tablet that he was going to use on his comatose wife. Kingpin hired the assassin Elektra to retrieve it, and when Black Cat threw it into the harbor Elektra threw one of her sais into the Black Cat's chest, sending the thief over the edge. She was presumed dead, though no body was found.

She later returned during a gang war, stopping Hammerhead from shooting Spider-Man in the right temple.  Later, after the crisis was resolved, she passionately kissed Spider-Man through his mask, her previous interest in him having gotten stronger.  She had apparently no idea of the age disparity between her and Peter, and mistakenly assumed, after he left in a rush, that he was a married man. When she managed to unmask him and realized how young he really is, she was revulsed and threw up.

In this version, the Black Cat actually has short brunette hair, and wears a white-haired wig in her secret identity. As a side note, this wig has proven itself to stick really tightly to the scalp. More than once, Elektra yanked at it really hard, and it stayed in place.

===[[MC2]]===
In the alternate future comics known as [[MC2]], Felicia Hardy married Flash Thompson and had at least one child-- Felicity-- before they divorced.    In this continuity, she has apparently retired the identity of the Black Cat and runs a private detective agency.  She has begun a romantic relationship with a woman she works with, a fact that has produced much tension between herself and her daughter.  (There has been no implication that Felicity has a problem with the lesbian aspect, but instead it appears that she blames her mother for the divorce.  The exact chronology of these events has not been established.) Felicity temporarily adopted the identity of the [[Scarlet Spider]].

Felicia Hardy and her alter ego, Black Cat, was depicted as the first potential love interest for both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, rivaled only by Mary Jane Watson. Felicia was the well bred, well to do daughter of business woman Anastasia Hardy, and had only vague memories of her father, a career jewel thief known as the Cat, who had been imprisoned for years because he had memorized the World War II super soldier formula. As her civilian identity, Felicia was a slightly petite (unlike her alter ego) but none the less very attractive blonde with a crisp brogue and a sharp mind. She briefly dated Michael Moerbius and later Jason Macendale, who was revealed to be the series Hobgoblin, and the revelation left her devastated.

In this version of her character, Felicia was experimented on by the Kingpin/Wilson Fisk with an upgraded type of the super-soldier project used to create [[Captain America]], gifting her with great physical strength agility and dexterity, and the ability to alter her physical appearance i.e. hair color to white and costume change (thus transforming her into the more recognizeable "Comic" form.) She has the ability to emit some sort of knockout gas from her wrists and an extendable cable and grappling hooks. She appears to have claws but they may only be part of her costume, allowing her to tear/cut through steel and concrete.

The Black Cat also makes an appearance in the Spiderman 2 Movie Video Game, as an unsual seductive ally of the web slinger. Most missions involve Spiderman chasing her, sometimes for no apparent reason.
