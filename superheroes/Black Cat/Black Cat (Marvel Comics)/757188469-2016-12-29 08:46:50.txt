==Publication history==
In 1979, creator [[Marv Wolfman]] was looking for a female foil for [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. He decided to base a character on a [[Tex Avery]] cartoon "[[Bad Luck Blackie]]", in which a black cat brought misfortune to anyone in close proximity.<ref name="cbulr22">{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/10/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-22/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #22! }}</ref> The Black Cat's costume and appearance were designed by [[Dave Cockrum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002527565.cfm|title=Saying Goodbye to Dave Cockrum|accessdate=2007-06-21|author=Matt Powell|date=2006-11-27|publisher=Wizard.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228085620/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002527565.cfm|archivedate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>

When Wolfman changed writing assignments within [[Marvel Comics]] to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', he brought his character with him. He made considerable changes to the character and her appearance over this time; the Black Cat intended to debut in ''Spider-Woman'' had only her name and powers in common with the one who finally appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref>{{cite journal| last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= August 2006|title= Marvel's Dark Angel: ''Back Issue'' Gets Caught in Spider-Woman's Web|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 17|pages= 57–63|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> On the bottom of the [[Letter to the editor|letters page]] of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194, a [[thumbnail]] of the intended cover for ''Spider-Woman'' #9 appears along with a rejected cover for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194.  Wolfman said in an interview, "I didn't plan Black Cat to be in Spidey. I created her for Spider-Woman (look at the letter column of the first B.C. story and you’ll see). I then decided to leave Spider-Woman and moved her over. So, I never even thought of [[Catwoman]] when I did her. I got the idea for her from a Tex Avery cartoon, Bad Luck Blackie."<ref name="cbulr22" />

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] began writing the ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]'' miniseries in 2002. After the third issue the series went on a hiatus until 2005, when Smith revealed he had finally finished writing the scripts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=36769 |title=The impossible has happened... |accessdate=2007-06-21 |author=Kevin (Presumably Kevin Smith) |date=2005-07-28 |publisher=View Askew Message Board }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Smith has stated, "While I have zero defense for my lateness (particularly when folks like [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis]] turn out great stories in multiple books on a monthly basis), I will say this: it's a much better story now than it would've been had I completed it back in '02."

In the mid-2000s, she starred alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a limited comic book miniseries titled ''Claws''. A sequel to this miniseries, entitled ''Claws II'', began publication in July 2011. Black Cat was a lead character in the 2006-2007 ''Heroes for Hire'' series.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Spider194.png|thumb|''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #194 (July 1979): The Black Cat's debut. Cover art by [[Al Milgrom]].]]
Felicia Hardy was born in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Her father [[Walter Hardy|Walter]] pretended to be a travelling salesman, but was a world-renowned cat burglar who, before his arrest, encouraged her to never settle for second best. If she loved basketball, she should work to become a basketball player and not just a cheerleader.

''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do]]'' reveals that, as a freshman at Empire State University, Felicia was [[rape]]d by her boyfriend Ryan. Hating the idea of being a victim, she trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics, intent on killing her rapist. Finally, after months of preparing, she set out for revenge, but before she could find him, Ryan was killed in a [[drunk driving]] accident. Furious that she was denied the chance for revenge, Hardy decided to utilize her new skills to follow in her father's footsteps. After amassing a fortune in stolen items, Felicia adopted her costumed identity.

She first donned the Black Cat costume in order to break her father out of prison. On the same night, she met Spider-Man. Unfortunately for Felicia, her father died, and she then faked her own death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #194-195</ref> Despite her antipathy towards men, Felicia felt a kinship with this lone hero; Spider-Man was the first man she felt she could trust and she grew to believe herself in love with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #204-205</ref> Felicia looked for a way to earn his trust and continued with the Black Cat persona as a misguided attempt to attract his affection. Seeing the good in Felicia, Spider-Man made every attempt to have her criminal record expunged.

Felicia had been placed in a mental institution, but escaped. She joined forces with Spider-Man against the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. She was granted conditional amnesty, and again convinced Spider-Man that she had died.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #226-227</ref>

The Black Cat finally found the opportunity to prove herself after learning the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] controlled an incredibly powerful detonator. The [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] planned to use the weapon to hold New York City hostage. Meanwhile, [[Doctor Octopus]] planned to use the weapon to destroy the city altogether. However, the Black Cat was able to use her abilities to steal the item first and protect it from all parties. She gave the detonator to Spider-Man and became the target of Doctor Octopus' revenge. Although Spider-Man was able to tear off his mechanical appendages, Octopus was still able to mentally control them and hold the Black Cat still while his men opened fire. Spider-Man barely got her to the hospital in time and as they operated on the dozens of bullet and knife wounds, Peter realized just how much he cared for Felicia.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #74-76</ref>

After she recovered, they began a relationship and soon Peter revealed his identity to her. Felicia had great difficulty accepting the fact that Peter was just a man beneath the mask and could not understand his need for a civilian life. Peter was hurt, but continued the relationship since it was the first time he did not need to hide his life as Spider-Man from someone.

Initially, the "accidents" which seemed to befall those who crossed the Black Cat's path were merely well-planned [[stunt]]s and [[wikt:trap|trap]]s. After her near-death experience,<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #75</ref> Felicia feared her lack of superpowers made her a liability to Spider-Man. She was terrified that his overwhelming need to protect her would eventually get him killed. So, Felicia sought a way to make herself Spider-Man's equal. After learning [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] was missing, [[Henry Pym]] would not return her calls, and being rejected by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], Felicia was offered an opportunity to undergo the same process that was used to create the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Human Fly (comics)|Fly]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #87-89</ref> The Kingpin chose to use it on the Black Cat as payback for a theft she committed. Scared and ashamed of being empowered by the Kingpin of crime, she decided to keep her new abilities a secret from Peter. While Spider-Man was gone during the "[[Secret Wars]]", Felicia searched for him at [[Avengers Mansion]]; [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] offered her the chance to join the Avengers, which she declined, being interested solely in Spider-Man. Upon his return, her 'bad luck' power turned out to be infectious, and began to jinx Spider-Man, which was exactly the Kingpin's intent. Feeling a wall of secrets growing between them, Spider-Man broke up with Felicia.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100</ref> Felicia then began a "Robin Hood crusade," stealing from the rich to give to the poor.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #112</ref>

Peter soon realized something was amiss with his own luck and enlisted the aid of [[Doctor Strange]] to remove the "hex" on him. By doing so, he altered the hex's source and changed the Black Cat's powers in the process. She soon found she had heightened [[superhuman strength|strength]], [[agility]], [[wikt:stability|balance]], [[Visual perception|vision]], and retractable [[claw]]s. While burglarizing the mercenary known as the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]], Black Cat was attacked by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], the Foreigner's hitman; Spider-Man saved her life.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #115</ref>

The Black Cat updated her look and her attitude and rekindled her relationship with Spider-Man. She made peace with his need for a normal life as Peter Parker and stood by him while he was being accused of murder as Spider-Man. Together, they tracked down the source of the elaborate scheme to frame him and fought the Foreigner. Eventually, just as his life seemed to be coming together, Spider-Man came home to discover Black Cat discussing her plans to ruin his life. He followed her to find she had never forgiven him for breaking up with her and in revenge became the Foreigner's lover.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #115-117</ref> She then battled and defeated Sabretooth.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #119</ref> Her apartment was fire-bombed by the Foreigner's hitman Blaze, and she began living with Peter Parker.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #123-124</ref> During her ruse against Peter and despite her anger, Felicia began to fall back onto her desire to love him. She soon donned another new costume. Spider-Man then discovered her association with the Foreigner. She cleared Spider-Man of a murder charge. In the end, the Black Cat doublecrossed the Foreigner and left for Paris to find a new life,<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #128-129</ref> which unexpectedly pushed Peter to find support and a new relationship with [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #290-293</ref>

Years later, the Black Cat returned to America, and went "shopping" with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 2 #10</ref> She returned to her original costume, went to seek out Peter Parker, and in a chance confrontation with [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] learned that Peter had married Mary Jane Watson.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #316</ref> Angry and jealous, Felicia began harassing the couple, taunting Peter as she dated his friend [[Flash Thompson]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #329</ref> She began physically threatening Mary Jane, confronting her and swearing to ruin their marriage.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #331</ref> She saved a powerless Spider-Man from the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], but then all her powers were rendered inert by one of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s devices. She began to believe that she sincerely cared for Thompson,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #342-343</ref> but he broke up with her when he found out her secret. The Black Cat later made up with both Spider-Man and Mary Jane, becoming close friends with them.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} She was one of the few to stand with Spider-Man and Venom against [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and his "brood" in the [[Maximum Carnage]] arc. Originally she sided with Venom's belief that the only way to defeat Carnage was to kill him, but at the end, she fought alongside Spider-Man in his effort to battle the chaos with compassion.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} After Spider-Man used a device to remove his superhuman abilities, the Black Cat aided him in finding the device again in order to restore them. In the process, the Black Cat's cat-like abilities were completely erased.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} She subsequently purchased equipment from the [[Tinkerer]] to incorporate into her costume in order to compensate for her lost abilities, and occasionally teamed up with Spider-Man.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

After Spider-Man unmasked himself, the Black Cat was enraged, because she had felt that they shared a bond over knowing his identity, which she described as "sexy".{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Though she is dating Thomas Fireheart (a.k.a. [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]), her new sexual interest notes that Felicia may still have some romantic inclinations toward Peter.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #27, #34</ref>

Since Spider-Man was with her at the time of the robbery he knew that she was innocent, and he recruited Matt Murdock (a.k.a. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]) to help prove her innocence.

In the Slide-Away Casino, [[Melter]] and [[Killer Shrike]] take [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] to the back room where Black Cat is waiting. Black Cat shows him various items and tells him that even she cannot steal everything and sometimes must pay for them and asks him how is she supposed to do that when nobodies like him do not pay her weekly cut. Ringer tells her he did not pay because he was captured by Silk, owed the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] for getting him out of jail, and had to pay the [[Tinkerer]] for new equipment. He also tells Black Cat they worked in some works before and remembers her having a heart and asks for compassion. Black Cat hesitates long enough for the Ringer to attack them, hitting her in her arm before she takes him down. Black Cat tells Ringer that he will make three times the cut and will also serve as an example by having Killer Shrike and Melter beat him up. Black Cat is surprised Ringer could tag her as she normally is more lucky. She wonder if it was luck to remind her of who she is now and tests her luck with one of the casino's machines and wins. Black Cat notices that lately the harder she listens to the part of her that tells her not to let anyone put her down, the more her luck gets off the charts. She remembers her life in the elite class before she lost it all. Melter and Killer Shriek bring in Ringer and Black Cat tells him to spread the word that no one steals from her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #16</ref> Two years ago, Felicia Hardy presents a painting in an elite party. In the present day at a museum, Regina Venderkamp, the woman who bought all the items confiscated from the Black Cat in an auction, presents the same painting that Felicia did. However, the lights go out for a moment and the painting is gone. An enraged Regina and her bodyguards go to her apartment only to find all of her treasures gone. She goes upstairs to see if she also took everything there, despite a bodyguard protesting since Black Cat could still be there. Black Cat then appears and says she couldn't leave without Regina learning that no one takes from Black Cat without paying. Regina orders her bodyguards to attack, but Black Cat quickly takes them out. She reflects that her bad luck powers seem to work better when she is ruthless and she may have been holding back before. Black Cat throws one of her claws to Regina's neck causing her to pass out. Hours later, Regina wakes up handcuffed to a chair at Black Cat's hideout. Black Cat contemplates almost all of the items that were confiscated and those she retrieved with only one missing. In J. Jonah Jameson Sr. and Aunt May's apartment, they contemplate the last item the only thing they got at the auction and go watch TV unaware that the Black Cat plans to steal it back.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #17</ref> Following Spider-Man's fight with [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] at [[Parker Industries]], Black Cat places the statue with the rest of her things while having Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina Venderkamp tied up. Jay asks her why did she took them as she doesn't need money and they didn't do nothing to her. Felicia pours gasoline around her apartment and tells Jay he is wrong as they bought her things in the auction, a collection she spent years acquiring. She tells him that's the problem with possessions, they can break, you can lose them or they can be taken. And when that happens, everyone thinks they can take what's yours unless you prove them wrong. She says that nothing and no one will have that hold on him before setting the apartment on fire. When Spider-Man arrives, May warns him that the Black Cat is still in there and Peter asks Felicia for help. She tells him to save them if he wants as she made her point and the more people know the better. Parker tries to convince her that this isn't her but she tells him that the Felicia he knew is gone and she is done being who others want. She tells her that she controls her fate and anyone who stands before that will also be gone. Spider-Man manages to save Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina, who screams at him for not saving her things before May shushes her, telling her that people are what count, not things and Spider-Man knows that. In the Slide-A-Way Casino, Black Cat tells her men that they have seen what happens when they stay on her good side and what happens when they cross her. But from now on, there's nothing holding her back and no limit to what she will do.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #18</ref>

Black Cat later established a criminal empire which is soon disbanded thanks to [[Gwenpool]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref>''Howard the Duck'' Vol. 6 #1-3</ref>

===Civil War II===
During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Black Cat took in Kingpin's former minion Janus Jardeesh as the latest member of her gang. She was later informed about Janus undergoing Terrigenesis and arrived at the scene. During one of the heists by Black Cat's gang, Black Cat encountered the Avengers. She, [[Fancy Dan]], and Janus Jardeesh evaded capture. Afterwards, Black Cat decided to lay low for a while.<ref>''Civil War II: Kingpin'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, the Black Cat had no [[superhuman]] abilities. Later, a test induced by the Kingpin gave her the psionic ability to affect [[probability]] fields; essentially, she could produce "bad luck" for her enemies.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #89</ref> The "bad luck" power entails that under stress she is subconsciously able to cause anyone in her immediate vicinity that she perceives as a threat to be susceptible to freak accidents, like guns jamming and exploding, or tripping on objects. This ability also had the [[side effect]] of eventually causing problems for anyone spending long periods of time around her.

[[Doctor Strange]] eventually tampered with her powers that briefly removed her bad luck abilities, along with the unwanted side effect. However, this magical tampering temporarily endowed her with cat-like abilities, giving her [[night vision]], retractable talons in her fingertips, superhuman speed, strength, agility and endurance, proportionate to a cat.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #116</ref> Her "bad luck" powers were eventually restored by Doc Tramma through the use of [[cybernetics]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #12</ref>

The Black Cat has reflexes, agility, and stamina of an Olympic level acrobat. She is physically very strong and athletic and has great physical endurance. She is an excellent street fighter capable of taking on several armed assailants and incapacitating them without being injured herself. She is trained in several [[martial arts]] styles.

The Black Cat has also acquired several devices from the [[Tinkerer]] that increase her agility and heighten her strength. She wears earrings that interact with the balance centers of her brain to grant her enhanced agility. She has contact lenses that let her see in various ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]. Her costume contains micro-[[Servomechanism|servos]] that enhance her strength above normal human levels. The gloves of her costume contain steel micro-filaments, which form retractable claws at the fingertips when she flexes her fingers (triggering a magnetic surge which condenses the filaments into polarized talons) which enable her to tear through most surfaces and easily scale walls. Using this equipment, the Black Cat has been able to beat enemies who have superhuman abilities.

The Black Cat has a miniature grappling hook device hidden in the "fur" of each glove, designed by her father [[Walter Hardy]], which enables her to swing from buildings in a manner similar to Spider-Man, though not quite as fast. She can also use the cable from this device as a tightrope, wall scaling device, swing line, or as a weapon in combat.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
[[File:MangaBlackCat.jpg|thumb|right|Marvel Mangaverse Black Cat. Art by Tommy Ohtsuka.]]

In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] continuity, Black Cat is cybernetically enhanced. She was originally a simple thief, who stole a cursed magical amulet for its monetary value, but this act attracted the attention of [[Alternative versions of Daredevil#Marvel Mangaverse|Matt Murdock, the Devil Hunter]], and she was cut in half. The Kingpin of Crime reconstructed her body with cybernetics, including a shut-down mechanism he planned to activate if she failed to serve him. After completing her mission for the Kingpin, he claimed to have permanently deactivated the mechanism, but whether he kept his word or not remains to be seen. She is still [[Spider-Man]]'s old flame, but in the New Mangaverse storyline (with Spider-Man having chosen [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson#Mangaverse|Mary Jane Watson]] over her) she is trying to move on, and is now showing a romantic interest in [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Mangaverse|Wolverine]] though by the end of the story arc it is clear that she has a hidden agenda as she is later seen with [[Nick Fury]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

=== Marvel Zombies ===
A zombified Black Cat is briefly seen battling [[Iron Fist (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Iron Fist]]. He punches a hole straight through her.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

However, somehow (in ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'') during events set after her appearance above (which happened in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]''), she appears alive and well, also uninfected on one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Carriers.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

When asked about this during his Joe Friday 100, Joe Q explained that "the MZ world is not exactly like the regular Marvel Universe. Our Captain America is their “Colonel America”. Their Reed Richards is evil. A lot of the costumes are from different eras in our world. We assumed it was obvious from the context that in the MZ world, Felicia Hardy has a twin sister, Felicity Hardy, who is the costumed adventurer known as Night Cat."<ref>[http://classic.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/JoeFridays100_2.html Joe Fridays - Week 100, A Weekly Q&A With Joe Quesada, Part 2]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Newsarama]]</ref>

In the alternate future comics known as [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Felicia Hardy married [[Flash Thompson#MC2|Flash Thompson]] and had two children, [[Felicity Hardy|Felicity]] and Gene, before they divorced.{{Issue|date=April 2011}} In this continuity, she has apparently retired the identity of the Black Cat and runs a private detective agency. She has begun a romantic relationship with Diana, a woman she works with, a fact that has produced tension between herself and her daughter.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Howard the Human===
Felecia is an anthropomorphic black cat in this reality from a ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' Battleworld, where she is a crime boss and known as "The Cat Lady." She hired private investigator Howard the Human to find a spy within her organization, but someone was able to find him before Howard, and killed him.{{issue|date=September 2015}} The Cat Lady then gave Howard twelve hours to find the assassin, otherwise she would kill him. Howard  figured out that the informant was playing possum on orders from a simian version of Wilson Fisk who wanted to take his main rival, the Cat Lady, down. She confronts him and Adrian Toomes at a bar but they are both arrested as Howard planned. Howard kept the informant, Peter Possum, alive to get the reward money from the district attorney and to have Peter testify against Felecia.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

===Spider-Man: Fairy Tales===
Issue #1 of ''[[Spider-Man: Fairy Tales]]'' follows the fairy tale of [[Little Red Riding Hood]].

Mary Jane owns a black cat named '''Felicia'''. #3, a Japanese ghost story, features a demoness resembling a humanoid black cat, with long white hair.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

===Marvel Noir===
In [[Marvel Noir]], Felicia Hardy is the owner of "The Black Cat", a [[speakeasy]] that caters to the most powerful and corrupt in New York City.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir #1''</ref> In ''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes without a Face'', she takes on a more prominent role, sheltering Peter after he is almost killed by [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], as well as dating [[Crime Master]]. Like most incarnations, Felicia has a relationship with [[Marvel Noir|Spider-Man Noir]]. Crime Master slashes her when he finds out about this, but before passing out, she alerts the FBI that he is in league with [[Otto Octavius]] and his inhumane experiments. The final panel of the series shows her with a mask similar to [[Madame Masque]], angrily refusing to see Spider-Man since she blames him for her scars.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Mask Issues #1-4''</ref>

During the [[Spider-Verse]] storyline, she was assaulted by Kingpin and his men in hopes of extracting the identity of Spider-Man, but with nothing to lose anymore she retains her silence. She was then used as a hostage to lure Spider-Man in accepting Mysterio's challenge. After the battle, she would secretly grab the blood of Spider-Man which was extracted earlier to avoid it falling into Mysterio's hands.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

She would later appear tending to an injured Spider-Man Noir (accompanied by Silk and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]) while on the run from the [[Spider-Verse|Inheritors]].{{issue|date=December 2014}}

===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===
Felicia Hardy makes her appearance in issue #17 of the series. She is a teenager who transfers to the same high school attended by Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. Felicia is considered "bad luck" due to her violent past and confrontational personality. She flirts with Flash and challenges his girlfriend, [[Liz Allan]], to a fight, which was merely a ruse to establish her reputation as a girl not to be messed with.<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' #17</ref>

===Supernaturals===
A different version of Felicia Hardy is part of a team led by [[Brother Voodoo]]. Unlike her 616 counterpart, this version of Black Cat possesses enchanted vocal abilities that allow her to alter the outcomes of events by speaking certain phrases aloud. (For example, at one point, saying "Break" causes a noose to snap.) This ability is shown to be useless once [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] tapes Felicia's mouth shut.<ref>''The Supernaturals'' #4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:ULTSM082.jpg|Ultimate Black Cat on the cover to ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #82 (November 2005). Art by [[Mark Bagley]].|200px|thumb]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the Black Cat is Felicia Hardy, a young woman who blames her father’s death on [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin]]. Seeking revenge, she stole a priceless tablet that he was going to use on his comatose wife. Kingpin hired the assassin [[Elektra (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Elektra]] to retrieve it. When Black Cat threw it into the harbor, Elektra threw one of her [[sai (weapon)|sai]] into the Black Cat's chest, sending the thief over the edge. She was presumed dead, though no body was found.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53</ref>

She later returned during a gang war, stopping [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Hammerhead|Hammerhead]] from shooting [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] in the right temple.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #81</ref> She later expressed interest in working for Hammerhead if it would mean getting rid of the Kingpin although Spider-Man opposed this.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #82</ref> She later assisted Hammerhead and Elektra in a confrontation against Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, Iron Fist and Spider-Man.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #84</ref>

Later, after the crisis was resolved, she passionately kissed Spider-Man through his mask, her previous interest in him having gotten stronger. She had apparently no idea of the age disparity between her and Peter, and mistakenly assumed, after he left in a rush, that he was a married man. When she managed to unmask him and realized how young he truly was, she was repulsed. The shock and embarrassment of such a discovery caused her to vomit on his costume.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #85</ref> She is next seen trying to assassinate the Kingpin. However, [[Mysterio]] beats her to it.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #153</ref> She then tries to steal the Zodiac Key from the Kingpin's vault. Mysterio, knowing that it contained great power, tried to steal it from her. Felicia tried to wish Mysterio to go away, but instead she accidentally caused the key to create a massive explosion. Shocked by what she did, she handed it over to Mysterio. Spider-Man came to the scene with [[Iron Man]]. Mysterio subdued Iron Man and then Spider-Man, Mysterio, and Felicia then fought over the key. Spider-Man won and then both he and Felicia decided to help the people who were caught in the middle of Felicia's mistake.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #152-154</ref>

In this version, the Black Cat actually has short brunette hair, but wears a white-haired wig as part of her costume.

===Spider-Gwen===
On [[Spider-Gwen|Earth-65]], Felicia and her father are French and professional burglars. When her father stole Wilson Fisk's first dollar, Fisk sent Matt Murdock to kill him. Felicia went on to become a famous musician after singing in the streets and has a band called the Black Cats. She had a concert in New York with Mary Jane as the opening act to which she invited Murdock with the intention to kill him. While there, Murdock unleashes the Hand where she is defended by [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]]. When she attempts to kill Matt, Spider-Woman knocks her out.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #5</ref>

===What If?===
In the ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if the Alien Costume had Possessed Spider-Man?'', after the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] forms a permanent bond with Spider-Man due to [[Mister Fantastic]] being unable to examine the web-slinger until it is too late to break them apart, Felicia goes on a brief crime spree until she learns that the symbiote—which here lives on adrenaline from superhumans—has abandoned the now-deceased Spider-Man in favor of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]; she favors killing the Hulk over the objections of the other heroes. After Spider-Man's funeral, she is contacted by the Kingpin, who helps her develop a weapon that will kill the symbiote in exchange for a lifetime of service from her; despite the heroes having already defeated the symbiote thanks to the actions of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Black Bolt]], with [[Doctor Strange]] being about to banish it, Felicia kills the symbiote anyway, subsequently berating the heroes for not knowing the price she had to pay to ensure that justice was done.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

In another storyline, Spider-Man marries the Black Cat rather than Mary Jane - [[Alistair Smythe]]'s attack having left Mary Jane injured in this reality, leaving Peter doubting his ability to look after her, with he and Felicia rekindling their romance while fighting supervillains together, but their relationship is complicated by such factors as Peter and Felicia being unable to live together in order to preserve his secret identity. After Felicia's carelessness results in Spider-Man's identity being discovered by an unidentified informant, combined with her own jealousy over Peter's continued friendship with Mary Jane, she is killed by [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] after he mistakenly assumes she attempted to kill Mary Jane, resulting in Peter forming a romantic relationship with [[Silver Sable]] as the two bond over their shared grief at the loss of their loved ones.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #20-21</ref>

===Television===
* Black Cat appeared in the 1980s ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series episode "Curiosity Killed the Spider-Man", voiced by Morgan Lofting.<ref>{{Cite episode |title = Curiosity Killed the Spider-Man |episodelink = |url = |series = Spider-Man |serieslink = Spider-Man (1981 TV series) |credits = |network = |station = |city = |airdate = |began = |ended = |season = |seriesno = |number = |minutes = |transcript = |transcripturl = |quote = }}</ref>[[File:Felicia Hardy in Spider-Man The Animated Series.jpg|right|thumb|Felicia Hardy in ''Spider-Man: The Animated Series.'']]
* Felicia Hardy/Black Cat appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'',{{vague|date=December 2011}}<!--which epsiodes did she appear in?--> voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. Her character was originally depicted as Peter Parker's first love interest before being eventually replaced in this role by [[Mary Jane Watson]], but dates [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] instead. It's revealed her father The Cat was fooled into sneaking into an American lab during [[World War II]], to memorize the super soldier formula that created [[Captain America]] and report back to the [[Red Skull]]. At the last moment, The Cat realized the deception and ran away to a life of crime. In the present, The Cat is in a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prison but is then broken out by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. [[Doctor Octopus]] (working for the Kingpin) kidnaps Felicia as leverage and to be used as a guinea pig for an improved super soldier formula. The formula proves a success, making her overall physical prowess comparable to Spider-Man and also gives her the ability to switch between her normal blond haired form and her empowered well-muscled white haired form at will; she then recruited [[Spider-Man]] to assist in a rescue attempt for her father. After [[Kraven the Hunter]] was believed to be creating havoc in [[New York City]], Black Cat helped make Spider-Man realize that Kraven was trying to help [[Calypso (comics)|Dr. Crawford]]. She was also featured in a smaller story arc where she was again kidnapped this time by [[Alistair Smythe]] to be used as leverage to get Spider-Man to kidnap either the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] or the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. It was later revealed that Smythe had developed a machine reversed engineered from the Time Tablet and Vulture's talons and that data extracted from the genetic and molecular structure of Scorpion (both Vulture and Scorpion suffered heavy exposure to Vulture's earlier prototypes) was needed. The three components were used in conjunction in an attempt to swap age and abilities of the baby [[Silvermane]] and Spider-Man but a rescue attempt by Black Cat, Vulture, and the freed Scorpion destroyed the machine and returned Silvermane to his proper age. After Morbius awakens as a vampire, she struggles at figuring out how to stop Morbius because of her personal feelings. She then finds herself teaming up with [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], Spider-Man, and Morbius to take down Blade's vampire mother who was using [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Connors]]'s genetic recombinator to create an army of vampires. She then decides to leave Spider-Man to work for Blade along with Morbius, but not before she admits her love for the web-slinger. She does come back however to help Spider-Man defeat [[Hydro-Man]] and also appears at Peter's and Mary Jane's wedding. Black Cat allies herself with Spider-Man and Kingpin fighting droids created by Smythe that are [[Wedding crashing|crashing]] the wedding. After Blade, Morbius, and Black Cat nearly succeeded in capturing Blade's mother, Black Cat was brought into the Secret War due to an effort by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Iron Man]], and Spider-Man. She is initially angry and wants to return to Earth. She nearly fell into a river of lava, but Spider-Man saved her by webbing Black Cat's ankle. When Red Skull's stronghold is attacked, she goes after Red Skull while the others are distracted trying to destroy the Cyber-Skulls. However she is seized by Doctor Octopus, covering her mouth. The other heroes are unable to attack with her hostage, but she is freed, though the two villains escape. She is later seen fighting them with other heroes before [[Doctor Doom]] sends them back to Earth. After the Secret War was over she was sent back to the exact time and place she was taken from with no memory of the war. Despite her aristocratic background she flirts, kisses, or dates other characters in her age range. She does so more than once with Spider-Man while dating another person. It is alluded to that her promiscuous nature is rooted in her relationship with her father. With him having left her when she was young, she constantly tries to fill that void and if a man disappoints her, leaves, dies, etc.; she turns to Spider-Man because he tends to "always be there" unlike her father.
* Black Cat/Felicia Hardy appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Tricia Helfer]]. Introduced in season one, she is depicted as simply a thief with no bad-luck probability abilities in "Persona" and her alter ego is revealed in "Opening Night". In season two, she tries to break her father [[Walter Hardy]] out of prison. Black Cat frequently flirts with Spider-Man, kissing the web-slinger to distract enough for her to escape.

===Film===
* Felicia Hardy appeared in early scripts for ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' in a subplot in which she tries to convince Spider-Man to give up being Peter Parker.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} This idea was to contrast the other subplot of Peter giving up being Spider-Man. Though she was cut from later scripts, the Black Cat and her subplot are used in the video game based on the film. Felicia Hardy was originally supposed to appear in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'' and be played by [[Anne Hathaway]], though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat, as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new super-powered figure called the Vulturess.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieline.com/2009/12/exclusive-spider-man-4-circling-john-malkovich-anne-hathaway.php?page=all |title=EXCLUSIVE: Spider-Man 4 Circling John Malkovich, Anne Hathaway |publisher=MoveLine|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=December 12, 2009}}</ref> However, in 2013 Raimi stated that Anne Hathaway would have played Black Cat if ''Spider-Man 4'' had been made.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/175363-sam-raimi-confirms-that-anne-hathaway-would-have-been-his-black-cat-in-spider-man-4|title= Sam Raimi Confirms That Anne Hathaway Would Have Been His Black Cat in Spider-Man 4|publisher=SuperHeroHype.com|date= March 5, 2013}}</ref>

===Video games===
* Black Cat made her video game debut as a playable character in the 1991 arcade game ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]'', a side-scrolling fighting game. Black Cat can scratch enemies, pounce on them with leaping kicks, or use her grappling hook like a whip to strike from a distance.
* Black Cat is a summon in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] game ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', where her attacks vary depending on whether the player is Spider-Man or [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. She also appears in many of the pages from the ''[[Maximum Carnage]]'' comic book that were shown between levels.
* In the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Personal computer|PC]], and [[Nintendo 64]] ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, Black Cat appears in the first stage giving gaming tips every time the player walks into a question mark, and reappears later in the game. She is knocked out by the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and kidnapped by [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] who have thugs pose as paramedics. Spider-Man eventually finds her and rescues her from the symbiote base. [[Jennifer Hale]] reprises her role from ''Spider-Man: The Animated Series''.
* Black Cat appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game, voiced by [[Holly Fields]]. She is not a playable character. During the game, Black Cat appears as a thief who develops an interest in Spider-Man. Throughout certain levels of the game Spider-Man has to meet with Black Cat in certain places on top of buildings; once met, Black Cat will usually race Spider-Man to another region which she claims to be trouble. During cutscenes in the game, Black Cat will continuously persuade Spider-Man to 'ditch' his normal life as Peter Parker for a permanent life as Spider-Man. Black Cat makes her first appearance during a theft at an art museum. She later reveals her identity as Black Cat before diving off a building and vanishing into the city below. She later leads Spider-Man to [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]'s location where she helps defeat the foe. Black Cat makes her final appearance in the game after Spider-Man helps her defeat a fleet of armed mechas, after which he tells her the world needs both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. She departs, telling Spider-Man "once I cross your path, I'm not so easy to get rid of." Two of the hint markers found in and around the city of the game also reveal tidbits of information about her.
* Black Cat is a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Audrey Wasilewski]]. Spider-Man encounters her outside of Doctor Octopus' secret lab in a Japanese industrial plant. During the game Black Cat's skills are best suited to the art of infiltration, but she is no pushover in a fight. Her grappling hook, usually employed to climb walls, is a quick and efficient weapon in her capable hands. After meeting Black Cat, she will assist Spider-Man throughout the chapter. During fights Black Cat wields her grappling hook and has two power moves called: Heaven's Claw and Tornado Claw.
* Black Cat appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', with [[Tricia Helfer]] reprising her role. Near the beginning of the game, she serves as the first boss having gone to work for the Kingpin, though after the fight she revealed in utter distress that it was a complex attempt to impress Spider-Man and comes on to him. If the player chooses the Red Suit path, Spider-Man rejects her advances stating that he both does not want her and cannot be with her as he leaves to go meet up with Moon Knight. If the player chooses the Black Suit path, Spider-Man accepts Black Cat's advances and stays the night with her. If the player choose her, she will also give Spider-Man missions to track down who was manufacturing weapons for Kingpin instead of [[Moon Knight]]. Sometime after helping Spider-Man, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and Kingpin's forces clear a rooftop full of symbiotes, Black Cat becomes possessed by a symbiote and fights Spider-Man. After the fight, Black Cat is gravely injured, freeing her of the symbiote. The player is then given two choices again. If the player takes the Red Suit path, she is brought on to a S.H.I.E.L.D medivac uttering her last conscious words to Mary-Jane "He really does love you". If the player chooses the Black Suit path, Spider-Man reinfects her with his more powerful symbiote to heal her leaving her in more control of her symbiote. Doing this will cause Mary-Jane to leave in tears. In one Black Suit ending, Spider-Man rules with the symbiote-controlled Black Cat by his side telling Spider-Man that she had offered him the entire city.
* The character is alluded in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''; Felicia Hardy's Noir version is referenced as [[Spider-Man Noir]]'s tip about [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and one of the background billboards in the [[Marvel 2099|2099]] era depicts Black Cat seemingly being used to advertise a shampoo brand.
* An exclusive 2099 incarnation of Black Cat appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', voiced by [[Katee Sackhoff]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118040024?refCatId=13 | work=Variety | first=Michael | last=Sullivan | title=Activision, Marvel enlist top VO talent | date=2011-07-18}}</ref> According to her in-game profile, Alchemax acquired the original Black Cat's DNA when she came to the company looking for a way to halt or reverse the aging process. But she escaped when she realised the extent of Alchemax's corruption, clones of the woman were created by Alchemax as a security force. One clone was given the [[Vanisher]]'s powers, instilled with a powerful [[agoraphobia]] so that she would not be tempted to escape the building, upgraded with cybernetic weaponry, and has been seemingly force-fed anti-aging pills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gc-11-spider-man-edge/719224 |title=Spider-Man: Edge of Time Video - GC 11: Behind the Scenes with Katee Sackhoff |publisher=GameTrailers |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> After fighting and defeating the other Black Cat clones, [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) fights the special clone.
