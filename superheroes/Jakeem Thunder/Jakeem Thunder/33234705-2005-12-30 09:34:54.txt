'''Jakeem Johnny Thunder''' (initially called '''J. J. Thunder''', a name he dislikes) is a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]] and a member of the current version of the [[superhero]] team the [[Justice Society of America]]. 

A foul-mouthed [[African-American]] boy from [[Keystone City]] (home of the original and current versions of [[the Flash]]), he came into possession of [[Johnny Thunder]]'s "[[genie]]" Thunderbolt. This was during a [[Justice League]]/Justice Society crossover, when the world was being threatened by an evil Thunderbolt. With [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s help, Jakeem was able to "merge" the two Thunderbolts, with the command for summoning the Thunderbolt being ''zkl'' (pronounced "so cool").

Jakeem later, and somewhat reluctantly, joined the Justice Society. Like Johnny before him, he often caused trouble by wishing for things without meaning to, thanks to poorly-worded commands. When Johnny returned, having apparently recovered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] as the result of one of Jakeem's wishes, he demanded the Thunderbolt back. However, it turned out that this was actually the villainous [[Ultra-Humanite]], controlling Johnny's body. Jakeem was able to wrest control of the Thunderbolt back, but Johnny lost his life. Jakeem then wished that the Thunderbolt could save Johnny somehow. In desperation, the Thunderbolt merged with Johnny, creating a new being with the memories of both (although a recent issue of JSA, dealing with a Jakeem "gone mad", has shown a Johnny separate from the genie and a denizen of the fifth dimension, part of the "Thunderbolt family").

Jakeem resents being seen as a kid by the rest of the team, especially [[Stargirl]], although as the closest to his age on the team, he sees her as a friend. Living in Keystone, he has formed a friendship with [[Bart Allen]], the teenage superhero Kid Flash (formerly known as '''Impulse''').
