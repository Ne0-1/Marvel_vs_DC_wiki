'''Jakeem Johnny Thunder''' (initially called '''J.J. Thunder''', a name he dislikes) is a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]] and a member of the current version of the [[superhero]] team the [[Justice Society of America]]. Jakeem first appeared in ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' vol. 2 #134 (February [[1998]]), and was created by [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and [[Paul Ryan (comic artist)|Paul Ryan]]. Many African Americans are greatly offended by the character of Jakeem Johny Thunder. He is a racist stereotype and is clearly written by white writers such as Morrison and Johns in a stereotypical black manner.

== Fictional character biography ==
Jakeem Johnny Williams is a precocious teenager from [[Keystone City]] (home of the original and current versions of [[the Flash]]). Jakeem's mother left his father while she was still pregnant with the boy and he was orphaned when his mother died of cancer. His aunt Lashawn was then  granted custody and his father, Phil, never knew (and still does not know) about his birth. Jakeem became a self-reliant latchkey kid who grew up on the streets and adopted a tough, foul-mouthed attitude in order to survive life on the street. 

Jakeem comes into possession of [[Johnny Thunder]]'s "[[genie]]" Thunderbolt. When Johnny Thunder begins to lose control over the Thunderbolt due to declining mental
health, he puts the genie inside an ink pen, which is then given by [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] to Jakeem.<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2 #134</ref>

During a [[Justice League]]/Justice Society crossover, when the world was being threatened by an evil Thunderbolt, Jakeem soon discovers that the Thunderbolt actually came from the Fifth Dimension and was controlled by
speaking its name (Yz) backwards ("Say You"). With [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s help, Jakeem was able to merge Yz with another blue genie named Lkz from the Fifth Dimension. Lkz is controlled by speaking
the phrase  ''So Cûl'' (pronounced "so cool"). Yz and Lkz form a new purple genie named Ylzkz and this new genie is also now controlled by the phrase "so cool."<ref>''JLA'' #26</ref>

===Justice Society===
{{main|Justice Society}}
Jakeem soon, and somewhat reluctantly, joins the Justice Society as a part-time member. <ref>''JSA Secret Files'' #2, September 2001</ref>  Jakeem is welcomed by the  fellow young hero, [[Stargirl]], who becomes  a friend, and positive influence on him. He also benefits from the guidance of Johnny Thunder himself. He and Hourman [[Hourman|Rick Tyler]] also build a brotherly friendship. Like Johnny before him, he often caused trouble by wishing for things without meaning to, due to poorly-worded commands.

During the "Last Laugh" story arc where certain villains in the DC universe had been affected by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker's]] laughing gas, a Jokerized [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] attacks the JSA headquarters. His initial attack involves dropping the head of the [[Statue of Liberty]] outside the doors of the JSA and knocking out the then-caretaker of the museum [[Eclipso|Alexander Montez]]. Jakeem and [[Stargirl]] were the only two at the headquarters at the time. Their fight against Grundy goes badly, as he steals Jakeem's pen and retreats to the sewers. Jakeem tells Stargirl he wants to get the pen back not because he saw the Thunderbolt as his power, but because the Thunderbolt was his friend. 

During the fight with Grundy, Jakeem is nearly knocked out by the behemoth. He realizes Stargirl is in grave peril and in desperation, stretches to reach his pen, just out of reach. A purplish-pink wave of energy appears in his eyes and around the pen, which levitates into his grasp. Jakeem briefly wonders how this has happened, but decides to figure it out later. The fight serves as a bonding experience between the two young heroes. Jakeem has the Thunderbolt fix the statue.<ref>JSA3 #29</ref>

===Johnny Thunderbolt===
{{see also|Johnny Thunder}}
Also in the course of the battle with Grundy, Jakeem unwittingly cures his predecessor, Johnny Thunder of his [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Unfortunately, Johnny immediately fell prey to the [[Ultra-Humanite]], who took over Johnny's body in order to command the Thunderbolt's powers. In the "Stealing Thunder" storyline<ref>JSA #33-37</ref>, Jakeem is one of several heroes left free from Ultra's control. Eventually Jakeem wrests control of the Thunderbolt back from Ultra, but Johnny Thunder loses his life.  Jakeem then wishes that the Thunderbolt could save Johnny somehow, so the genie chooses to merge with Johnny, creating a new being with the memories of both. He later assumes the name '''Johnny Thunderbolt.'''<ref>Ibid #46</ref> Johnny Thunderbolt bears Johnny's likeness, though it is not clear how the personalities of Johnny and the two genies interact, and whether any one personality is dominant. Johnny's family was informed of his death and a funeral was held at Valhalla, a cemetery for superheroes. The family does not know that he lives on as the Thunderbolt. The Thunderbolt eventually stops displaying Johnny's likeness while still speaking as him.

With Johnny's help, Jakeem meets his biological father, Phil, who is now an engineering student. Jakeem does not reveal his true identity, but he also meets Phil's wife, Jennifer, and his younger half-brother. He is torn by his longing to reconnect with his biological father, but fears he will upset Phil's life.<ref>Ibid #38</ref> At the dawn of the [[Infinite Crisis]], the Spectre shunts Jakeem into his pen — into the Fifth Dimension — where he succumbs to the machinations of [[Qwsp]] and becomes a mad tyrant. The Thunderbolt amasses an army to fight him, including his son, '''Shocko''' and his wife '''Peachy Pet.''' With the help of the JSA, Jakeem was freed of Qwsp's evil influence. <ref>Ibid #74, 78-80</ref> Among Qwsp's prisoners is Johnny Thunder, apparently separated from the Thudnerbolt and living in the Fifth Dimension. Upon the JSA's return from the Fifth Dimension, they find the villain [[Mordru]] battling with [[Doctor Fate|Nabu]].  Jakeem jumps the gun and takes action against the evil wizard (who had previously slit Jakeem's throat). Jakeem returns the favor by stabbing Mordru in the throat with his pen, then summons the Thunderbolt,  electrocuting Mordru. Jakeem then asked the Thunderbolt to remove Mordru from their sight (followed for the first time by a "please").<ref>Ibid #80</ref>
