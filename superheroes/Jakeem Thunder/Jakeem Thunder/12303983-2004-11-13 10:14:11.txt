Jakeem Johnny Thunder (usually called '''J. J. Thunder''') is a character in [[DC Comics]] and a member of the current version of the [[Justice Society of America]]. A foul-mouthed African-American kid from Keystone City (home of [[the Flash]]), he came into possession of [[Johnny Thunder]]'s "genie" Thunderbolt, during a [[Justice League]]/Justice Society crossover, when the world was being threatened by an evil Thunderbolt. With [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s help, J.J. was able to "merge" the two Thunderbolts. The command word was now "so cool".

Jakeem later joined the J.S.A., somewhat reluctantly. Like Johnny before him, he often caused trouble by wishing for things without meaning to. When Johnny returned, having apparently recovered from [[Alzheimer's Disease]] as the result of a wish, he demanded the Thunderbolt back. However, this was actually the [[Ultra-Humanite]], controlling Johnny's body. Jakeem was able to wrest control of the Thunderbolt back, but Johnny lost his life. Jakeem then wished that the Thunderbolt could save Johnny somehow. In desperation, the Thunderbolt merged with Johnny, creating a new being with the memories of both.

Jakeem resents being seen as a kid by the rest of the team, especially [[Star-Spangled Kid|Stargirl]], although as the closest to his age on the team, he sees her as a friend. Living in Keystone, he has formed a friendship with Impulse/[[Kid Flash]].
