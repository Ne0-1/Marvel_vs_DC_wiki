'''L-Ron''' (full name '''L-Ron H*bb*rd''', a reference to [[Scientology]] founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]<ref name="DC">[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=469 Justice League Broken Frontier] JLA members</ref>), is a [[fictional character]], a [[robot]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. L-Ron first appeared in ''Justice League International'' #14 (June 1988). 

== Fictional character history ==

He is initially the robot companion of [[Manga Khan]], an intergalactic trader, and in that role appears as a foe of the [[Justice League]] in the early 1990s. L-Ron also has a different form. Khan damages him over anger that a JLA team had successfully followed the ship and Mister Miracle, who was a prisoner inside; in fact they had beat him by several minutes. L-Ron isn't too concerned about the damage, he wonders what forms are available in the 'fall line'.

Manga Khan trades L-Ron to the Justice League in exchange for the inert body of the [[villain]] [[Despero]]. 

L-Ron is considered a [[hero]] [http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=469] and assists the League in various non-combat roles (mainly administration and maintenance). He annoys many of them by inventing praise-laden salutations when he appears. 

===Despero===

Later on, L-Ron's consciousness is transferred into the body of Despero by [[Kilowog]] in a desperate attempt to stop the villain's latest rampage. During the "Breakdowns" storyline that ran through ''[[Justice League America]]'' and ''[[Justice League Europe]]'', Despero wakes up in L-Ron's body and attacks the [[Justice League International]] including [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] and [[Blue Beetle]]. Despero/L-Ron is defeated when he chases them outside and is shot by a duck hunter.

L-Ron continues to associate with the League, becoming a member of the [[Justice League Task Force]]. He works closely with [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]], [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Triumph (comics)|Triumph]]. Despero's body affects L-Ron, giving him the urge to kill innocents. 

===Back In Form===

Under unknown circumstances, he returns to the form in which he had been sold to the Justice League. He is last seen acting as [[Maxwell Lord]]'s assistant and liaison with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] in the "[[Super Buddies]]". Manga attempts to buy him back but is refused. This story reveals he had been romantically involved with a robot known as J-Lo. 

During his time with the Super Buddies, several members of the team vanish due to a misunderstanding over the function and form of a mystical artifact. Lord and [[Sue Dibny]] speculate on sending L-Ron along the magical path to investigate, an idea he strongly protests.

Afterwards L-Ron disappeared into a comics limbo of sorts.  Recently he has been seen working with a team of supervillains known as the [[Robot Renegades]].  His motives for working with the villains is yet unknown, though he does assist the [[Metal Men]] in fighting the [[Death Metal Men]].

==Other media==
*L-Ron was going to be [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s assistant in the unmade movie ''[[Superman Lives]]''.  ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' star [[Dwight Ewell]] was considered a possible choice for voice actor, giving L-Ron a 'gay [[C-3PO]]' persona.<ref name="smith part 2">[http://www.cinescape.com/0/Editorial.asp?this_cat=Movies&obj_id=21118&aff_id=0 Cinescape Movies: SUPERMAN LIVES, Part 2: Writer Kevin Smith]</ref>
