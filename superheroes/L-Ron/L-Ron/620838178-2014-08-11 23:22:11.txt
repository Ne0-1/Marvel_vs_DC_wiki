'''L-Ron''' (Full name L-Ron H-bb-rd) is a [[fictional character]], a [[robot]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. L-Ron first appeared in ''Justice League International'' #14 (June 1988).

==Fictional character history==
L-Ron (named after writer [[L. Ron Hubbard]]) was originally the robot companion of [[Manga Khan]].  At the time Manga Khan also had other robots named after famous figures in science fiction including Commander Sooroo, Captain Krikk (''[[Justice League International]]'' #14), Hein-9 (named after [[Robert A. Heinlein]], ''Justice League International'' #20) and K-Dikk (named after [[Philip K. Dick]], ''Justice League International'' #21) among others. Manga Khan is an intergalactic trader, who in that role appears as a foe of the [[Justice League]] in the early 1990s. L-Ron also exhibited different robot forms at this time. Khan damages one of these forms when angered that a JLA team had successfully followed the ship (as they were holding [[Mister Miracle]] as a prisoner). L-Ron wasn't too concerned about the damage; he wonders what forms are available in the 'fall line'.<ref>''Justice League International'' #14 (June, 1988)</ref>

Khan and his forces later trick Mister Miracle into becoming a prisoner of contract, L-Ron is involved in this adventure as well.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #13-14 (March–April 1990).</ref>

Manga Khan later traded L-Ron to the Justice League in exchange for the inert body of the [[villain]] [[Despero]]. At the time Manga paraphrases [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] saying "Alas poor L-Ron I knew him K-Dikk".<ref>"Justice League of America" #40 (July 1990)</ref>

L-Ron assists the League in various non-combat roles (mainly administration and maintenance). He annoys many of them by inventing praise-laden salutations when he appears.

===Despero===
Later on, L-Ron's consciousness is transferred into the body of Despero by [[Kilowog]] in a desperate attempt to stop the villain's latest rampage. During the "Breakdowns" storyline that ran through ''[[Justice League America]]'' and ''[[Justice League Europe]]'', Despero wakes up in L-Ron's body and attacks the [[Justice League International]] including [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] and [[Blue Beetle]]. Despero/L-Ron is defeated when he chases them outside and is shot by a duck hunter.<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #36 (March 1, 1992)</ref>

L-Ron continues to associate with the League, becoming a member of the [[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]. He works closely with [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]], [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Triumph (comics)|Triumph]]. Despero's body affects L-Ron, giving him the urge to kill innocents. 

L-Ron participates in a multi-League effort against [[Overmaster]], an alien threatening all life on Earth. During this mission, L-Ron's friend Ice is slain by the villain.<ref>''Justice League Task Force'' #13-14 (June–July 1994)</ref>

Despero's mind temporarily takes over the body again during a battle with [[Supergirl]], but at the end of the fight, L-Ron has resumed control, while the disembodied Despero has disappeared. (Soon thereafter, the Despero mind returns to battle [[Young Justice]], but L-Ron is not present at that time.)

===Back in form===
Under unknown circumstances, he returns to the form in which he had been sold to the Justice League. He is last seen acting as [[Maxwell Lord]]'s assistant and liaison with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] in the "[[Super Buddies]]". Manga attempts to buy him back but is refused. This story reveals he had been romantically involved with a robot known as J-Lo.<ref>"Formerly Known as the Justice League" #1-6 (2003)</ref>

During his time with the Super Buddies, several members of the team vanish due to a misunderstanding over the function and form of a mystical artifact. Lord and [[Sue Dibny]] speculate on sending L-Ron along the magical path to investigate, an idea he strongly protests. The heroes return safely.<ref>"JLA Classified" #4-9 (2004)</ref>

Afterwards L-Ron disappeared into a comics limbo of sorts. Recently he has been seen working with a team of supervillains known as the [[Robot Renegades]]. His motives for working with the villains is yet unknown, though he does assist the [[Metal Men]] in fighting the [[Death Metal Men]].<ref>"Metal Men" #2-3 (2007)</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* L-Ron appears in the ''[[Young Justice: Invasion]]'' episode "Cornered" voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. This version is a majordomo to [[Despero]] helping him attack the [[Hall of Justice]]. When Despero's paralysis ability is turned against him by [[Zatanna]] acting through [[Mal Duncan]], L-Ron assumes his battle form and goes on the attack. He is ultimately destroyed when [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] jumps on his back and summons his magical lightning.

===Film===
* L-Ron was going to be [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s assistant in the unmade movie ''[[Superman Lives]]''. ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' star [[Dwight Ewell]] was considered a possible choice for voice actor, giving L-Ron a 'gay [[R2-D2]]' persona. The unproduced script was written by Dwight's friend and fellow co-star [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name="smith part 2">[http://www.cinescape.com/0/Editorial.asp?this_cat=Movies&obj_id=21118&aff_id=0 Cinescape Movies: SUPERMAN LIVES, Part 2: Writer Kevin Smith]</ref>
