'''L-Ron''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He was initially the robot companion of [[Manga Khan]], an intergalactic trader, and in that role was a foe of the [[Justice League]] in the early 1990's. Later on his consciousness was transferred into the body of [[Despero]], a long-time Justice League foe. L-Ron befriended the Justice League, and was even a member of their short-lived [[Justice League Task Force]] team.

Under unknown circumstances, he was recently returned to the form he was sold to the Justice League in. He now acts as [[Maxwell Lord]]'s assistant in the "[[Super Buddies]]" (and liaison with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]).
