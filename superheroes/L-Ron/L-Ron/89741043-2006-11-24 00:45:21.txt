'''L-Ron''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He was initially the robot companion of [[Manga Khan]], an intergalactic trader, and in that role was a foe of the [[Justice League]] in the early 1990's. Manga Khan traded L-Ron to the Justice League in exchange for the inert body of the villain [[Despero]]. L-Ron assisted the league in various non-combat roles (mainly administration and maintenance). 
Later on L-Ron's consciousness was transferred into the body of Despero and he became a member of their short-lived [[Justice League Task Force]] team. 
During the Breakdowns story line that ran through [[Justice League America]] and [[Justice League Europe]], Despero woke up in L-Rons body and attacked the [[Justice League International]] including [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] and [[Blue Beetle]]. Despero/L-Ron was defeated when he chased them outside and was shot by a duck hunter. 

Under unknown circumstances, he was recently returned to the form he was sold to the Justice League in. He was last seen acting as [[Maxwell Lord]]'s assistant in the "[[Super Buddies]]" (and liaison with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]). Manga attempted to buy him back, but was refused. (It was heavily implied that the gaseous entity had an unrequited crush on his former lackey.) During this story it was revealed he had been romantically involved with a robot known as J-Lo.  L-Ron's whereabouts since the disbanding of the Super Buddies and the death
of Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle, are unknown.

His name is a reference to [[Scientology]] Founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]].
