'''''Vengeance''''' is the name of a former [[supervillain]] turned [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Biography==
When [[Zarathos]]' hellfire (the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider) caused serious psychological damage to a police officer named Badilino, he went on to kill his wife, daughter and himself, leaving only his young son, '''Michael Badilino''', alive.  With his sister's death, Michael inherited both quarters of the "Medallion of Power" that had been entrusted to his family millennia ago by the Blood.  During his twenties, Badilino joined a special task force in the army but left to join the New York City police force, after the "death" of Anton Hellgate.  Eventually, Badilino was promoted to lieutenant.

When Daniel Ketch became the new [[Ghost Rider]],  Michael Badilino believed him to be the same demon that had destroyed his family.  He led a task force to destroy Ghost Rider, but failed repeatedly to do so.  In frustration, he turned to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], trading his soul in exchange for the power to destroy the Ghost Rider.  Mephisto made the deal, but only unlocked Badilino's inner strength using the "Medallion of Power". 

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill  Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos.  Eventually, Vengeance was won over to the side of good when Ghost Rider was proven not to be the demon Zarathos, the one truly responsible for Badilino's hatred.  Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by the name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and his acolytes, The Fallen. 

Upon the return of Ghost Rider, Vengeance left New York, and re-joined a special governmental task force.  One of their first missions was to free hostages, and stop the terrorist.  When they found the hostages, Badilino was shocked to discover that the hostages had already been murdered prior to their arrival.  Badilino transformed into Vengeance and went insane, setting out to kill anyone who had done but the smallest of sins.  Vengeance's actions were brought to the attention of Ghost Rider and Blaze and they immediately set out to show Vengeance the error of his ways or destroy him.  Badilino however, realizing that his alter ego Vengeance was out of control, he killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his hellfire.

Badilino's death meant that he was damned to Hell for all eternity, where his punishment was eternal stinging by scorpions.  Vengeance was discovered by Daniel Ketch, and Naomi Kale in Hell, while they were on a mission.  After being freed by Dan and Naomi, Vengeance reappeared in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale.  Vengeance aided the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, and Blackheart was destroyed.  Vengeance's current status is unknown.

==Powers and Appearance==
He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, though he did possess the Penance Stare and his motorcycle also seemed to share characteristics with the version used by Noble Kale.  He was characterised by his skull being deep purple, by fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and large spike protrusions with a backswept curve on the top of his skull.
