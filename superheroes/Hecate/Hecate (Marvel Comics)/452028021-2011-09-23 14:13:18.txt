A supervillain named '''Hecate''' appeared in ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #11-13 (November 1977-January 1978), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

Hecate was an extradimensional female humanoid scientist and explorer, who was mistaken for the goddess [[Hecate]] when she visited Earth thousands of years ago. She allied with and later opposed the [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elementals]] while seeking the Ruby Scarab. She fought Ms. Marvel at the time when the Elementals wanted to control the power of the Ruby Scarab. After the elementals were defeated, Ms. Marvel forgave Hecate who took the Ruby Scarab in order to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #11-13</ref>
