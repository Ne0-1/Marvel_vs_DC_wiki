'''Mister Fear''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]].  Four different individuals have played the role of Mister Fear. Mister Fear is primarily a villain of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], the "Man Without Fear."

==Fictional character biography==
===Zoltan Drago===
'''Zoltan Drago''' was the proprietor of a financially-ailing wax museum who attempted to use his knowledge of chemistry to create an elixir which would turn his wax statues into living creatures, with which he would create a private army.  The chemical failed to create life in wax, but Drago discovered the brew he had created could evoke fear in those who inhailed it.  Designing a frightening costume for himself, Drago became Mr. Fear.

Fear used his fear-gas to make terrified slaves of the brutish [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] of the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] and the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]].  Naming his triumvarate the '''Fellowship of Fear''', Drago ran afoul of, and was soundly defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].

===Starr Saxon===
{{main|Machinesmith}}
Criminal engineer Starr Saxon temporarily assumed the guise of Mister Fear.  Daredevil had defeated Saxon's robotic assassins, and desiring the means to confront Daredevil directly, Saxon gunned down Drago and stole his gear.  As the second Mr. Fear, Saxon humilated Daredevil in a series of televised battles, casting himself as the hero in a series of charity-funding battles against the superhero.  Saxon was unmasked, plunging to his death in final battle with Daredevil.

Saxon's robots would use his mind as the template for the Machinesmith's central consciousness.

===Larry Cranston===
'''Larry Cranston''' was a law school classmate of Matt Murdock who also became his employer for a while.  Cranston happened to overhear Saxon killing Drago, and after learning that Saxon himself had died, he took on the guise of Fear himself.

Cranston went mad during his first effort against Daredevil, jumping off a building, assuming that he was wearing a rocket pack which he had previously worn in battle with the hero.

Cranston survived the fall and returned years later.  He masterminded a series of campaigns meant to discredit Daredevil with the aid of the current Enforcers, the Eel, and a sleepless villainess named [[Insomnia (comics)|Insomnia]].  Daredevil bested these efforts, Cranston abandoning the Mr. Fear identity.

Cranston has resurfaced, along with the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] at his side, providing the criminals of Hell's kitchen a drug that causes the user to become completely unafraid of death in an attempt to make Daredevil's life miserable.

===Alan Fagan===
'''Alan Fagan''' was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  He was the nephew of the third Mister Fear, Larry Cranston.  When Larry seemingly died, Alan came into possession of the fear gas and other equipment.  Unlike the other Fears, Fagan's primary adversary was [[Spider-Man]], not Daredevil.

Fagan attempted to use his fear-gas in blackmail schemes which were stymied by Spider-Man, once with the aid of [[Hawkeye]].  Fagan was brutally attacked in prison, much of the skin carved from his face by men in the employ of his daughter, who used the skin to draw out fear-gas residue she used to turn herself into the villainess [[Shock (comics)|Shock]].  

Fagan recovered from these injuries and received improved weaponry from the interim ruler of [[Latveria]], [[Lucia Von Bardas]].  The weaponry, including a suit of body armor resembling a metallic version of the traditional Mr. Fear costume, was destroyed at the climax of the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] miniseries.

Fagan was one of the many criminals to escape from the [[Raft]] prison facility, becoming a thrall of the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]. During his efforts in service to Cross, Fagan was again defeated by Spider-Man.

Fagan has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''New Avengers #35''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Chronic exposure to his various chemicals has resulted in accumulation of his fear drug within his skin. Though he has not proven able to utilize this himself, samples of his skin were used by Ariel Tremmore to gain superhuman powers as Shock.

Mister Fear uses compounds based on pheromones, chemicals produced by most animals, used to communicate a variety of simple messages over distances. The particular pheromone he uses is the flight-scent pheromone, which stimulates fear reactions in herd animals. This drug, tailored for human beings, whose reactions to pheromones are not completely understood, induces severe anxiety, fear, and panic in his victims, rendering them incapable of fighting or resisting his will.
The drug is most commonly used in the form of gas pellets shot from a gun. The pellets rupture on contact, releasing the flight scent, which is inhaled by the victim. The dosage contained in one pellet is enough to incapacitate a normal adult male for about 15 minutes, or an exceptionally fit male, such as Daredevil, for about five minutes. The side effects of anxiety, edginess, and mild nausea can persist for several days.
The flight scent can be administered in other ways: Fagan has used a miniature hypodermic needle mounted on his ring to inject a large dose of the liquid directly into his victimâ€™s bloodstream. He has also used a hand-held weapon that fires capsules of the fear gas. Small but effective doses of the flight scent can be absorbed through the pores in the skin within an enclosed space, but the length of time it takes limits its usefulness.
Fagan has also adapted other pheromones to his use, including one that makes a man sexually irresistible to women.
He briefly wore a suit of armor, which presumably at least provided protection from injury.

It is likely that the name Larry Cranston is an [[allusion]] to Lamont Cranston, a false identity often used by [[The Shadow]].

Also, Mister Fear is often compared to the Scarecrow, however, the Scarecrow did not use fear gas until after Mister Fear debuted.
