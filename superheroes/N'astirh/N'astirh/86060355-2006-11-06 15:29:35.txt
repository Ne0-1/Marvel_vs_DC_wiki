N'astirh is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Marvel Comics]] as a demonic inhabitant of [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]]. He first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #32 and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Jon Bogdanove]]. 

==Character history==
N'Astirh was a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] with great [[magic (paranormal)|magical skills]], but rebelled against his master [[Belasco]] when he chose a human, [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] as his apprentice. N'Astirh formed an alliance with [[S'ym]], the strongest of Belasco's demons. When Illyana rose against Belasco, N'Astirh stole Belasco's spellbook and fled from Limbo into Earth's past. When Illyana left Limbo, S'ym summoned N'Astirh again and they plotted against her. Due to the [[Magus (comics)#Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]] invasion of Limbo, S'ym and N'Astirh were both turned into techno-organic beings. As techno-organic beings, they had become more powerful and took over Limbo. 

N'Astirh made pacts with various villains in the [[Marvel Universe]], such as [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] (Macendale), and [[Madelyne Pryor]]. The latter used this alliance to get revenge against her creator [[Mister Sinister]] and her ex-husband [[Cyclops (comics)| Cyclops]]. N'astirh had previously led Madelyne to Sinister's genetic lab, to rescue her baby, and to confront Mr. Sinister. Madelyne then learned that she was merely a clone of [[Jean Grey]], whom her husband had actually loved, and left her upon learning that she was still alive. With the help of N'astirh and his fellow demon S'ym, Madelyne's [[telepathy| telepathic]] powers were triggered, transforming her into the '''Goblin Queen'''.

The three then plotted a demonic invasion, starting with [[Manhattan]], known as the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno Crisis]]. During the invasion N'astirh also coerced[[Magik (comics)| Illyana Rasputin]] and [[Meggan]] towards their darker sides--Magik having a tie to the demonic realm [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]] (transforming her into '''Darkchylde''') and Meggan being an [[empathy| empathic]] [[shapeshifting| shapeshifter]] who was swayed by the dark emotions around her (transforming her into the '''Goblyn Princess'''). However N'astirh's invasion was thwarted by the X-teams, and he was destroyed by an overload of lightning driven into him by [[Storm (comics)|Storm]].
