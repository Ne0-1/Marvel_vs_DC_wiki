'''N'astirh''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Marvel Comics]] as a demonic inhabitant of [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]]. He first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #32 and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Jon Bogdanove]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
N'Astirh was a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] with great [[magic (paranormal)|magical skills]] and a master manipulator. Despite his power and loyalty to his lord [[Belasco]] he rebelled when [[Belasco]] chose a human, [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] as his apprentice. N'Astirh formed an alliance with [[S'ym]], the strongest of Belasco's demons. When Illyana rose against Belasco, N'Astirh stole Belasco's spellbook and fled from Limbo into Earth's past. When Illyana left Limbo, S'ym summoned N'Astirh again and they plotted against her. Due to the [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]] invasion of Limbo, S'ym was turned into a techno-organic being. As a techno-organic being, S'ym became more powerful and took over Limbo. 

N'Astirh made pacts with various villains in the [[Marvel Universe]], such as [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] (Macendale), and [[Madelyne Pryor]]. The latter used this alliance to get revenge against her creator [[Mister Sinister]] and her ex-husband [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. N'astirh had previously led Madelyne to Sinister's genetic lab, to rescue her baby, and to confront Mr. Sinister. Madelyne then learned that she was merely a clone of [[Jean Grey]], whom her husband had actually loved, and left her upon learning that she was still alive. With the help of N'astirh and his fellow demon S'ym, Madelyne's psionic powers (far stronger than her progenitor's) were triggered, transforming her into the '''Goblin Queen'''. When he realized that Madelyne could not be used as his pawn openly he devised another way of coercing her to the dark side. When she was bound and defeated by Sinister he left her to fend for herself while he infected himself with the transmode virus. The virus changes his coloring from green to red. He also claims he has 'become' magic, since he can now process and cast spells almost simultaneously. 

When N'astirh knew she had fallen into madness he returns and presents Madylyne her son as chief sacrifice.

[[Madelyne Pryor]], N'astirh and S'ym  then plotted a demonic invasion, starting with [[Manhattan]], known as the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno Crisis]]. During the invasion N'astirh also coerced [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] and [[Meggan]] towards their darker sides--Magik having a tie to the demonic realm [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]] (transforming her into '''Darkchylde''') and Meggan being an [[empathy|empathic]] [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] who was swayed by the dark emotions around her (transforming her into the '''Goblin Princess'''). N'astirh was also known for his twisted sense of humor.  When Jason Phillip Macendale, then the Hobgoblin, offered to make a [[Faustian]] bargain to trade his soul for the power of a demon, N'astirh laughed and scoffed at the offer, thinking Macendale's soul to be too pitiful to be of any worth.  In return for amusing him, however, N'astirh granted Macendale's request by fusing the hapless human with a demon, which would eventually break away to become the [[Demogoblin]]. 

However N'astirh's invasion attempt was thwarted by the X-Factor, [[New Mutants]], the [[X-Terminators]] and the X-Men. He was frozen and shattered and ultimately destroyed by an overload of lightning driven into him by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].

Recently N'astirh has reappeared at the side of Illyana Rasputin, during the recent 'Quest for Magik' storyline.  Whether or not this is the original N'Astirh or like Illyana a possible alternate reality version is unclear.  This version appears to be more savage and primitive in nature and has not yet displayed any of the powers of the original. He also does not appear to be a techno-organic being
