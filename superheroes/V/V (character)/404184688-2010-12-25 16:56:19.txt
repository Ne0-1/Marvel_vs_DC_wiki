'''V''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[comic book]] series ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]]. He is a mysterious [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[vigilante]] and [[Propaganda of the deed|freedom fighter]], easily recognizable by his [[Guy Fawkes]] mask and dark clothing. According to Moore, he was designed to be both a [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]], so that readers could decide for themselves whether he was a hero fighting for a cause, or simply [[Insanity|insane]].<ref name="giantmoore">{{cite web | work=GIANT Magazine| title=A FOR ALAN, Pt. 1: The Alan Moore interview | url=http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html#more | accessdate=31 March 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060330072000/http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html#more <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 March 2006}}</ref> 

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
The background and identity of V is largely unknown. He is at one point an inmate at "[[Larkhill]] Resettlement Camp" - one of many [[concentration camp]]s where [[political prisoner]]s, [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[Jew]]s, [[Pakistan]]is, [[Muslim]]s and [[black people]] are exterminated by [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s new [[fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Norsefire]]. While there, he is part of a group of prisoners who are subjected to horrific [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experimentation]], conducted by Dr. Delia Surridge, involving artificially-designed [[hormone]] [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. Lewis Prothero is the camp's commandant, and a <!-- spelt paedophile as this is a UK topic START -->[[pedophilia|paedophile]]<!-- END spelt paedophile as this is a UK topic --> priest, Father Lilliman, is at the camp to lend "spiritual support". All prisoners so injected soon die under gruesome circumstances, with the sole exception of "the man in room five" ("V" in [[Roman numeral]]s). During that time, the man had some level of communication with [[Valerie Page]], a [[lesbian]] former [[actress]], kept in "room four", who wrote her [[autobiography]] on [[toilet paper]] and then pushed it through a hole in the wall.

Although there is nothing physically wrong with him, Surridge theorizes that his mind had been warped by the experimentation. Still, his actions seem to maintain a twisted [[logic]]. The experiments actually yield some beneficial results: he develops [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level [[reflex]]es, increased strength, and incredibly expanded mental capacity (as demonstrated consistently throughout the novel, V is a [[genius]] in the fields of [[explosives]], [[martial arts]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], [[politics]], [[hacking]], [[music]], [[chemistry]], and, as stated by Dr. Surridge in the graphic novel, [[gardening]]).

Over time, the man is allowed to grow roses (<!-- violet carson, NOT scarlet carson: -->[[Violet Carson (rose)|violet carsons]]<!-- :violet carson, NOT scarlet carson -->) and raise crops for camp officials. The man eventually starts taking surplus [[ammonia]]-based [[fertilizer]] back to his cell, arranges it in bizarre, intricate patterns on the floor. He then takes a large amount of grease solvent from the gardens. In secret, the man uses the fertilizer and solvent to make [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] and [[napalm]]. On a stormy night ([[Guy_Fawkes_Night|Nov. 5th]]), he detonates his homemade bomb and escapes his cell.  Much of the camp is set ablaze, and many of the guards who rush in to see what happened are killed by the mustard gas. The camp is evacuated and closed down. He adopts the new identity, "V", and dons a Guy Fawkes mask and costume. V then spends the next five years planning his [[revenge]] on the Norsefire government, building his secret base, which he calls the "Shadow Gallery". He then kills off most of the over 40 surviving personnel from Larkhill, making each killing look like an accident. However, he saves Prothero, Lilliman and Surridge, (the 3 most responsible for the experiments on him) for last, showing only the remorseful Surridge a bit of mercy by injecting her with a painless poison in her sleep.

===Identity===
{{original research|section|date=March 2009}}
V's true identity is a mystery, and he visibly removes his mask only once during the entire story (at Surridge's request), at which point his back is to the reader. Surridge tells him "it is beautiful", in contrast to her personal notes, where she mentions that the man in cell V was ugly.

He doesn't even consider "V" his "name", saying "I do not have a name. You can call me V". The only explanation given regarding V's past is Surridge's diary, which V leaves out in the open for the "Finger" (Norsefire's [[secret police]]) to find after he kills her. [[Inspector Finch]], the head of [[London]]'s police department and one of Norsefire's most powerful officials, reads through the diary, but points out that V ''wanted'' them to read it. V also tore out many pages, which possibly left clues to his true identity before arriving at the camp. Finch further speculates that V fabricated the version of Surridge's diary, which he left with her body, just to confuse the police. 

In the comic and graphic novel, Delia Surridge states in the diary that he was ugly, although she mentions "Physically, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with him. No cellular anomalies, nothing". His confidante [[Evey Hammond]] speculates in the comic that V might be her own father, who was arrested years before as a [[political prisoner]]; V denies it, however, Moore has confirmed that V is not Evey's father.<ref name="whoisv">{{cite web | title=shadowgalaxy.net | work=Who is V? | url=http://www.shadowgalaxy.net/Vendetta/whov.html | accessdate=29 March 2006 }}</ref> There is also some speculation that V could actually be Valerie, the prisoner in the cell next to his whose autobiographical letter inspires V not to give up (and which he later passes on to Evey).<ref name="whoisv"/> However, Prothero and Surridge both describe V as the "man" from room five (V claims Valerie was the "Woman in room four" and also that he did not write Valerie's letter).

As Finch comments on the pages V tore from Surridge's diary "What was on the missing pages, eh? His name? His age? Whether he was Jewish, or homosexual, or black, or white?" He later proclaims to Finch that he is "an idea."

Upon witnessing V's death, Evey declines to unmask him with the conviction that even if he was her father, learning the man's true identity would not be worth diminishing what he endeavored to symbolize. Eventually, Evey takes over V's persona and his mission to consider herself as [[Anarchism|anarchy]] incarnate.

===The "Villain"===
Four years after his escape from Larkhill, V blows up [[Parliament]] on November 5, [[Guy Fawkes Night|Guy Fawkes Day]]. V then [[kidnap]]s Prothero, who is now the "Voice of Fate" on the government's [[propaganda]] radio, and drives him insane by destroying his prize [[doll]] collection in a [[satire]] of the exterminations that occurred at Larkhill. V kills now-Bishop Lilliman by forcing him to eat a [[Eucharist|communion]] wafer laced with [[cyanide]].  Norsefire had infused a perversion of religion into their rhetoric, saying that those who were exterminated were not pure in the eyes of [[God]], and V's [[black humor]] was enforcing Lilliman to put some of his religious [[rhetoric]] to the test of [[transubstantiation]]. V then kills Surridge, the one Larkhill official who feels [[remorse]] for her actions, by injecting her with a [[poison]] that painlessly kills her. Having thus killed his personal foes, V moves his plans forward.

V stages an attack on the government's [[propaganda]] broadcasting station, strapping himself with [[explosive]]s and forcing the staff to follow his orders under threat of detonating them. V then broadcasts a message to the people, telling them to take responsibility for themselves and rise up against their government. Finally, V destroys the government's CCTV [[surveillance]] buildings, eroding its control over British citizens.  However, V is mortally wounded when he is shot by Finch, and he staggers back to the Shadow Gallery, where he dies in Evey's arms. Evey then puts him in state, surrounded by violet carson roses, lilies and [[gelignite]], in an [[London Underground|Underground train]] that stops at a blockage along the tracks right under [[10 Downing Street]], where the explosives-laden train detonates, giving V a [[viking funeral]], fulfilling his final request to her in the process. Evey then takes on the mantle of "V."

==Film adaptation==
{{main|V for Vendetta (film)}}
The 2005 film adaptation of the graphic novel starred [[Hugo Weaving]] as V.

In the film, V is a freedom fighter rather than an [[anarchist]] terrorist. He is disfigured (a result of burns) instead of being described as being ugly. His abilities are a result of weapons experiments and superhuman reflexes instead of hormonal experiments. At the end of the film, he says that he has fallen in love with Evey.

There are several plot deviations. In the film, he only bombs the [[Old Bailey]] and [[Houses of Parliament]] building. It is Peter Creedy who confronts V at the end, instead of Finch. Creedy shoots Sutler (Adam Susan in the graphic novel), but V refuses to take off his mask, and Creedy and his men shoot V. V wore a breastplate to deflect the bullets but was still mortally wounded. He dies in Evey's arms. Evey gives him a viking funeral, like the graphic novel. Finch then confronts Evey, but puts down his weapon after learning about the corruption of the Norsefire regime and joins Evey as they watch V's bomb destroy the Houses of Parliament.
