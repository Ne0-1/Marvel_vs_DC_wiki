'''V''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[comic book]] series ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]. He is a mysterious [[propaganda of the deed|anarchist vigilante]] and [[terrorist]], easily recognizable by his [[Guy Fawkes]] mask and dark clothing. According to Moore, he was designed to be both a [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]], so that readers could decide for themselves whether he was a hero fighting for a cause, or simply [[insane]]. <ref name="giantmoore">{{cite web | work=GIANT Magazine| title=A FOR ALAN, Pt. 1: The Alan Moore interview | url=http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html#more | accessdate=31 March | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===

V's background and his identity are largely unknown. He was an inmate at the infamous "[[Larkhill]] Resettlement Camp", which was actually one of many [[concentration camp]]s where [[political prisoner]]s, [[homosexual]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[black people]], [[Pakistanis]], [[Muslim]]s and probably all non-Caucasians were exterminated by [[Britain]]'s new [[fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Norsefire]].  While there, he was part of a group of prisoners who were subjected to horrific [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]] conducted by Dr. Delia Surridge, which involved artificially designed [[hormone]] experiments (possibly research into creating [[supersoldier|super-soldiers]]).  A [[pedophilia|paedophile]] priest, Lilliman, was at the camp to lend "spiritual support".  The dozens of prisoners injected with the serum all died horribly, all except for one man: the man in room five ("V" in [[Roman numeral]]s).  Physically, there was nothing wrong with him, but Surridge felt that his mind had been warped by the experimentation.  Still, his actions seemed to maintain a twisted logic to them. The experiments actually yielded some beneficial results; he developed Olympic-level [[reflex]]es, increased strength, and incredibly expanded mental capacity; as demonstrated consistently throughout the novel, V is a genius in the fields of [[explosives]], [[martial arts]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], [[politics]], [[computer hacking]], [[chemistry]] and many more.

Over time, the man is allowed to grow roses (violet carsons) and is discovered to be a gardening expert and ends up raising crops for camp officials, i.e. Prothero. The man eventually started taking surplus [[ammonia]]-based [[fertilizer]] back to his cell, arranged it in bizarre, intricate patterns on the floor, and soon after a large amount of grease solvent from the gardens also went missing.  In secret, the man was using the fertilizer and solvent to make [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] and [[napalm]].  On a stormy night (Dec. 23rd), he detonated his homemade bomb and escaped his cell. Much of the camp was set ablaze, and many of the guards that rushed in to see what happened were killed by the mustard gas. The camp was evacuated and closed down. He adopted the new identity, "V", and donned a [[Guy Fawkes]] mask and costume. V then spent the next five years (twenty in the [[film adaptation]]) planning his [[revenge]] on the Norsefire government, building his secret base, which he called the "Shadow Gallery", and killing off most of the over 40 surviving personnel from Larkhill, making each killing look like an accident.  However, he saved Prothero, Surridge, and Lilliman for last, showing only Surridge a bit of mercy by using a painless poison.

===Identity===
V's true identity is a mystery, and he publicly takes off his mask only once during the entire story (at Surridge's request). Near the end of the story, Evey imagines what the face behind the mask looks like, one of the imaginings being her own father.

He doesn't even consider "V" his "name", saying "I do not have a name. You can call me V." The only explanation given regarding V's past is Surridge's diary, which V leaves out in the open for the "Nose" (an agency much like the [[FBI]]) to find after he kills her. [[Inspector Finch]], the head of [[London]]'s Nose department and one of Norsefire's most powerful officials, reads through the diary, but points out that V ''wanted'' them to read it. V also tore out many pages, which possibly left clues to his true identity before arriving at the camp.  Finch further speculates that V fabricated the version of Surridge's diary which he left with her body, just to confuse the police.  It does seem to be confirmed that V was actually at Larkhill, but anything the police found out about it from the diary is what V wanted them to know.  

In the book Delia Surridge states in the diary "Physically, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with him.  No cellular anomalies, nothing", something that would dispel the notion that V was disfigured. His confidante [[Evey Hammond]] speculated in the comic that V might be her own father, who was arrested years ago as a political prisoner, though he denies it.  Indeed, Moore has confirmed that V is not Evey's father. <ref name="whoisv">{{cite web | title=shadowgalaxy.net | work=Who is V? | url=http://www.shadowgalaxy.net/Vendetta/whov.html | accessdate=29 March | accessyear=2006}}</ref> There is also some speculation that V could actually be Valerie, the prisoner in the cell next to his whose autobiographical letter inspired V not to give up (and which he later passed on to Evey). Conceivably, V might actually be a woman whose appearance has been so drastically altered by the hormone experiments that it is impossible to tell while wearing the Guy Fawkes disguise.<ref name="whoisv"> </ref> However, Prothero and Surridge both describe V as the "man" from room five, which would seem to dispel this theory.  

V's true identity is never revealed. As Finch comments on the pages V tore from Surridge's diary, "What was on the missing pages, eh?  His name?  His age?  Whether he was Jewish, or homosexual, or black or white?". He later describes himself to Finch as "an idea". That Evey genuinely takes over the persona upon the death of her predecessor suggests V is something transcending the individual physically donning the mask, akin to [[Doctor Mabuse]]. Late in the story, Evey, having taken over V's mission, also appears to consider herself [[Anarchism|anarchy]] incarnate. In effect, V is an [[Everyman]]: potentially, ''anyone'' oppressed by their government could become a revolutionary avenger.

===The villain===
Four years after his escape from Larkhill, V begins his vendetta against the government by blowing up [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] on [[November 5]], [[Guy Fawkes Night|Guy Fawkes Day]]. V then kidnapped Prothero, who was now the "Voice of Fate" on the government's [[propaganda]] radio, and drove him insane by destroying his prize doll collection in a [[satire]] of the exterminations that occurred at Larkhill. V killed now-Bishop Lilliman by forcing him to eat a [[communion]] wafer laced with a lethal dose of [[cyanide]]. Norsefire had infused a perversion of religion into their rhetoric, saying that those who were exterminated were not pure in the eyes of [[God]], and V's black joke was in forcing Lilliman to put some of his religious rhetoric to the test of [[transubstantiation]]. V then killed Surridge, the one Larkhill official who felt [[remorse]] for her actions, by injecting her with a poison which painlessly killed her. Having thus leveled the playing field, V moved his plans forward.

V staged an attack on the government's propaganda broadcasting station, strapping himself with explosives and forcing the staff to follow his orders under threat of detonating them. V then broadcast a message to the people, telling them to take responsibility for themselves and rise up against their government. Finally, V destroyed the government's CCTV [[surveillance]] buildings, eroding its control over British citizens. However, V was mortally wounded when he was shot by Finch, and he staggered back to the Shadow Gallery, where he died in Evey's arms. Evey then laid him in state, surrounded by white lilies and [[gelignite]], in a subway train which stopped at a blockage along the tracks right under [[10 Downing Street]], where the explosives-laden cab detonated, giving V a [[viking funeral]] in the process. Evey then took on the mantle of "V".

==Portrayal in the 2006 film==
[[Image:V intro.jpg|thumb|250px|V (as portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]]) in the [[V for Vendetta (film)|film adaptation]].]]
{{main|V for Vendetta (film)}}
The 2006 film adaptation of the graphic novel starred [[Hugo Weaving]] as V.  In the film, V is portrayed as a romantic freedom fighter rather than as an [[anarchist]] terrorist.  He is also portrayed as much more human and personable than his comic book counterpart, and more willing to spare the lives of those collaborating with the government.  Also, near the climax of the film, the character admits to having fallen in love with Evey. Although it is never specified, it appears to be a [[platonic love]] rather than [[romantic love]]. There are strong elements from the ''[[Count of Monte Cristo]]'' and ''[[Phantom of the Opera]]'' in this interpretation of V that are not as pronounced in the original story.  V's history is also very different from that given in the graphic novel; his powers are no longer the result of a super-soldier experiment, but an end result of a [[biological weapon]]s experiment. Another addition to the character's [[biography]] is that, prior to his escape from Larkhill, he claims to have forgotten his past in its entirety, including his name, transforming him totally into the "[[everyman]]" persona he adopts in both the original story and in the film. Unlike the graphic novel, where he kills dozens, if not hundreds of government workers indiscriminately, the V of the film kills only to fulfill his vendetta and those who are an immediate threat to his plans.  He fails to bomb Jordan Tower, and given V's proximity to the explosives and his stated plans for the future, it can only be assumed that the bomb was not rigged to explode anyway.  He is also revealed to have undergone severe burn damage, whereas in the novel, he is assumed to have been unscarred by his escape from Larkhill. The briefly exposed skin of his hands, while suffering from severe burn scarring, indicates he is probably Caucasian.

Additionally, at the climax of the film when the people in costume gather to witness the explosion of Parlaiment, many figures and characters who died in the film, due to Norsefire's social cleansing, appear, removing their masks to witness the grand fireworks. In this group is Hugo Weaving, signifying that V's "spirit" was also among the others who had died. This suggests that Weaving not only played V, but V shared his resemblance prior to his burning.
