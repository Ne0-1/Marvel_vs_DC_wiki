'''Wonder Man''' ('''Simon Williams''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[Don Heck]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #9 (Oct. [[1964 in comics|1964]]).

==Publication history==
Wonder Man first appears in ''Avengers'' #9 (Oct. 1964), and after supposedly dying was not seen again until ''Avengers'' #102 (Aug. [[1972 in comics|1972]]) where he made a brief "cameo" appearance - still in a comatose state. Wonder Man's body is later revived by the villain [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] in ''Avengers'' #131 - 132 (Jan - Feb. [[1975 in comics|1975]]), and then again by the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] in ''Avengers'' #152 (Oct. [[1976 in comics|1976]]) and finally the [[Living Laser]] in ''Avengers'' Annual #6 (1976). After this last encounter, Wonder Man finally recovers his faculties and joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity in ''Avengers'' #160 (Jun. [[1977 in comics|1977]]). 

Wonder Man is a member for many years, and for a time serves with the expansion group the [[West Coast Avengers]], who first appear in a self-titled [[limited series|mini-series]], which ran for four issues from September to December [[1984 in comics|1984]]. The team eventually disbands and Wonder Man joins a reformed version called [[Force Works]], which debuted in an ongoing series in July, [[1994 in comics|1994]]. The unit, however, splinters quickly and Wonder Man eventually rejoins the main team in issue #4 (vol. 3), dated May [[1998 in comics|1998]]. Despite the collapse of the team in ''Avengers'' #503, (vol. 3, Dec. [[2004 in comics|2004]]), Wonder Man joins a new splinter group called the [[Mighty Avengers]], who feature in an ongoing title that debuted in March [[2007 in comics|2007]].

Wonder Man also appeared in an on-going series that ran for twenty-nine issues from September [[1991 in comics|1991]] to February [[1994 in comics|1994]] (also included are two Annuals). In [[1986 in comics|1986]] he also appeared in a self-titled graphic novel, which was subsequently followed in [[2000 in comics|2000]] by a limited series titled ''Avengers Two: Wonder Man and the Beast'', which ran for three issues. In [[2007 in comics|2007]] Wonder Man featured in a second mini-series, titled ''Wonder Man: My Fair Super Hero'', which ran for five issues.

==Fictional character biography==
Simon Williams is the son of rich industrialist Sanford Williams, owner of Williams Innovations. Simon inherits the munitions factory after his father's death, but over time the company's profits fall due to its biggest competitor, [[Tony Stark]]. On the advice of his brother Eric, Simon tries to embezzle funds from his company but is caught and incarcerated. Simon blames Stark for his failure and readily accepts the proposition of master villain [[Baron Zemo]], who requires a pawn to infiltrate the Avengers. The desperate Simon Williams agrees and, after being freed, is transformed into an [[ion]]-powered being with superhuman powers. Called Wonder Man by Zemo, he is then sent to meet and join the Avengers, with instructions to betray them at a critical moment so that Zemo's [[Masters of Evil]] can destroy the Avengers. Zemo ensures Wonder Man's loyalty by advising him that as a result of the treatment his body now requires periodic doses of a serum to survive — a serum that only Zemo can provide. 

The plan fails when Wonder Man decides to save the Avengers and aid them against Zemo, apparently at the cost of his own life. [[Iron Man]] — Tony Stark's alter ego — records Wonder Man's brain patterns in the hope that one day he can be revived.<ref>''Avengers'' #9 (Oct. 1964)</ref> Unbeknownst to the Avengers, Wonder Man's body has simply entered a catatonic state as it adjusts to the effects of the treatment.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Eric Williams becomes distraught over the apparent death of his sibling and, blaming the Avengers, assumes the identity of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] in an effort to destroy them. The Grim Reaper steals Simon's body at one point,<ref>''Avengers'' #102 (Aug. 1972)</ref> and attacks the Avengers three times before Wonder Man finally returns.<ref>''Avengers'' #52 (May 1968); 79 (Aug. 1970); 102 (Aug. 1972) + 107 - 108 (Jan. - Feb. 1973)</ref>

Wonder Man remains in [[suspended animation]] for years, and it is during this period that [[Ultron]], the evil robot creation of [[Henry Pym]], steals the brain patterns recorded by the Avengers for use as a template for the synthezoid [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]<ref>''Avengers'' #57 - 58</ref> (it is eventually revealed that the Vision is built from the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]], an android created by Professor [[Phineas Horton]].<ref>''Avengers'' #134 - 135</ref> This, however, only happened in mainstream continuity and other origins were possible courtesy of the Forever Crystal of [[Immortus]]).<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1 - 12 (1998 - 1999)</ref>

During this vulnerable time, Wonder Man is used as a pawn on three occasions. Wonder Man is briefly revived by [[Kang the Conqueror]] to battle the Avengers as part of his [[Legion of the Unliving]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol.1, #131 - 132; ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #3</ref> and later "resurrected" as a [[zombie]] by [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] and the Grim Reaper to attack the Avengers once more.<ref>''Avengers'' #151-153 (September-November 1976)</ref> On the final occasion, the Living Laser hypnotizes a now-awake but still very weak Wonder Man in an unsuccessful attack on the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #6 (1976)</ref> After this encounter, Wonder Man was restored to true life and chooses to remain with the Avengers, aiding them against [[Attuma]] and [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Avengers'' #154-156</ref> He also fought the Vision, and helped the Avengers battle [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]].<ref>''Avengers'' #158-159</ref> He soon after defeats the Grim Reaper, who was intent on destroying the Vision as he was "artificial" and a "mockery" of his brother; Wonder Man at this point is revealed to have become a being of ionic energy.<ref>''Avengers'' #160 (June 1977)</ref>

===The Avengers===

Wonder Man eventually joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity and becomes close friends with his teammate, the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. For several months after his resurrection, Wonder Man suffers from slight [[claustrophobia]] and a fear of dying in battle, as he did once before. Wonder Man finally overcomes his fear of death during the final battle with [[Korvac]].<ref>''Avengers'' #177 (Nov. 1978)</ref> Wonder Man invaded his former plant which had been taken over by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], and fought [[Madame Masque]] and the [[Dreadnought]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #55</ref> Developing an interest in acting, Wonder Man stars in minor roles before moving to Hollywood, where fellow Avenger [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] uses his contacts to establish Wonder Man's career.<ref>The beginning of this relationship is seen in ''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)</ref> Wonder Man also works for a time as a stuntman, an ideal vocation since he is invulnerable to virtually all conventional weapons.<ref>Mentioned by the Vision at the conclusion of ''Avengers'' #250 (Dec. 1984)</ref>

Wonder Man helps form the [[West Coast Avengers]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> and his new-found confidence begins to become arrogance. He develops a serious rivalry with Iron Man, but sees the error of his ways after a brutal battle with the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #25 (Oct. 1987)</ref> He also foils Doctor Doom's plot to control the world.<ref>''Emperor Doom'' graphic novel (1987)</ref> Wonder Man eventually accepts the Vision as his "brother," but there is a setback when the Vision is dismantled and rebuilt as an emotionless machine by a global conglomeration. The [[Scarlet Witch]] — the Vision's wife — asks Wonder Man to provide his brainwaves once again in order to rebuild the foundational personality matrix of the original Vision, but Wonder Man refuses, having feelings for her himself. The [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] further deduces that the Vision's original relationship to the Scarlet Witch may even have been predicated by Wonder Man's initial donation for the original personality matrix; at this, Wonder Man confirms that several of his hesitations about making the attempt arise from these doubts and the subconscious desire he's felt toward the Scarlet Witch since her separation from her husband.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #42 - 45 (Mar. - June 1989)</ref> He is then ensorcelled by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and battles the Avengers.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #38-45</ref>

Wonder Man battles old foes [[Erik Josten|Goliath]],<ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2 #1 (September 1991)</ref> and the Enchantress,<ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> before meeting his would-be sidekick "Spider" and battling Gamma-Burn, resulting in wrecking his jet-pack.<ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2 #3</ref> Wonder Man then battles the assassin Splice for the first time.<ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> Wonder Man takes part in the Kree/Shi'ar War, and had his powers altered when he and the Vision failed to prevent the Shi'ar Nega-Bomb from detonating.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #80-82; ''Quasar'' #32-33; ''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2 #7-9</ref> He battled Angkor,<ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2 #11-12</ref> and then journeyed to Hades where he battled [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], the Enchantress, and the Grim Reaper; he then learned that he was immortal.<ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2 #22-25</ref> When Avengers West Coast (renamed) disbands after a dispute, Wonder Man becomes a founding member of its successor group — [[Force Works]].<ref>''Force Works'' #1 (July 1994)</ref> Soon after this, an accident in space changes Wonder Man into a being of pure ionic energy,<ref>''Wonder Man'' #9 (Apr. 1992)</ref> and during a related mission against the alien [[Kree]], Wonder Man is disintegrated in an explosion. Many months later, the Scarlet Witch accidentally resurrects Wonder Man in ionic form; while in this form he appears when she is in need.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #3 (Apr. 1998)</ref> Several months later, the Scarlet Witch is able to fully revive Wonder Man and he now exists in an independent, more human form. It is also discovered later that the Grim Reaper - dead at the time - is also revived.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #10 - 11 (Nov. - Dec. 1998)</ref> Wonder Man becomes romantically involved with the Scarlet Witch, but ends their affair during the [[Kang Dynasty]] saga, due to her residual feelings for the Vision.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #51 (Apr. 2002)</ref>

===Civil War===
Wonder Man is blackmailed into working for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]] Civil War. Due to charges of misappropriation of funds in his non-profit organization, Wonder Man is pressured to work for the pro-registration side in the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] drama. In addition to capturing renegade vigilantes and criminals, Wonder Man is instrumental in creating televised messages to educate the public and yet-unregistered superhumans about the specifics of the Registration Act.<ref>''Civil War '' #1 - 7 (May 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> Wonder Man became a member of the [[Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #1 (May 2007)</ref>

Wonder Man began a romantic relationship with fellow Mighty Avenger [[Ms. Marvel]]; warning her, however, not to use her position as leader of the Avengers to keep him out of potentially dangerous situations just because of their relationship.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #6 (Oct. 2007)</ref>

===Dark Reign===
Following the events of the [[Secret Invasion]], [[Norman Osborn]] created a [[Dark Avengers|new team of Avengers]], effectively retiring Wonder Man. Wonder Man later appears on television, lamenting his tenure as an Avenger, claiming it was all a waste of time, and that using violence to uphold justice has caused nothing but heartache and death. He ends his speech by sadly admitting that having Osborn in charge is exactly what the country deserves.<ref>''New Avengers'' #51</ref> After this, Wonder Man is imprisoned as a member of the new [[Lethal Legion]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #1</ref>

Wonder Man has been seen alongside his old West Coast Avengers teammates, Ronin, Mockingbird, Tigra and War Machine in battle with a new version of [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]].<ref>''War Machine'' #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Simon Williams gained his superhuman powers due to chemical and radiation treatments with "ionic" energy by Baron Zemo, giving him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. While Zemo's initial aim is to use ionic energy treatments to make Wonder Man at least as strong as "the equal of any Avenger", his treatments surpass his expectations and endowed Wonder Man with strength nearly comparable to that of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>Stated by Zemo in ''Avengers'' #9 (Oct. 1964) and confirmed by Wonder Man in ''Avengers'' #176 (Oct. 1978).</ref> Zemo's treatments also grant Wonder Man virtual invulnerability, immortality, and instantaneous reflexes. Zemo also outfits Wonder Man with a rocket pack in his belt to achieve flight. 

During the beginning years, Wonder Man sometimes wore an ionic jet flight-pack which allowed him to fly.

Following his resurrection and metamorphosis, Wonder Man's physiology evolves to the point he acquires the power of true flight, independent of technology. Due to Wonder Man's self-regenerating ionic energy, he has the ability to exist indefinitely without air, food, or water, and he no longer ages. Wonder Man's eyes also glow a bright red courtesy of the ionic energy stored in his body. While with concentration, Wonder Man can make his eyes appear normal, he usually wears sunglasses to conceal the effect.

Before his "death" at the hands of the Kree, Wonder Man discovered new abilities of his ionic body, such as changing his size (enabling him to grow taller than his adversary Goliath) and emitting energy from his eyes. Since his resurrection, Wonder Man has not used these powers. However, when the Scarlet Witch resurrected him during [[Kurt Busiek]]'s tenure as head writer, Wonder Man was often seen as being able to transform into a state of pure living ionic energy at will and back again.

Wonder Man is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, having received Avengers training in unarmed combat by Captain America. He is also a trained electrical engineer with an advanced degree in electrical engineering, and is a capable industrialist, experienced stuntman, and a talented actor.

==Other versions==
===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In an alternate future, Wonder Man - now with snow white hair and using the alias "Hollywood" - reluctantly aids the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. He eventually joins the team,<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #62 (July 1995)</ref> and later the "breakaway" team, the ''Galactic Guardians''.<ref>''Galactic Guardians'' #1 - 4 (July - Nov. 1994)</ref> In #18 of the 2008 ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' series, he's shown as part of the Guardians in a potential 3009 AD.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 2 #18</ref>
