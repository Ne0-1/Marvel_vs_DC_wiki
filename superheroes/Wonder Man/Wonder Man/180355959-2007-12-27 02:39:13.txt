==Fictional character biography==
Simon Williams is the son of rich industrialist Sanford Williams, owner of Williams Innovations. Simon inherits the munitions factory after his father's death, but over time the company's profits fall due to its biggest competitor, [[Tony Stark]]. On the advice of his brother Eric, Simon tries to embezzle funds from his company but is caught and incarcerated. Simon blames Stark for his failure and readily accepts the proposition of master villain [[Baron Zemo]], who requires a pawn to infiltrate the Avengers. The desperate Simon Williams agrees and, after being freed, is transformed into an [[ion]]-powered being. Called Wonder Man by Zemo, he is then sent to meet and join the Avengers, with instructions to betray them at a critical moment. Zemo ensures Wonder Man's loyalty by advising him that as a result of the treatment his body now requires periodic doses of a serum to survive - a serum that only Zemo can provide. 

The plan fails when Wonder Man decides to save the Avengers, apparently at the cost of his own life. [[Iron Man]] - Tony Stark's alter ego - records Wonder Man's brain patterns in the hope that one day he can be revived.<ref>''Avengers'' #3</ref> Unbeknownst to the Avengers, Wonder Man's body has simply entered a catatonic state as it adjusts to the effects of the treatment. Eric Williams becomes distraught over the apparent death of his sibling and, blaming the Avengers, assumes the identity of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] in an effort to destroy them. The Grim Reaper attacks the Avengers three times before Wonder Man finally returns.<ref>''Avengers'' #52, 79, 102 + 107 - 108</ref>

Wonder Man remains in [[suspended animation]] for years, and it is during this period that [[Ultron]], the evil robot creation of [[Henry Pym]], steals the brain patterns recorded by the Avengers for use as a template for the synthezoid [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]<ref>''Avengers'' #57 - 58</ref> (it is eventually revealed that the Vision is built from [[Human Torch (android)|the original Human Torch]], an android created by Professor [[Phineas Horton]].<ref>''Avengers'' #134 - 135</ref> This, however, only happened in mainstream continuity and other origins were possible courtesy of the Forever Crystal of [[Immortus]]).<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1 - 12 (1998 - 1999)</ref>

During this vulnerable time, Wonder Man is used as pawn on three occasions. Wonder Man is briefly revived by [[Kang the Conqueror]] to battle the Avengers as part of his [[Legion of the Unliving]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol.1, #131 - 132</ref> and later "resurrected" as a [[zombie]] by [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] and the Grim Reaper to attack the Avengers once more.<ref>http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/comics101/123.html</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #152</ref> On the final occasion, the Living Laser hypnotizes a now-awake but still very weak Wonder Man in an unsuccessful attack on the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #6</ref> After this encounter, Wonder Man chooses to remain with the Avengers, and soon after defeats the Grim Reaper, who was intent on destroying the Vision as he was "artificial" and a "mockery" of his brother.<ref>Avengers #160</ref>

===The Avengers===
Wonder Man eventually joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity and becomes close friends with his teammate, the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. For several months after his resurrection, Wonder Man suffers from slight [[claustrophobia]] and a fear of dying in battle, as he did once before. Wonder Man finally overcomes his fear of death during the final battle with [[Korvac]].<ref>''Avengers'' #177</ref> Developing an interest in acting, Wonder Man stars in minor roles before moving to Hollywood, where fellow Avenger [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] uses his contacts to establish Wonder Man's career.<ref>The beginning of this relationship is seen in ''Avengers'' #211</ref> Wonder Man also works for a time as a stuntman, an ideal vocation since he is invulnerable to virtually all conventional weapons.<ref>Mentioned by the Vision at the conclusion of ''Avengers'' #250</ref>

Wonder Man joins the [[West Coast Avengers]], and his new-found confidence begins to become arrogance. He develops a serious rivalry with Iron Man, but sees the error of his ways after a brutal battle with the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #25</ref> Wonder Man eventually accepts the Vision as his "brother," but there is a setback when the Vision is dismantled and rebuilt as an emotionless machine by a global conglomeration. The [[Scarlet Witch]] - the Vision's wife - asks Wonder Man to provide his brainwaves once again in order to rebuild the foundational personality matrix of the original Vision, but Wonder Man refuses, having feelings for her himself. The [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] further deduces that the Vision's original relationship to the Scarlet Witch may even have been predicated by Wonder Man's initial donation for the original personality matrix; at this, Wonder Man confirms that several of his hesitations about making the attempt arise from these doubts and the subconscious desire he's felt toward the Scarlet Witch since her separation from her husband.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #42 - 45</ref>

When Avengers West Coast (renamed) disbands after a dispute, Wonder Man becomes a founding member of its successor group - [[Force Works]].<ref>''Force Works'' #1</ref> Soon after this, an accident in space changes Wonder Man into a being of pure ionic energy,<ref>''Wonder Man'' vol. 2, #9</ref> and during a related mission against the alien [[Kree]], Wonder Man is disintegrated in an explosion. Many months later, the Scarlet Witch accidentally resurrects Wonder Man in ionic form; while in this form he appears when she is in need.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #3</ref> Several months later, the Scarlet Witch is able to fully revive Wonder Man and he now exists in an independent, more human form. It is also discovered later that the Grim Reaper - dead at the time - is also revived.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #10 - 11</ref> Wonder Man becomes romantically involved with the Scarlet Witch, but ends their affair during [[Kang Dynasty|a global war against Kang]], due to her remaining feelings for the Vision.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #45 - 55</ref>

===Civil War===
Wonder Man is blackmailed into working for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during the SuperHuman Registration Act Civil War. Because of charges of misappropriations with some money in his non-profit organization, Wonder Man is pressured to work for the pro-registration side in the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] drama. In addition to capturing renegade vigilantes and criminals, Wonder Man is instrumental in creating televised messages to educate the public and yet-unregistered superhumans about the specifics of the Registration Act.<ref>''Civil War '' #1 - 7 (2006 - 2007)</ref> Wonder Man is now a member of the newly-formed [[Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #1 (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
While Zemo's initial aim is to use ionic energy treatments to make Wonder Man at least as strong as [[Henry Pym |Giant Man]], and "the equal of any Avenger," Zemo's treatments surpass his expectations and endow Wonder Man with strength comparable to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Zemo's treatments also grant Wonder Man virtual invulnerability, immortality, and instantaneous reflexes.  Zemo also outfits Wonder Man with a rocket pack in his belt so that he can fly like [[Iron Man]].

Following his resurrection and metamorphosis, Wonder Man's physiology evolves to the point he acquires the power of true flight, independent of any technology. Due to Wonder Man's self-regenerating ionic energy, he also no longer needs to sleep, eat or breathe.

Wonder Man's eyes glow red courtesy of the ionic energy stored in his body. While, with concentration, Wonder Man can revert his eyes to their natural state, he usually wears sunglasses to conceal the effect.

==Other versions==
===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In an alternate future, Wonder Man - now with snow white hair and using the alias "Hollywood" - reluctantly aids the Guardians of the Galaxy and eventually joins the team.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol.1, #62</ref>

In the [[MC2]] Universe, Wonder Man is never revived after initially dying to save the Avengers, with robotic copies being utilized instead.<ref>''A-Next'' #1 - 12</ref>
