He was a criminal who left clues toward his crimes, though unlike [[the Riddler]] they weren't riddles. He is the father of Stephanie Brown, the vigilante who was known as the [[Spoiler (comics)|Spoiler]] and later as [[Robin (Batman)|Robin]]. With several other villains, he was a member of the [[Justice League Antarctica]] and of the second [[Suicide Squad]]; he was killed in action in the latter group.
