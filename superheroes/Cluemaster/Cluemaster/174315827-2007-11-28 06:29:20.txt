The '''Cluemaster''' ('''Arthur Brown''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and enemy of [[Batman]]. A failed [[game show host]], he became a criminal who left clues toward his crimes, though unlike [[the Riddler]] these clues weren't riddles. 

==Fictional character history==
The Cluemaster starts his criminal campaign by a daring attempt to learn the secret identity of the Batman, in order to gain a fighting edge. This, however, fails.

Arthur Brown has a daughter named Stephanie, but rarely spends any time with her due to long periods of incarceration. When he returns to [[Gotham City|Gotham]], "rehabilitated," Stephanie becomes furious when she discovers that he has returned to crime without his need to leave clues behind. Making a costume for herself, she calls herself [[Spoiler (comics)|the Spoiler]], finds out her father's plans, and leaves clues so that the police and Batman can stop him. [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] tracks her down, and she joins in the capture of the Cluemaster. Each time the Cluemaster escapes or start some new plan, Stephanie dons her costume again in order to foil him. Eventually, she realises she enjoys being a hero, and begins regular patrols as Spoiler. For a brief period of time she even replaces her boyfriend, Tim Drake, as [[Robin (comics)#Stephanie Brown|Robin]].

With several other villains, Cluemaster becomes a member of the [[Injustice League]], then later the [[Justice League Antarctica]], attempting to reform. Cluemaster and his teammates volunteer to join the second [[Suicide Squad]], a group sanctioned by the US government, in return for a full pardon of his crimes. The Cluemaster also hopes to make Stephanie proud of him.

===Seeming death===

During the mission, which involves dealing with terrorists and a lovesick genetic experiment, Cluemaster sees his friends, [[Big Sir]], [[Clock King]] and [[Multi-Man]] die. Only the first two are tragedies as Multi-Man has died many times before. In the resulting chaotic battle, Cluemaster seemingly saves [[Major Disaster]]'s life twice, though the Major admits the situation was confusing. Cluemaster is seen shot many times through the chest. He survives this incident, with a year's recuperation in the hospital and many, many scars. He is encouraged by thoughts of his daughter. 

When he got out and discovers that his daughter has been killed, he takes on the [[secret identity]] Aaron Black and creates the "Campaign for Culpability", blaming Batman for his involvement in Stephanie's death, saying that she was not the first child working with Batman to die and that Batman should be brought to justice.

==Other media==

A considerably distorted and obese version of the Cluemaster has appeared on the [[animated series]]'' [[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' where Arthur Brown gets revenge on the people he blames for rigging the last question on "Think Thank Thunk", a [[game show]] that he competed in when he was a child. This version of Cluemaster was based on Tim Burton's character Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Cluemaster is voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]].

Brown was a child [[genius]], and the continuing champion on aforementioned show. After twelve straight weeks of victories, he lost when he gave an incorrect date to the discovery of one of [[Jupiter]]'s [[moon]]s, and in his child mind, this was nothing short of a life-shattering tragedy. His mother ruined the show's future by filing a [[lawsuit]], claiming the show was rigged. However, Ross, the host, and Bert, the producer, had some friends in high places, and cancelled the lawsuit. Ever since, Brown was under the delusion that he had been cheated out of his title; he dropped out of [[school]], and never attempted to build his life up. In the episode's events, he still lives with his mother, who has gone blind with age, and still thinks Brown is a boy. He spends his time rewatching the point where his life was destroyed, and eating Kremelos, a fictional cream-filled chocolate bar whos company sponsored Think Thank Thunk, as he received a lifetime supply as a consolation prize.

Cluemaster attempts to take his revenge on the show's producer, host, and the contestant who had beaten him. After humiliating them in public, he kidnaps them, and places them on a ridicously unfair gameshow, where a loss means death. Batman manages to save them by playing "all or nothing". He stumps the Cluemaster with the one question he does not know: the identity of the Batman. Throwing a temper tantrum, the Cluemaster attempts to unmask him, but is defeated and (presumably) taken to [[Arkham Asylum]].
