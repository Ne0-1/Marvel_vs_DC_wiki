'''Cluemaster''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]].

==History==
A failed [[game show host]], '''Arthur Brown''' became a criminal who left clues toward his crimes, though unlike [[the Riddler]] these clues weren't riddles. 

He had a daughter named Stephanie, but never got much of a chance to spend time with her, being in jail most of the time. When he returned to [[Gotham City|Gotham]], "rehabilitated," Stephanie became furious that he was returning to crime without his need to leave clues behind. She decided something needed to be done. Making a costume for herself, she called herself [[the Spoiler]]. She knew where her father was hiding out, found out his plans, and left clues so that the police and Batman could stop him. [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] tracked her down, and she joined in on the capturing of Cluemaster. Each time Cluemaster would escape or start some new plan, Stephanie would don her costume again. Eventually, she decided she liked being a hero, and began regular patrols as Spoiler. For a brief period of time she even replaced her boyfriend, Tim Drake, as [[Robin (comics)#Stephanie Brown|Robin]].

With several other villains, Cluemaster became a member of the [[Injustice League]], then later the [[Justice League Antarctica]], attempting to reform. Cluemaster and his teammates later volunteered to join the second [[Suicide Squad]], a group sanctiond by the US government, in return for a full pardon of his crimes. The Cluemaster also hoped to make Stephanie proud of him.

On his first mission he appeared to be killed in action, but managed to survive (albeit hideously scarred). He spent a year in a hospital, the only thing keeping him alive the thought of his daughter. 

When he got out and discovered that his daughter had died, he took up the name Aaron Black and created the campaign called "Campaign for Culpability", blaming Batman for his involvement in Stephanie's death, saying that she was not the first child working with Batman to die, and that Batman should be brought to justice.

A considerably distorted and obese version of the Cluemaster has appeared on the [[animated series]]'' [[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' where Arthur Brown gets revenge on the people he blames for rigging the last question on "Think Thank Thunk", a [[game show]] that he competed in when he was a child, and was defeated by Batman. Cluemaster is voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]].

Brown was a child [[genius]], and the continuing champion on the children's gameshow, "Think Thank Thunk". But one day, after twelve straight weeks of victories, he lost when he gave an incorrect date, and in his child mind, this was nothing short of a life-shattering tragedy. His mother ruined the show's future by filing a [[lawsuit]], claiming the show was rigged. However, Ross, the host, and Bert, the producer, had some friends in high places, and cancelled the lawsuit.  Ever since, Brown was under the delusion that he had been cheated out of his title; he dropped out of [[school]], and never attempted to build his life up. In the episode's events, he still lives with his mother, who has now lost touch with reality, and still thinks Brown is a boy. He spends his time rewatching the point where his life was destroyed, and eating Kremelos, a fictional cream-filled chocolate bar, as he received a lifetime supply as a consolation prize.

Cluemaster attempts to take his revenge on the show's producer, host, and the contestant who had beaten him. After humiliating them in public, he kidnapped them, and placed them on a ridicously unfair gameshow, where a loss meant death. Batman managed to save them by playing "all or nothing". He stumped the Cluemaster with the one question he does not know: the identity of the Batman. Throwing a temper tantrum, he attempted to unmask him, but was defeated, and (presumebly) taken to [[Arkham Asylum]].

'''NOTE''': It must be stated that he resembles [[Oogie Boogie]] from [[Tim Burton]]'s [[The Nightmare Before Christmas]] in which Glenn Shadix played the [[Mayor (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Mayor of Halloween Town]]. {{weasel}}
