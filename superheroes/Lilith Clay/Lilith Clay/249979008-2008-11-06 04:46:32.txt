'''Lilith Clay''' is a young [[superhero]]ine who occasionally appears in [[DC Comics|DC Comic's]] ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' titles.

==Pre-Crisis==
[[Image:LilithoriginTT38.jpg|thumb|left|''Lilith's origin as described as in Teen Titans #38'']] Originally living in peace at home, Lilith started to manifest strange mental powers at the age of 13. She read her parents' minds to find she was adopted, then left home to try to find her birth parents.  After some trouble, she ended up working as a dancer at the Canary Cottage disco.  During this time, she encountered Loren Jupiter, and began to aid him in his cause.{{clarify}}

Soon, Lilith approached the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and asked to join.  She saw premonitions involving a political figure, who inevitably died, proving her power.  She then became a member of the Teen Titans.

Eventually, she left the team and resettled on the West Coast, where she started a new branch of the Titans (known as Titans West). She briefly dated one of her team members, [[Hawk and Dove#Hawk and Dove|Don Hall (Dove)]], before the team disbanded.

During the ''Terror of Trigon'' storyline (''New Teen Titans, Vol. 2 #1-6)'', Lilith played a key role in tracking down the former Titan [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], who was at that time possessed by her [[Trigon|evil demonic father]].  Eventually, Lilith made some type of psychic connection with Raven's mentor, the goddess Azar, and hosted the souls of her followers in a successful attempt to cleanse Raven of evil.

Lilith stayed on with the Titans briefly, during which time she accompanied the team on a trip to Donna "[[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]]" Troy's home island of [[Themyscira]].  During this mission into the realms of Greek myth, Lilith finally learned her true parentage: her father was a normal human who had been seduced by [[Thia]], the mythological Greek Titaness of the sun.  The power-hungry Thia attempted to take over Olympus, but the young mortal Teen Titans helped defeat the [[Titans of Myth (comics)|Titans of Myth]] and returned home safely--all except Lilith, who elected to remain on Olympus, claiming her birthright as a demi-goddess.

==Post-Crisis==

After the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Lilith was not heard from for a time; however, the mythological Titans (including Thia) showed up in ''New Titans # 50-54'' as a benevolent pantheon and adoptive parents of Donna Troy.  This storyline effectively negated Lilith's origin.  Her only significant appearance at this time was a brief cameo in the ''War of the Gods'' storyline, in which she received a premonition that her friend Donna was once again in trouble; this showed readers that she was indeed alive and well, and living on Earth as opposed to Olympus.

Years later, Lilith once again found her birth parents.  Her mother's identity was never revealed to the readers, but it is known that she helped Lilith unlock untapped abilities.  Her birth father turned out to be none other than the Teen Titans' old benefactor, Loren Jupiter.

She took the name '''Omen''', and became part of the Teen Titans team lead by a teenaged [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]] and founded by Loren Jupiter; initially, the team did not realize that Omen was Lilith.  She was captured by her half-brother [[Haze (comics)|Haze]] (Jarrod Jupiter), who used her powers to augment his own.  Haze was defeated by the Teen Titans with the aid of four of the original Titans: [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Aqualad|Tempest]], [[Wally West|Flash]] III and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]]. Her Teen Titans team eventually disbanded. 

She aided the Titans in protecting former team-mate [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg's]] soul from the [[Justice League]] in ''JLA/Titans #1-3: The Technis Imperative.''  Shortly after that, Lilith was abducted by [[Vandal Savage]], who wanted her to divine a perfect team to take down the Titans.  Savage forced Lilith to submit, but she purposely chose members who wouldn't work well as a team.  She was rescued by the reformed Titans (''Titans #14'').  

Lilith stood with her old friends when a mysterious corporation called Optitron approached the Titans and [[Young Justice]] with an offer to fund the two groups.  Before they could discuss the offer, the teams were attacked by an android from the future called [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]].  The malfunctioning robot accidentally activated a [[Superman]] android believed to be long destroyed.  The rampaging Superman Android managed to both snap Lilith's neck and pierce Donna Troy's heart, killing both beloved Titans.  This tragedy, told in ''[[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day #1-3]],'' led team leader Nightwing to disband the two groups (though they would be reformed shortly thereafter as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] and the latest incarnation of the Teen Titans).

Lilith appeared in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #30, as her soul was resurrected by the newest [[Brother Blood]] as the latest in his doomed line of mother-figures. Despite the request of [[Mia Dearden|Speedy]], [[Kid Eternity]] did not allow her to stay among the living.

A statue of Lilith is in the [[Titans memorial|Memorial]] of the [[Titans Tower]] in [[San Francisco]].
