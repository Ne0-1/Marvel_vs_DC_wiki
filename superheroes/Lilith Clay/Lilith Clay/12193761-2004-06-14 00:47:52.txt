[[Lilith]] Clay is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[DC Comics]].

Originally living in peace at home, Lilith started to evidence strange mental powers at the age of 13. She read her parent's minds to find she was adopted, then left home to try to find her birth parents. After some trouble, she ended up working as a dancer at the Canary Cottage disco.  Soon, Lilith approached the [[Teen Titans]] and asked to join. She saw premonitions involving a political figure, who inevitably died, proving her power.  Lilith was a member of the Teen Titans' branch, Titans West. She took the name Omen, and was involved with Titans again.  Lilith was killed by a rogue [[Superman]] [[android]] in ''Titans/[[Young Justice]]: Graduation Day'' #3.
