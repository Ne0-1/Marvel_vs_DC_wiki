'''Lacuna (Woodstock)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] and the occasional ally of the superhero group [[X-Statix]]. 

==History==
Originally named [[Woodstock]], Lacuna is the daughter of two wealthy, extremely [[liberal]] former [[hippies]]. She often tried to rebel against her parents, but they were so open-minded that they would immediately accept and support whatever she tried to do. Woodstock grew up in [[Los Angeles]], where she became familiar with the exploits of X-Statix, then known as X-Force. She attempted to join the team after using her powers to pull benign pranks on them (such as putting bizarre hats atop [[U-Go Girl]]'s head), but she did not impress them so much as annoy them.

Determined to prove herself to the team, she made an appearance on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', which was being guest-hosted by U-Go Girl. She embarrassed the team by stripping them naked on camera, and caught the eye of television producers. Lacuna was finally welcomed to join X-Force, but declined so that she could star on her own television show, ''Lacuna and the Stars'', in which she would use her powers to spy on celebrities and learn their secrets. This finally disappointed her parents, which pleased Lacuna to no end.

Eager for ratings, Lacuna made the mistake of unmasking a new X-Statix member, The Mysterious [[Fan Boy]], on her show, which revealed him as be the homicidal, reality-warping mutant Arnie Lunt, who had been blackmailing the team for membership. In the wake of public outrage, X-Statix leader [[Mister Sensitive]] demanded that Lacuna help him in getting rid of Arnie, and she used her powers to kill him in what would appear to be a natural heart attack.

Lacuna later became infatuated with Mister Sensitive. She gave information to him that revealed that the team's founder, [[Spike Freeman]], had illegal ties to [[Saddam Hussein]]. She was shot in an attempt to prevent the information from leaking, and was put into a coma. Later, however, she was revived on-camera by a [[Faith healing|faith healer]] in an attempt to boost ratings for her show.

Lacuna was not featured on the list of [[The 198]], the listing of mutants who retained their powers following the decimation of the mutant population. The ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #6 didn't say anything about her keeping/losing her powers. The current Marvel policy is that if any character in the Handbook isn't listed as depowered, he or she still is powered.

==Powers==
She can create a temporary ripple in the timestream, which allows her to move about freely within a nano-second temporal period while everything else remains frozen in time.
