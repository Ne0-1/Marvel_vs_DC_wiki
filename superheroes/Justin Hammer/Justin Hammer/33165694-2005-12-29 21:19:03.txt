'''Justin Hammer''' is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He is frequently an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]].

A rival of industrialist Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), Hammer invented a device called the hypersonic scan transmitter, which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, Hammer took control of Iron Man's amor and forced him to kill an ambassador. Stark cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but had found a new enemy in Hammer. Hammer later stole Stark's Iron Man technology and sold it to a number of superhumans who wore [[powered armor]]. Although most of these individuals were supervillains, they also included the [[Guardsmen (comics)|Guardsmen]] of the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], a prison for superhuman criminals. Iron Man disabled the Stark-based technology in the suits in question, leading him into conflict with [[Captain America|The Captain]] and the his fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Much later, Hammer infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering [[nanites]] that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In the confrontation between Iron Man and Hammer on Hammer's own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice and lost in space.

He is the father of Justine Hammer ([[Crimson Cowl]]), who led the incarnation of the Masters of Evil that fought the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].
