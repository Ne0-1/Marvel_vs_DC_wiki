'''Justin Hammer''' is a [[fictional character]] that has appeared in various [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. As a frequent adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]], Justin Hammer exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''Iron Man'' (1st series) #120 (March 1979).

As he explains in his first major appearance, Hammer is the reason why many of Iron Man's supervillain enemies have access to extremely advanced technology, and why these foes use their equipment for violent crimes instead of profiting by bringing the designs to market. Hammer reveals that the villains are his underworld mercenaries, secretly armed and contractually obligated to fulfill missions against Hammer's competitors and enemies, such as Tony Stark.

Actor [[Sam Rockwell]] portrays a younger, American version of Justin Hammer in the 2010 film, ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.

== Fictional character biography ==
Justin Hammer was born in [[Surrey]], England, and later became a citizen of Monaco. A rival of industrialist Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), multi-billionaire businessman Hammer later became a criminal financier using unethical methods. In exchange for fifty percent of the crime profits, he would pay bail for costumed criminals and finance the development and replacement of both their weaponry and equipment.  In the event that a mercenary under his employ violated his contract, Hammer would send an enforcement unit, usually led by his most reliable supervillain employee, [[Blacklash]], to attack the rogue and confiscate his assigned equipment.

At the start of the ''[[Demon in a Bottle]]'' storyline, Justin Hammer invented a device called the hypersonic scan transmitter, which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. He tested this remote control, affecting Iron Man's unibeam, sealing plates, and boot jets.<ref>''Iron Man'' #118, 120, 123</ref> Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, Hammer took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the Carnelian ambassador, and set an army of superhuman criminals against Iron Man. Stark cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but had found a new enemy in Hammer.<ref>''Iron Man'' #124–127</ref>

With help from the supervillain [[Force (comics)|Force]], Hammer next hijacked yachts to smuggle opium into the United States. They battled Iron Man and were defeated.<ref>''Iron Man'' #140–141</ref>  Hammer later sent Adap-Tor to attack Stark Enterprises.<ref>''Iron Man'' #217</ref>

For a time, Hammer frequently hired the villain group known as the [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] in an attempt to kill both Stark and Iron Man, but fired the group after they constantly failed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

When Force later attempted to go straight, Hammer sent the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]], [[Blacklash]], and the second [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]] to retrieve Force, but they were defeated by Force with help from Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #223–224</ref>

During the "[[Armor Wars]]" storyline, Justin Hammer had Stark's Iron Man technology stolen by the [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]] and sold it to a number of superhumans who wore [[powered armor]]—including, among others, the [[Stilt-Man]], the Raiders, the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], the Beetle, [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the [[Titanium Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #225</ref> Iron Man set about to disable the Stark-based technology in the suits in question, going so far as to also disable ''sanctioned'' technology in the armor of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'S [[Mandroid]]s and the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]'s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], leading him into conflict with [[Captain America|The Captain]] and his fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Justin Hammer later sent the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to break the Blizzard out of prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #238</ref> He sent his "B-Team" (Blacklash, Blizzard, and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]) to battle the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #239–240</ref>

Justin Hammer redesigned the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]'s tail, and sent him to abduct General Musgrave. Justin Hammer sent Blacklash and the Rhino to retrieve the tail when the Scorpion refused to complete his mission.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #318–319</ref> Hammer later learned that Tony Stark had been shot.<ref>''Iron Man'' #243</ref> Hammer sent Boomerang to raid a Stark Enterprises security office.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> Hammer hired the [[Taskmaster]] to train the second [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #254</ref>

Later, Hammer agreed to design a new costume for the Rhino.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #4</ref> Hammer sent the Rhino and Boomerang to battle [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344–345</ref> With the Life Foundation, [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], Stane International, and the Brand Corporation, Hammer abducted a number of superhuman beings to analyze their abilities. Hammer also helped the first [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]] to reclaim the Ka-Stone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #12; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #8; ''New Warriors Annual'' #2</ref>

It was revealed, years later, that Justin Hammer had obtained Stane International after the death of its chairman [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], causing problems for Tony Stark through his old company. With operatives of [[HYDRA]], Roxxon Oil, Moroboshi International, and the Trinational Commission, Hammer tricked the Masters of Silence into attacking Stark Enterprises. Even when Hammer was forced to sell his stock in Stane International to Stark for the sum of one dollar,<ref>''Iron Man'' #281–283</ref> Hammer had the last laugh, when all the shady dealings and irresponsible, or even criminal actions of Stane International came back to bite Tony later.

Much later, after Justin Hammer had been diagnosed with an incurable illness, he resolved to destroy Tony Stark before he died. Justin Hammer infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering [[Nanorobotics|nanites]] that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In a final confrontation between Iron Man and Hammer on Hammer's own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice and lost in space.<ref>''Iron Man: Bad Blood'' #1-4</ref> Hammer Industries kept running, long enough for employees to forget exactly what happened to Justin (of course, they might never have been in the know).

Justin is the father of Justine Hammer{{Issue|date=September 2010}} (a.k.a. [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]), who led the incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] that fought the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Justine also has a daughter Sasha Hammer.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Justin Hammer===
[[Image:justinhammerultimate.JPG|135px|left|thumb|Ultimate Justin Hammer.]]In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], Justin Hammer first appeared in Ultimate Spider-Man #16 (''2002''). His late father, Justin Hammer, Sr. was a head industrialist for his time, and now he, Justin Jr. is CEO of Hammer Industries and is from the south of the US rather than from Britain. He was rivals with [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and was Osborn Industries' main competitor. In an effort to surpass Osborn Industries, Hammer hired Osborn's top scientist [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] and paid him for inside information.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} When Otto Octavius was caught in a lab accident, he was grafted with four metal arms. He blamed Hammer for this, and sought him out for revenge. He attacked Hammer in his limo, and Hammer subsequently died from a heart attack.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #20 (June 2002)</ref>

Justin Hammer has also been secretly funding superhuman testing directly violating the Superhuman Test Ban Treaty. Two of his more significant subjects were [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], both petty criminals who were given horrible powers.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

His daughter, [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]], appears in the [[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars|Ultimate Armor Wars]] series. She is found in a facility under Stark Industries that is being shut down by Stark after the Ultimatum attack on New York. The changes made to her by her father are degrading and killing her, until she is saved by Stark. She subsequently joins him on an international mission to recover stolen information regarding Iron Man tech.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

==In other media==
===Television===
Justin Hammer appeared as a villain on the 1990s animated ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' TV series voiced by [[Tony Steedman]] and later by [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]]. Justin Hammer is not only shown to be a rival of Tony Stark like in the comics, he was also an ally of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] here as well as the one who orchestrated the death of Tony's father (which was later revealed to be a cover-up by S.H.I.E.L.D. in "Not Far From the Tree"). In "The Armor Wars" two-parter, he had [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] steal the Stark Armor designs and sold them to each of the armored criminals. He also created the [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]] robot to eliminate his competition. After Firepower was defeated, Iron Man appeared in Justin Hammer's office to confront him. Iron Man then placed a virus-containing disc in Justin's computer that completely wiped out any records of his designs and uploaded it to the internet and Hammer’s computers. The same virus completely deleted all of Hammer’s files, and presumably left his company bankrupt. It is also implied that he isn't aware that Stark and Iron Man are one and the same. He was one of the few first season villains who appeared in Season 2 episodes besides the [[season premiere]] and the [[season finale]].

===Film===

* [[Sam Rockwell]] portrays Justin Hammer in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref>http://www.cinematical.com/2009/01/16/sam-rockwell-confirms-himself-for-iron-man-2/</ref> as the secondary antagonist of the film.<ref>http://www.superherohype.com/news/ironmannews.php?id=7689</ref> This version of Hammer is only loosely based on his comics counterpart; he is much younger than the comic book version, closer to Tony Stark in age, is American instead of British, and his personality is much less icy. In fact, he is quite incompetent and bumbling both as villain and businessman. Like in the comics, Hammer is a defense contractor and rival of Tony Stark who attempts to replicate Stark's technology. When it came to Tony Stark being subpoenaed to Congress, Justin Hammer was there. Tony Stark used his PDA to hack into the television monitors showing attempts at an Iron Man armor (with one of them being from Hammer Industries) which went horribly awry. Justin commented that the wearer of that armor is still alive after that experience. After [[Ivan Vanko]] publicly attacks Stark with his homemade, [[arc reactor]]-powered "[[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]]" suit, Hammer secretly hires the Russian villain in order to "make Iron Man look like an antique". Vanko manufactures a line of military drones for Hammer, who unveils them at the Stark Expo alongside the [[War Machine]] armor. However, Vanko rigs the drones and the War Machine armor to attack Iron Man, double-crossing Hammer and exposing their alliance. In retribution, Hammer aids Pepper and Black Widow in attempting to break Vanko's control over the drones, although Hammer is still arrested for his crimes. He swears revenge on both Stark and Pepper as he is taken away by the police.
