'''Justin Hammer''' is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He is frequently an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]]. He first appeared in ''Iron Man'' (1st series) #120 (''1978'').

== Fictional character biography ==
Justin Hammer was born in [[Surrey]], England. A rival of industrialist Anthony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), multimillionaire businessman Hammer invented a device called the hypersonic scan transmitter, which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, Hammer took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill an ambassador. Stark cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but had found a new enemy in Hammer. 

Hammer uses unethical methods.  In exchange for fifty percent of the profits from their crimes, he will pay bail for costumed criminals and finance the development and replacement of their weaponry and equipment.

For a time, Hammer frequently hired the villain group known as the [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] in an attempt to kill both Stark and Iron Man, but fired the group after they constantly failed. Hammer later had Stark's Iron Man technology stolen by the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] and sold it to a number of superhumans who wore [[powered armor]] - including, among others, the [[Stilt-Man]], the Raiders, the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and even [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the [[Titanium Man]]. Iron Man started [[Armor Wars|a small war]] to disable the Stark-based technology in the suits in question, going so far as to also disable ''sanctioned'' technology in the armor of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]´S [[Mandroid]]s and the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]´s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], leading him into conflict with [[Captain America|The Captain]] and the his fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In short, Justin Hammer's greed led to the first Armor War.

It was revealed, years later, that Justin Hammer had obtained Stane International after the death of its chairman, causing problems for Tony Stark through his old company, which even led to a confrontation between Iron Man and the Masters of Silence. Even when he was forced to sell it to Stark for the sum of one dollar, he had the last laugh, when all the shady dealings and irresponsible, or even criminal actions of Stane International came back to bite Tony later. 

Much later, after Justin Hammer had been diagnosed with an incurable illness, he decided he did not want to die before destroying Tony Stark. Hammer infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering [[nanites]] that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In a final confrontation between Iron Man and Hammer on Hammer's own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice and lost in space. Hammer Industries kept running, long enough for employees to forget exactly what happened to Justin (of course, they might never have been in the know).

He is the father of Justine Hammer (a.k.a. [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]), who led the incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] that fought the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

==Ultimate Universe==
[[image:justinhammerultimate.JPG|135px|left|thumb|Ultimate Justin Hammer.]]In the Ultimate Universe, Justin Hammer first appeared in Ultimate Spider-Man #16 (''2002'').

There, he is a wealthy industrialist and CEO of Hammer Industries. He was rivals with [[Norman Osborn]] and was Osborn Industries' main competitor. In an effort to surpass Osborn Industries Hammer hired Osborn's top scientist [[Otto Octavius]] and paid him for inside information. 

Justin Hammer has also been secretly funding superhuman testing directly violating the Superhuman Test Ban Treaty. Two of his more significant subjects were Electro and Sandman, both petty criminals who were given horrible powers.

When Otto Octavius was caught in a lab accident, he was grafted with four metal arms. He blamed Hammer for this, and sought him out for revenge. He attacked Hammer in his limo, and Hammer subsequently died from a heart attack.

==In other media==
Justin Hammer also appeared as a villain on the 1990s ''[[Iron Man (animated series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, where he was voiced by [[Tony Seedman]] and [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]]. He was one of the few first season villains who appeared in Season 2 episodes besides the [[season premiere]] and the [[season finale]]
