'''Justin Hammer''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as a villainous entrepreneur and a frequent adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]]. As he explains in his first major appearance, he is the reason why many of Iron Man's supervillain enemies have access to extremely advanced technology and why these foes use their equipment for violent crimes instead of profiting by bringing the designs to market. Hammer reveals that the villains are his underworld mercenaries, secretly armed and contractually obliged to fulfill missions against Hammer's competitors and enemies, such as Tony Stark.

[[Sam Rockwell]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref>{{cite news|last=Rappe|first=Elisabeth|title=Sam Rockwell Confirms Himself For 'Iron Man 2'|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/01/16/sam-rockwell-confirms-himself-for-iron-man-2/|access-date=April 20, 2013|newspaper=Cinematical|date=January 16, 2009}}</ref> and the [[short film]] ''[[All Hail the King]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Justin Hammer was born in [[Surrey]], England and later became a citizen of Monaco. A rival of industrialist Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), multi-billionaire businessman  Hammer later became a criminal financier using unethical methods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=189}}</ref> In exchange for fifty percent of the crime profits, he would pay bail for costumed criminals and finance the development and replacement of both their weaponry and equipment. In the event that a mercenary under his employ violated his contract, Hammer would send an enforcement unit (usually led by his most reliable supervillain employee [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]]) to attack the rogue and confiscate his assigned equipment.

At the start of the ''[[Demon in a Bottle]]'' storyline,  Hammer invented a device called the Hypersonic Scan Transmitter which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. He tested this remote control affecting Iron Man's unibeam, sealing plates, and boot jets.<ref>''Iron Man'' #118, 120, 123</ref> Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International,  he took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the Carnelian ambassador, and set an army of superhuman criminals (consisting of [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] I, [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], [[Man-Killer]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] I, [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], and [[Aqueduct (comics)|Water Wizard]]) against Iron Man. Ultimately, Tony Stark not only cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but finally learned that a major enemy was behind multiple attacks on his interests for years.<ref>''Iron Man'' #124–127</ref>

With help from the supervillain [[Force (comics)|Force]], Hammer next hijacked yachts to smuggle opium into the United States. They battled Iron Man and were defeated.<ref>''Iron Man'' #140–141</ref> When Stark lost his company to [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], Hammer left the destitute Stark to his own devices while continuing with his own enterprises. When Stark recovered and re-entered the business world with Stark Enterprises, Hammer sent the Adap-Tor (a robotic attack drone disguised as a helicopter) to attack the new company as a way of "welcoming" Stark back.<ref>''Iron Man'' #217</ref>

For a time, Hammer frequently hired the villain group known as the [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] in an attempt to kill both Tony Stark and Iron Man, but fired the group after they constantly failed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

When Force later attempted to go straight, Hammer sent Beetle, Blacklash, and [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] II to retrieve Force, but they were defeated by Force with help from Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #223–224</ref>

During the "[[Armor Wars]]" storyline, Hammer had Tony Stark's Iron Man technology stolen by [[Spymaster (comics)#Original Spymaster|Spymaster]] and sold it to a number of superhumans who wore powered armor (including [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Raiders (comics)|Raiders]], the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], Beetle, [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the [[Titanium Man]]).<ref>''Iron Man'' #225</ref> Iron Man set about to disable the Stark-based technology in the suits in question, going so far as to also disable ''sanctioned'' technology in the armor of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'S [[Mandroid]]s and the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]'s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], leading him into conflict with [[Captain America|The Captain]] and his fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Hammer later sent the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] (who Hammer once provided a removable version of his armor to) to break Blizzard out of prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #238</ref> He sent his "B-Team" (Blacklash, Blizzard, and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]) to battle [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #239–240</ref>

Hammer redesigned [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]'s tail and sent him to abduct General Musgrave. When Scorpion refused to complete his mission, Hammer sent Blacklash and the Rhino to retrieve the tail.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #318–319</ref> Hammer later learned that Tony Stark had been shot, and ordered a batch of orchids to be sent to him with a card expressing condolences should he live.<ref>''Iron Man'' #243</ref> He sent Boomerang to raid a Stark Enterprises security office<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> and hired [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] to train the second Spymaster.<ref>''Iron Man'' #254</ref>

Later, Hammer agreed to design a new costume for Rhino.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #4</ref> He sent Rhino and Boomerang to battle [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344–345</ref> With the Life Foundation, [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], Stane International, and the Brand Corporation, he abducted a number of superhuman beings to analyze their abilities. He also helped the first [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]] to reclaim the Ka-Stone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #12; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #8; ''New Warriors Annual'' #2</ref>

Years later, it was revealed that Hammer had obtained Stane International after the death of its chairman Obadiah Stane, causing problems for Tony Stark through his old company. With operatives of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], Roxxon Oil, Moroboshi International, and the Trinational Commission, he tricked the Masters of Silence into attacking Stark Enterprises. Even when forced to sell his stock in Stane International to Stark for the sum of one dollar,<ref>''Iron Man'' #281–283</ref> Hammer had the last laugh when all the shady dealings and irresponsible, or even criminal actions of Stane International came back to bite Tony later.

Hammer later sent Barrier, Blacklash, and Ringer to recruit Luis Barrett to become the new [[Thunderbolt (Marvel Comics)|Thunderbolt]]. The three villains were foiled by the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #17</ref>

Discovering that he had been diagnosed with an incurable cancer-like illness, Hammer resolved to destroy Tony Stark before he died. He infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering nanites that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In a final confrontation with Iron Man on Hammer's own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice when the water he fell into leaked out into space and instantly froze and is currently lost in space. While observing his frozen body drifting in Earth's orbit, Iron Man reflected that his foe would now "live forever".<ref>''Iron Man: Bad Blood'' #1-4</ref>

Justin is later revealed to be the father of [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]] and the grandfather of [[Sasha Hammer]].<ref name=IronMan25>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matt Fraction]]|artist=[[Salvador Larocca]]|story=Stark Resilient Part 1|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=25|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref>
