'''Justin Hammer''' is a [[fictional character]] that has appeared in various [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. As a frequent adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]], Justin Hammer exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]].

As he explains in his first major appearance, Hammer is the reason why many of Iron Man's supervillain enemies have access to extremely advanced technology, and why these foes use their equipment for violent crimes instead of profiting by bringing the designs to market. Justin Hammer reveals that the villains are his underworld mercenaries, secretly armed and contractually obliged to fulfill missions against Hammer's competitors and enemies, such as Tony Stark.

==Fictional character biography==
Justin Hammer was born in [[Surrey]], England and later became a citizen of Monaco. A rival of industrialist Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), multi-billionaire businessman Justin Hammer later became a criminal financier using unethical methods. In exchange for fifty percent of the crime profits, he would pay bail for costumed criminals and finance the development and replacement of both their weaponry and equipment. In the event that a mercenary under his employ violated his contract, Hammer would send an enforcement unit (usually led by his most reliable supervillain employee [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]]) to attack the rogue and confiscate his assigned equipment.

At the start of the ''[[Demon in a Bottle]]'' storyline, Justin Hammer invented a device called the Hypersonic Scan Transmitter which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. He tested this remote control affecting Iron Man's unibeam, sealing plates, and boot jets.<ref>''Iron Man'' #118, 120, 123</ref> Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, Justin Hammer took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the Carnelian ambassador, and set an army of superhuman criminals (consisting of [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] I, [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], [[Man-Killer]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] I, [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], and [[Aqueduct (comics)|Water Wizard]]) against Iron Man. Ultimately, Tony Stark not only cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but finally learned that he has had a major enemy behind multiple attacks on his interests for years.<ref>''Iron Man'' #124–127</ref>

With help from the supervillain [[Force (comics)|Force]], Justin Hammer next hijacked yachts to smuggle opium into the United States. They battled Iron Man and were defeated.<ref>''Iron Man'' #140–141</ref> When Stark lost his company to [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], Justin Hammer left the destitute Stark to his own devices while continuing with his own enterprises. When Stark recovered and re-entered the business world with Stark Enterprises, Justin Hammer sent the Adap-Tor (a robotic attack drone disguised as a helicopter) to attack the new company as a way of "welcoming" Stark back.<ref>''Iron Man'' #217</ref>

For a time, Justin Hammer frequently hired the villain group known as the [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] in an attempt to kill both Tony Stark and Iron Man, but fired the group after they constantly failed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

When Force later attempted to go straight, Justin Hammer sent Beetle, Blacklash, and [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]] II to retrieve Force, but they were defeated by Force with help from Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #223–224</ref>

During the "[[Armor Wars]]" storyline, Justin Hammer had Tony Stark's Iron Man technology stolen by [[Spymaster (comics)#Original Spymaster|Spymaster]] and sold it to a number of superhumans who wore [[powered armor]] (including [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Raiders (comics)|Raiders]], the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], Beetle, [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the [[Titanium Man]]).<ref>''Iron Man'' #225</ref> Iron Man set about to disable the Stark-based technology in the suits in question, going so far as to also disable ''sanctioned'' technology in the armor of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'S [[Mandroid]]s and the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]'s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], leading him into conflict with [[Captain America|The Captain]] and his fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Justin Hammer later sent the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to break Blizzard out of prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #238</ref> He sent his "B-Team" (Blacklash, Blizzard, and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]) to battle [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #239–240</ref>

Justin Hammer redesigned [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]'s tail, and sent him to abduct General Musgrave. Justin Hammer sent Blacklash and the Rhino to retrieve the tail when the Scorpion refused to complete his mission.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #318–319</ref> Justin Hammer later learned that Tony Stark had been shot, and ordered a batch of orchids to be sent to him with a card expressing condolences should he live.<ref>''Iron Man'' #243</ref> Justin Hammer sent Boomerang to raid a Stark Enterprises security office.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> Justin Hammer hired [[Taskmaster]] to train the second Spymaster.<ref>''Iron Man'' #254</ref>

Later, Justin Hammer agreed to design a new costume for Rhino.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #4</ref> Justin Hammer sent Rhino and Boomerang to battle [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344–345</ref> With the Life Foundation, [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], Stane International, and the Brand Corporation, Justin Hammer abducted a number of superhuman beings to analyze their abilities. Justin Hammer also helped the first [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]] to reclaim the Ka-Stone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #12; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #8; ''New Warriors Annual'' #2</ref>

Years later, it was revealed that Justin Hammer had obtained Stane International after the death of its chairman Obadiah Stane, causing problems for Tony Stark through his old company. With operatives of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], Roxxon Oil, Moroboshi International, and the Trinational Commission, Justin Hammer tricked the Masters of Silence into attacking Stark Enterprises. Even when Justin Hammer was forced to sell his stock in Stane International to Stark for the sum of one dollar,<ref>''Iron Man'' #281–283</ref> Justin Hammer had the last laugh when all the shady dealings and irresponsible, or even criminal actions of Stane International came back to bite Tony later.

Justin Hammer later sent Barrier, Blacklash, and Ringer to recruit Luis Barrett to become the new [[Thunderbolt (Marvel Comics)|Thunderbolt]]. The three villains were foiled by the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #17</ref>

Justin Hammer later discovered that had been diagnosed with an incurable cancer-like illness. He resolved to destroy Tony Stark before he died. Justin Hammer infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering [[Nanorobotics|nanites]] that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In a final confrontation between Iron Man and Justin Hammer on Hammer's own space station, Justin Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice (when the water he fell in leaked out into space and instantly froze) and is currently lost in space. While observing Justin Hammer's frozen body drifting in space, Iron Man reflected that his foe would now "live forever."<ref>''Iron Man: Bad Blood'' #1-4</ref>

Justin is later revealed to be the father of [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]] and the grandfather of [[Sasha Hammer]].<ref name=IronMan25>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matt Fraction]]|artist=[[Salvador Larocca]]|story=Stark Resilient Part 1|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=25|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref>
