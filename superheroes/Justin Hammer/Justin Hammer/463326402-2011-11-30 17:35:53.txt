'''Justin Hammer''' is a [[fictional character]] that has appeared in various [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. As a frequent adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]], Justin Hammer exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''Iron Man'' (1st series) #120 (March 1979).

As he explains in his first major appearance, Hammer is the reason why many of Iron Man's supervillain enemies have access to extremely advanced technology, and why these foes use their equipment for violent crimes instead of profiting by bringing the designs to market. Hammer reveals that the villains are his underworld mercenaries, secretly armed and contractually obligated to fulfill missions against Hammer's competitors and enemies, such as Tony Stark.

Actor [[Sam Rockwell]] portrays a younger, American version of Justin Hammer in the 2010 film, ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.

== Fictional character biography ==
Justin Hammer was born in [[Surrey]], England, and later became a citizen of Monaco. A rival of industrialist Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), multi-billionaire businessman Hammer later became a criminal financier using unethical methods. In exchange for fifty percent of the crime profits, he would pay bail for costumed criminals and finance the development and replacement of both their weaponry and equipment. In the event that a mercenary under his employ violated his contract, Hammer would send an enforcement unit, usually led by his most reliable supervillain employee, [[Blacklash]], to attack the rogue and confiscate his assigned equipment.

At the start of the ''[[Demon in a Bottle]]'' storyline, Justin Hammer invented a device called the hypersonic scan transmitter, which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. He tested this remote control, affecting Iron Man's unibeam, sealing plates, and boot jets.<ref>''Iron Man'' #118, 120, 123</ref> Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, Hammer took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the Carnelian ambassador, and set an army of superhuman criminals against Iron Man. Ultimately, Stark not only cleared his name and destroyed the control device, but finally learned that he has had a major enemy behind multiple attacks on his interests for years.<ref>''Iron Man'' #124–127</ref>

With help from the supervillain [[Force (comics)|Force]], Hammer next hijacked yachts to smuggle opium into the United States. They battled Iron Man and were defeated.<ref>''Iron Man'' #140–141</ref>  When Stark lost his company to [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], Hammer left the destitute Stark to his own devices while continuing with his own enterprises; when Stark recovered and re-entered the business world with Stark Enterprises, Hammer sent the Adap-Tor (a robotic attack drone disguised as a helicopter) to attack the new company as a way of "welcoming" Stark back.<ref>''Iron Man'' #217</ref>

For a time, Hammer frequently hired the villain group known as the [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] in an attempt to kill both Stark and Iron Man, but fired the group after they constantly failed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

When Force later attempted to go straight, Hammer sent the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]], [[Blacklash]], and the second [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]] to retrieve Force, but they were defeated by Force with help from Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #223–224</ref>

During the "[[Armor Wars]]" storyline, Justin Hammer had Stark's Iron Man technology stolen by the [[Spymaster (comics)#Original Spymaster|Spymaster]] and sold it to a number of superhumans who wore [[powered armor]] (including [[Stilt-Man]], the Raiders, the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], Beetle, [[Crimson Dynamo]] and the [[Titanium Man]]).<ref>''Iron Man'' #225</ref> Iron Man set about to disable the Stark-based technology in the suits in question, going so far as to also disable ''sanctioned'' technology in the armor of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'S [[Mandroid]]s and the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]'s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], leading him into conflict with [[Captain America|The Captain]] and his fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Justin Hammer later sent the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to break the Blizzard out of prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #238</ref> He sent his "B-Team" (Blacklash, Blizzard, and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]) to battle the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #239–240</ref>

Justin Hammer redesigned the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]'s tail, and sent him to abduct General Musgrave. Justin Hammer sent Blacklash and the Rhino to retrieve the tail when the Scorpion refused to complete his mission.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #318–319</ref> Hammer later learned that Tony Stark had been shot, and ordered a batch of orchids to be sent to him, with a card expressing condolences should he live.<ref>''Iron Man'' #243</ref> Hammer sent Boomerang to raid a Stark Enterprises security office.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> Hammer hired the [[Taskmaster]] to train the second [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #254</ref>

Later, Hammer agreed to design a new costume for the Rhino.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #4</ref> Hammer sent the Rhino and Boomerang to battle [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344–345</ref> With the Life Foundation, [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], Stane International, and the Brand Corporation, Hammer abducted a number of superhuman beings to analyze their abilities. Hammer also helped the first [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]] to reclaim the Ka-Stone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #12; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #8; ''New Warriors Annual'' #2</ref>

It was revealed, years later, that Justin Hammer had obtained Stane International after the death of its chairman [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], causing problems for Tony Stark through his old company. With operatives of [[HYDRA]], Roxxon Oil, Moroboshi International, and the Trinational Commission, Hammer tricked the Masters of Silence into attacking Stark Enterprises. Even when Hammer was forced to sell his stock in Stane International to Stark for the sum of one dollar,<ref>''Iron Man'' #281–283</ref> Hammer had the last laugh, when all the shady dealings and irresponsible, or even criminal actions of Stane International came back to bite Tony later.

Much later after Justin Hammer had been diagnosed with an incurable illness, he resolved to destroy Tony Stark before he died. Justin Hammer infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering [[Nanorobotics|nanites]] that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In a final confrontation between Iron Man and Hammer on Hammer's own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice and lost in space.<ref>''Iron Man: Bad Blood'' #1-4</ref> 

Justin is the father of  [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer (a.k.a. Crimson Cowl)]] and the grandfather of [[Sasha Hammer]].<ref name=IronMan25>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matt Fraction]]|artist=[[Salvador Larocca]]|story=Stark Resilient Part 1|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=25|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref>

{{plot|section|date=November 2011}}
* Justin Hammer appeared as a villain on the 1990s animated ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' TV series voiced by [[Tony Steedman]] and later by [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]]. Justin Hammer is not only shown to be a rival of Tony Stark like in the comics, he was also an ally of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] here as well as the one who orchestrated the death of Tony's father (which was later revealed to be a cover-up by S.H.I.E.L.D. in "Not Far From the Tree"). In "The Armor Wars" two-part episode, he had [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] steal the Stark Armor designs and sold them to each of the armored criminals. He also created the [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]] robot to eliminate his competition. After Firepower was defeated, Iron Man appeared in Justin Hammer's office to confront him. Iron Man then placed a virus-containing disc in Justin's computer that completely wiped out any records of his designs and uploaded it to the internet and Hammer’s computers. The same virus completely deleted all of Hammer’s files, and presumably left his company bankrupt. It is also implied that he isn't aware that Stark and Iron Man are one and the same. He was one of the few first season villains who appeared in Season 2 episodes besides the [[season premiere]] and the [[season finale]].

* A younger version of Justin Hammer appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]].<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=676</ref> After Howard Stark's disappearance, he has become the most powerful weapons dealer, surpassing Stark Enterprises. In the episode "Invincible Iron Man: Dissassembled", he and [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] are kidnapped by Whiplash. In the episode "Invincible Iron Man: Reborn," it was revealed that Justin Hammer had orchestrated his own kidnapping as he had become allies with [[Fixer (comics)|Mr. Fix]], [[Blacklash|Whiplash]], and [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]]. He also had his assistant Sasha implant a nanovirus into Justin Hammer that would remotely shut down Mr. Fix's brain should he fail him. In the episode "Look into the Light," Justin Hammer has Mr. Fix reassemble [[Living Laser]] in order to use him as research for Project Titanium which ends up splitting Living Laser into a Light Half and a Dark Half. After Living Laser was freed and reassembled, Justin Hammer scolds Mr. Fix for losing Living Laser. As a consolation prize, Justin Hammer was given the disk which contained the info they gathered for Project Titanium. In the episode "Ghost in the Machine," [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] gives a copy of the blueprints for the Iron Man Armor to Justin Hammer which he uses to create an armor for Project Titanium. In the episode "Line of Fire," Justin Hammer's vibranium smuggling operation from Wakanda is disrupted by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] causing Justin Hammer to call in [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]] to dispose of Black Panther. When Black Knight and those involved were sent to the Vault, Nick Fury tells Iron Man and Black Panther that Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer denied any involvement in the caper. In the episode "Titanium vs. Iron," Justin Hammer completes his Project Titanium yet the unveiling of the project before Nick Fury and the other military members ends up disrupted by Iron Man in his stealth armor who ends up learning of Project Titanium. Justin Hammer's secretary Sasha ends up rescheduling his meeting with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the other military members as Justin plans to spring a trap for when Iron Man tries another attempt to delete Project Titanium. Justin Hammer then sends an invite to Tony Stark which quotes "I know your secret" indicating to them that Ghost told him about Tony Stark's identity of Iron Man. Later that night, Tony Stark meets with Justin Hammer where Justin Hammer reveals at dinner that Tony was contributing designs to Stark International claiming that he helped Obadiah Stane with the Iron Man designs. Pepper later tells Tony that S.H.I.E.L.D. has suspected of criminal activities with the supervillain members of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], the [[Masters of Evil]], and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Justin Hammer has Mr. Fix work with the prototype Project Titanium armor despite Mr. Fix's objection that the titanium and vibranium will need to be melded together. Justin Hammer then has Mr. Fix prepare the camera-bots to record the event where he takes down Iron Man. Later that night, Iron Man infiltrates Hammer Multinational to finish the job in his stealth armor. Just then, Iron Man is ambushed by Justin Hammer in the Titanium Man armor who sees through Iron Man's stealth armor. War Machine comes to Iron Man's aid only for Titanium Man to knock out War Machine. Titanium Man ends up chasing after Iron Man (who ends up carrying War Machine away) and ends up dropping War Machine. Iron Man has his armor do a proposal which spins Iron Man free and pick up War Machine. When Titanium Man catches up, he destroys the stealth armor only to discover that Tony had bailed at the last minute. Titanium Man ends up chasing after Tony until War Machine wakes up. In the nick of time, Tony Stark's Mark II armor arrives and helps War Machine fight Titanium Man. Iron Man was able to bind Titanium Man enough to warm up the Titanium Man armor. Upon returning to Hammer Multinational, Justin Hammer bails from the suit as Blizzard freezes it. Mr. Fix tells Justin that he had warned him about not letting him meld the titanium with the vibranium. Justin Hammer declares that Mr. Fix has failed for the last time and ends up shutting him down. Justin then places a disk containing Mr. Fix's conscious into his computer systems so that Mr. Fix can work nonstop to perfect the Titanium Man armor. In the episode "The Hawk and the Spider," Justin Hammer uses a rebuilt Titanium Man armor to steal Stark International's User Interface Chip from Hawkeye and Black Widow (after they stole it from Iron Man) before they can arrange to give the User Interface Chip to Count Nefaria. Hawkeye and Black Widow's weapons couldn't phase Justin Hammer's Titanium Man armor and he manages to defeat them. Hawkeye manages to give up the User Interface Chip. Justin Hammer later speaks with Mr. Fix 2.0 about the User Interface Chip which would plan to control the armors and that the User Interface Chip must be programmed well to be adapted to the Titanium Man armor. When Sasha warns Justin Hammer about Hawkeye and Black Widow's infiltration, Justin Hammer tells Sasha to activate his new security system. When Iron Man infiltrates the building, Justin Hammer begins to break out his new "toy" that his men found bobbing in the river despite Sasha's objection. After Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow end up escaping the security systems, Justin Hammer activates his "toy" which turns out to be MODOK who ends up attacking Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. After MODOK was defeated by Iron Man and Hawkeye, Justin Hammer unleashes his guards on them until Iron Man and Hawkeye escape. In the episode "Fugitive of S.H.I.E.L.D.," Justin Hammer works with Black Widow to steal a microchip for him. When Justin Hammer meets up with Black Widow at his sea-based mansion, Iron Man ends up crashing the exchange. When Ghost arrives and fights Iron Man and Black Widow for the microchip, Justin Hammer leaves during the fight. In the episode "Heavy Mettle," Justin Hammer is displeased that Obadiah Stane has landed the biggest military contract that surpassed Hammer Multinational. After firing a laser on the television, Justin Hammer orders Sasha to see if Mr. Fix 2.0 has finished the weapon which he plans use in order to put Hammer Multinational back on the top. Justin Hammer in his Titanium Man armor later ambushes Iron Man to call a ceasefire in a plot to take down Obadiah Stane and Iron Monger. When Iron Man refuses Titanium Man's armor, Titanium Man attacks Iron Man. Sasha tells Justin that Obadiah Stane has snuck into Stark International. Upon using the Titanium Man armor to infiltrate Stark International, Justin Hammer manages to place a device that would make the Iron Monger armor go haywire. When Justin Hammer sees that Obadiah Stane has Pepper Potts, Sasha advises that Justin Hammer uses the Titanium Man armor to save Pepper Potts from Iron Monger which doesn't go well. After Whitney convinces her father not to kill Iron Man, Justin Hammer tells Sasha to take control of the Iron Monger armor and send it on a rampage. Iron Man discovers that someone is remote-controlling the Iron Monger and suspects that Titanium Man is behind this. When Justin asks for Sasha to help, Sasha controls the Iron Monger armor to target Whitney. Iron Monger then falls off the building as Titanium Man laughs at this. Iron Man and War Machine attack Titanium Man enough to blast him into the mountains with the Titanium Man armor disabled.

* [[Sam Rockwell]] portrays Justin Hammer in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref>http://www.cinematical.com/2009/01/16/sam-rockwell-confirms-himself-for-iron-man-2/</ref> as the secondary antagonist of the film.<ref>http://www.superherohype.com/news/ironmannews.php?id=7689</ref> This version of Hammer is a younger man, closer to Tony Stark in age, and an American, and he is quite incompetent and bumbling both as villain and businessman.<br>In this incarnation, Hammer is a defense contractor and rival of Tony Stark who attempts to replicate Stark's Iron Man technology. When it came to Tony Stark being subpoenaed to Congress, Tony Stark used his PDA to hack into the television monitors, showing attempts at duplicating the Iron Man armor (with one of them being from Hammer Industries) which went horribly awry. After Ivan Vanko publicly attacks Stark with his homemade, [[arc reactor]]-powered "[[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]]" suit, Hammer secretly hires the Russian villain in order to "make Iron Man look like an antique". Vanko manufactures a line of military drones for Hammer, who unveils them at the Stark Expo alongside the [[War Machine]] armor. However, Vanko rigs the drones and the War Machine armor to attack Iron Man, double-crossing Hammer and exposing their alliance. In retribution, Hammer aids Pepper and Black Widow in attempting to break Vanko's control over the drones, although Hammer is still arrested for aiding a criminal. He swears revenge on both Stark and Pepper as he is taken away by the police.
