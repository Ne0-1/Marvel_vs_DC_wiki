'''Icon''', also known as Augustus Freeman, Augustus Freeman Jr, Augustus Freeman III, and Augustus Freeman IV, was a fictional super-hero whose adventures were published by [[Milestone Media]] from 1993-1998.

Originally an alien lawyer, an accident during a galactic cruise led to his crash-landing on Earth; to allow him to survive until rescue, his life-pod was programmed to transform him so that he would resemble an infant of the local sentient species. However, he landed in the American South in 1839 and was found by a black woman, and as such was raised as a [[slavery|slave]].

Icon was sometimes referred to as the "black [[Superman]]".
