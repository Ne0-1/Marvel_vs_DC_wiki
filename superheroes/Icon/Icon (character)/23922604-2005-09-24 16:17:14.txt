'''Icon''' (also known as Augustus Freeman, Augustus Freeman Jr, Augustus Freeman III, and Augustus Freeman IV) is a [[Milestone Media|Milestone Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Dwayne McDuffie]], he first appeared in ''Icon'' #1 (1993).
Despite its title, McDuffie has said that the protagonist of the ''Icon'' series was actually Icon's sidekick, [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]].

The man called Augustus Freeman was originally an alien lawyer, before an accident during a galactic cruise led to his crash-landing on Earth. To allow him to survive until rescue, his life-pod was programmed to transform him so that he would resemble an infant of the local sentient species. However, he landed in the [[American South]] in [[1839]] and was found by a black woman, and as such was raised as a [[slavery|slave]].

He did not age visibly beyond adulthood, and to disguise this fact, he periodically assumed the identity of his own son. By the late 20th century, he was posing as Augustus Freeman IV, the great-grandson of his original human identity. He became a successful lawyer and settled in the city of Dakota.

Raquel Ervin was a teenage girl who was born in Paris Island, the poorest, most gang-ridden neighborhood in Dakota. Her prospects seemed fairly bleak until a chance encounter with Augustus Freeman IV. After seeing him use his powers, Raquel persuaded Augustus to become a superhero named Icon. With the aid of an alien device giving her the ability to fly, Raquel became his sidekick, [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]].

Icon held conservative views on economic and social issues, which often put him in conflict with more liberal Dakota superheroes, including his sidekick. Under Rocket's influence, he eventually began re-evaluating his views.

Because of the superficial similarity of his powers and origin story, Icon was sometimes referred to as the "black [[Superman]]", a designation rejected by his creators.
