'''Icon''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]], a [[comic book]] character distributed by [[DC Comics]]. An original character from [[Milestone Media|Milestone Comics]], he first appeared in ''Icon'' #1 (May 1993), and was created by [[Dwayne McDuffie]] and [[Denys Cowan]]. <ref>''Icon #1 http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/11/11/icon-1-review-2/</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
At the 2008 Comic-Con, DC Comics executive editor Dan DiDio announced that the Milestone Universe and characters would be revived and merged into the DC Universe proper. This was the result of a complex publication/distribution agreement drawn up between the two independent companies. The merger treated the characters as new to the universe, ignoring the "Worlds Collide" crossover of 1994.  Icon, along with Shadow Cabinet, appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #27, written by [[Dwayne McDuffie]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
In 1839, an alien starliner malfunctioned and exploded, and a jettisoned lifepod crashed in the middle of a cotton field in the [[American South]].<ref name=Icon1>''Icon'' #1 (May 1993)</ref><ref name=Icon8>''Icon'' #8 (December 1993)</ref> The pod automatically altered the appearance of its passenger named '''Arnus''' to mimic the first sentient life-form who discovered him.  That life-form was a slave woman named Miriam, who saw the pod crash land.<ref name=Icon1>''Icon'' #1</ref> And so it happened that Miriam found inside a baby boy with her mother's eyes.

In the present, Arnus is still with us. He did not age visibly beyond adulthood; to disguise this fact, he periodically assumed the identity of his own son.<ref name=Icon8>''Icon'' #8</ref> By the late 20th century, he was posing as '''Augustus Freeman IV''', the great-grandson of his original human identity. Still marooned, Augustus waits for [[Earth]]'s technology to catch up to his lifepod's.<ref name=Icon8>''Icon'' #8</ref> Secretly possessing superpowers that belie his human appearance, he has always performed quiet acts of charity.<ref name=Icon8>''Icon'' #8</ref><ref name=Icon25>''Icon'' #25 (May 1995)</ref> But one night, Augustus' house is broken into, and he uses his powers for the first time in decades, an action witnessed by Raquel Ervin.<ref>''Icon #1 http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/11/11/icon-1-review-2/</ref>

Raquel is an idealistic teenage girl who was born in Paris Island, the poorest, most gang-ridden neighborhood in Dakota City. Her prospects seemed fairly bleak until a chance encounter with Augustus Freeman IV. After seeing him use his powers, Raquel persuaded Augustus to become a superhero named '''Icon''', with herself as his sidekick, [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]].<ref>''Icon #2 http://worldofblackheroes.com/2011/02/28/icon-2-review/</ref>

===Personality===
Icon is portrayed as a very intelligent, somewhat stiff kind of person. Due to his upper-class job as a corporate lawyer and "proper" way of speaking, he is often criticized as being a "[[sell out]]" or "white washed". Icon usually prefers to do everything by the book instead of acting on instinct.<ref>''Icon #1 http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/11/11/icon-1-review-2/</ref> During the majority of his series, he mostly fought plain street criminals and those who gained powers from Dakota's [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]].

===DC Universe===
Following the death of [[Darkseid]] (as chronicled in ''[[Final Crisis]]''), the space-time continuum was torn asunder, threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe. The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being's defeat in ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'') to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon and [[Superman]] are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants ever existed in a parallel universe.<ref name=jla34>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #34 (June 2009)</ref>

In the revised continuity, Icon and the other Milestone characters have apparently always existed in the [[DC Universe]]. Augustus appears to have an existing friendship with Superman and to be a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]]. He also claims that, due to his status as a citizen of the [[Cooperative (comics)|Cooperative]], he is exempt from prosecution at the hands of the [[Green Lantern Corps]].<ref name=jla28>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #28 (December 2008)</ref>
Icon later plays a crucial role in the JLA's battle with the planet eating villain [[Starbreaker (comics)|Starbreaker]].

After the events of ''[[New Krypton]]'' lead to [[Kryptonians]] being banned from Earth, it is shown that the General [[Sam Lane]] is keeping tabs on Icon. It is unclear whether Lane believes Icon is a Kryptonian, or if he is merely watching him due to his friendship with Superman.<ref>''Superman''#688 (July 2009)</ref>

==Supporting characters==
* '''Darnice/Rocket II'''&nbsp;– Raquel's best friend. Darnice took on the role of Rocket while Racquel was on maternity leave (one insisted upon by both Icon and her close friends).
* '''Amistad Augustus Ervin'''&nbsp;– Raquel's infant son, named for the [[Amistad (ship)|Spanish slave ship]] and her partner, Icon.
[[Image:Buckwildmsu0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Buck Wild Mercenary Man, artist [[Mark Bright]]]]
* '''Rufus T. Wild/"Buck Wild, Mercenary Man"'''&nbsp;– First appeared in ''Icon'' #13 "It's Always Christmas" (May 1994); Buck Wild possessed "belief defyin' strength" and "[[tungsten]] hard skin." He once used an experimental growth serum which turned him into the gigantic "Buck Goliath." After some time, Buck wore a replica of Icon's costume in order to take Icon's place when Icon returned to his home planet. Rocket (Darnice) was able to use her Inertia Belt to carry him, making him appear to fly. Buck's time as Icon II was short-lived when he gave his life in order to stop Oblivion, a mass murdering alien foe of Icon. While working with the Patriot, he called himself "Jim Crow" and wore a winged costume allowing him to fly. As "Buck Lightning," Buck experimented with wearing wrist apparatus that generated lightning bolts. Following Buck's death the legendary Ruby Begonia briefly brought him back to life, and allowed him to generate green smoke, the sound of drums tolling doom, and a ghost-like double which could possess others and make them do his bidding. (An obvious [[Luke Cage]] [[pastiche]], Buck's later powers reflected [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Black Lightning]] and [[Brother Voodoo]]).

==Powers and abilities==
===Powers===
Icon's lifepod altered his DNA so he would resemble a normal human being, thus enabling him to blend among Earth's natives. A side effect of this process was the maximization of his now human/alien genetic structure.  Thus, Icon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities that are unusual even for a Terminan.<ref name=Icon25>''Icon'' #25</ref>

* '''[[Superhuman Strength]]''': Icon possesses vast superhuman strength that is nearly on par with Superman's.<ref name=Icon16>''Icon'' #16 (August 1994)</ref>
* '''[[List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Superhuman speed|Superhuman Speed]] and [[List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Superhuman reflexes|Reflexes]]''': Icon possesses the ability to think, move, and react at superhuman speeds.<ref name=Icon1>''Icon'' #1</ref>
* '''Superhuman Stamina''': Icon possesses highly efficient musculature which produces almost no fatigue toxins, granting him almost limitless stamina in all physical activities.
* '''[[List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Flight|Flight]]''': Icon flies by manipulation of [[gravitons]], manipulation of [[magnetic fields]], control of his absolute molecular movement, and utilizing his superhuman speed.  Icon can fly far beyond [[supersonic]] speeds, but it is unknown if he can achieve nearly the [[speed of light]].<ref name=Icon1>''Icon'' #1</ref>
* '''[[List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Superhuman senses|Superhuman Senses]]''': Icon possesses superhuman senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing.<ref name=Icon3>''Icon'' #3 (July 1993)</ref>
* '''Enhanced Mental Perception''': Icon possesses the ability to sense & comprehend things on levels that far exceed human capabilities.
* '''[[List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Invulnerability|Invulnerability]]''': Icon seems to possess nigh-invulnerability & durability, being capable of withstanding tremendous impact forces, high caliber bullets,<ref name=Icon2>''Icon'' #2</ref> exposure to temperature and pressure extremes,<ref name=Icon10>''Icon'' #10 (February 1994)</ref> and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury.<ref>Shadow Cabinet #0 (January 1994)</ref> He is even capable of surviving in the vacuum of space unaided.<ref name="jla28">''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #28 (December 2009)</ref> Icon's invulnerability has not been portrayed consistently. If he is not expecting an attack, he can be injured more easily. For example, in Icon #2, he sustains a bloody nose from getting hit in the face with the butt of a rifle that surprised him. After being injured by [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)#Payback|Payback]],<ref name=Icon3>''Icon'' #3</ref> Icon began wearing alien body armor to grant him further protection.<ref name=Icon5>''Icon'' #5 (September 1993)</ref> However, in a fight with Superman, he took numerous blows from the Man of Steel and was able to match his endurance.<ref name=Icon15>''Icon'' #15 (July 1994)</ref>
* '''[[Healing factor|Regenerative Healing Factor]]''': Despite his nigh invulnerability to injury, it is possible to injure Icon. If injured, his body is capable of quickly repairing damaged tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than the normal human body.<ref name=Icon3>''Icon'' #3</ref>
* '''Energy Generation''': Icon has the ability to generate and control a radiant energy based on [[positron]]s.<ref name=Icon6>''Icon'' #6 (October 1993)</ref> He can manipulate this energy for various effects.

:* '''''Concussive Force Bolts''''': Icon can release positron energy from his hands as bolts of concussive force.<ref name=Icon6>''Icon'' #6</ref> A low power force bolt can flick on a light switch<ref name=Icon36>''Icon'' #36 (April 1996)</ref> while a force bolt at maximum power can stagger Superman.<ref name=Icon16>''Icon'' #16</ref>

:* '''''Stun Bolts''''': Icon can project low-energy bolts that render human beings unconscious by disrupting the electrical impulses in their nervous systems.<ref name=Icon21>''Icon'' #21 (January 1995)</ref> Icon can also use these bolts like an [[electromagnetic pulse]] to overload electronic devices.<ref name=Icon27>''Icon'' #27 (July 1995)</ref>

:* '''''Energy Enhanced Punches''''': Icon can focus positron energy into his fists, which he can then use to shatter virtually any substance.<ref name=Icon27>''Icon'' #27</ref>

:* '''''Energy Pulse''''': Icon can release all of his body's positron energy as a massive omnidirectional pulse of devastating power.<ref name=Icon36>''Icon'' #36</ref>

:* '''''Positron Field''''': Icon can detect the presence of Bang Babies within his vicinity by flooding an area with a field of positrons.<ref name=Icon20>''Icon'' #20 (December 1994)</ref> The field interacts with the invisible [[quantum well]] surrounding a Bang Baby, who then glows as he or she gives off mild [[gamma particles]]. Hence, Icon can use these fields to distinguish Bang Babies from other metahumans as well as normal humans

* According to Icon, he possesses powers that all humans will possess once they evolve past their limitations.<ref name=Icon25>''Icon'' #25</ref>

* In the ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'' crossover with the DC universe; Icon and Superman fight.<ref name=Icon15>''Icon'' #15</ref> It is shown that Icon is able to hold his own against Superman. Icon even seemed to have a slight upper hand in the battle. Since Icon rarely fights beings of Superman's magnitude, it is possible that Icon is more powerful than he regularly displays. In ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #28, Icon punches Superman through the JLA Watchtower, knocking the Man of Steel hundreds of yards into space with one blow. Although Icon's hand was sore after such a massive punch, Superman later admitted that he has rarely been hit that hard in his life.<ref name="jla28"/>

Icon possesses extraordinary longevity, enabling him to age at a vastly slower rate than that human beings.<ref name=Icon1>''Icon'' #1</ref> Hence, though centuries old, he appears to be no older than forty. Icon's lifespan is typical for a Terminan and the only power that is not the result of his genetic maximization.<ref name=Icon26>''Icon'' #26 (June 1995)</ref>

===Skills===
Icon is among the Cooperative’s most celebrated mediators. He has extensive knowledge of the Cooperative legal system as well as decades of experience in his chosen field. Icon is an equally adept corporate lawyer due to his mediator background and a century’s worth of experience in American law.<ref name=Icon8>''Icon'' #8</ref><ref name=Icon25>''Icon'' #25</ref>

Icon is also a formidable combatant, whose fighting skills rival those of Superman.<ref name=Icon25>''Icon'' #25</ref><ref name=Icon16>''Icon'' #16</ref> Icon is well trained in unarmed and armed combat, having fought in major conflicts ranging from the Civil War to World War II.<ref name=Icon8>''Icon'' #8</ref><ref name=Icon25>''Icon'' #25</ref> Some opponents underestimate Icon’s abilities since he tries to peacefully settle disputes before pummeling his foes.

Icon is fluent in English and Galactic Standard, the native language of the Cooperative.<ref name=Icon6>''Icon'' #6</ref><ref name=Icon27>''Icon'' #27</ref>

==Equipment==
===Costume===
Icon wears a costume composed of alien materials that grant him further protection from projectile weaponry, energy beams, and intense heat or cold.<ref name=Icon3>''Icon'' #3</ref> On his command, the Info Tool aboard his starship uses its Maker to construct Icon's costume over his civilian clothing (see Transportation).<ref name=Icon39>''Icon'' #39 (July 1996)</ref> When no longer needed, the costume is disassembled, converted back to energy, and stored in the structural files of his ship's Info Tool.

===Transportation===
For interstellar journeys, Icon employs his personal [[starship]] that is a gift from the Cooperative.<ref name=Icon36>''Icon'' #36</ref> Like all Cooperative vessels, Icon's starship has a [[faster-than-light]] drive that allows it to shift into the realm called [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. Within hyperspace, the speed of light is not a limiting factor and thus cannot prevent the starship from quickly traversing interstellar distances.  [[artificial gravity (fiction)#Field generators|Gravity compensators]] provide [[artificial gravity (fiction)|artificial gravity]] that can be adjusted to the comfort level of the ship's passengers.<ref name=Icon36>''Icon'' #36</ref>

Icon's starship contains a range of highly advanced Cooperative technology. Two notable items are the Information Tool and the Maker.<ref name=Icon31>''Icon'' #31 (November 1995)</ref> Icon's starship is equipped with a local access system that links directly with the Information Tool or "Info Tool." The Info Tool is a computerized database of virtually everything anyone within the Cooperative knows. It even contains very detailed files on the cultures, languages, history and technology of Sol III (Earth) thanks to Icon's accounts of his life on the planet. The Info Tool acquires new information from written documents, verbal accounts, and visual data inputs. The database can even scan an item (organic or inorganic) and store its molecular structure within files called "software." Apart from storing and retrieving data, the local access to the Info Tool can also link to and control any computer-operated device or system. This includes Cooperative technology like the starship's Maker to terrestrial technology like phone lines or lights.<ref name=Icon38>''Icon'' #38 (June 1996)</ref>

Because of all the data it has accumulated over the millennia, the Info Tool is truly self-aware and even has a personality of sorts. The Info Tool relies on verbal inputs to receive commands to perform certain functions.<ref name=Icon31>''Icon'' #31</ref> In terms of information retrieval, the Tool can respond either verbally or by displaying its findings via holographic imagers aboard the starship. The Info Tool remains in contact with Icon via a communicator hidden in his costume.<ref name=Icon39>''Icon'' #39</ref> The communicator's maximum range is unknown.

The Maker is a molecular factory that can construct any physical item, molecule by molecule, from structural data files stored within the Info Tool. These data files are called "software" while the objects created by the Maker are known as "hardware".<ref name=Icon31>''Icon'' #31</ref> The Maker operates by tapping the vast energies of the reactor for Icon's starship and converting them into matter used for the construction of hardware. The Maker can create any item, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, in a matter of seconds as long as its structure is on file within the Info Tool. These include medicines, machinery (e.g., vehicles), clothing, and even food.<ref name=Icon31>''Icon'' #31</ref> The Maker can repair or modify constructed hardware by altering its molecular structure according to the whims of its user.

The Maker can also rearrange the molecular structure of items it did not create in order to change their appearance or function.<ref name=Icon38>''Icon'' #38</ref> To do so, the Info Tool must first scan the structure of the object to be modified. For example, Icon employed the Maker to build the starship garage beneath his mansion's swimming pool.

Icon's starship has numerous projectors through which the Maker can construct hardware within the vessel.<ref name=Icon31>''Icon'' #31</ref> To build an item outside the vessel, the Maker relies on a special probe mounted on the underside of the starship.<ref name=Icon38>''Icon'' #38</ref> It is the probe that facilitates the Maker repairing or remodeling Icon's possessions over great distances. Icon has often employed this feature to repair any damage to his costume.<ref name=Icon41>''Icon'' #41 (September 1996)</ref>

Icon's starship is also equipped with [[Cloaking device|cloaking technology]] that can render the vessel invisible to both the human eye and all forms of Earthly electronic surveillance.<ref name=Icon38>''Icon'' #38</ref>  Though unusual for a civilian vessel, the cloak was installed in the ship so Icon could use it on Earth without attracting attention.

When not in use, Icon stores his starship in his "garage," a hangar located beneath his mansion’s swimming pool.<ref name=Icon38>''Icon'' #38</ref> The pool slides out of the way to provide easy entry or exit for the ship.

==In other media==
===Television===
* While he did not appear onscreen, Augustus Freeman was referred to several times in ''[[Static Shock]]'' through the names of various centers and organizations, notably the Dakota-based Freeman Community Centre.<ref>Beginning with the first season episode "Child's Play"</ref>

He and Rocket are shown rescuing civilians from a Plant Creature that the [[Injustice League]] had unleashed on Paris. In the episode "Failsafe", [[Cat Grant]] mentions in passing that Icon was one of the numerous superheroes killed during an alien invasion of Earth. The invasion is later revealed to be a subconscious illusion created by [[Miss Martian]].

==Politics==
* Icon held [[conservatism|conservative]] views on economic and social issues, which often put him in conflict with more [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Milestone Comics]] superheroes, including his sidekick. Under [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]]'s influence, he eventually began re-evaluating his views.
* Icon is a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].
* Icon is a strong believer in the self-reliance philosophy of [[Booker T. Washington]]
