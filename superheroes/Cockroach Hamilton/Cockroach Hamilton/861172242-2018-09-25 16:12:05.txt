Later on in his life, Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton turned to a life of crime and became a mob enforcer for [[List of Marvel Comics characters: J#Piranha Jones|Ray "Piranha" Jones]]. Both of them bought information from Harry Wentworth that detailed about the Adonis Chemical Company's shipments lethal bacteriological agent. [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] was hired to find out who Harry Wentworth sold the information to. He arrived just as Dontrell was in the process of killing Harry Wentworth. After a fierce battle with Power Man, Dontrell used his gun "Josh" to blast Harry Wentworth and shoot Power Man enough to dislocate his shoulder.<ref>''Power Man'' #28</ref> Dontrell retreated back to his apartment where he took a call from Ray "Piranha" Jones. Dontrell went to Ray's penthouse to meet up with him as they finalized their plans for the hijacking. During his investigation after getting his arm popped back in, Power Man was attacked by Dontrell and Ray's men at the Harlem River docks. While Power Man took out the henchmen, Dontrell gassed him out with "Josh" and then tied him to the river's drawbridge before departing.

Ross]] arrived to help stop the villains.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 3 #16-17</ref>
