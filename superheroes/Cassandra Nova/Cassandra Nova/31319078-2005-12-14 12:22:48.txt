'''Cassandra Nova''' is a [[supervillain]]ess in the [[Marvel Universe]], primarily associated with the [[X-Men]]. Nova first appeared in ''[[New X-Men]]'' #114 (July [[2001]]) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]].

Cassandra Nova is twin sister of X-Men leader [[Professor X]], who strangled her in the [[womb]] (having recognised her evil nature)  leading into Nova being delivered [[stillborn]].

[[Jean Grey]] later discovered that Cassandra Nova is the mummudrai (from a Shi'ar legend, meaning opposite) of Charles Xavier.  "Legend says each of us faces our own personal mummudrai in the womb, shortly before birth - it is our first experience of the alien, the other, the different."

Of comparable power to Xavier, Nova's entity somehow survived; clinging to a sewer wall and building up her  strength, and in time building her own psionic body from her brother's DNA.  

After she was able to rebuild herself, Nova returned with a vengeance. She programmed a pack of wild [[sentinels (comics)|sentinels]] to destroy the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] homeland of [[Genosha]], killing 16 million mutants. She then attacked the X-Mansion, defeating most of the X-Men easily. Cassandra then put herself into Xavier's machine [[Cerebra]] (an enhanced version of [[Cerebro]]) and switched minds with her brother before [[Emma Frost]] snapped Nova's neck (Emma had been teaching a class on Genosha when it was attacked and saw her students get massacred). Trapped in Nova's broken body, Xavier was unable to warn the X-Men before Nova, now in Xavier's body, shot him.

Now in Xavier's body, Cassandra Nova contacted the alien race the [[Shi'ar]], whose leader was Princess [[Lilandra]]; Xavier's lover. Nova manipulated the Shi'ar, driving Lilandra insane and convincing the Shi'ar to destroy the Earth. Nova sent the [[Shi'ar Imperial Guard]] to attack the X-Men. The Guard fought the X-Men until they were able to convince the Guard that Nova was lying.

Angered at Nova's treachery and realizing the danger she posed, the Imperial Guard fought Nova, who defeated them and headed into the mansion. She had planned on using Cerebra to focus on all the mutants and killing them with the machine. However Jean Grey (who was becoming increasingly more powerful due to a manifestation of the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] entity) was able to split Xavier's consciousness into pieces and store a little part of him in every single living mutant mind.  When Nova used Cerebra and focused on all the mutants, the pieces of Xavier's mind were brought back together and he was able to force Nova out of his body.

Without a body, Nova became pure psychic energy, bodiless and blind. Emma Frost tricked Nova into returning to what appeared to be her old body, which was in reality the alien polymorph "Stuff."  

Nova's essence entered the body and was locked into a self-repeating program in the synthetic brain.

Later, "[[Planet X (comics)|Planet X]]" hinted and "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" directly implied that Nova had taken the form of the young mutant [[Ernst (comics)|Ernst]].

She has recently returned in the latest volume of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'', working with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].
