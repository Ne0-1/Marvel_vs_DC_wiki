===Shin Harada===
'''Shingen''' "'''Shin'''" '''Harada''', otherwise known as the second '''[[Silver Samurai]]''', is Kenuichio Harada's son and named after Lord Shingen, his grandfather. He had been committing larceny with [[Amiko Kobayashi]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #300. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He was later recruited by Kade Killgore to be a teacher at the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s Hellfire Academy where he worked as a designer.<ref name="WatX-M #20">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Silver Samurai later appeared as a member of Mystique's fourth incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> During [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s fight with the Brotherhood of Mutants on [[Madripoor]], Magneto controlled Silver Samurai into wounding Mystique.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #16.

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]", Shingen Harada represented the Yashida Corporation when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of [[Alchemax]], [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] of Fisk Industries, [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] of Shaw Industries, [[Darren Cross]] of [[Cross Technological Enterprises]], [[Zeke Stane]] of Stane International, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] about [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]'s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. When the true motive of the meeting was revealed, Harada attacked Dario and they almost fought, interrupted by the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation, resulting in Dario getting knocked out when declaring herself a new member of their assembly.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 5 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then went to an underwater station in the Southern Ocean, where he attacked the employees until encountering [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]] who defeated him by smacking him repeatedly with [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. He then escaped and joined Exterminatrix in an aerial battle against soldiers attempting to rescue Dario. They later entered Roxxon Corporation HQ, where they encountered the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., a group of Hulk-like superhumans. While the Mindless Ones fought the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., Silver Samurai and Exterminatrix went to Dario's vault, attempting to take the money until Agent Solomon arrived, forcing Exterminatrix to fight the woman while Silver Samurai opened the vault. When the vault was opened, Dario transformed into Minotaur and knocked out Silver Samurai. Then, the floating island the building was located on fell down due to the activation of the Agger Imperative. While [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] evacuated the building, Thor destroyed the island. The villains were later arrested and taken into custody.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 5 #9–11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Silver Samurai approached [[Old Man Logan]] wanting to ally in stopping the Hand's Regenix operation. He agreed in exchange that Mariko doesn't get killed and that Touku and Asami's child is taken care of. When Logan and Silver Samurai attack the Hand's Regenix operations, Silver Samurai fought [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] while Logan fought the Hand Ninjas to confront Mariko. After Gorgon got away, Silver Samurai injected nanites into Mariko to break the Hand's control. Afterwards, Logan and Mariko sent Silver Samurai to destroy the Regenix shipments in Madripoor.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As an old man dying of cancer in the present, Yashida arranges for Logan to see him one more time and asks Mariko to succeed him before seemingly dying.

However, Mariko uses the claws to attack Yashida, who loses control of his suit while Logan regenerates his original bone claws and kills him.
