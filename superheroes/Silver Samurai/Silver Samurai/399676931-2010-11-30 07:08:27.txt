The '''Silver Samurai''' ('''Kenuichio Harada''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]], sometimes a [[superhero]] and sometimes a [[supervillain]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] #111'' (July, 1974). In Japan his name is Harada Kenichirō (原田剣一郎){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, since 'Kenuichio' is not an actual Japanese name (and is probably derived from a corruption of Kenichirō{{Citation needed|reason=Probably? Is this original research?|date=September 2010}}).

==Fictional character biography==
Silver Samurai, the illegitimate son of [[Shingen Yashida]], is a [[Japan]]ese [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the power to charge almost anything{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, most notably his [[katana]], with mutant energy (described as a [[tachyon|tachyon field]]) which enables it to slice through any known substance excluding [[adamantium]]. He also sports a suit based on traditional [[samurai]] armor. It is made of a silver metal, hence his name.

He became a professional criminal, and first appeared to clash with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] when he was hired by [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]] and [[Black Spectre]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #111</ref>

Harada was once the bodyguard for the international terrorist known as the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and was subsequently an occasional [[mercenary]]. When working for Viper, he fought [[Spider-Man]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #57</ref> After recovering the Viper's teleport ring, he fought Spider-Man again on [[Saturday Night Live]] and encountered the original Not-Ready-For-Prime-Time-Players.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #74</ref> He joined Viper and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] in fighting Spider-Man, [[Nick Fury]], [[Shang-Chi]], and Black Widow on the original [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #83-85</ref> He and Viper attempted to kidnap Michael Kramer, and fought the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #42-43</ref>

Alongside the Viper, he attempted a theft of cavourite crystal, and battled the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #5-6</ref> Alongside the Viper, he battled the [[X-Men]] and [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #172-174</ref> He attempted to possess the Black Blade, and battled [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Lindsay McCabe, and [[O'Donnell]]. He rescued Wolverine and a depowered Jessica Drew from cultists.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #2-3</ref>

He became the Oyabun (leader) of Clan Yashida after his half-sister [[Mariko Yashida]]'s death.<ref>revealed in ''Cable'' #2</ref> He attempted to pay off his clan's debts to the [[Yakuza]] and restore its honor.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Though once one of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s greatest enemies, he had apparently impressed Wolverine so greatly that Wolverine entrusted him with the care of his adopted daughter, [[Amiko Kobayashi]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The Samurai even once helped Wolverine destroy the monster known as "Doombringer",{{Issue|date=April 2009}} and later helped Logan rescue Amiko and Yukio from their kidnappers.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During his time as hero, the Silver Samurai became the leader of the first Japanese [[superhero]] team, [[Big Hero 6]].<ref>''Sunfire and Big Hero'' 6 #1-3</ref>

Silver Samurai was recently [[brainwashing|brainwash]]ed by the mutant [[Blindspot]] into forgetting his time as a hero, believing his redemption was just a result of [[Professor X]]'s brainwashing.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} As a result, he had returned to his previous criminal activities.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} However, it now seems that Harada is currently operating as the chief security officer for the Prime Minister of Japan. {{Issue|date=April 2009}}

For unclear reasons, the Samurai was abducted, incarcerated in the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] prison in America without trial, and official records stated he was dead. He was freed by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], who transported him back to Japan. They wanted him to lead the Hand and unite the Japanese criminal underworld, hoping he could take on shadowy figures controlling both Hydra & SHIELD that Madame Hydra was reluctant to name. However, Harada wasn't interested in a war and even helped the Avengers defeat them. Afterward, he decided to try to earn his good name back by serving the people of Japan once again.<ref>''New Avengers'' #11-13</ref>

Silver Samurai is one of the few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Wolverine made his way to Japan in search of Harada and engaged him in battle. Wolverine had recovered all of his memories due to the events of House of M and asked Silver Samurai questions about his past during the course of their fight. Silver Samurai was able to run Wolverine through with one of his swords. Immediately afterward, Wolverine grabbed the Samurai by his right forearm and severed his hand at the wrist with his claws. When last seen, Silver Samurai was kneeling on the floor cradling the bloody stump where his hand once was.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]], Viper left the Silver Samurai to rejoin Hydra. She later came with a new Madame Hydra to negotiate support to be given to Typhon, Hydra's production front, from the Yashidas. Also, they took a mysterious box; the Yashidas claimed that those who opened it never lived to see another day.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #6</ref> Some time later, warriors of the mysterious Leviathan group attacked the Silver Samurai to make him divulge the location of the box.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Silver Samurai is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to generate a [[tachyon]] field, with which he can surround anything{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. He commonly uses his power on his sword, enabling it to cut through nearly anything, except [[adamantium]].

When working with the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], he possesses a [[teleportation]] ring, which allows him to teleport from one location to another, granting him great mobility and stealth.

As a self-styled samurai, he is a master of [[Kenjutsu]] ([[samurai sword|katana]]), and a martial arts master specializing in edged weapons, hand to hand combat, and tactics. He usually wears a suit of lightweight steel alloy body armor, modeled after traditional samurai armor, but made of modern protective materials. He carries a katana (long sword), shuriken (throwing stars), and other weaponry. Keniuchio has extensive knowledge of the operations of criminal organizations due to his shady past, which he now uses in the service of his government to combat such organizations. He is an expert in the history and customs of the samurai class (Bushido).

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
In the most recent "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" story, published in 2005 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Age of Apocalypse storyline, the Silver Samurai was a key member of the X-Men. He wore no helmet, and had a red upside down Omega symbol tattooed on his forehead. Because he wears no helmet, it is probably a ''maedate'', the crest of a Samurai [[kabuto]]. He was one of the team's more visible members, rash yet strong. It was revealed that the Samurai and Wolverine met each other in Japan, some time before Logan rescued Mariko from thugs. He was also aware of the existence of [[Psylocke]], a rare telepath in the Age of Apocalypse, but how the Samurai was convinced to join [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]]'s X-Men in the first place was not explained.

===Exiles===
In ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #83 (August 2006), another alternate version of the Silver Samurai was revealed. Originating from Earth-172, the Samurai appeared to have a good relationship between [[Mariko Yashida]] and that Earth's Wolverine, who was a briefly seen member of the reality-hopping counterpart team of the Exiles called [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]. As Wolverine had vanished out of their sight for months to join said team, he later on was killed in action and returned by the Exiles to his home-world. The Samurai and Mariko still don't fully know what happened to their Wolverine, but at least honored his death with a proper funeral by burning Logan's ashes.

===House of M===
In the [[House of M]], Kenuicho Harada was a powerful businessman and, secretly, the head of Clan Yashida, a powerful crime family. His daughter, Mariko Harada, was kidnapped by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], who wanted to blackmail Harada into revealing his illegal businesses.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #4, the Silver Samurai and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] are bitten and infected by a zombie [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. During the [[Silver Surfer]]'s globe-spanning travels, they are seen attacking innocent civilians.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Silver Samurai.jpg|thumb|left|Silver Samurai from ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]]'']]
* Silver Samurai has appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode ''"The Lotus and the Steel"'' voiced by [[Dennis Akiyama]]. He is simply portrayed as a gang leader whose thugs terrorize every village for tribute to him each year. Wolverine first encounters him while gathering timber as Silver Samurai warns him not to interfere with his gang's affairs. The villagers stand their ground with the help of [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and Wolverine bests the Samurai in single combat by taking advantage of Samurai's habit of teleporting behind him: Wolverine anticipates the move and disables the teleportation device, humiliating the Silver Samurai.

* Silver Samurai appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Code of Conduct" voiced by [[Keone Young]]. He is not depicted as Mariko's half-brother, but her husband, as well as a member of the [[Yakuza]]. He fought Wolverine before and ended up surrendering. Years later, Silver Samurai captures the X-Men (except Rogue) in order to force Wolverine to fight him again as a way to become the next leader of the Yakuza. After overhearing the talk between Wolverine and Mariko, he was angry and told Hura to get every ninja to the warehouse. At the fight of the warehouse near the docks, he knocked out Rogue with a shuriken loaded with knock-out gas. The Yakuza Leader says that they will have an anti-mutant power duel (as part of the Samurai Code) by the next night. When they finally dueled, Silver Samurai mentioned that he only married Mariko so that Logan wouldn't marry her. Wolverine was once again besting Silver Samurai. Since Silver Samurai acted dishonorably by using his mutant powers when it was not allowed, he was then hit with a knock-out gas-filled shuriken. The Yakuza leader annuls the duel declaring that Silver Samurai dishonored the code and has his men take him away. After the Yakuza Leader agreed to release the captive X-Men, Mariko told Wolverine that Silver Samurai will be driven from the Yakuza in shame and that they will never admit him again.

===Film===
* In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', his name appears on a list of names [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for Magneto's file.
* In the featurette "Wolverine Unleashed: The Complete Origins", on the DVD release of ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', the producer Lauren Shuler Donner reveals that [[20th Century Fox]] has approved the making of a stand alone Wolverine movie focusing on the Silver Samurai, and Wolverine's time in Japan.

===Video games===
[[Image:Silver Sam.gif|thumb|right|Silver Samurai in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]'']]
* Silver Samurai is a [[player character|playable character]] in the [[Capcom]] fighting games ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' and ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]''. His mutant tachyon powers are not evident here, however, as he is seen throwing giant shurikens and his supers involve empowering his katana with elemental properties and attacks revolving around lightning, fire, and ice. He is one of the two Marvel characters that doesn't speak English during gameplay, because he speaks [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who speaks [[Russian language|Russian]] during gameplay is the other).

* Silver Samurai appears in the game ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' (which fills in the gap between ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'') voiced by [[Keone Young]]. In the game, Silver Samurai is the head of [[HYDRA]], and mentor of [[Lady Deathstrike]]. Years before Weapon X, Silver Samurai and HYDRA collaborated with [[William Stryker]] in building the [[Master Mold]] and [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] robots. After Stryker's death, HYDRA was sent back in to remove all Sentinel equipment and files, and accidentally activated the Master Mold. Wolverine infiltrated HYDRA's headquarters and duels with Silver Samurai over how to shut down the Master Mold and the Sentinels. Conquering Samurai in combat, Wolverine emerges the winner, gains the information, and tells the team how to defeat Master Mold.

===Others===
* In the comic prequels to the first X-Men film{{Issue|date=October 2009}}, Wolverine was revealed to have fought a Yakuza enforcer just prior to the film. This man, with an obsession with honor and the mutant ability to generate electricity, was referred as the Silver Samurai. He was killed at the end of the story.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} That story has been revealed to be out of the regular movie-continuity, because the Samurai was revealed alive in the game X-Men: The Official Movie Game, which is a lot closer to the movies than the movie prequels were.{{Or|date=October 2009}}
