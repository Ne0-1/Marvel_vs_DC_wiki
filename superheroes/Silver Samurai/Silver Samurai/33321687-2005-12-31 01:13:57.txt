The '''Silver Samurai''' (Keniuchio Harada) is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Daredevil]] #111'' (July, [[1974]]).
==Character biography==

Silver Samurai, the illegitimate son of [[Shingen Harada]], is a [[Japan]]ese [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the power to charge his [[katana]] [[sword]] with mutant energy (described as a [[tachyon]] field) that enables it to slice through any known substance except for [[adamantium]].  He also sports a suit of traditional [[samurai]] armour, which is white and the portion made of a silver-like metal, hence his professional name.

Harada was once the bodyguard for the international terrorist known as the [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] and was subsequently an occasional [[mercenary]], but he became the head of Clan Yashida after his half-sister [[Mariko Yashida]]'s death. He attempted to pay off his clan's debts to the [[Yakuza]] and restore its honor. Though once one of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s greatest enemies, he had apparently impressed Wolverine so greatly that Wolverine entrusted him with the care of his adopted daughter, Amiko. During his time as hero, the Silver Samurai became the leader of the first Japanese [[superhero]] team, [[Big Hero 6]].

{{spoilers}}
Silver Samurai was recently [[brainwash]]ed by the mutant [[Blindspot (comics)|Blindspot]] into forgetting his time as a hero, believing his redemption was just a result of [[Professor X]]'s brainwashing. As a result, he had returned to  his previous criminal activities.  However, it now seems that Harada is currently operating as the chief security officer for the Prime Minister of Japan.  Very recently, Wolverine made his way to Japan in search of Harada and engaged him in battle.  Wolverine has recovered all of his memories due to the events of [[House Of M]] and asks the Samurai questions about his past during the course of their fight.  The Silver Samurai is able to impale Wolverine using one of his swords.  Immediately afterward, Wolverine grabs the Samurai by his right forearm and severs his hand at the wrist with his claws.  When last seen, the Samurai was kneeling on the floor cradling the bloody stump where his hand once was and his current activities are unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
The Silver Samurai is a mutant with the ablity to channel energy into his sword to create a tachyon field around the blade enabling it to cut through anything save [[adamantium]]. He posseses a teleportation ring which allows him to teleport from one location to another, granting him great mobility and stealth. As a samurai, he is a martial arts master specializing in edged weapons, hand to hand combat, and tactics. Due to his shady past Keniuchio has extensive knowledge of the operations of criminal organizations, which he now uses in the service of his government to combat such organizations.

==Alternate Realities==
In the most recent "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" story, published in 2005 to Celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Age of Apocalypse storyline, the Silver Samurai was a key member of the X-men. He wore no helmet, and had a red Omega symbol tattooed on his forehead. He was one of the team's more visible members, rash yet strong, filling a Colossus/Wolverine type niche in the 
group.
