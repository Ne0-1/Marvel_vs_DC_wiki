The '''Silver Samurai''' (Keniuchio Harada) is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who was once a foe of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] but is now a trusted ally. His first appearance was in ''Daredevil #111'' ([[1976]]).

Silver Samurai, the illegitimate son of [[Shingen Harada]], is a [[mutant]] with the power to charge his ''katana'' (sword) with mutant energy (described as a [[tachyon]] field) that enables it to slice through any known substance except for [[adamantium]].  He also sports a suit of traditional [[samurai]] armour, which is white and the portion made of a silver like metal, hence his professional name.

Harada was once the bodyguard for the international terrorist known as the [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] and was subsequently an occasional [[mercenary]], but he became the head of Clan Yashida after his half-sister [[Mariko Yashida]]'s death. He is currently attempting to pay off his clan's debts to the criminal underworld and restore its honor. Though once one of Wolverine's greatest enemies, he has apparently impressed Wolverine so greatly that Wolverine has entrusted him with the care of his adopted daughter, Amiko.

The Silver Samurai is the leader of Japan's first superhero team, [[Big Hero 6]]. He is one of the few rare cases of a truly rehabilitated [[supervillain]].
