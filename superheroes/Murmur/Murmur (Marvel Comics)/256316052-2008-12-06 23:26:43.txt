'''Murmur''' ('''Allan Rennie''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe who first appearance was in ''Generation X #11''.

===Fictional character biography===
Not much is known of the mutant known as Murmur apart from that he was mutated into pseudo-[[vampire|vampiric]] form by [[Emplate]]. He then joined a team that Emplate gathered to torment [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], including [[Bulwark (comics)|Bulwark]], [[Vincente (comics)|Vincente]], and '''DOA'''. In an uncharacteristic move, Emplate not only recruited mutants for his team but a human as well: a woman named [[Gayle Edgerton]] from Generation X member Chamber's past. 
When [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]]'s powers first manifested he had unintentionally paralyzed Gayle and Emplate offered her a chance for revenge, turning her into one of his vampiric minions as well. They were successful in capturing the young mutants, but [[M (comics)|M]] had [[telepathy|telepathically]] called for help and it was answered by the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. Vincente and Murmur teamed up to try and defeat the him, but when Murmur saw that he would soon be defeated, he fled along with Bulwark. With [[Penance (comics)|Penance]]'s realignment of alliances they were successful in stopping the team.
It is unknown if he was de-powered after M-Day

===Powers and abilities===
Completely wrapped in bandages, Murmur could open [[teleportation]] portals in space within his line of sight, had enhanced strength and durability (like all of the Emplate minions) and had a large mouth in chest.

'''Murmur''' ('''Arlette Truffaut''') is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character, a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She is a former member of the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]], currently in [[Beta Flight]].

===Fictional character biography===
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}

Murmur would become part of Alpha Flight during a time when they were being heavily mentally influenced by the Canadian government. One of her main duties is to mentally control the powerful beast know as Sasquatch, which was believed to be former Alpha Flight member Walter Langowski. During one of her first missions, against the criminal organization known as Zodiac, she loses control of Sasquatch and he attacks both friend and foe. Murmur is later lost to the mental control of [[Mesmero]], along with some of her teammates. Though she breaks free, she doesn't manage to control Sasquatch in time and he injures her. Manbot sedates Sasquatch.

She is initially attracted to her teammate [[Radius (comics)|Radius]] but he purposely rejects her advances. In a move that puzzles Vindicator, she flirts with the now-younger Guardian, offering on more than one occasion to use her powers to make his injuries feel better. 

Murmur comes with when the team is sent to kidnap [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] for the supposed murder of the ex-Alpha Flight member Box. 

The team meets up with Wolverine on a heavily forested road near an abandoned gas station. Murmur and Sasquatch investigate the hopping form of the man with Wolverine, who was in reality, [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], a powerful mutant in his own right. 

Wolverine summons help and a fight breaks out between the two teams. It concludes on peaceful terms, due to the willingness of fellow teammate [[Flex (comics)|Flex]] who wanted to talk instead of battle. Also, Alpha Flight is unsure of the motives behind the fight, as they have uncovered discrepancies.

The mind-controlling leader of Alpha Flight, Jeremey Clarke, dies in a battle with the criminal organization known as [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Murmur is also shot in the leg by forces of the same group and is sidelined from action for some time. She does not take this well, expressing a need for simply physical contact, even platonic.

===Powers and abilities===
She has been depowered by [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]

'''Mind Manipulation:''' Psionic ability that allows her to manipulate others upon physical contact. By touching them they are completely under control, and gives them commands verbally. Such as she touched Puck and told him to sleep and he immediately fell asleep. She even has the power to calm the savage Sasquatch II, which is the actual [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] of myth not Walter the original [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] on [[Alpha Flight]]. She also has been shown to free people that were under [[Mesmero]]'s control. There are two instances that show there is more to Murmur. Such as when Alpha Flight was battling [[Mesmero]], she demonstrated that she could kill a person using her power. This is not typical for a mind-controller to do. Another incident when [[Radius (comics)|Radius]] was under the control of [[Mesmero]] and to break his control Murmur must make physical contact with him. However, his forcefield prevents that so it's not known how she broke the hold on him. They later talk about it in the series, but never give a clear answer to how she did it. Another odd incident was when X-Men's [[Maggott]] ordered his own maggots to attack Murmur they ran away without even touching her. When she touched Maggott she had a flashback back in [[Hull House]] where she was getting attacked by bugs and monsters, which never was explained
<br>
<br>
'''Teleportation:''' In Marvel X-Men Encyclopedia [Vol.2] they state Murmur has teleportation abilities. However, this was never fully explained. This comes from in [[Alpha Flight]]'s battle with the Zodiac, Murmur touched the Zodiac member named Virgo and said "Paris." Immediately she vanished saying "Scorpio I'm fading awayyy", which when someone who is under Murmur's control doesn't have independent thought so this was unique and different. Virgo ended up in Paris, France with a type of amnesia. The Zodiac did have personal teleportation devices, but how Murmur would know that she would have this type of a device is a mystery. Also if she did use the teleportation device, why Virgo would activate it and teleport to Paris is another mystery since Taurus later had to go get her since they stated her teleporter was broken. So the range or her actual ability to teleport people were never stated.

==Notes==
*There is a member of [[Hellbent]] known as '''Murmur'''. He had a completely black appearance and was very pliable.  He first appeared and was killed in the same issue, ''Moon Knight'' vol. 3 #50, after failing to capture bloodline for [[Seth the Immortal]]. 
*In the early issues of the second series of '''Alpha Flight''' it was stated she was one of the non-mutants, the only mutants on the team being [[Flex (comics)|Flex]] and [[Radius (comics)|Radius]], however this has obviously been changed.
* Her last name coincides with the last name of La Nuit of [[X-Statix]].
*In Generation X #57, a character with a similar mummified appearance—but vastly different powers—named '''Wrap''' is with Emplate's gang. They attack the Massachusetts Academy to, once again, try and recapture Penance but their attempts are foiled. In the process, a building blows up and the [[M Twins]] are knocked free from the Penance body.
