'''Murmur''' ('''Arlette Truffaut''') is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character, a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She is a former member of the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]], currently in [[Beta Flight]].

==Fictional character biography==
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}

Murmur would become part of Alpha Flight during a time when they were being heavily mentally influenced by the Canadian government. One of her main duties is to mentally control the powerful beast know as Sasquatch, which was believed to be former Alpha Flight member Walter Langowski. During one of her first missions, against the criminal organization known as Zodiac, she loses control of Sasquatch and he attacks both friend and foe. Murmur is later lost to the mental control of [[Mesmero]], along with some of her teamates. Though she breaks free, she doesn't manage to control Sasquatch in time and he injures her. Manbot sedates Sasquatch.

She is initially attracted to her teammate [[Radius (comics)|Radius]] but he purposely rejects her advances. In a move that puzzles Vindicator, she flirts with the now-younger Guardian, offering on more than one occasion to use her powers to make his injuries feel better. 

Murmur comes with when the team is sent to kidnap [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] for the supposed murder of the ex-Alpha Flight member Box. 

The team meets up with Wolverine on a heavily forested road near an abandoned gas station. Murmur and Sasquatch investigate the hopping form of the man with Wolverine, who was in reality, [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], a powerful mutant in his own right. 

Wolverine summons help and a fight breaks out between the two teams. It concludes on peaceful terms, due to the willingness of fellow teamate [[Flex (comics)|Flex]] who wanted to talk instead of battle. Also, Alpha Flight is unsure of the motives behind the fight, as they have uncovered discrepancies.

The mind-controlling leader of Alpha Flight, Jeremey Clarke, dies in a battle with the criminal organization known as [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Murmur is also shot in the leg by forces of the same group and is sidelined from action for some time. She does not take this well, expressing a need for simply physical contact, even platonic.

==Powers and abilities==
She has been depowered by [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]

'''Mind Manipulation:''' Psionic ability that allows her to manipulate others upon physical contact. By touching them they are completely under control, and gives them commands verbally. Such as she touched Puck and told him to sleep and he immediately fell asleep. She even has the power to calm the savage Sasquatch II, which is the actual [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] of myth not Walter the original [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] on [[Alpha Flight]]. She also has been shown to free people that were under [[Mesmero]]'s control. There are two instances that show there is more to Murmur. Such as when Alpha Flight was battling [[Mesmero]], she demonstrated that she could kill a person using her power. This is not typical for a mind-controller to do. Another incident when [[Radius (comics)|Radius]] was under the control of [[Mesmero]] and to break his control Murmur must make physical contact with him. However, his forcefield prevents that so it's not known how she broke the hold on him. They later talk about it in the series, but never give a clear answer to how she did it. Another odd incident was when X-Men's [[Maggott]] ordered his own maggotts to attack Murmur they ran away without even touching her. When she touched Maggott she had a flashback back in [[Hull House]] where she was getting attacked by bugs and monsters, which never was explained
<br>
<br>
'''Teleportation:''' In Marvel X-Men Encyclopedia [Vol.2] they state Murmur has teleportation abilities. However, this was never fully explained. This comes from in [[Alpha Flight]]'s battle with the Zodiac, Murmur touched the Zodiac member named Virgo and said "Paris." Immediately she vanished saying "Scorpio I'm fading awayyy", which when someone who is under Murmur's control doesn't have independent thought so this was unique and different. Virgo ended up in Paris, France with a type of amnesia. The Zodiac did have personal teleportation devices, but how Murmur would know that she would have this type of a device is a mystery. Also if she did use the teleportation device, why Virgo would activate it and teleport to Paris is another mystery since Taurus later had to go get her since they stated her teleporter was broken. So the range or her actual ability to teleport people were never stated.

==Notes==
*There is a member of [[Hellbent]] known as '''Murmur'''. He had a completely black appearance and was very pliable.  He first appeared and was killed in the same issue, ''Moon Knight'' vol. 3 #50, after failing to capture bloodline for [[Seth the Immortal]]. 
*In the early issues of the second series of '''Alpha Flight''' it was stated she was one of the non-mutants, the only mutants on the team being [[Flex (comics)|Flex]] and [[Radius (comics)|Radius]], however this has obviously been changed.
* Her last name concides with the last name of La Nuit of [[X-Statix]].
