'''Noble Kale''' is the man who would be [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. Noble grew up with his abusive father, [[Pastor Kale]], and his younger brother, Dante, in the eighteenth century. [[Jennifer Kale]], introduced in 1972, is one of his descendents.

One day Noble fell in love with a young black girl named [[Magdelena]], who worked for the Quentin Carnival. Because of Magdelena's skin color, Noble hid his love for her from his father, but was finally forced to tell when Magdelena gave birth to their son. Eventually, Noble and Magdelena married.  

Shortly after their marriage, Magdelena discovered Pastor Kale's dark secret, that he was the servant of the dark lord [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. To cover up Magdelena's discovery, the pastor accused her of witchcraft and had her burned at the stake. Knowing that Noble would object, his father had him drugged, tortured, and beaten in the church's cellar.  

Unbeknownst to anyone, Magdelena sent a curse of her own shortly after her death. She sent the [[Furies]] to take revenge on the pastor and his town. After many of the townsfolk died at the hands of the Furies, Pastor Kale struck a deal with Mephisto: Mephisto would turn Noble into a demon and claim Noble's soul. The deal was made and Noble became the spirit of vengeance, the Ghost Rider. When Ghost Rider had destroyed the Furies, the pastor offered him human flesh, Noble's son. Unwilling to eat his own child, Noble killed himself. 

When Mephisto appeared to claim Noble's soul, Mephisto's brother, the archangel [[Uriel]] appeared and demanded that the soul of Noble Kale be spared. Since no agreement could be reached, a compromise was made where Noble's soul was to be claimed by neither realm; instead, his soul would remain in the void until called upon by one of his descendants.  To make sure that each realm would live up to the bargain, a spell of protection was placed upon Noble and his descendants. Thus, the legend of the Ghost Rider began.

Seeking the '''Medallion of Power''', Noble battled the demon [[Zarathos]]. During their battle the medallion was broken into three pieces. Each recovered a piece; the third was believed lost until being found as part of the Badilino family.

The Blazes were separated as a protective measure by the Blood. Mephisto confronted Naomi Kale. She attempted to join with Noble and battle Mephisto. She was killed, and Noble's father hid the body. (Mephisto had apparently made Pastor Kale immortal and tormented him with the fact that his zealous beliefs had damned his descendants.) He also tracked down the Badilinos.

His manipulations caused Johnny Blaze to be bonded with Zarathos. Blaze then was manipulated to attack the Badilinos, causing Michael Badilino to become Vengeance. Noble was bonded to Daniel Ketch when his sister Barbara was shot.

The truth about the Ghost Rider and Noble was revealed after a penance stare from Vengeance. Kale and Ketch continued to battle evil, with Kale becoming more powerful and angrier. [[Blackheart]] deposed Mephisto and sought to up the stakes by creating his own Spirits of Vengeance.

They confronted Kale, demanding he serve Blackheart or die. He refused and was taken to "hell" after being stabbed by Pao Fu. There, Blackheart offered him another deal: marry both Pao Fu and the Blackrose. Ketch was able to contact Uriel, and Noble briefly was transformed into an "angel of death." Blackheart was defeated, and Kale assumed control of "hell." Mephisto soon returned and forced Kale out.
