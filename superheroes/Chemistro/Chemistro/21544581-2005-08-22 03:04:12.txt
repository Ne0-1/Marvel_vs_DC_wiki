Three people have taken the moniker '''Chemistro''' in the [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] universe, the first creating a "transmutation gun" capable of changing matter from one form to another by an unknown process (wood to glass, etc.), which he used in criminal pursuits.  

In combat with [[Luke Cage]], aka "[[Power Man]]", Chemistro accidentally fired his tranmutation gun at his own foot, turning it to steel, though the unstable nature of the transmutation soon caused it to crumble to dust, leaving him crippled.  He was turned over to the police, and in prison was beaten by his cellmate into revealing the means by which the transmutation gun worked.  

Upon leaving prison, this individual replicated the transmutation gun, but it exploded in his hand, enabling him to transmute substances via touch.  He was ultimately apprehended, thanks in large part to the help of the original Chemistro.  

More recently, the younger brother of the original Chemistro took the name, and embarked on a criminal career that was foiled by the intervention of the original Chemistro on at least one occasion.
