Three people have taken the moniker of the supervillain '''Chemistro''' in the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The first and the current Chemistro, '''Curtis Carr''' is an [[archenemy]] of [[Luke Cage]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Curtis Carr===
The first Chemistro, Curtis Carr, was born in [[Kansas City, Kansas]]. While working as a chemist and research scientist for Mainstream Motors, he created an "alchemy gun" capable of transmuting matter from one form to another by an unknown process (wood to glass, etc.). Horace Claymore, the company's president, was impressed until Curtis voiced his intent to keep the device. Claymore argued that since the gun was made on company time, it belonged to Mainstream. When Claymore fired him, Curtis adopted the persona of Chemistro to gain revenge and to extort his former employers.

In combat with [[Luke Cage]], Chemistro accidentally fired his alchemy gun at his own right foot, turning it to steel, though the unstable nature of the transmutation soon caused it to crumble to dust, leaving him crippled.<ref>''[[Luke Cage|Luke Cage: Hero for Hire]]'' #12</ref> Carr was turned over to the police, and in prison was beaten by his cellmate Arch Morton into revealing the means by which the alchemy gun worked. Morton took on the Chemistro persona, and Carr invented a "nullifier" device which enabled Cage to defeat Morton.<ref name="Power Man #37-39">''Power Man'' #37-39</ref> 

Curtis's alchemy gun was later stolen by his younger brother Calvin, who became the third Chemistro. Curtis aided Cage and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in defeating Calvin.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #94, 96</ref>

Later, Curtis came to work at a division of Stark Enterprises as a research scientist and Director of Research and Development at Stark Prosthetics in Denver, Colorado. He created an artificial prosthesis to replace his missing foot. Stark Prosthetics ended up attacked by the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" when the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] sent him to attack [[Iron Man]]. Curtis aided Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] against the Wrecker and Calvin, although Calvin destroyed Curtis' left foot. After that attack, Curtis made another prostheses for his other foot.<ref name="Iron Man #251-252">''Iron Man'' #251-252</ref> 

Curtis later became known as High-Tech.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Curtis Carr, as High-Tech, is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]: Battle Damage Report''.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

===Archibald Morton===
Archibald "Arch" Morton was born in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]], and became a professional criminal and was sent to prison. He forced Curtis Carr to reveal the secret of his alchemy gun while they were cellmates. Upon leaving prison, Morton attempted to replicate the alchemy gun, but it exploded in his hand, granting him superhuman powers and enabling him to transmute substances via touch. He battled Luke Cage on behalf of the [[Baron (comics)|Baron]]. Morton was ultimately apprehended, thanks in large part to the help of the original Chemistro.<ref name="Power Man #37-39"/>

===Calvin Carr===
Calvin Carr, Curtis' younger brother, stole the alchemy gun and took the Chemistro name. He embarked on a criminal career and battled Luke Cage and Iron Fist. Curtis intervened, and helped the heroes foil his brother's plans.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #93-96</ref> 
Calvin's alchemy gun was turned into wrist blasters by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] who sent him and the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] to attack [[Iron Man]] and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]." Curtis helped the heroes, and Calvin destroyed Curtis' other foot, but gave up when he was defeated by Iron Man.<ref name="Iron Man #251-252"/>

Calvin has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>New Avengers #35</ref>

Chemistro informs The Hood of a plot by [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] to sell [[Deathlok]], which he stole from S.H.I.E.L.D., to the highest bidder. As Owl hasn't gained permission from his new crime syndicate, The Hood decides to gatecrash the auction. Sending [[Madame Masque]], the [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], and [[Jonas Harrow|Dr. Jonas Harrow]] as proxies he effortlessly ambushes and dispatches the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]].

John King and The Hood reconvene in the back room of run-down bar where they are confronted by a curious [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] who overhears their plans to run Deathlok through the lobby of Avengers Tower. They escape by shooting Wolverine and assuming the form the Nistanti who originally owned his hood, using this form to escape.

Chemistro suggests that they change their plan and instead use Deathlok to rob a federal reserve bank under the Baxter Building. In the process they gain over 15 million in cash and lose Deathlok in the ensuing chaos. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.

In [[Secret Invasion]], he is one among many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> 

He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref> He later orchestrates a power-draining trap that was meant for the Dark Avengers only to end up having the New Avengers in his trap.<ref>New Avengers #55</ref> Chemistro was seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.<ref>''New Avengers'' #63</ref>  Later Calvin is shown to be arrested, along with other members of the Hood's gang, by the U.S. Army.  <ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The original Chemistro, Curtis Carr, is a gifted research scientist, with advanced degrees in chemistry, physics, and mechanical engineering. He is a highly skilled inventor and built his alchemy gun, which fires radiation able to transmute any substance into any other form of matter. He also built a "nullifier" rifle which is able to neutralize and reverse the effects of the alchemy gun, and Arch Morton's transmutation powers. The devices are cybernetically linked to the user, enabling him to work any transformation he can imagine. The transformed material usually turns to dust after exposure to heat or after a certain amount of time. Therefore his alchemy gun cannot be used merely to transmute substances, such as turning lead or rock into gold. As High-Tech, Curtis Carr employed an armored exoskeleton suit and various devices of his own invention.

Archibald Morton was granted the ability to transmute substances by the touch of his left hand in a similar fashion after his experimental version of the alchemy gun exploded.

The third Chemistro, Calvin Carr, used a set of wrist-blasters designed by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], which functioned in an identical manner as his brother's alchemy gun.
