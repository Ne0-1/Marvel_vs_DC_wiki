Three people have taken the moniker '''Chemistro''' in the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. 

The first, Curtis Carr, made his first appearance in [[Luke Cage|Luke Cage: Hero for Hire]] #12. While working as a chemist for Mainstream Motors, he created an "alchemy gun" capable of changing matter from one form to another by an unknown process (wood to glass, etc.). Horace Claymore, the company's president, was impressed until Curtis voiced his intent to keep the device. Claymore argued that since the gun was made on company time, it belonged to Mainstream. When Claymore fired him, Curtis adopted the persona of Chemistro to gain revenge and to extort his former employers.  

In combat with [[Luke Cage]], Chemistro accidentally fired his alchemy gun at his own foot, turning it to steel, though the unstable nature of the transmutation soon caused it to crumble to dust, leaving him crippled.  He was turned over to the police, and in prison was beaten by his cellmate Arch Morton into revealing the means by which the alchemy gun worked.  

Upon leaving prison, Morton replicated the alchemy gun, but it exploded in his hand, enabling him to transmute substances via touch.  He was ultimately apprehended, thanks in large part to the help of the original Chemistro.  

More recently, Calvin Carr, Curtis' younger brother, took the name, and embarked on a criminal career that was foiled by Curtis' intervention on at least one occasion.
