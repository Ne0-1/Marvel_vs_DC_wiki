'''Benjamin Richard Parker''' (often called '''Benjy''' by his sister and fans) is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] alternate future [[MC2]] universe.  He is the younger brother of [[Spider-Girl|May Parker/Spider-Girl]], and the son of [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]  and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] (Spider-Man).

Benjamin is born after a [[Complications of pregnancy|complicated]] pregnancy.  Because his father's genetic code was altered when he received his powers, Ben is at a high risk of being born with some kind of genetic abnormality: [[deformity]], [[disability]], or perhaps even [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] powers.<ref name="PPSM15">The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] of the X-Men, a noted geneticist, explained the probable risks to Spider-Man in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #15, October 1991, by writer/artist [[Erik Larsen]].</ref>   Due to the risk to Mary Jane's health, her [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] advises her to consider [[abortion]].  However, remembering that she had faced similar risks when pregnant with her daughter May, Mary Jane decides to proceed with the pregnancy.

Ben is born while his sister is fighting [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], and to his family's relief, is apparently a perfectly healthy, normal little boy. Whether he'll gain powers similar to his father or sister remains unknown. It is possible he may become the next male Spider-Man or Spider-Boy.

His first name '''Benjamin''' is in honor of his [[Ben Reilly|uncle]] and [[Benjamin Parker|great uncle]], while his second name '''Richard''' is in honor of his [[Richard and Mary Parker|grandfather]].

In <I>Amazing Spider-Girl</I> #9, Benjamin seems to display some superhuman abilities, namely balancing a toy block on one finger while spinning his arm at a fast speed. He was also seen dangling the block from his finger on a web-like string. In ASG #14 May discovers Ben crawling on the ceiling of their home, this makes her fear his powers are coming about too soon. 

He was once possessed by a miniature version of the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote.  After his sister freed him from the symbiote by using the ultrasonic weaponry of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]], his father notices that the baby's ears were bleeding, and realised that Ben has lost his hearing, likely because Ben's ears were far too underdeveloped to withstand the sonic waves.  The doctors in the hospital are still trying to determine whether Ben's hearing loss is temporary or permanent. May is deeply upset over this and blames herself. Nevertheless, Ben still seems to be his usual, happy self. Since discovering her baby brother crawling on the ceiling she fears that due to his exposure to the symbiote, his abilities have somehow been jump started far too early (as hers only came about in her teens).
