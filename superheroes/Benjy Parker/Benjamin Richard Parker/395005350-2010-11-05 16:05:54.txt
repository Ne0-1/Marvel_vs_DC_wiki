'''Benjamin Richard Parker''' (often called '''Benjy''' by his sister) is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] alternate future [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe.  He is the younger brother of [[Spider-Girl|May Parker/Spider-Girl]], and the son of [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Benjamin is born after a [[Complications of pregnancy|complicated]] pregnancy.  Because his father's genetic code was altered when he received his powers, Ben is at a high risk of being born with some kind of genetic abnormality: [[deformity]], [[disability]], or perhaps even [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] powers.<ref name="PPSM15">The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] of the X-Men, a noted geneticist, explained the probable risks to Spider-Man in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #15, October 1991, by writer/artist [[Erik Larsen]].</ref>  Due to the risk to Mary Jane's health, her [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] advises her to consider [[abortion]].  However, remembering that she had faced similar risks when pregnant with her daughter May, Mary Jane decides to proceed with the pregnancy.

Ben is born while his sister is fighting [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], and to his family's relief, is apparently a perfectly healthy, normal little boy.  His first name '''Benjamin''' is in honor of his [[Ben Reilly|uncle]] and [[Uncle Ben|great uncle]], while his second name '''Richard''' is in honor of his [[Richard and Mary Parker|grandfather]].

In ''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9, Benjamin seems to display some superhuman abilities, namely balancing a toy block on one finger while spinning his arm at a fast speed.  He was also seen dangling the block from his finger on a web-like string.  In ''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #14, May discovers Ben crawling on the ceiling of their home. 

He was once possessed by a miniature version of the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote.  After his sister freed him from the symbiote by using the ultrasonic weaponry of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]], his father notices that the baby's ears were bleeding, and realized that Ben has lost his hearing, likely because Ben's ears were far too underdeveloped to withstand the sonic waves.  The doctors in the hospital were trying to determine whether Ben's hearing loss is temporary or permanent.  May is deeply upset over this and blames herself.  Nevertheless, Ben still seems to be his usual, happy self.  Since discovering her baby brother crawling on the ceiling she fears that due to his exposure to the symbiote, his abilities have somehow been jump started far too early (as hers only came about in her teens) possibly making him more powerful than his father and sister as his powers manifested during childhood.

[[Normie Osborn]] recently agreed to fund an operation to restore Benjamin's hearing.  The operation was a success, restoring most, if not all of Ben's hearing. When Benjy was going through it, Normie closely examined his body and found out that he was already developing his powers from the start, but because of the exposure to the symbiote; it accelerated the process. Peter begins to fear that Benjy is maybe more powerful than him and his sister. This is strongly implied to be true when Ben spins organic webs to save both himself and Mary Jane after being thrown off a bridge by the [[Green Goblin]], something neither Peter nor May can do. Despite being a baby, he was also strong enough for Mary Jane to hold on to without hurting him. 

It is also known that Peter is the only one who can get him to burp "in the morning" (as Mary Jane says it) by feeding him chili.

===Universe X===
In this alternate reality, Ben is the child of Peter and Gwen. He possess the same ability as his father and took on the mantle of Spider-Man in Peter's illusion, brought on by Spiders Man.

===Possible future===
In the one shot 'Iron Man - The End' an aged Tony Stark, on the verge of retirement, is shown looking at a list of potential candidates to succeed him as Iron Man. 'Spider-Man' appears on the list alongside American Dream, and younger versions of Beast and Colossus (presumably their sons, who inherited the powers and physical features of their respective fathers). Since Peter Parker is long past his prime in this timeline, it is probably an indication that Benjy has followed his father's and elder sister's footsteps and taken up his father's costume and identity as Spider-Man.
