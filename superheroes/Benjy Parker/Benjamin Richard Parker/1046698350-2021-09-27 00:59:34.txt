'''Benjamin Richard Parker''' (often called '''Benjy''' by his sister) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted in the alternate future [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe.  He is the younger brother of [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|May Parker / Spider-Girl]], and the son of [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Benjamin is born after a [[Complications of pregnancy|complicated]] pregnancy.  Because his father's genetic code was altered when he received his powers, Ben is at a high risk of being born with some kind of genetic abnormality: [[deformity]], [[disability]], or perhaps even [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers.<ref name="PPSM15">The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] of the X-Men, a noted geneticist, explained the probable risks to Spider-Man in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #15, October 1991, by writer/artist [[Erik Larsen]].</ref>  Due to the risk to Mary Jane's health, her [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] advises her to consider [[abortion]]. However, remembering that she had faced similar risks when pregnant with her daughter May, Mary Jane decides to proceed with the pregnancy.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #40</ref>

Ben is born while his sister is fighting [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], and to his family's relief, is apparently a perfectly healthy, normal little boy.  His first name '''Benjamin''' is in honor of his [[Ben Reilly|uncle]] and [[Uncle Ben|great uncle]], while his second name '''Richard''' is in honor of his [[Richard and Mary Parker|grandfather]].<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #59</ref>

Benjamin seems to display some superhuman abilities, namely balancing a toy block on one finger while spinning his arm at a fast speed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9</ref>  He was also seen dangling the block from his finger on a web-like string.{{issue|date=January 2013}}  May discovers Ben crawling on the ceiling of their home.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #14</ref>

He was once possessed by a miniature version of the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote.  After his sister freed him from the symbiote by using the ultrasonic weaponry of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]], his father notices that the baby's ears were bleeding, and realized that Ben has lost his hearing, likely because Ben's ears were far too underdeveloped to withstand the sonic waves.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #11-12</ref>  The doctors in the hospital were trying to determine whether Ben's hearing loss is temporary or permanent.  May is deeply upset over this and blames herself.  Nevertheless, Ben still seems to be his usual, happy self.  Since discovering her baby brother crawling on the ceiling she fears that due to his exposure to the symbiote, his abilities have somehow been jump started far too early (as hers only came about in her teens).{{issue|date=January 2013}}

[[Normie Osborn]] agreed to fund an operation to restore Benjamin's hearing. The operation was a success, restoring most, if not all of Ben's hearing. When Benjy was going through it, Normie closely examined his body and found out that he was already developing his powers, but the exposure to the symbiote accelerated the process. Peter begins to fear that Benjy may be more powerful than him and his sister. This is strongly implied to be true when Ben spins organic webs to save both himself and Mary Jane after being thrown off a bridge by the [[Green Goblin]], something neither Peter nor May can do. Despite being a baby, he was also strong enough for Mary Jane to hold on to without hurting him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #30</ref>

It is also known that Peter is the only one who can get him to burp "in the morning" (as Mary Jane says it) by feeding him chili.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Spider-Verse===
In the 2014/2015 crossover event ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', Benjy's family come under attack from [[Daemos]], a relation of the 616 Spider-Man's former nemesis [[Morlun]]. During the attack, Mary Jane, Mayday's boyfriend Wes, and Peter are apparently all killed and their home destroyed. Mayday flees with Ben and is rescued by visiting Spider-Men from other dimensions who are trying to save as many Spiders as possible from similar attacks by Morlon and Daemos' family, who call themselves The Inheritors. Mayday and Ben are taken to a safe zone where the Spiders plan their next course of action. The safe zone is eventually compromised and Ben is captured by the Inheritors. It is revealed that the infant Ben is a vital part of a prophecy that will help bring about the downfall of the Inheritors and involves "The Other" (Kaine), "The Bride" (Silk) and "The Scion" (Ben himself). However, conversely if the three specific totems were sacrificed together, their deaths will ensure not only the Inheritors remain in power forever but also will stop future spider-people from appearing, and thus preventing the prophecy. Benjy is eventually saved by [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]]- his great-uncle and possible namesake- and [[Spider-Ham]] in the final fight, Uncle Ben taking Benjy to safety and Spider-Ham taking Benjy's place to catch the Inheritors off-guard.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol.3 #14</ref> Afterwards, it is revealed Benjamin's mother and Wes survived the Inheritor attacked, but unfortunately his father did not.

===Web Warriors===

Benjamin makes a few cameo appearances in 2015's [[Web Warriors]] series, looked after by Mayday, Mary Jane, Uncle Ben and is often visited by Anya Corzon.

===Spider-Geddon===

Benjamin is referenced several times by his sister Mayday in the event [[Spider-Geddon]]. After the latest battle with The Inheritors has concluded, Mayday comments that her brother is very likely still the Scion of the Spider-Scroll Prophecy, her alternate world sister Annie May Parker, Spiderling, informs her that The Other is still in play too and is closer than she knows. On Mayday and Benjamin's Earth, it is revealed that The Other has resurrected their father.

Then [[Alternative versions of Venom#Earth X|Venom]], Peter's real life daughter May who had bonded to the Venom symbiote, defeated Spiders Man and broke her out of that fabricated world and convinced Peter to accept his real life.<ref>''Universe X Special'' #3.
