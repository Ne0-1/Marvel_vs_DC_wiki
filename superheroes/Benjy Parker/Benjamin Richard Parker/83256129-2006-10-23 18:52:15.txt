'''Benjamin Richard Parker''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] alternate future [[MC2]] universe.  He is the younger brother of [[Spider-Girl|May Parker/Spider-Girl]], and the son of [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]  and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] (Spider-Man).

Benjamin is born after a [[Complications of pregnancy|complicated]] pregnancy.  Because his father's genetic code was altered when he received his powers, Ben is at a high risk of being born with some kind of genetic abnormality: [[deformity]], [[disability]], or perhaps even [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] powers.<ref name="PPSM15">The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] of the X-Men, a noted geneticist, explained the probable risks to Spider-Man in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #15, October 1991, by writer/artist [[Erik Larsen]].</ref>   Due to the risk to Mary Jane's health, her [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] advises her to consider [[abortion]].  However, remembering that she had faced similar risks when pregnant with her daughter May, Mary Jane decides to proceed with the pregnancy.

Ben is born while his sister is fighting [[Seth (comics)|Seth]], and to his family's relief, is apparently a perfectly healthy, normal little boy.

His first name '''Benjamin''' is in honor of his [[Ben Reilly|uncle]] and [[Uncle Ben|great uncle]], while his second name '''Richard''' is in honor of his [[Richard and Mary Parker|grandfather]].
