'''Onomatopoeia''' is a [[DC Comics]] supervillain and enemy of [[Green Arrow]] and [[Batman]]. He first appeared in ''Green Arrow'' #12 (March 2002). He was created by writer [[Kevin Smith]] and artist [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]]. [[IGN]]'s Daniel Crown called him "one of the coolest new villains of the decade".<ref>Schedeen, Jesse.

Kevin Smith discussed the character in a 2007 interview:
{{cquote|When I did Green Arrow, I went with Onomatopoeia for a villain, just because I loved that word, and it kind of formed the character inasmuch as he would say sounds out loud. It only kind of works – I think – on a comic book page because if you have a gun going off, they usually write BLAM! and then you can have, you know, the character saying "BLAM!" in a word balloon, but like if you tried to do that cinematically you can't really rock it. A gun in a film sounds completely different. It doesn't read as BLAM! and so to have a dude say BLAM! after a true gunshot, all these people would be like "he's just retarded". I think it works great in print and on a comic book page. I don't think that character would translate very well outside of that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azhrialilu.com/article/25/interview-with-kevin-smith-aka-silent-bob|title=Interview with Kevin Smith aka Silent Bob|publisher=Azhrialilu|author=Lisa S|date=1 November 2007|accessdate=2 November 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071116015644/http://azhrialilu.com/article/25/interview-with-kevin-smith-aka-silent-bob|archivedate=16 November 2007}}</ref>}}

Onomatopoeia first appears in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' #12 (March 2002), in which he murders a female crimefighter named [[Virago]], after telling her his name. The interlude in which this occurs serves as a lead-in to "The Sounds of Violence", a three-issue storyline that runs through issues #13-15 of the title, in which he is the main antagonist. No personal characteristics are revealed about Onomatopoeia aside from the fact that he is a [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] male, which is seen when portions of his face obscured by shadow are seen in ''Green Arrow'' #14, and when the lower half of his face is seen again in issue #15. Onomatopoeia is a [[serial killer]] who targets non-[[superpower]]ed [[superhero]]es. His name is derived from the fact that he imitates noises around him, such as dripping taps, gunshots etc. During the course of this storyline, he shoots [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the second Green Arrow, who is saved by his mentor [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] (the first and original Green Arrow). While Connor is being operated on in the hospital, Onomatopoeia returns to finish the job. He kills several doctors in the operating room, and after his attempt to kill Connor is foiled by Queen and [[Black Canary]], he manages to escape.

He is later recruited by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] as part of an army that is sent to conquer the city of Metropolis in issue #7 of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series (June 2006). A superhero army, backed up by the National Guard, successfully opposes the Society. Onomatopoeia is seen being punched in the face by the 'Odd Man', a costumed, un-powered vigilante, exactly the type the villain has slain before.

The character returned in the November 2008 three-issue miniseries ''[[Batman: Cacophony]]''<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080818-dc-november-solicitations.html "DC Comics' FULL November 2008 Solicitations"], [[Newsarama]], August 16, 2008</ref> which was written by Smith and pencilled by friend [[Walt Flanagan]].<ref>[http://www.newsaskew.com/2008/07/25/smith-flanagan-to-create-new-batman-comic-series/ "Smith, Flanagan To Create New “Batman” Comic Series…"], News Askiew, accessed March 13, 2011.{{dead link|date=March 2011}} {{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> Onomatopoeia frees [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] from [[Arkham Asylum]] and gives him money to finance a gang war against [[Maxie Zeus]]. Eventually he confronts Batman, who defeats him. He escapes capture, however, by mortally wounding the Joker, forcing Batman to choose between saving the Joker's life and capturing his new opponent. The end of the third issue reveals that Onomatopoeia has a secret, seemingly normal life as a loving husband and the father of two children, who are unaware of his murderous activities. He explains his occasional injuries as the result of sporting activities such as [[tennis]], [[polo]], and [[hunting]]. He keeps mementos of his victories in a hidden shrine behind a bookcase, saving a case each for Batman and Green Arrow.

In ''[[Batman: The Widening Gyre]]'', it is revealed that he has been in disguise as Baphomet, a new vigilante who had been teaming up with Batman. He appears as Baphomet early on, helping the Dark Knight defeat [[Etrigan the Demon]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]. He later assists Batman in defeating villains such as [[Deadshot]], [[Crazy Quilt]], and [[Calendar Man]], even unmasking himself in front of Batman to gain his trust (as Batman had no idea what Onomatopoeia actually looked like this did not reveal the ruse). At the storyline's end Batman takes Baphomet into the Batcave and introduces him to a disguised [[Silver St. Cloud]] before Batman reveals he is Bruce Wayne and Silver unmasks herself. Bruce invites Baphomet to stay for breakfast as he turns away and puts his utility belt on the table with a "KA-KLAK". He hears Baphomet repeating the sound before turning in horror to see Onomatopoeia midway through slicing Silver's throat and mimicking the noise of the blade.

==Powers and abilities==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
Onomatopoeia is a superb athlete, [[martial arts|martial artist]] and weapons expert. He invariably carries two semiautomatic [[handgun]]s, a sniper rifle, and an army knife. He appears to be quite intelligent, having orchestrated the Joker's escape to draw out Batman, as well as avoiding capture by giving the Joker a near-fatal wound, causing Batman to be distracted. His usual outfit consists of black gloves, pants, and shirt, with a long black [[trench coat]] and a full, black [[hood (headgear)|hood]] decorated by concentric white circles. In ''Batman: Cacophony'', it is revealed that he collects the masks of heroes he kills, keeping them in a trophy case in his secret identity's house.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

It remains unrevealed whether or not Onomatopoeia is a [[metahuman]]. In ''Green Arrow'' #15, he was shot with six arrows–two to one shoulder, one to the other, one in between the first and middle knuckles of his right hand, one through his right foot, one through the palm of his right hand–none of which slowed him or even impaired his manual dexterity. After being shot, he jumps off the roof of the [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] hospital, falling seven stories, and runs away before Green Arrow can find him.

==In other media==
The producers of the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' originally intended to adapt Onomatopoeia for a 2013 episode. However, executive producer Andrew Kreisberg states his team changed their minds after reading Kevin Smith's statement that the character could not be adapted for screen. Instead, they adapted the character for screen as Mr Blank, a mysterious and highly-effective contract assassin, and cast [[J. August Richards]] in the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cartermatt.com/57628/arrow-spoilers-meet-a-new-villain-very-soon/|title=‘Arrow’ spoilers: Meet a new villain very soon|work=Cartermatt.com|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>  He appeared in the episode "Home Invasion" where he played an assassin on the hunt for attorney [[Black Canary|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]) at a time when vigilante Oliver Queen ([[Stephen Amell]]) is on the hunt for [[Deadshot]] (Michael Rowe). Like Onomatopoeia, Mr. Blank used semi-automatic pistols but not a knife or sniper rifle.

Onomatopoeia appears in the ''Green Arrow'' short from ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]''. He sends his Ono-Bots (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) to take down Green Arrow and Black Canary. They are defeated, but Onomatopoeia sneaks away with the heroes on pursuit.
