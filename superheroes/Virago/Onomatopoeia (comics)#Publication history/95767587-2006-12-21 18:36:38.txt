'''Onomatopoeia''' is a [[DC Comics]] supervillain who has faced [[Green Arrow]]. He first appeared in ''Green Arrow'' #11 (February 2002). He was created by [[Kevin Smith]] and [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]].

== Character History ==
Nothing at all is known about Onomatopoeia, certainly not his name or face. When his face was once partially uncovered it was seen that he is a [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] [[male]] but that is the extent of our knowledge of him.

Onomatopoeia is a [[serial killer]] who targets non-[[List of comic book superpowers|powered]], [[vigilante]] [[superhero]]es. He earned [[Onomatopoeia|his name]] because he imitates noises around him, such as dripping taps, gunshots etc. It seems that he may be able to perfectly imitate these sounds but that has been left ambiguous. He invariably carries two semiautomatic [[handgun]]s, and army knife, and is a skilled [[martial arts|unarmed combatant]].

He once stated his nickname to one of his victims after he shot and killed her. This was the only time he has been seen speaking normally. He dresses all in black with black gloves and wears a full, black [[hood]] decorated by concentric white circles. 

One of his notable targets was [[Connor Hawke]], the second Green Arrow. He shot Connor, who was saved by his father '''Oliver Queen''' (the first and original Green Arrow). While Connor was being operated on in the hospital, Onomatopoeia returned to finish the job, but was stopped by Queen and [[Black Canary]]. He managed to escape and remains at large, making a brief cameo in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event during the "[[Battle of Metropolis]]."

It remains uncertain whether or not Onomatopoeia is a [[metahuman]], however in his encounter with Green Arrow, he took six arrows without stopping.  He took two to one shoulder, one to the other, one in between the first and middle knuckles of his right hand, one through his right foot, one through the palm of his right hand, none of which slowed him or even impaired his manual dexterity.  After being shot, he took a seven story drop off the roof of the Star City hospital and still managed to run away before Green Arrow could find him.
