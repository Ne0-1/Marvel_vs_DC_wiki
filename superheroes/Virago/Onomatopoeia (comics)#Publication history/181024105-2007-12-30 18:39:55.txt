'''Onomatopoeia''' is a [[DC Comics]] supervillain who has faced [[Green Arrow]]. He first appeared in ''Green Arrow'' #11 (February 2002). He was created by [[Kevin Smith]] and [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]].


== Publication history  ==

Kevin Smith discussed the character in a 2007 interview:

{{cquote|When I did Green Arrow, I went with Onomatopoeia for a villain, just because I loved that word, and it kind of formed the character inasmuch as he would say sounds out loud. It only kind of works – I think – on a comic book page because if you have a gun going off, they usually write BLAM! and then you can have, you know, the character saying “BLAM!” in a word balloon, but like if you tried to do that cinematically you can’t really rock it. A gun in a film sounds completely different. It doesn’t read as BLAM! and so to have a dude say BLAM! after a true gunshot, all these people would be like ‘he’s just retarded’. I think it works great in print and on a comic book page. I don’t think that character would translate very well outside of that.<ref> [http://azhrialilu.com/article/25/interview-with-kevin-smith-aka-silent-bob Azhrialilu dot Com: Interview with Kevin Smith]</ref>}}

== Fictional character biography ==
No personal characteristics are known about Onomatopoeia, including his real name or facial features.  When his face was once partially uncovered it was seen that he is a [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] [[male]] but that is the extent of our knowledge of him.

Onomatopoeia is a [[serial killer]] who targets non-[[List of comic book superpowers|powered]], [[vigilante]] [[superhero]]es. He earned [[Onomatopoeia|his name]] because he imitates noises around him, such as dripping taps, gunshots etc. It seems that he may be able to perfectly imitate these sounds but that has been left ambiguous. He once stated his nickname to one of his victims after he shot and killed her. This was the only time he has been seen speaking normally.  He invariably carries two semiautomatic [[handgun]]s, a sniper rifle (which may or may not carry live ammo along with tranquilizer darts), an army knife, and is a skilled [[martial arts|unarmed combatant]]. His usual outfit consists of black gloves, pants and shirt, with a long black [[trenchcoat]] and a full, black [[hood (headgear)|hood]] decorated by concentric white circles. 

One of his notable targets was [[Connor Hawke]], the second Green Arrow. He shot Connor, who was saved by his father [[Oliver Queen]] (the first and original Green Arrow). While Connor was being operated on in the hospital, Onomatopoeia returned to finish the job, but was stopped by Queen and [[Black Canary]]. He managed to escape and remains at large, making a brief cameo in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event during the "[[Battle of Metropolis]]."

It remains uncertain whether or not Onomatopoeia is a metahuman, however in his encounter with Green Arrow, he took six arrows without stopping. He took two to one shoulder, one to the other, one in between the first and middle knuckles of his right hand, one through his right foot, one through the palm of his right hand, none of which slowed him or even impaired his manual dexterity. After being shot, he took a seven story drop off the roof of the Star City hospital and still managed to run away before Green Arrow could find him.
