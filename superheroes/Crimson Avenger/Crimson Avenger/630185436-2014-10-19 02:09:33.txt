'''The Crimson Avenger''' is the name of three separate [[fictional character]]s, [[superhero]]es who exist in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].

==Lee Walter Travis==
{{main|Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)}}

The original Crimson Avenger made his first published appearance in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #20 (October 1938). He was a wealthy newsman named Lee Walter Travis who took up the identity of the Crimson Avenger to battle crime.

Travis initially dressed in a red [[trenchcoat]], a [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]], and a red [[mask]] covering his face; except for the red coloring, he was visually similar to the [[The Shadow|Shadow]]. He had an Asian [[chauffeur]]/crime-fighting partner, and used a gas gun to subdue criminals, similar to the [[Green Hornet]]. Later, when superheroes became more popular than costumed [[vigilante]]s, his costume was changed to a more standard superhero outfit, consisting of red tights, yellow boots, trunks and crest, and a "sun" symbol which was recently stated to have been a stylized bullet hole.

In a [[retcon]]ned origin story appearing in ''Golden Age Secret Files #1'' (February 2001), Travis trained in hand-to-hand combat in [[Nanda Parbat]] after [[World War I]]. While there he saw the future and witnessed an "unnamed hero" ([[Superman]]), and the man's selflessness and death at the hands of a monster ([[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]). This inspired him to return to America and combat crime, first as a corruption-free newspaper owner and later as a masked crime fighter.

In his costumed identity, Travis used both conventional handguns and a special pistol that dispensed a bright red smokescreen.

Years later, he died rescuing his city from an explosives-laden freighter about to detonate in its harbor;  after convincing the crew to abandon ship, he piloted the ship to a safe distance.<ref>''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #38</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = Wells|first = John|title = Flashback: Whatever Happened to...?|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 64|pages = 51-61|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013}}</ref>

The Justice League of America always has a version of his first costume present whenever they are inducting new members as a homage to the Crimson Avenger's status as the world's first masked crimefighter (Superman was the first superhero, and the world's first unmasked crimefighter, making his first appearance in June 1938 in Action Comics #1).

==Albert Elwood==
Albert Elwood made a single appearance as the Crimson Avenger, in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #131 (February 1963), in a story entitled "The Mystery of the Crimson Avenger". Eccentric inventor Albert Elwood adopted the guise and attempted to help Superman, Batman and Robin thwart the robberies of the Octopus Gang. After the requisite identity confusion when one of the gang members assumed the Crimson Avenger's identity, Elwood did help the heroes capture the gang, and retired right afterward. He had many sophisticated gadgets, but his efforts often proved counterproductive, more a hindrance than a help. He did mention that he had "taken the name of a former lawman," meaning the by-then long defunct original Crimson Avenger. The former Crimson Avenger was only recorded as having resided on Earth-Two, however the Earth Elwood resided on has never been identified.

==Jill Carlyle==<!-- This section is linked from [[Spectre (comics)]] -->
Since then, another Crimson Avenger has appeared. This character, like the original [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], serves as a minor [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]]. She is an African-American woman who possesses the powers of teleportation and intangibility. In a flashback sequence, we see that she studied law but apparently lost a case in which the defendant was clearly guilty. She obtains a pair of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] pistols originally owned by the first Crimson Avenger and uses them to exact vengeance upon the unknown criminal. These guns are cursed such that, if the possessor uses them out of revenge, he or she will be cursed to track and kill those who have taken innocent life. As part of the curse, an ever-bleeding bullet hole appears on her chest.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Crimson Avenger II | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 90 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Upon gaining a new "assignment," she mentally relives the death of the victim, and then is teleported to their place of burial. She then gains the memory and skills of those whose deaths she is avenging. Her guns never miss, never run out of ammunition, and have no triggers. The bullets are capable of penetrating any substance, and can wound invulnerable heroes such as [[Superman]] and [[Power Girl]], as well as crack the armored shell of [[Captain Atom]]. The guns seemingly have a mind of their own, as she speaks of having to restrain them from shooting those who come between her and her target. Her intangibility does not function against her own weapons or other magical forces. Unless/until the curse is lifted, she is seemingly immortal. She once attempts to kill herself with her own weapons, but this merely results in ending her current "assignment" and delivering her to the next one.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

She is a member of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] during the "Stealing Thunder" storyline - the group at the time being short on heroes after the [[Ultra-Humanite]] has used the [[Johnny Thunder|Thunderbolt]] to take over the world - where her mission is to avenge the death of Lee Travis, revealing that the explosion that killed him was caused by the Ultra-Humanite. She returns later in ''JSA'' #52-53, tracking down [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] for framing a man called Charles Durham for a crime he didn't commit, only to learn that Wildcat only framed Durham after he killed his brother, sister-in-law and nephew after his brother killed his fiancée. Since the D.A. didn't have anything on Durham, he was going to go free after killing an entire family, driving Wildcat to plant evidence implicating him in the death of his fiancée. While she performs her cursed duty, she attempts to learn how Lee Travis seemingly divested himself of the guns' curse, and begins to realize that she is not always contacted by the spirits of the innocent.

Though attacked by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in a 2005 issue of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'', the Crimson Avenger is seen at Blackgate Prison, fighting escaping inmates during the worldwide supervillain breakout the Society engineered in ''[[Villains United]]: [[Infinite Crisis]] Special'' #1. The Crimson Avenger later appears, alongside the current [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and [[Wild Dog (comics)|Wild Dog]], on a rooftop in the great [[Battle of Metropolis]], raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], the [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]].<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7</ref> She appears as one of the dozens of heroes and villains kidnapped by aliens in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #842 and 843. Other heroes free everyone trapped and Vigilante is seen fighting the security forces.

She is later seen gunning down the supervillain known as Catalyst after [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]] sends random super-criminals to attack the world's heroes in order to distract them from his master plan.<ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #5</ref>

This version of the Crimson Avenger is referred to by fans as Jill Carlyle, a name taken from the headstone of a victim the character was shown avenging in an early appearance. Whether the Avenger is Carlyle herself is unclear. Following DC Comics' 2011 [[The New 52|reboot of their publishing line]], a similar character appears in the series ''[[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]'' under the name Lee Travis.

==Other versions==
In ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', [[Alex Ross]] portrayed the character as a giant demon imprisoned in the Gulag. Naming him "King Crimson" in a nod to the band of the same name, his look owes more to his standard superhero look than his previous pulp fiction costume.
Also, in the pages of [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], Garv assumed a masked identity after quitting the team, calling himself the Crimson Avenger. He dropped the identity when he returned to the team near the end of the series.
In Blue Griffin Comics, a short lived comic endeavor, the forerunner super hero was to be named Crimson Avenger. His suit was more closely related to typical super hero style with bright red boots, gloves, trunks, and cape; while the rest of his outfit and mask were a darker shade of red. He sported a "C" crest on his chest and had energy manipulation powers similar to the Green Lantern, however he could not turn his energy projections into objects.

==In other media==
The Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) is a member of the Justice League in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and has several short, non-speaking appearances aside from a very minor one in the episode "[[This Little Piggy]]", where he is voiced by an uncredited [[Kevin Conroy]] (the voice of [[Batman]]). He also appeared in the episode "Patriot Act" as one of the reinforcements sent to help Green Arrow.

''For specific information on Crimson's Avenger's appearances on'' Justice League Unlimited, ''see [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)#In other media]].''

In ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the Crimson Avenger is briefly mentioned as having met with [[Allan Quatermain]] and [[Mina Harker|Mina Murray]] during the latter two's self-exile from Britain during the years of the [[Ingsoc]] government.

In ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', Cubbi sometimes fights crime as The Crimson Avenger which may or may not be a nod to the DC character.
