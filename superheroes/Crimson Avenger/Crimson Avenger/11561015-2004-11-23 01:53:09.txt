The '''Crimson Avenger''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] who exists in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

The original Crimson Avenger premiered in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #20 (predating the appearance of that title's most famous character, [[Batman]], who debuted in #27). He was a wealthy newsman named Lee Travis who took up the identity of the Crimson Avenger to battle crime. He had many similarities to the [[Green Hornet]], including a sidekick named Wing who was an Asian [[valet]] and a [[gas]] gun that he used to subdue opponents. He initially dressed in a [[red]] [[trenchcoat]], a [[fedora]], and a red [[mask]] covering his [[face]]; except for the red, he was visually similar to [[The Shadow]]. Later, when superheroes became more popular than costumed [[vigilante]]s, his costume was changed to a more standard superhero outfit.

In the fifties, a second Crimson Avenger appeared in an issue of ''[[World's Finest]]''. This character has mostly been forgotten.

More recently, a third Crimson Avenger apppeared. This character is an [[African American]] woman who obtains a pair of Colt [[pistol]]s originally owned by the first Crimson Avenger. For reasons that have yet to be revealed, she is [[curse]]d to track and kill those who have taken innocent life using her power of [[teleportation]]. She gains the [[memory|memories]] and skills of those whose deaths she is avenging. Her guns never miss, never run out of [[ammunition]], and have no triggers.

Fairly recently, the Crimson Avenger (possibly the Lee Travis version of him) is a member of the [[Justice League Unlimited]].
