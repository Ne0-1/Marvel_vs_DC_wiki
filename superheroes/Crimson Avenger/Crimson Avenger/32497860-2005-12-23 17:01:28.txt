The '''Crimson Avenger''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] who exists in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

==History==
===Avenger I===

The original Crimson Avenger premiered in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #20, [[October]] [[1938]]  (predating the appearance of that title's most famous character, [[Batman]], who debuted in #27). He was a wealthy newsman named Lee Travis who took up the identity of the Crimson Avenger to battle crime. He had many similarities to the [[Green Hornet]], including a sidekick named [[Wing (comics)|Wing]] who was an Asian [[valet]] and a [[gas]] gun that he used to subdue opponents. He initially dressed in a red [[trenchcoat]], a [[fedora]], and a red [[mask]] covering his face; except for the red, he was visually similar to [[The Shadow]]. Later, when superheroes became more popular than costumed [[vigilante]]s, his costume was changed to a more standard superhero outfit.

In a one shot story named "Whatever Happened to the Crimson Avenger?" featured in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #38, Lee Travis finds out that he is suffering from an incurable disease. he dons his suit one last time and is killed while trying to save the city from an oil tanker which is loaded with explosives. He defeats the crooks on the boat, rescues the crew and then takes it to the center of the lake when it explodes. When the crew reach the shore and they are asked by the police that who were they saved by the captain says that he never saw the face of the man. It can be assumed that nobody actually knew where Lee Travis had disappeared to.

===Avenger II===

The second Crimson Avenger made a single appearance, in ''World's Finest Comics'' #131 (February [[1963]]), in a story entitled "The Mystery of the Crimson Avenger". Eccentric inventor Albert Elwood adopted the guise and attempted to help Superman, Batman and Robin thwart the robberies of the Octopus Gang. After the requisite identity confusion when one of the gang members assumed the Crimson's identity, Elwood did help the heroes capture the gang, and retired right afterward.  He did mention that he had "taken the name of a former lawman," meaning the by-then long defunct original Crimson.

===Avenger III===

More recently, a third Crimson Avenger has appeared. This character, possessing the power of teleportation, is an African American woman who obtains a pair of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] pistols originally owned by the first Crimson Avenger. These guns were cursed such that if the possessor were to use them out of revenge he or she would be cursed to track and kill those who have taken innocent life. She gains the memory and skills of those whose deaths she is avenging. Her guns never miss, never run out of ammunition, and have no triggers. She was a member of the [[JSA]] during the "Stealing Thunder" storyline, and was featured in JSA #52-53, tracking down [[Wildcat]].  She appears to have been killed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in recent ([[2005]]) issues of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]''.

Fairly recently, the Crimson Avenger (possibly the Lee Travis version) is a member of the [[Justice League Unlimited]].
