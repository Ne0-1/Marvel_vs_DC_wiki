'''Solo''' ('''James Bourne''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. He first appeared in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #19 (October [[1986]]). He was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Marc Silvestri]].

==Publication history==
Solo has had his own self-titled limited series.

==Fictional character biography==
Born in the USA, Solo works as a counter-terrorism operative, and makes limited appearances in the Marvel Comics universe. He is known for his [[catchphrase]], "While Solo lives, terror dies!"

One of Solo's more prominent appearances was during the [[Spider-Man]] storyline ''Revenge of the Sinister Six''. Soon after the Six reform and defeat both Spider-Man and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Solo aids the web-slinger in his second fight against the super villain team. Things take a turn for the worse when [[Mysterio]] uses an illusion to make Solo believe he is attacking the Six, when in reality he is attacking Spider-Man while the Six escape. Solo escapes and Spider-Man is rescued by [[Crimson Commando|Cyborg X]] and [[Deathlok]]. Soon after, Solo rejoins Spider-Man to aid him in a final assault on the Six aided by the Hulk, [[Ghost Rider (comics)#Daniel Ketch|Ghost Rider]], [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], [[Nova (comics)|Nova]], Deathlok and the [[Fantastic Four]]. With the villains defeated, Solo disappears.

Solo also once helped Spider-Man take on criminally-trained specialist versions of [[Captain America]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and Spiderman himself.

Later, Solo assists dozens of other heroes in battling a seemingly rampaging Wolverine (he was being mentally influenced). He confronts Wolverine, side-by-side with [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]]. Solo is swiftly defeated, suffering deep lacerations in the process. Cardiac is subdued with masonry.

In ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #7-12, Solo is hired by [[G. W. Bridge]] to join the new [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] alongside Hammer, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], and [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] in their mission to take down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Like Bridge and Hammer, Solo is captured and placed in suspended animation. He is eventually released.

===Civil War===
In Marvel Comics' 2006 [[fictional crossover|crossover]] [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Solo sides with other heroes who oppose registration, including [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]] and [[Typeface (comics)|Typeface]]. While waiting to make contact with the resistance led by [[Captain America]], Solo and the others are arrested by [[Iron Man]], [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], [[Wonder Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. He is shown in Civil War #6 siding with Captain America and his band of rebels.

Solo has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

Recently, Solo was hired along with [[Clay (comics)|Clay]], as bodyguards to protect Wally and Molly, cheery twins who sing Mutant hate-songs. They protected the kids from [[M (comics)|M]] and [[Siryn]], who tried to round to kids up in order to enforce the kids grandparents' court granted visitation rights.

==Powers and abilities==
Solo has somewhat limited [[teleportation]] abilities, allowing him to "jump" from place to place within a given area, and is a master of many forms of combat, and an expert marksman.
