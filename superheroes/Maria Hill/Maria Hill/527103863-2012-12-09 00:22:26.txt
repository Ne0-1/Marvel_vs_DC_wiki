'''Maria Hill''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. As the former director of the planetary defense/intelligence service [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], she appears in various storylines in which that organization figures prominently, which often feature the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] or members of that group, such as the late 2000s ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' and ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' miniseries, and the monthly ''[[Iron Man]]'' series, in which she was a prominent supporting character during the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" and "Stark Disassembled" storylines.

Maria Hill appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' portrayed by [[Cobie Smulders]].

==Publication history==
Maria Hill first appeared in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #4 (March 2005), and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].

[[Joe Quesada]], who was Marvel's editor-in-chief during her first appearance, describes the character thus: "[Hill] is such a strong personality, she's like a force of nature and quite frankly, while perhaps not immediately loved by all involved, she's certainly as strong and imposing a figure as Nick Fury. Right now I feel that people view her as the outsider but [while] I  don't think she’s any harsher than Fury has ever been, what's different is that we aren’t quite clear about her motives".{{deadlink|date=January 2012}}<ref>[[Quesada, Joe]]. [http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays12.html "Joe Fridays"]. [[Newsarama]].{{deadlink|date=January 2012}}</ref>

Maria Hill appeared as a supporting character in the 2010-2013 ''Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013), but only appeared sporadically after the first half of its run.

==Fictional character biography==
===Introduction===
Born in [[Chicago]]<ref>''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #5</ref> to a father who never failed to make his resentment of her survival and her mother's death in childbirth clear to her, upon reaching adulthood Hill first joins the United States armed forces, and later becomes an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Iron Man: World's Most Wanted''</ref> Hill has a brief stint in [[Madripoor]] that gets her noticed by various heads of state and government around the world.

After the scandalous affair of the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] and its disastrous effect on [[New York City]], S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]] goes into hiding. Maria Hill, viewed by the leaders of several nations as being both an efficient agent and, more importantly in their eyes, not directly loyal to Fury or any of his personal cadre, is appointed interim Executive Director. For a time, a [[Life Model Decoy]] of Fury is regularly used in public to maintain an illusion of normalcy within the Directorate's ranks. Hill is expected to be loyal to [[United States of America|United States]] interests before those of the [[United Nations]], which S.H.I.E.L.D. is supposed to serve before any other country. After she is named Director, Hill is confronted by Nick Fury one night.<ref>''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' #12</ref> He warns her that if she ever sees anything suspicious to use an LMD, referencing the coming Secret Invasion. He also warns her that if she does anything that he feels is wrong, then he will kill her.

Hill quickly establishes new policies on super-powered heroes, as requested by the [[President of the United States]] and his peers in other national governments: to end S.H.I.E.L.D. support for the heroes. These policies are in full effect when Hill tries to prevent the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] from re-forming following the breakout at the super-villain prison the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]]. However, [[Captain America]]'s champion status allows him to form any team he wants for any mission he sees fit, while [[Jessica Drew|Spider-Woman]]'s status as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent gives her access to any files that the Avengers may require. With these two situations meaning that the Avengers could operate independent of Hill's authority while retaining access to the relevant information they need to complete their mission of tracking down the Raft escapees, Hill is convinced to leave the situation alone. 

In the wake of events in the [[Savage Land]] the Avengers suspect Hill of being complicit in various crimes, but lack the evidence to prove her malfeasance. For her part, Hill has suspected the latest incarnation of the Avengers of harboring an illicit agenda in connection with, among other things, the "[[House of M]]" affair, to the point that she abducted [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] to question them about the situation even when dealing with the Collective.

She earns [[Iron Man]]'s respect when she ignores the [[President of the United States|President]]'s orders to nuke an island the Avengers were on at the time.

===''Civil War''===
In the 2006–2007 miniseries ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', [[Captain America]] refuses to assist Commander Hill in preparations to arrest any superheroes who refuses to comply with the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], seeing such activity as politically motivated, but Hill, arguing that Captain America must obey the will of the American people, attempts to arrest him. Captain America fights his way out of the [[Helicarrier]] and escapes.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Mark Millar]]|penciler=[[Steven McNiven]]|inker=[[Dexter Vines]]|title=Civil War|issue=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=July 2006}}</ref> After the Act passes into law, Hill is one of its leading enforcers. She blackmails [[Wonder Man]] into actively supporting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s crusade to hunt down the superheroes opposed to the Registration Act. She sends [[Kree]] supersoldier [[Noh-Varr]], already brainwashed, to capture the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]. She directs the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to capture [[Spider-Man]] after he goes rogue. The two Thunderbolts members sent out, [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], are slain by the [[Punisher]].{{issue|date=January 2012}} After foiling an attack on [[Stark Tower]], Hill admits to Tony Stark that she does not want her job as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and thinks she should not have been offered it in the first place. She suggests that the only other person besides [[Nick Fury]] who should lead the organization is Stark himself.{{issue|date=January 2012}} At the conclusion of the Civil War, the President of the United States appoints Tony Stark the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D., with a displeased Maria Hill his acting deputy director.<ref>''Civil War'' #7</ref>

===Deputy Director===
After being made Deputy Director, Maria Hill becomes a core member of Stark's S.H.I.E.L.D. cabinet and assists Stark in dealing with a sudden rise in various terrorist groups who have gained access to hyper-advanced biological weapons. Unlike the rest of the cabinet (including Sal Kennedy, whom she loathed personally), Hill remains skeptical of a single conspiracy behind all these attacks.<ref>''Iron Man, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #15</ref> When the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s neoplastic tumor began infecting the Helicarrier, Hill organizes the evacuation; she (wrongly) believed the infection is the main objective of the attack.<ref>''Iron Man, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #18</ref> Subsequently, however, Hill becomes much more trusting in Stark's leadership, a trusted agent in her role as Deputy Director, and far less bound by conventional process, particularly after a confrontation with Dum Dum Dugan, in which he forces her to confront the fact that she was apparently willing to take actions that would allow innocent people to die while still sticking to "the book" because the alternative was to disobey orders.<ref>''Iron Man'' #26</ref> She eventually risks her career by locking down the [[United Nations]] under S.H.I.E.L.D. martial law so Stark can escape a tribunal going against him and track down the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #28</ref>

===2008 - 2010 storylines===
During the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, after the Helicarrier is disabled by [[Skrull]] invaders, Hill, who is left in charge in Stark's absence, confronts a number of extraterrestrial Skrulls, [[shapeshifter]]s who can assume the appearance of anyone or anything, who are revealed to have replaced [[Edwin Jarvis]] and a number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<ref>Secret Invasion #4</ref> The Skrulls execute Hill, but this "Hill" is revealed to be a [[Life Model Decoy]] of Hill. Hill then activates the Helicarrier's self-destruct system, killing all the Skrull infiltrators on board, escaping via jet pack.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5</ref>

In the aftermath of the Skrull Invasion's failure, during the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, S.H.I.E.L.D is disbanded by the President, and Hill and Tony Stark lose their jobs, replaced by the newly appointed director [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] who then reforms the fallen S.H.I.E.L.D. into [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]]<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> In the ''Iron Man'' monthly series, Hill tries to go about having a normal life but Osborn dispatches H.A.M.M.E.R. to arrest her for theft. She joins her former boss, Tony Stark, as a fugitive after he stole the Superhuman Registration Database. The night before Tony leaves the two finally give in to the sexual tension that had been brewing for some time.{{issue|date=January 2012}} Hill is sent on a mission by Tony to retrieve a hard drive. Hill finds the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] holed up in the basement of Futurepharm, hooked into a large machine holding many people in containers. She barely manages to escape him, before downloading the data Tony sent her for. The skirmish with the Controller would leave her in a state of paranoia for a while. She then enlists the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] to deliver the data to [[Bucky|Captain America]], all the while evading H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. However, they are captured when H.A.M.M.E.R. intercepts an e-mail from Stark. They are rescued by Pepper Potts, disguised as Madame Masque.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #11-18</ref>

During the 2010 "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" storyline, Hill comes to the aid of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] after Osborn launches an attack on him and his home of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Siege'' #3</ref> Hill becomes a supporting cast member in the Iron Man series, protecting him and his friends from multiple threats. <ref>"Invincible Iron Man" #20-28 (2008-2009)</ref> In the 2010 "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline, which followed "Siege", Hill is appointed by Captain Steve Rogers to work with a new team of Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.4 #1</ref>
