The '''Spot''' ('''Dr. Johnathon Ohnn''') is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  He was created by [[Al Milgrom]] and [[Herb Trimpe]], and first appeared in ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #98.

==Character history==
[[Image:Spiderspot.png|thumbnail|left|130px|Cover to ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #99. Art by Herb Trimpe.]]
As a scientist working for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Dr. Johnathon Ohnn was assigned to reproduce the radiation levels of the superhero [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] to find a way to artificially mimic his powers.  While working late one night, he succeeded, creating a solid black circular [[Portal (fiction)|portal]].  In doing so, however, the drain on the city's power became so great, a [[blackout]] washed over the city, causing the portal to shimmer and destabilize.  Fearful of losing a once in a lifetime opportunity, Ohnn stepped into it; the shock of the transition caused him to pass out.

He awoke floating weightlessly in a dimension which he initially assumed was Cloak's dark dimension.  He soon realized however that the power shortage caused the portal to send him to a different dimension, a place of half darkness and half light.  A seemingly infinite number of portals surrounded him in this place.  Making swimming motions, he managed to find the original portal that brought him there and slipped back through it.

When Ohnn emerged back into his lab, his body had undergone a radical transformation.  The portals from the other dimension had adhered to his skin, covering him with black spots from head to toe.  Realizing the spots were portable space warps, he started to think he might be able to use them to defeat anyone in battle.  When [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] arrived to confront the Kingpin, he appeared before them and announced himself as the Spot.  Spider-Man collapsed on the [[roof]], laughing at the name.  The Spot ended up winning that first confrontation and warned the heroes to leave the Kingpin alone.  He later lost a second battle against Spider-Man because he was tricked into throwing too many of his spots as weapons and not keeping enough to defend himself with.

Later, the Spot formed a short-lived team with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], and [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo II]] called the Spider-Man Revenge Squad, which was better known as the [[Legion of Losers]]. This team fell apart when Spider-Man carted the Spot and the Kangaroo to jail for bank robbery.

The Spot also appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' series, in which he helped [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] escape from a maximum security [[prison]].  As thanks, Tombstone snapped his neck. Because the ''Tangled Web'' series is considered to exist outside of the normal Spider-Man [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], it is still possible the Spot will be seen again in one of the current Spider-Man titles.

He recently appeared in issue 26 of Wolverine during Mark Millar's run, he was killed by [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] and a group of Hand ninjas during a meeting with Slyde, 'The Teflon coated man', in a plot teaming [[HYDRA|Hydra]], The Hand and the mutant group 'Dawn of the White Light' to end all life on earth. He was resurrected by The Hand and joined an assault on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] hellicarrier which resulted in its destruction. He was killed by Wolverine as were most of the super-villains and heroes [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]] were using in the attack, although having died once before, his death remains questionable.

==Powers and abilities==
Using his space warps, the Spot can instantly move himself or any part of his body from one area to another over a theoretically unlimited distance.  

The Spot can control and manipulate the warps to almost any degree he wishes.  He can expand or shrink them to any size, or he can join together multiple spots to form one larger warp.  The spots are unaffected by gravity and can be placed against a surface or left suspended in mid-air.  He can also designate which spots will lead to the spot dimension from those that will instantly lead to another location in this dimension.  He can create new spots, or close them entirely by retreating into his dimension and pulling the warp in behind him (making a quiet "poit" sound).

By concentrating, he can also revert to his human appearance.  When doing this, the spots merge to form one large black void in his chest, though this is easily covered with a shirt.

His preferred method of attack is to surround his opponent with numerous spots, allowing him to punch or kick them from unexpected angles across great distances.  This proved very effective against Spider-Man as his spider-sense was unable to detect incoming attacks from another dimension, effectively negating this ability.  The same phenomenon was true when Spot flung Spider-Man through a warp and he reappeared in this dimension too close to a wall to dodge.  He can also move the spots on his body to protect himself from physical attack by positioning one in the path of a punch or kick, causing the attack to pass harmlessly through a warp.

The Spot appears in an episode of ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. In this episode, Jonathon Ohn is fired from his work by Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]) for Ohn's work involves creating dimensional portals. Since the events of the episodes '''[[Venom Returns]]''' and '''Carnage''', Stark thought it would be best if Ohn's work were shut down.

[[Kingpin (comics)|The Kingpin]] locates Ohn, pretending to be appreciate Ohn's job of creating portals, and gives him a job with a woman whom he loves, Dr. Silvia Lopez. As weeks pass, Ohn and Lopez finish their work but Ohn falls into one of his portals, becoming the Spot when a whole group of portals attached to him.  He can create portals with his mind. The Kingpin was frustrated with Ohn and considered him and Lopez very vague. The Spot used his portal-creating abilities to rob banks and jewelry stores to get more money to fund his research.  He then deduces that he works for a criminal like the Kingpin and wants to take over the empire. However, the Kingpin uses Lopez to have the Spot capture and kill Spider-Man.  The Spot confronts Spider-Man but the hero defeats him. Spider-Man is aware that if the Spot fails, Lopez would die and the two start to work together. In a battle to defeat the Kingpin, Ohn opens a portal that grows so big it had the potential to engulf the Earth, starting with New York City. Spider-Man, the Spot, Lopez and Kingpin work together to take down the portal. However, the Spot cannot completely close the portal from the outside. He jumps in but not before Lopez expresses her love for him. They were both sucked in. He is voiced by [[Oliver Muirhead]]. 

An alternate reality version of the Spot appears in part one of the [[Spider Wars|series finale]] in a cameo as Dr. Ohn, when the [[Scarlet Spider]] explains the origin of Spider-Carnage. In this reality, Ohn works for the Kingpin and accidentally releases the Carnage symbiote through one of his portals.
