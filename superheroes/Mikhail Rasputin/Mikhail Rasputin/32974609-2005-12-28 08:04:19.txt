'''Mikhail Nikolaievitch Rasputin''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] from [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Uncanny X-Men]]. He is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] and the brother of the [[X-Men| X-Men's]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and the [[New Mutants| New Mutant's]] [[Magik (comics)|Magik]]. He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #285. Mikhail is a cold calculating villain in the marvel universe, who cares little about the lives of those who stand in his way, and even those who serve him, he is a rather merciless character. He sometimes collaborates his efforts with other villains such as [[Omega Red]], [[Apocalypse]], and [[Mister Sinister]]. 

==History==

The fact that Colossus had an older brother was first revealed in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #99.  He was a Russian [[Cosmonaut]] and was believed dead after his a faulty mission where his [[space shuttle]] exploded. However, it was later discovered that the explosion was set up by the government who learned of Mikhail's powers and wanted to exploit them without the family's interaction. 

Mikhail made his first actual appearance in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #285. His superiors sent him into a void, counting on his powers to keep him and his comrades safe, to see what was on the other side. He found a world, although he was the only survivor of his crew.  He soon became a [[messiah]]-like figure and found himself embroiled in a civil war.  The X-Men happen to end up on the same planet and tell Mikhail that he has to close the void before it destroys both this world and their home.  However, having had one failed attempt that killed many, Mikhail was apprehensive to try it again.  With the help of [[Sunfire]], [[Iceman]], and [[Jean Grey]] they succeed and are transported home where next he appeared with the Morlocks.

Tragically, after Mikhail set himself up as leader of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], the tunnel-dwelling mutants beneath [[New York City]], he massacred nearly all of them by flooding the tunnels in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #293. He did, however, survive, as seen in the second ''Storm'' [[limited series]], along with [[Callisto]] the former leader of the band of outcasts and a group of Morlocks who later descended to form [[Gene Nation]]. In this world where time moves faster than normal, Mikhail had established a citadel for himself on the top of a massive hill. The [[Charles Darwin| Darwinian]] philosopy of "survival of the fittest" was the only thing which governed the society. If someone could reach the summit of the hill they were considered "fit" and worthy of being part of Gene Nation. Mikhail was forced to transport [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and the Gene Nationals back to Earth, but he escaped once more (presumably back to the Hill) ranting about his benefactor being displeased with him. Storm then transported all of the Gene Nationals to a dying village in [[Africa]] where they would eke out a new life for themselves. It was discovered that Mikhail was working for the [[Dark Beast]] to try and propogate a group of elite warriors. 

Distraught by the death of his little sister [[Magik| Illyana]] by the [[Legacy Virus]], Mikhail decided to do something. In the [[limited series]] ''New Mutants: Truth or Death'' Mikhail goes back and exposes his sister to the virus when she is in her aged form, thinking that with her [[black magic| magical abilities]] it would shield her from harm and help her to build an [[immunity]]. It was later revealed that Mikhail himself was suffering from the disease and was also trying to rid his body of the fatal virus. However, his plan backfired and Illyana contracted the disease, her brother having been the one to administer it to her.

Most recently in the ''Colossus: Bloodline'' mini-series, Mikhail has made a reappearance and this time has allied himself with [[Mister Sinister| Sinister]]. The two are attempting to assassinate all of the members of the Rasputin family but one, so that the spirit of their forefather [[Grigory Rasputin]] may be concentrated and [[reincarnation| reincarnated]] in the last remaining member of the [[lineage]].

==Powers and abilities==

Mikhail's powers have always been rather ambiguous and have never fully been explained. In various appearances he is shown to be able to manipulate the substance of matter, allowing him to fire destructive blasts and teleport through space and dimensions. 

==Appearances in other media==

In the [[video game]] [[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]], Mikhail is the second of the '''Four Horsemen of Apocalypse''' that you encounter.  His appearance is more reminescent of his character in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline from [[Marvel comics]] than his traditional look.

===Alternate versions===

Mikhail served Apocalypse, as one of his four horsemen during [[Age Of Apocalypse]]. The land that was delegated to him is a significant portion of mid-eastern [[North America]].
