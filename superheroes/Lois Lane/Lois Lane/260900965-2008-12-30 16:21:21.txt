'''Lois Joanne Lane-Kent''' is the primary love interest of Superman in the [[DC Comics]]’ ''[[Superman]]'' stories.  Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], she [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 (1938). Lois' physical appearance was originally based on a [[model (person)|model]] hired by Siegel and Shuster named Joanne Carter, who would later marry Siegel. Lois's personality was based on [[Torchy Blane]], a female reporter featured in a series of films from the 1930s. Siegel took her name from actress [[Lane Sisters|Lola Lane]], who portrayed Torchy in one of the middle entries.<ref>TIME Magazine, May 30, 1988, Letters to the Editor, P. 6-7)</ref> 

Lois is Superman's chief romantic interest and, in the current DC [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], his wife.  Like Superman's [[alter ego]] [[Clark Kent]], she is a [[journalism|reporter]] for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper, ''The [[Daily Planet]]''. 

Depictions of Lois Lane have varied since her character was created in 1938, spanning the 70-year history of Superman [[comic books]] and other media adaptations.  During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], she was the star of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]],'' a comic title that had a light and frivolous tone.  However, the original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] version of Lois, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portray Lois as a tough-as-nails [[journalist]] and intellectual equal to Superman. One thing has remained throughout the character's 70-year history, however: she has always been the most prominent love-interest in Superman's life and is seen by many fans as the archetypical comic book love interest.

==Profile==
Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years (depending on the comic writers' handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time), but in most incarnations she has been depicted as a determined, strong-willed person, whether it involves beating her rival reporter [[Clark Kent]] to a story or (in what became a trademark of 1950s and 1960s era Superman stories) alternating between elaborate schemes to convince Superman to marry her and proving to others her suspicion that Clark was in reality Superman.  She also traditionally had a cool attitude toward Clark, who in her view paled in comparison to his alter ego.  At times, the character has been portrayed as a [[damsel in distress]].

Lois Lane was modeled on Lola Lane, an actress in the 1930s who appeared in films like ''Public Stenographer''. Lois is regarded as attractive, but not in the exaggerated "[[supermodel]]" sense often seen in superhero comics' depictions of women{{Fact|date=February 2008}}. Her appearance has varied over the years, depending either on current fashion or (especially more recently) the way she's depicted in contemporary media adaptations; for instance, in the mid-1990s, when the series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois and Clark]]'' began airing, Lois received a hair cut that made her look more like [[Teri Hatcher]], and her eyes were typically violet to match the Lois of the television [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' after that show began airing. Traditionally, Lois has black hair, though for a period from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, Lois was depicted with brown hair in the comics. She started with red hair in the original Sunday papers{{Fact|date=February 2008}}.

Lois is the daughter of Ellen and [[Sam Lane]].  In the earlier comics, her parents were [[farmer]]s in a town called Pittsdale; the modern comics, however, depict Sam as a retired soldier, and Lois as a former "[[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|army brat]]", born at [[Ramstein Air Base]] with Lois having been trained by her father in areas such as hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms.  Lois also has one younger sibling, her sister [[Lucy Lane]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] | penciller = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] | inker = [[John Beatty (illustrator)|Beatty, John]] | story = The Power That Failed! | title = Superman | volume = 2 | issue = 19 | date = July 1988 | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | page = 2 | panel = 6 }}</ref>

In most versions of Superman, Lois is shown to be a crack investigative reporter, one of the best in the city and certainly the best at the newspaper she works at. However, despite such brilliance, she has long been unable to see through Clark's rather primitive disguise of glasses and figure out that he is Superman--despite being the character who is most up close and personal with both Superman and Clark. This contradiction is seldom mentioned, but played for humor when it is.

In the current comics, [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|Lois is married to Clark Kent]] (and aware of his [[secret identity]]), but has kept her [[maiden name]] for professional purposes.

==Fictional character biography==
The comics have seen several incarnations of Lois Lane over the decades.

===Golden Age===
[[Image:Superman27.PNG|thumb|240px|The Golden Age Lois Lane and Superman, from the cover of ''Superman'' #27 (March-April 1944). Pencils by [[Wayne Boring]].]]
In the earliest [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was featured as an aggressive, career-minded reporter for the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'' (the paper's name was changed to ''The Daily Planet'' in the early 1940s), who, after Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, found herself attracted to Superman, but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent.  Starting in the late 1940s or early 1950s comics, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman, and started to make various attempts at uncovering his [[secret identity]], all of which backfired (usually thanks to Superman's efforts). 

In the Golden Age comics, Lois also had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated [[tall tales]] and fibs to adult.  Susie's last appearance was in 1955; subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

After DC instituted its [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity, it was deemed that the Lois of the Golden Age comics (i.e., comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) lived on the parallel world of "Earth-Two" versus the then-mainstream ([[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]]) universe of "Earth-One."  In 1978's ''Action Comics'' #484, it was revealed that sometime in the 1950s, the Earth-Two Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old [[Justice Society of America]] enemy, the Wizard), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted.  Clark and Lois began to date each other, and were soon married; however, during the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman, and after recruiting the aid of the Wizard, restored Clark's memory.  A series of stories in the 1970s and 1980s titled "Mr. and Mrs. Superman" presented the further adventures of the now-married Lois and Clark (in several of which Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character). 

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seen for one of the final times, as she, the [[Kal-L|Earth-Two Superman]], and the [[Earth Prime|Earth-Prime]] [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] are taken by [[Earth-Three]]'s [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] (who himself was the son of Earth-Three's Lois Lane, who had perished, along with her husband Alexander Luthor, Sr., in the first issue of the series) into a paradise-like dimension at the end of the story (after all the parallel Earths, including Earth-Two, had been eliminated in favor of just one Earth), after which this version of Lois was (seemingly) permanently discarded from DC's continuity.

In 2005's [[Infinite Crisis]] miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr. and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis [[DC Universe]] from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her [[octogenarian]] status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-2, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-2, however, Lois Lane died in the arms of Superman in ''Infinite Crisis'' #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he couldn't let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]] at the end of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois's final words- "''It's... not... going...''"- as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]]'s, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.

===Silver Age===
When the reading audience of [[comic book]]s became predominately young boys in the mid-to-late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward [[science fiction]]-inspired plots involving [[extraterrestrials]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures and bizarre, often contrived, plots.  Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival [[Lana Lang]] for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, and tricking or otherwise forcing Superman into marriage.  Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that she could be trusted not to keep his secret identity hidden, and that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies (Of course, this ignored the fact that his romantic relationship with her was already public knowledge.  This change in Lois' personality from her earlier 1940s self might also be a result of American society's attitudes toward women and their societal roles in the 1950s. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era -- to other characters such as [[Batman]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]].  She also married a convicted criminal on death row (and various Superman pastiches). All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during this decade, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC's title ''Showcase'' in 1957, DC created an on-going title for the character, titled ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' beginning in March 1958 and running for 137 issues until September 1974.  Most of these placed an emphasis on Lois' romance with Superman, and were drawn by artist [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]; indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lois became cited by many{{Fact|date=February 2008}} as the "definitive" version of Lois, and he was often asked by DC editor [[Mort Weisinger]] to redraw other artists' depictions of Lois Lane in other DC titles where she appeared.

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society changed, Lois' character changed as well.  Stories in the 1970s depicted her as fully capable and less reliant on Superman.  She engaged in more solo adventures without Superman being involved, and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity.  For example, in her solo stories in ''Superman Family'' (an [[anthology]] title started in the mid-1970s after the cancellation of ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' and ''Superman's Pal, [[Jimmy Olsen]]''), Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian [[martial arts|martial art]] of [[Klurkor]], taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle-city of [[Kandor]]<ref> Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #78</ref>. 

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', writer and artist [[John Byrne]] revised the Superman legend, and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity; before this happened, a final non-canonical "imaginary story" ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'' was written by writer [[Alan Moore]], meant as a send-off for the "pre-Crisis" versions of the characters, including Lois.

===Modern Age===
[[Image:loislane.png|150px|left|thumb|Lois Lane, as she appears on the cover of ''The Man of Steel'' (miniseries) #2 (1986).  Pencils by [[John Byrne]].]]
Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which completely rewrote Superman's origin and history.  In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing.  She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive. 

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with Superman (though she may have harbored a slight crush at first).  One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship.  In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent.

A more superficial change was made to Lois's hair. From 1987 into the late 1990s, the feisty reporter's hair was brown.

[[Image:Lois_Lane_on_the_cover_of_Superman_(second_series)-11_(November_1987)_.jpg|Lois with her new brown hair. Cover to Superman Vol. 2, No. 11 (Nov. 1987)]]

In this new revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary.  Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview, but she eventually became his best friend.  Lois' first real relationship in this version was with [[Gangbuster|Jose Delgado]], a Metropolis vigilante whose legs are shattered in a battle with a [[Lexcorp]] cyborg/human hybrid gone amok.  Delgado eventually recovered.  He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, mainly due to Clark and Lois becoming much closer as friends.

Following Clark's brief rampage under the influence of [[The Eradicator]], Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for "selling out" to [[Blaze and Satanus|Collin Thornton]] and running [[Newstime Magazine]], but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to "''grovel for his job back.''" Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her.  The two became a couple, and eventually Lois accepted a proposal of marriage.  Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.

DC had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #75.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}  However, with the then-upcoming television show ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}  Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a [[battle royal]] with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].  After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the mermaid [[Lori Lemaris]]).  Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her.  When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits, and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been recently depleted, and that he was her editor (due to Perry White's cancer).  Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief, Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

In 1996, coinciding with the ''Lois and Clark'' television program, Lois and Clark were finally wed in the one-shot special ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'', which featured the work of nearly every then-living artist who had ever worked on Superman.  The ''Wedding Album'' itself, however, was forced to spend part of its opening pages accommodating and reconciling the then-current comic storyline of Lois and Clark having broken off their engagement (the television program's producers had failed to provide adequate lead time for the ''Superman'' comics' writers).{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Since their marriage, Clark and Lois' continue to remain one of the stronger relationships in most comic series.  In 2007, the couple recently took the 'next step' in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they name [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]].  The boy is discovered to be the son of [[Jor-El]]'s arch-foe, [[General Zod]].  Although initially uneasy about raising a super-powered boy, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being 'Mommy Lois'.  However, following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the Phantom Zone rift, trapping himself inside with Zod's forces, leaving Lois without her son.

When the [[Titans Tomorrow]] arrive at the Kent's apartment in order to kidnap Superman, Lois is knocked out, bound and gagged, and hidden in the couple's bedroom. Before Clark can untie her, he is ambushed and beaten into submission by the Titans.

In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lois and Perry are caught in an explosion triggered by [[Clayface]] destroying the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and apparently Lois is seriously injured or possibly even dead.  In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating.  Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he is to save his wife's life.  The story is continued in the [[Stereoscopy|3D]] tie-in comic "''Superman Beyond"''. The lastest news is the mysterious phantom was revealed to be Lois Lane, who is trapped in the Phantom Zone, thanks to Lana and Lex working together.

==Other versions==
During the years (1942-1985) that [[Editora Brasil-América]] (EBAL), and the [[Editora Abril]] published the Brazilian versions of Superman comics, Lois Lane's name was translated to "Miriam Lane" and later to "Miriam Lois Lane".

===''Kingdom Come''===

In the [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' (now Earth-22 in the [[DC Multiverse]]), flashbacks reveal that ten years prior to the story's beginning, the Joker murdered ninety-three people in the Daily Planet, and Lois was the only woman in that body count. While her face is never shown in any of the flashbacks, her body is seen hunched over her desk.

In the ''[[Justice Society of America]] Kingdom Come Special: Superman'' by [[Alex Ross]], the fate of Earth-22's Lois was fully revealed. She actually survived the Joker Venom by wearing a gas mask and tried to fight the Joker with a fire extinguisher, only to be bashed in the head with her Daily Planet paperweight. By the time Superman got to the Planet building she was still alive, but dying from an unrepairable wound. Lois's dying words were thanks for Superman's love for her, and telling him not to cross the line by becoming a killer, or to lose Clark Kent. She died in her husband's arms.<ref>''Justice Society of America Kingdom Come Special: Superman''</ref>

===''All Star Superman''===

In 2005, DC launched a new ''[[All Star Superman]]'' comic series by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]]. The series takes place outside normal DC continuity.  In this storyline, they are not married, and although Superman revealed his secret identity to Lois in issue #2, she didn't believe him.  At the end of the issue, Superman (who believed he was dying) presents Lois with a super-powered chemical and a superhero costume and Lois Lane becomes [[Superwoman]] for 24 hours.  {{-}}

===Tangent Comics===
In one of the possible origins for the Green Lantern of Earth-9. Lois Lane is shown to be an archaeologist, explorer and adventurer who is murdered by billionaire playboy, Booster Gold, for trying to protect a group of Sea Devils, eventually being resurrected as the Green Lantern.

==In other media==
===Radio and animation===
*Actress [[Rollie Bester]] originated the role of Lois Lane for a [[Superman (radio)|radio series]] with [[Bud Collyer]] as Superman in the 1940s. Other actresses to lend their voice to the character were [[Helen Choate]] and [[Joan Alexander]]. Joan Alexander would also voice the character for a series of [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman theatrical cartoons]] for [[Fleischer Studios]] (1941-1943) as well as a 1960s animated television series.

*Lois has also made some appearances in ''[[Super Friends]]'' and its sequel series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]''.

*Actress [[Dana Delany]] played Lois Lane in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' animated television series of the 1990s and in the character's subsequent appearances on ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' and its successor ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', all of which are a part of the [[DC animated universe]].  In this version, series creator [[Bruce Timm]] and character designer James Tucker reinvented Lois more like her original comic counterpart, in that at first her relationship with Clark was very much a rivalry about which was the better reporter, and she would at times actively attempt to trick him out of stories, but Lois eventually learns to respect Clark, and in episodes like "The Late Mr. Kent", takes a faked death of Clark significantly hard, admitting to Superman (unaware he is Clark) that she regretted never telling her rival she respected and loved him as a person and a reporter.  At first, Lois was skeptical about Superman, but she grew closer to him throughout the series.  She previously dated Lex Luthor before she broke off the relationship.  Lois also had a relationship with Gotham City's Wayne Enterprises CEO [[Bruce Wayne]], but it didn't last after Lois discovers that he is the infamous masked vigilantee Batman. Superman and Lois did not share their first kiss until the final moments  of "Legacy", ''Superman'''s last episode (although Lois had kissed an alternate version of Superman in "''Brave New Metropolis''").  Superman and Lois are shown to be dating by the time of ''Justice League Unlimited''.  In the episode "Divided We Fall", the writers planned to have Superman reveal his secret identity to Lois, but the decision was reportedly vetoed by DC.

*Dana Delany reprises her role as Lois in Season 5 of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. She, along with [[Jimmy Olsen]], are in [[Gotham City]] reporting on [[Superman]]'s visit to deliver a check from Metropolis, when [[Metallo]] attacks Superman. She and Jimmy follow the fight to the junkyard where she takes a picture of Superman with Batman after defeating Metallo. Back in Metropolis, she is kidnapped by [[Clayface]] and [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] for [[Lex Luthor]] to infuriate Superman. After being rescued, Lois tells Superman that Black Mask was working with Luthor. Superman leaves to confront Luthor.

*Actress [[Anne Heche]] plays Lois Lane in the 2007 WB Animation DVD ''[[Superman: Doomsday]].'' The animated feature is based from the award-winning DC Comics storyline ''[[The Death of Superman]]'' trilogy, with [[Adam Baldwin]] as The Man of Steel and [[James Marsters]] as Lex Luthor. In this story, Lois is shown as being in a relationship with Superman, but is only 'unofficially' aware of his identity as Clark Kent; she reveals to Martha Kent after his death while fighting Doomsday that she knew about his secret identity, but he never told her himself. After the climatic battle with his insane clone, Superman and Lois reconcile and renew their relationship, with Superman finally officially revealing his identity to her.

* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] voices Lois Lane in WB Animation feature ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''.

===Broadway musical===
*Actress Patricia Marand played Lois Lane in Broadway [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's a Superman]]'' in 1966. For her performance she was nominated for Broadway's 1966 [[Tony Award]] as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Musical).

*Actress [[Lesley Ann Warren]] portrayed Lois in the television production of ''It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Superman'' in 1975 opposite [[David Wilson]]. She was also among the many actresses who auditioned for the role opposite [[Christopher Reeve]] for the 1978 film ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]].''
 
===Live-action films===
*Actress [[Margot Kidder]] played Lois Lane against Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent in the 1970s and 1980s films ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'', ''[[Superman II]]'', ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]''. Her role in ''[[Superman III]]'' was greatly reduced, however, due to a conflict with the producers of the film.  Kidder also appeared briefly in two episodes of the television program ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' as [[Bridgette Crosby|Dr. Bridgette Crosby]], an emissary of Dr. Swann (played by Christopher Reeve), but declined to make a third appearance after Reeve's death because she felt it would be doing his memory a disservice.

*Actress [[Kate Bosworth]] played Lois Lane in the 2006 Bryan Singer-directed film ''[[Superman Returns]]''.  In this version, she has given birth to a son named Jason White, who is later revealed to be Superman's son. The film's continuity is semi-sequel to that of ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', so Bosworth's Lois could be considered similar to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane but with differences.

===Live-action television===
*Actress [[Noel Neill]] played Lois Lane in more venues and instances than any other actress. She played the role in the 1948 and 1950 Saturday movie serials with [[Kirk Alyn]] playing Clark Kent/Superman. She returned to the role in the second season of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television program opposite [[George Reeves]] and had a cameo in the 1978 film ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' as Lois Lane's mother.  She was later a guest star in ''[[Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' alongside [[Jack Larson]] ([[Jimmy Olsen]]) as an office worker at the ''Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters''. She also has a role in the [[Bryan Singer]]-directed film ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

*Actress [[Phyllis Coates]] played Lois Lane in the theatrical feature ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'' opposite [[George Reeves]] as Superman and continued in the role in the first season of the ''Adventures of Superman'' television program. She also portrayed Ellen Lane, the socialite divorcee mother of Lois Lane in the first season of the 1990s television program ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois and Clark]]''.

*Actress [[Teri Hatcher]] played Lois Lane on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois and Clark]]'' for four seasons, starting in 1993, with the two leading characters getting married during its run; this is the first television or film series that showed Lois and Clark's romance fully realized. When Teri Hatcher hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', she participated in a sketch where she pretended not to recognize well-known ''SNL'' cast members who joined her on stage when they wore glasses, poking fun at the fact that Lois Lane never seemed to realize that Clark Kent is just Superman wearing glasses.

** The 1998 episode [[The Cartoon (Seinfeld episode)|"The Cartoon"]] has Jerry make fun of Elaine's drawings, leading her to reply: "It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane."   
** In [[The Strong Box (Seinfeld episode)|"The Strong Box"]] (also 1998), Elaine dates a man whose mysterious ways lead Jerry to joke that he is a crimefighter protecting his secret identity.

** In a 1994 episode, "The Marine Biologist", when Elaine accuses Jerry of helping a strange woman just so he can take her out on a date, Jerry replies that Superman is never suspected of such intentions when saving a woman's life, prompting Elaine to comment "Well, you're not Superman", to which Jerry responds, "Well, you're not Lois Lane..."
