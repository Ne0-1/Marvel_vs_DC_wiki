'''Lois Lane''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], the character first appeared in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938). Lois is an award-winning journalist and the primary love interest of [[Superman]]. For fifteen years in DC Comics [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], she was also his wife. Like Superman's alter ego [[Clark Kent]], she is a reporter for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper, the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.

The character was created from many influences. Her physical appearance was originally based on [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]], a model hired by Superman co-creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and Siegel's future wife. Jerry Siegel based Lois's personality on the fictional reporter [[Torchy Blane]]—a gutsy, beautiful, and headline-hunting reporter, portrayed by [[Glenda Farrell]] in a series of 1930s films. Siegel took the character's name from [[Lane Sisters|Lola Lane]], who played Torchy Blane on one occasion.<ref>Letters to the Editor, ''Time'' magazine (May 30, 1988), pp. 6–7.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Joanne|url= http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics.php?topic=articles/lois-lane|title= The True Inspiration for Lois Lane|publisher= Superman Home Page|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150721154956/http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics.php?topic=articles/lois-lane|archivedate= July 21, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate= July 19, 2015}}</ref> Lois was also influenced by the real life journalist [[Nellie Bly]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Farghaly |first=Nadine|title =Examining Lois Lane: The Scoop on Superman's Sweetheart.|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press, Inc.]]|year=2013 |isbn= 0810892375 |page= 45}}</ref>

Depictions of Lois Lane have varied since her character was created in 1938, spanning the entire history of [[Superman comics]] and other media adaptations. During the [[Silver Age of Comics]], she was the star of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'', a comics series that had a light and frivolous tone. The original [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a tough-as-nails [[journalist]] and intellectual equal to Superman. Throughout the character's long history, she has always remained the most prominent love interest in Superman's life, and is considered the archetype comic book love interest.

==Publication history==

Lois Lane made her debut in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938) in the first published Superman story.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1930s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 20 |quote = Lois Lane was established early...but she rejected Clark [Kent] as a 'spineless, unbearable coward.'}}</ref> Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years, depending on the comic book writers' handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time. In most incarnations she has been depicted as a determined, strong-willed person, whether it involves beating her rival reporter Clark Kent to a story, or, in what became a trademark of 1950s/1960s era Superman stories, alternating between elaborate schemes to convince Superman to marry her or attempting to expose and prove to others her suspicion that Clark Kent was in reality Superman. Lois traditionally had an disinterested attitude toward Clark Kent, who in her view pales in comparison to his alter ego Superman. At times, the character has been portrayed as a [[damsel in distress]].

Lois's appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion, or media adaptations. For instance, in the mid-1990s, when the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' began airing, Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress [[Teri Hatcher]], and her eyes were typically violet to match her character on the animated television series ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', after that show began airing. Traditionally, the character has black hair, though for a period from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, Lois was depicted with reddish brown hair in the comics.
 
Lois Lane is the daughter of Ellen (alternately Ella) and [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]]. In the earlier comics, her parents were farmers in a town called Pittsdale;<ref name="loislane13">{{cite comic| writer= [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Bernstein, Robert]] | penciller= [[Kurt Schaffenberger|Schaffenberger, Kurt]]| inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt| story= Introducing ...

Lois has one younger sibling, her sister [[Lucy Lane]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | penciller = Byrne, John| inker = [[John Beatty (illustrator)|Beatty, John]] | story = The Power That Failed! | title = [[Superman vol. 2|Superman]] | volume = 2 | issue = 19 | date = July 1988 | publisher = DC Comics | page = 2 | panel = 6 }}</ref>

In most versions of Superman, Lois is shown to be a crack investigative reporter, one of the best in the city and certainly the best at the newspaper she works at. In the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] and particularly in the [[Silver Age (comics)|Silver Age]] stories, Lois suspects that Clark Kent is Superman; however, Superman thwarted Lois' suspicions. While this was sometimes played for humor, stories since the 1970s greatly decreased Lois' interest in Superman's secret identity.

Lois has been shown occasionally obtaining superpowers and becoming a superhero. Some of her superhero identities include [[Superwoman]] and [[Red Tornado]] of [[Earth-Two#Reimagined: Earth 2 in The New 52|Earth 2]].

The comics have seen several incarnations of Lois Lane over the decades.

===Golden Age===

In the earliest [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was featured as an aggressive, career minded reporter for the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'' (the paper's name was changed to the ''Daily Planet'' in ''Action Comics'' #23 in 1940). After Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, Lois found herself attracted to Superman, but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent. Starting as early as the early 1940s, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]]| penciller= [[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]]| inker= [[John Sikela|Sikela, John]] | story= Man Or Superman?| title= [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]| issue= 17 | date= July–August 1942}}</ref> and started to make various attempts at uncovering his [[secret identity]], all of which backfired usually thanks to Superman's efforts.

Lois gained her first solo series of stories (without Superman) starting with ''Superman'' #28 (May–June 1944).

In the Golden Age comics, Lois had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated [[tall tale]]s and fibs to adults.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry| penciller= Sikela, John| inker= [[Ed Dobrotka|Dobrotka, Ed]]| story= Cinderella – a la Superman| title= Action Comics | issue= 59| date= April 1943}}</ref> Susie's last appearance was in ''Superman'' #95 (February 1955).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[William Woolfolk|Woolfolk, Bill]]| penciller= [[Wayne Boring|Boring, Wayne]]| inker= [[Stan Kaye|Kaye, Stan]]| story= Susie's Enchanted Isle| title= Superman| issue= 95| date= February 1955}}</ref> Subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

===Earth-Two version===
DC instituted its [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity, and introduced the [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #73 (August 1969).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]| penciller= [[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]| inker= [[Sid Greene|Greene, Sid]]| story= Star Light, Star Bright—Death Star I See Tonight!| title= [[Justice League of America]]| issue= 73| date= August 1969}}</ref> This [[retcon]] declared the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane stories (i.e. comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) as having taken place on the parallel world of "[[Earth-Two]]" versus the then mainstream ([[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]) universe of "Earth-One." In ''Action Comics'' #484 (June 1978), a flashback story reveals Earth-Two's Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old [[Justice Society of America]] enemy, [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted. Clark and Lois began to date each other, and were soon married. During the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman, and after recruiting the aid of the Wizard, restored Clark's memory.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]]| penciller= [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]] | inker= [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]]| story= Superman Takes a Wife| title= Action Comics| issue= 484| date= June 1978}}</ref>

The now-married Lois and Clark starred in a series of stories in ''[[The Superman Family]]'' #195 – #199 and #201 – #222 titled "Mr and Mrs Superman," which presented their further adventures early in their marriage. Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[E. Nelson Bridwell|Bridwell, E. Nelson]]| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= Giella, Joe| story= Susie's Flying Saucer| title= Superman Family| issue= 199| date= January–February 1980}}</ref> Years later, Lois and Clark acted as parental figures for [[Power Girl]], Superman's cousin, after she arrived on Earth.

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seemingly seen for the final time, as Lois, the Earth-Two Superman, and the [[Superboy Prime|Superboy of Earth Prime]] are taken by [[Earth-Three]]'s [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] into a paradise like dimension at the end of the story. Following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths,'' this version of Lois was retroactively removed from DC's continuity.

In 2005's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post Crisis [[DC Universe]] from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her [[octogenarian]] status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in ''Infinite Crisis'' #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy Prime at the end of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words "''It's... not... going...''" as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]]'s, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.

Lois later returns as a sinister [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] with her husband in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover. Her first task is to kidnap [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]] with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for [[Superman|Kal-El]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Connor Kent]], and Martha, to be reunited with [[Jonathan Kent (comics)|Jonathan Kent]] in death. She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until [[Krypto]] intervened, ripping the black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], and reaching town to aid others unhindered.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]| penciller= [[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]| inker= [[Ruy Jose|Jose, Ruy]]; [[Julio Ferreira|Ferreira, Julio]]| story= A Sleepy Little Town | title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 1| date= October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= Psycho Piracy!| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 2| date= November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; [[Allan Goldman|Goldman, Allan]]| inker= Jose, Ruy; [[Eber Ferreira|Ferreira, Eber]]| story= The Long Dark Knight| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 3| date= December 2009}}</ref>

Black Lantern Lois later appears to [[Power Girl]], claiming that she has escaped the ring's corrupting influence, and needs her help. This however, was just a ploy to get close enough to her husband's body, which was being held in the JSA headquarters after his black ring had been removed. Black Lantern Lois "sacrifices" herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L, restoring him to full undead status, and causing her own body to become inert.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; [[Marcos Marz|Marz, Marcos]]| inker= Ferreira, Julio; [[Luciana Del Negro|Del Negro, Luciana]]; Jose, Ruy| story= Lost Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= 1| date= February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James; [[Tony Bedard|Bedard, Tony]]| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Marz, Marcos| inker= Ferreira, Julio; Ferreira, Eber; Del Negro, Luciana| story= Troubled Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= 2| date= March 2010}}</ref>

===Silver Age and Bronze Age===

When the reading audience of superhero comic books became predominately young boys in the mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving [[extraterrestrials]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures, and bizarre plots. Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, and tricking or otherwise forcing Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies, and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to Superman imposter from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Otto Binder|Binder, Otto]]| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Shrinking Superman!| title= Action Comics| issue= 245| date= October 1958}}</ref> and a man from the future.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bernstein, Robert| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Man Who Married Lois Lane| title= Superman| issue= 136| date= April 1960}}</ref> All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during the 1950s, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC's title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in 1957,<ref>[[Alexander C. Irvine|Irvine, Alex]] "1950s" in Dolan, p. 85: "The future title ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' got a tryout in issues #9 and #10 of ''Showcase'', when Lois Lane stepped in as the lead feature."</ref> DC created an ongoing title for the character, titled ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]''<ref>Irvine "1950s" in Dolan, p. 89: "Following her successful test run in the pages of ''Showcase'' #9 and #10, Lois Lane got her own title ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' in which Superman was ever the prankster."</ref> beginning in March 1958 and running for 137 issues until September 1974. Most of these stories placed an emphasis on Lois' romance with Superman, and were drawn by artist [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]; indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lois became cited by many<ref>{{cite book|last = Voger|first = Mark|authorlink = |author2=Voglesong, Kathy |chapter= Front Page Romance |title = Hero Gets Girl!: The Life & Art of Kurt Schaffenberger|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2003|pages = 43–45| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8_mF5qdrMR0C&pg=PA43&dq=Front+Page+Romance+Kurt+Schaffenberger&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QUyfT7abB6fN6QGA3LCkAg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Front%20Page%20Romance%20Kurt%20Schaffenberger&f=false| isbn = 1-893905-29-2

''Lois Lane'' soon became one of DC Comics' most popular titles, and spent the 1960s as one of the top ten best-selling comics. At its sales peak, ''Lois Lane'' was the third best-selling comic in 1962<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1962.html|title= 1962 Comic Book Sales Figures|first= John Jackson|last= Miller|date= n.d.|publisher= Comichron: The Comics Chronicles|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141008070224/http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1962.html|archivedate= October 8, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref> and 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1965.html|title= 1965 Comic Book Sales Figures|first= John Jackson|last= Miller|date= n.d.|publisher= Comichron: The Comics Chronicles|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024222/http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1965.html|archivedate= November 17, 2015|deadurl= no}}</ref> The title featured the first appearance, after an absence from comics of over a decade, of the Silver Age [[Catwoman]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Leo Dorfman|Dorfman, Leo]]|penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt|inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt|story= The Catwoman's Black Magic!|title= Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane |issue= 70|date= November 1966}}</ref>

While Lois had started to become suspicious of Superman's secret identity during the Golden Age (as early as ''Superman'' #7 in 1940), her suspicions reached their peak during the early Silver Age, with many stories in her solo series focusing on her attempts to prove Superman and Clark Kent were one and the same. To wit, various stories from this era show Superman using various means to protect his secret identity from Lois, including his [[Superman robot]]s or Batman disguising himself as Clark/Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Schwartz, Alvin]]| penciller= Swan, Curt| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= Batman – Double for Superman!| title= [[World's Finest Comics]]| issue= 71| date= July–August 1954}}</ref>

[[Lana Lang]], a character introduced in the ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' series, was initially introduced in Superman's setting in ''Superman'' #78 in 1952, but became a permanent part of the Superman era stories with ''Showcase'' #9 in 1957. From that point on, Lana Lang became a frequently seen rival of Lois for Superman's affections.

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society changed, Lois' character changed as well. In ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' issue #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look.<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 128: "She started trading in her generic blouse and pencil skirt combinations for a "mod" wardrobe filled with printed dresses, go-go boots, mini skirts, and hot pants."</ref> Stories in the 1970s depicted Lois as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more solo adventures without Superman being involved, and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity.

Lois Lane had a solo series featured in ''[[The Superman Family]]'' (an [[anthology]] title started in the mid-1970s after the cancellation of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' and ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'') from 1974 to 1982. In her series, Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian [[martial arts|martial art]] of Klurkor, taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of [[Kandor]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Dorfman, Leo| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= [[Pete Costanza|Costanza, Pete]]| story= Courtship, Kryptonian Style!| title=Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane| issue= 78| date= October 1967}}</ref> There were several cameos of the [[New Gods]], including [[Desaad]] and [[Darkseid]].

During the Silver and Bronze Age, Lois' backstory became more fully fleshed out, with various stories explaining her life before becoming employed at the "Daily Planet." This backstory was attributed to the Lois Lane of Earth-One.

As summarized in various stories, Lois was born to Sam and Ella Lane, and grew up on their farm in the small town of Pittsdale.<ref name="loislane13" /> While Lois was a toddler, she encountered a [[rattlesnake]] in the woods near the Lane family farm. The snake was scared away by one of Kal-El's baby toys which had landed nearby in one of Jor-El's experimental rockets.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry|penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt|inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt|story= Lois Lane's Childhood|title= Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane|issue= 26|date= July 1961}}</ref> At the age of two, Lois suffered [[measles]], and at the age of three, [[Pertussis|whooping cough]].<ref name="supermanfamily206">{{cite comic| writer= [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|penciller= [[Bob Oksner|Oksner, Bob]]|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= Have You Ever Told Me the Story of My Life?|title= Superman Family|issue= 206|date= March–April 1981}}</ref> At an unspecified time during Lois' childhood, her younger sister Lucy Lane was born.<ref name="supermanfamily206" />

During Lois' adolescence, she won a youth contest run by the ''Daily Planet'', with the prize being a trip to Metropolis to spend a week working as a cub reporter for the newspaper. There, she first met Clark Kent of Smallville, who was the other winner of the contest. Lois found Clark dull, and became more interested in asking him for information about Superboy after learning Clark came from Smallville. During the week in Metropolis, Lois made a bet with Clark to see who would get the most [[Scoop (term)|scoops]], which turned out to be Lois, as Clark was forced to constantly go into action as Superboy. Lois met Superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories. At the end of the week, Clark paid off Lois' bet (an [[ice cream sundae]]), and the two returned to their respective hometowns.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Finger|Finger, Bill]]|penciller= [[Al Wenzel|Wenzel, Al]]|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= How Clark Kent Met Lois Lane|title= [[Adventure Comics]]|issue= 128|date= May 1948}}</ref>

Upon finishing high school, Lois left Pittsdale, and attended Raleigh College to study journalism.

After graduating from college, Lois became permanently employed at the ''Daily Planet'', soon becoming its star reporter. Lois eventually saw her longtime coworkers, Clark Kent and Jimmy Olsen, join the Planet's staff.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry|penciller= Plastino, Al|inker= Plastino, Al|story= How Perry White Hired Clark Kent!|title= Superman|issue= 133|date= November 1959}}</ref> At some point in her career, Lois was a winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Dorfman, Leo|penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt|inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt|story= Get Out of My Life, Superman!|title= Superman's Girl Friend|issue= 80|date= January 1968}}</ref>

Lois Lane was the backup series in ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl]]'' in 1982–1983.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2626|title= The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl}}</ref>

After the 1985–1986 miniseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', writer and artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] revised the Superman legend, and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity. Before this happened, a final non-canonical "imaginary story," ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'', was written by writer [[Alan Moore]], meant as a send-off for the pre-Crisis versions of the characters, including Lois. Published at the same time but in Earth-One continuity was a two-issue miniseries titled ''Lois Lane,'' in which she investigates the problem of missing children.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mindy Newell|Newell, Mindy]]|penciller= [[Gray Morrow|Morrow, Gray]]|inker= Morrow, Gray|story= Chapter I: Ignorance Was Bliss/Chapter II: Dark Realities [When It Rains, God is Crying]|title= Lois Lane|issue= 1|date= August 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Newell, Mindy|penciller= Morrow, Gray|inker= Morrow, Gray|story= Chapter Three: Quicksand/Chapter Four: Quicksand!

===Modern Age===
[[Image:loislane.png|180px|left|thumb|Lois Lane, as she appears on the cover of ''The Man of Steel'' (miniseries) #2 (1986). Pencils by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]
Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which significantly rewrote [[Origin of Superman|Superman's origin]] and history. In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive.

Lois' first real relationship in this version was with [[Gangbuster|Jose Delgado]], a Metropolis vigilante whose legs are shattered in a battle with a [[Lexcorp]] [[cyborg]]/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL and Lois' attraction to Superman with whom Delgado felt he had to compete.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry|penciller= Ordway, Jerry|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The Ledge|title= [[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]|issue= 448|date= December 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry|penciller= Ordway, Jerry|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Triple Threat|title= The Adventures of Superman|issue= 450|date= January 1989}}</ref>

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with just Superman, although she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this new revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #460–463 and ''Action Comics'' #650.

Following Clark's brief rampage under the influence of the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]], Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for "selling out" to [[Blaze and Satanus|Collin Thornton]] and running ''Newstime'' Magazine, but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to "''grovel for his job back.''" Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her. The two became a couple, and eventually Lois accepted a proposal of marriage.<ref name="Superman50" /><ref name="Manning247" /> Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]]| penciller= [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]]| inker= McLeod, Bob| story= Secrets in the Night| title= Action Comics| issue= 662| date= February 1991| publisher= DC Comics}}</ref><ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 249: "With their nuptials looming, Clark thought it was time to reveal his dual identity to the love of his life, in this landmark issue by writer Roger Stern and artist Bob McLeod."</ref>

DC had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's [[Superman vol. 2|''Superman'' (vol. 2)]] #75.However, with the then-upcoming television show ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV. Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in ''Superman'' #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a [[battle royal]] with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the [[mermaid]] [[Lori Lemaris]]). Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her. When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits, and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been depleted, and that he was her editor (due to [[Perry White]]'s cancer). Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief, Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

Lois and Clark were finally wed in the one-shot special ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'', which featured the work of nearly every then-living artist who had ever worked on Superman.<ref name="Manning275" /> The issue was published during the week of October 6, 1996, coinciding with an episode of ''Lois & Clark'', which also featured the wedding of the two characters.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kryptonsite.com/manyfaces-wedding.htm|title= The Many Faces Of...

Since their marriage, Clark and Lois continue to remain one of the stronger relationships in most comic series. In 2007, the couple took the 'next step' in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they name [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]]. The boy is discovered to be the son of [[Jor-El]]'s arch-foe, [[General Zod]]. Although initially uneasy about raising a super-powered boy, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being 'Mommy Lois'. Following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the [[Phantom Zone]] rift, trapping himself inside with Zod's forces, leaving Lois without her son.

When the [[Titans Tomorrow]] arrive at the Kents' apartment to kidnap Superman, Lois is knocked out, bound and gagged, and hidden in the couple's bedroom. Before Clark can untie her, he is ambushed and beaten into submission by the Titans.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Sean McKeever|McKeever, Sean]]| penciller= [[Randy Green|Green, Randy]]| inker= [[Andy Lanning|Lanning, Andy]]; [[Sandra Hope|Hope, Sandra]]| story= Passage| title= Teen Titans| volume= 3| issue= 50| date= October 2007}}</ref>

In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lois and Perry are caught in an explosion triggered by [[Clayface]] destroying the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and apparently Lois is seriously injured or possibly even dead. In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he is to save his wife's life. The story is continued in the [[Stereoscopy|3D]] tie-in comic ''Superman Beyond'', where [[Monitor (comics)|the female Monitor]] Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him and several of his multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising immediate care for Lois. After facing off against the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brought back a distilled drop of [[Bleed (comics)|The Bleed]], and administered it through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois was later seen in ''Final Crisis'' #6, one of the few still free humans.

After the events of ''[[Superman: New Krypton]]'' Superman must leave Earth for an undetermined amount of time swearing off his Earthly connections in the eyes of his fellow [[Kryptonian]]s to keep an eye on General Zod the New Kryptonian military commander but secretly tells Lois he still considers her his wife and will come back to her. In issues of ''Action Comics'' Lois has reunited with [[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]] who has aged to adulthood in the past months and became the new Metropolis hero [[Nightwing]] and spoke to his partner [[Thara Ak-Var]] (the new [[Flamebird]]) on the two's (possible romantic) relationship.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Greg Rucka|Rucka, Greg]]| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= The Sleepers Part I| title= Action Comics| issue= 875| date= May 2009}}</ref> Lois hears that her sister [[Lucy Lane]] was killed during battle with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] where Supergirl and Lana visit Lois' apartment to tell her the bad news.

Lois hands her exposé in and the government are after her for treason. With agents on her tail, Lois makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody and awakens, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Although Lois is happy to see her father alive her love soon turns to anger when she realizes Lucy was fully aware of her actions and Kara was indeed telling the truth. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has being this lenient with her is that she is his daughter. He threatens to make her disappear forever; never to see the light of day again, where not even Superman could save her, if she continues. He tells Lois, he does love her but the planet will always come first over his family. Lois returns to the ''Daily Planet'' under cover of night and explains all to Perry. Lois points out that the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he refuses to run the story but notes the story must get out to the people somehow.

== Superhero identity ==
Lois Lane has become a superhero and gained superpowers several times in the comics, animation, and live-action series.

===Superwoman===
[[File:SuperwomanLoisLane.PNG|thumb|170px|right|Lois Lane, first appearance as Superwoman in Action Comics #60. Art by [[Joe Shuster]].]]
Lois Lane was the first person to assume the [[Superwoman]] persona, and has become the [[superheroine]] on several occasions. Some of the stories featuring Lois as Superwoman have her gaining powers temporarily.

Lois's first appearance as Superwoman (also Superwoman's first appearance in DC Comics) was in ''Action Comics'' #60 (May 1943).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry|penciller= Shuster, Joe|inker= Shuster, Joe| story=Lois Lane -- Superwoman| title= Action Comics| issue=60| date=May 1943}}</ref> The story is set in a dream sequence, where, after Lois is hit by a truck, she dreams a transfusion of Superman's blood gives her super powers and she becomes Superwoman. In ''Superman'' #45, Lois believes Hocus and Pocus—a pair of fraudulent magicians—have given her superpowers, and with Superman's help and intervention, Lois once again becomes Superwoman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Schwartz, Alvin]]| penciller= Sikela, John|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]| story= Lois Lane, Superwoman!| title= Superman| issue=45| date=March-April 1947}}</ref> In ''[[The Superman Family]]'' #207, the Earth-Two Lois gained superpowers from her husband, after Superman brought an extraterrestrial plant into their home, with Lois losing the powers after the death of the plant.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[E.

On ''[[Smallville]]'' in the episode "Prophecy", Jor-El gives Lois all of Clark's powers for one day.

In the original [[Crime Syndicate of America]] on [[Earth-Three]], Lois Lane and Superwoman were two separate individual characters.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]| penciller= [[Mike Vosburg|Vosburg, Mike]]|inker= [[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]] | story= Crisis on Earth-3 (Reprise)!| title= Secret Society of Super-Villains| issue=14| date=April-May 1978}}</ref> Superwoman is a [[supervillain]] and Lois married Earth-Three's greatest champion, Alexander Luthor.

She is an Amazon by birth and the chief editor of the ''Daily Planet''. The New 52 version of Superwoman of Earth-3 is also named Lois Lane and part of the Crime Syndicate.

In ''[[All Star Superman]]'' by Grant Morrison, Lois becomes a [[Kryptonian]] Superwoman for 24 hours. Superman takes Lois to his [[Fortress of Solitude]] to spend her birthday.

The writer of ''Earth 2'', [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Tom Taylor]], specifically resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2, after he was told to kill off the character in the ''Injustice'' comic series. Taylor stated "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if I could bring back Lois. Then it was just a matter of working out exactly how."<ref>{{cite web|last= Santori-Griffith|first= Matt|url= http://www.comicosity.com/interview-tom-taylor-batman-earth-2/ | title = Tom Taylor Talks Batman and the Cast of ''Earth 2''|publisher= Comicosity|date= February 5, 2014|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150818072758/http://www.comicosity.com/interview-tom-taylor-batman-earth-2/|archivedate= August 18, 2015|deadurl= no| accessdate= December 1, 2014}}</ref> Taylor received "[[Women in Refrigerators#Women in Refrigerators Syndrome|Women in Refrigerators]]" criticism for his ''Injustice'' comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to "unfridge" Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois's first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope."<ref>{{cite web |last=Roger |first=Vaneta |url = http://www.newsarama.com/19662-unfridging-lois-just-one-of-the-surprises-tom-taylor-plans-for-dc-s-earth-2.html|title= 'Unfridging Lois' Just One of the Surprises Tom Taylor Plans For DC's ''Earth 2''|publisher= Newsarama|date= November 22, 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150722034314/http://www.newsarama.com/19662-unfridging-lois-just-one-of-the-surprises-tom-taylor-plans-for-dc-s-earth-2.html|archivedate= July 22, 2015|deadurl= no| accessdate=December 1, 2014}}</ref>
