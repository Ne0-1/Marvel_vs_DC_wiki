'''Lois Joanne Lane''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] who appears in [[DC Comics]]’ ''[[Superman]]'' stories.  Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and 
artist [[Joe Shuster]], she first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 (1938).

Lois is Superman's chief romantic interest and, in the current DC [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], his wife.  Like Superman’s [[alter ego]] [[Clark Kent]], she is a [[journalism|reporter]] for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper, ''The [[Daily Planet]]''. 

Depictions of Lois Lane have varied in the nearly 70 year history of Superman [[comic books]] and other media adaptations.  During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], she was the star of ''Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane,'' a comic title that had a light and frivolous tone.  However, the original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] version of Lois, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portray Lois as a tough-as-nails journalist and intellectual equal to Superman.

==Profile==
Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years (depending on the comic writers' handling of the character and [[United States|American]] social attitudes toward women at the time), but in most incarnations she has been depicted as a determined, strong-willed person, whether it involves beating her rival reporter [[Clark Kent]] to a story or (in what became a trademark of 1950s and 1960s era Superman stories) proving to others her suspicion that her fellow reporter [[Clark Kent]] was in reality Superman.  She also traditionally had a cool attitude toward Clark, who in her view paled in comparison to his super [[alter ego]].  At times, the character has been portrayed as a [[damsel in distress]].

Lois is regarded as attractive, but not in the exaggerated "[[supermodel]]" sense often seen in superhero comics' depictions of women.  Her appearance has varied over the years, depending either on current fashion or (especially more recently) the way she's depicted in contemporary media adaptations; for instance, in the mid-1990s, when the series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois and Clark]]'' began airing, Lois received a hair cut that made her look more like [[Teri Hatcher]], and her eyes were typically violet to match the Lois of the television [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' after that show began airing.

Lois is the daughter of Sam and Ella Lane.  In the earlier comics, her parents were [[farmer]]s in a town called Pittsdale; the modern comics, however, depict Sam as a retired soldier, and Lois as a former "[[army brat]]," with Lois having been trained by her father in areas such as hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms.  Lois also has one younger sibling, her sister [[Lucy Lane]].

In the current comics, [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|Lois is married to Clark Kent]] (and aware of his [[secret identity]]), but has kept her [[maiden name]] for professional purposes.

==Character history==
The comics have seen several incarnations of Lois Lane over the decades.

===Golden Age===
[[Image:Superman27.PNG|The Golden Age Lois Lane and Superman, from the cover of ''Superman'' (volume 1) #27 (March-April 1944). Pencils by [[Wayne Boring]].|left|thumb]]
In the earliest [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was featured as an aggressive, career-minded reporter for the ''Daily Star'' (the paper's name was changed to ''The Daily Planet'' in the early 1940s), who, after Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, found herself attracted to Superman, but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent.  Starting in the late 1940s or early 1950s comics, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman, and started to make various attempts at uncovering his [[secret identity]], all of which backfired (usually thanks to Superman's efforts). 

In the Golden Age comics, Lois also had a [[niece]] named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated [[tall tales]] and fibs to [[adults]].  Susie's last appearance was in 1955; subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

After DC instituted its [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity, it was deemed that the Lois of the Golden Age comics (i.e., comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) lived on the parallel world of "Earth-Two" versus the then-mainstream ([[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]]) universe of "Earth-One."  In 1978's ''Action Comics'' #484, it was revealed that sometime in the 1950s, the Earth-Two Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old [[Justice Society of America]] enemy the Wizard), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted.  Clark and Lois began to date each other, and were soon married; however, during the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman, and after recruiting the aid of the Wizard, restored Clark's memory.  A series of stories in the 1970s and 1980s titled "Mr. and Mrs. Superman" presented the further adventures of the now-married Lois and Clark (in several of which Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character).

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seen for one of the final times, as she, the [[Kal-L|Earth-Two Superman]], and the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Prime]] [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] are taken by [[Earth-Three]]'s [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] into a paradise-like dimension at the end of the story (after all the parallel Earths, including Earth-Two, had been eliminated in favor of just one Earth), after which this version of Lois was (seemingly) permanently discarded from DC's continuity.

{{spoiler}}
In 2005's [[Infinite Crisis]] miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane, along with the Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr. and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis [[DC Universe]] from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observors, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her [[octogenarian]] status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-2, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-2, however, Lois Lane died in the arms of Superman in ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 and after Earth-2 Superman's death at the end of [[Infinite Crisis]] #7, they are shown reunited in the stars.

===Silver Age===
[[Image:Super lois and lana.jpg|thumb|Lois and [[Lana Lang]] acquire super powers and fight each other for [[Superman]]'s love in ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #21 (November 1960).  Pencils by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].]]
As the audience for [[comic book]]s began gravitating towards young boys in the mid-to-late 1950s, the Superman stories shifted in focus more toward [[science fiction]]-inspired plots involving [[extraterrestrials]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures and bizarre, often contrived, plots.  Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival [[Lana Lang]] for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, and tricking or otherwise forcing Superman into [[marriage]].  For Superman's part, his rationale for resisting her is that she cannot be trusted not to expose his secret identity to advance her career and marrying her would put her in too much danger from his enemies (ignoring the fact that his romantic relationship with her is already public knowledge).  This change in Lois' personality from her earlier 1940s self might also be a result of American society's attitudes toward women and their societal roles in the 1950s. Across this generation, she got married quite frequently, to other well known characters such as [[Batman]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] (and various Superman pastiches) but these marriages were always annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during this decade, and after a one-shot story in 1957 in DC's title ''Showcase,'' Lois was given her own comic, titled ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane''.  Most of the stories in this title placed a greater emphasis on Lois' romance with Superman, and were drawn by DC comic artist [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]; indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lois became cited by many as the "definitive" version of Lois, and he was often asked to redraw ''Superman'' comic artist [[Curt Swan|Curt Swan's]] renditions of Lois and Lana by Superman comic editor [[Mort Weisinger]].

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society began to change, Lois did as well.  1970s stories featuring Lois depicted her as being fully capable of taking care of herself, engaged in more solo adventures without Superman being involved, and her being much less interested in things such as discovering Superman's secret identity.  For example, in her solo stories in ''Superman Family'' (an [[anthology]] title started in the mid-1970s from the merging/cancellation of several previous titles, including ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' and ''Superman's Pal, [[Jimmy Olsen]]''), Lois regularly battled criminals in her investigations and defeated them with quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian [[martial arts|martial art]] of Klurkor, taught to her in the bottle-city of Kandor.

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', writer and artist [[John Byrne]] was hired to revise the Superman comics, thus eliminating the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity; before this happened, a final non-canonical "imaginary story" ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'' was written by writer [[Alan Moore]], meant as a send-off for the "pre-Crisis" versions of the characters, including Lois.

===Modern Age===
[[Image:loislane.png|150px|left|thumb|Lois Lane, as she appears on the cover of ''The Man of Steel'' (miniseries) #2 (1986). Pencils by [[John Byrne]].]]
Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which was designed to rewrite Superman's origin from scratch.  In the modern version of events, Lois was a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing.  She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive. 

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall head over heels in love with Superman.  One reason for this was the changed nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship: before Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent, but now Clark Kent lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary.  After some time, Lois and Clark began dating.  In the early 1990s, they became engaged and Clark revealed to Lois the secret of his dual life.

DC had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's ''Superman'' #75.  However, with the then-upcoming [[television]] show ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV (as it turned out, they desired to have the wedding occur simultaneously in both the comics and the television program).  Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in ''Superman'' #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a [[battle royal]] with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].  After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems occurring (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend (and mermaid), [[Lori Lemaris]]). 

In 1996, coinciding with the ''Lois and Clark'' television program, Lois and Clark were finally wed in the one-shot special ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'', which featured the work of nearly every then-living artist who had ever worked on Superman.  The ''Wedding Album'' itself, however, was forced to spend part of its opening pages accommodating and reconciling the then-current comic storyline of Lois and Clark having broken off their engagement (the television program's producers had failed to provide adequate lead time for the Superman comics' writers).

Today, Lois lives with Clark in an apartment at 1938 Sullivan Lane in Metropolis.

==''All Star Superman''==
{{spoiler}}
In 2005, DC launched a new ''[[All Star Superman]]'' comic series by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]], the series taking place outside normal DC continuity.  In this storyline, they are not married, and although Superman has decided to reveal his secret identity to Lois, as of the second issue of the series, she refuses to believe him.  At the end of issue #2, Superman (who believes he is dying) presents Lois with a super-powered chemical and a superhero costume and Lois Lane becomes [[Superwoman]] for 24 hours.

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
* Lois once owned a cat named Elroy.
* There is a street in the [[Metro Detroit]] area (specifically, the city of Southfield) called "Lois Lane".
*Lois's physical appearance was originally based on a [[model (person)|model]] hired by Siegel and Shuster named [[Joanne Carter (model)|Joanne Carter]]. Siegel and Carter met again many years later and married. They were together until his passing.
* The character of Lois was based on [[Torchy Blaine]], a female reporter featured in a series of films from the 1930s. Siegel took her name from actress [[Lola Lane]], who portrayed Torchy in one of the middle entries (TIME Magazine, May 30, 1988, Letters to the Editor, P. 6-7). 
*Traditionally, Lois has black [[hair]], though for a period from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, Lois was depicted with brown hair in the comics.
*Lois is one of several Superman characters with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lana Lang]], [[Lena Luthor]], [[Lionel Luthor]], Linda Lee (aka [[Supergirl]]), [[Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter|Letitia Lerner]], Lyla Lerrol (a Silver Age-era Kryptonian actress) and [[Lori Lemaris]] (a [[mermaid]]).
*During the years (1942-1984) that [[Editora Brasil-América]] (EBAL) published the [[Brazilian]] versions of Superman comics, Lois Lane's name was translated to "Miriam Lane" and later to "Miriam Lois Lane".
*The secondary female lead in the musical [[Kiss Me, Kate]] is named Lois Lane; she plays [[Bianca]] in the show-within-a-show's production of [[The Taming of the Shrew]]: The Musical.  Whether she was named after the Superman character is unknown.
*Two actresses who have played Lois Lane have later returned to play her mother.  [[Phyllis Coates]] played Lois in the first season of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', and played her mother on an episode of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.  [[Noel Neill]] played Lois on in the two [[Superman (serial)|Superman movie serials]], and in subsequent seasons of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', and played her mother in 1978's [[Superman]].  [[Joan Alexander]] provided Lois Lane's voice in the [[Max Fleischer]] [[Superman (1940s cartoons)]] and on the Superman radio program.  [[Dana Delany]] did Lois Lane's voice in [[Superman: The Animated Series]] in the [[1990s]].
*Several parodic or homage versions of Lois Lane have appeared in [[Marvel Comics]], usually unnamed or with the first name Lois and no surname, and often in the company of a similarly unnamed Clark analogue.  A more indirect homage was Terri Kidder, a reporter for the [[Daily Bugle]] who was named after two actresses who had played Lois.  She was killed in ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'' #2.

*Actress [[Rollie Bester]] originated the role of Lois Lane for a [[Superman (radio)|radio series]] with [[Bud Collyer]] as Superman in the 1940s.  Other actresses to lend their voice to the character were [[Helen Choate]] and [[Joan Alexander]].  Joan Alexander would also voice the character for a series of [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman theatrical cartoons]] for [[Fleischer Studios]] (1941-1943) as well as a 1960s animated television series.

*Actress [[Noel Neill]] played Lois Lane in more venues and instances than any other actress. She played the role in the 1948 and 1950 Saturday movie serials with [[Kirk Alyn]] playing Clark Kent/Superman.  She returned to the role in the second season of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television program opposite [[George Reeves]] and had a cameo in the 1978 film ''[[Superman (movie)|Superman]]'' as Lois Lane's mother.  She was later a guest star in ''[[Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' alongside [[Jack Larson]] ([[Jimmy Olsen]]) as an office worker at the ''Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters''.  She also has a role in the [[Bryan Singer]]-directed film ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

*Actress [[Phyllis Coates]] played Lois Lane in the theatrical feature ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'' opposite [[George Reeves]] as Superman and continued in the role in the first season of the ''Adventures of Superman'' television program.  She also portrayed Ellen Lane, the socialite divorcee mother of Lois Lane in the first season of the 1990s [[television]] program ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois and Clark]]''.

*Actress Patricia Marand played Lois Lane in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's a Superman]]'' in 1966.  For her performance she was nominated for Broadway's 1966 [[Tony Award]] as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Musical).

*Actress [[Lesley Ann Warren]] portrayed Lois in the television production of ''It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Superman'' in 1975 opposite [[David Wilson]]. She was also among the many actresses who auditioned for the role opposite [[Christopher Reeve]] for the 1978 film ''[[Superman (movie)|Superman]].''
 
*Actress [[Margot Kidder]] played Lois Lane against [[Christopher Reeve]]'s [[Clark Kent]] in the 1970s and 1980s films ''[[Superman (movie)|Superman]]'', ''[[Superman II]]'', ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest For Peace]]''.  Her role in ''[[Superman III]]'' was greatly reduced, however, due to a conflict with the producers of the film.  She also appeared briefly in two episodes of the television program ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' as [[Bridgette Crosby|Dr. Bridgette Crosby]], an emissary of Dr. Swann (played by [[Christopher Reeve]]).

*Actress [[Teri Hatcher]] played Lois Lane on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois and Clark]]'' for four seasons, starting in 1993, with the two leading characters getting married during its run; this is the first television or film series that showed Lois and Clark's romance fully realized.

*Actress [[Dana Delany]] voiced Lois Lane in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' animated television series of the 1990s and in the character's subsequent appearances on ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' and its successor ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', all of which are a part of the [[DC animated universe]].  In this version, series creator [[Bruce Timm]] and character designer James Tucker reinvented Lois more like her original comic counterpart, in that at first her relationship with Clark was very much a rivalry about which was the better reporter, and she would at times actively attempt to trick him out of stories.  At first, Lois was skeptical about Superman, but she grew closer to him throughout the series.  They did not share their first kiss until the final moments  of "Legacy", ''Superman'''s last episode.  Superman and Lois are shown to be dating by the time of ''Justice League Unlimited''.  In the episode "Divided We Fall", the writers planned to have Superman reveal his secret identity to Lois, but the decision was vetoed by DC.[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode49/episode49.htm]

*On the 2000s [[The WB Television Network|WB]] series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', [[Erica Durance]] plays a young Lois Lane who came to Smallville to investigate the apparent death of her cousin, [[Chloe Sullivan]]. Durance plays a teenaged Lois, depite the fact that she is five years older than Kate Bosworth, who playes an adult version of the character in the concurrently released ''Superman Returns''.  After teaming up with [[Clark Kent]] to find her cousin, she returned for several guest star appearances in Season 4 before signing to return as a regular in Season 5.  This version of Lois was originally not interested in [[journalism]] at all. In the sixth season Lois began to develop an interest in journalism, working at the Inquisitor and competing with her cousin Chloe and Jimmy Olsen who work at the Daily Planet. She is currently dating [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen, the Green Arrow]].

*Actress [[Kate Bosworth]] played Lois Lane in the 2006 [[Bryan Singer]]-directed film ''[[Superman Returns]]''.  In this version, she has given birth to a son named [[Jason White (character)|Jason White]], who is heavily hinted to be the biological son of Superman.

==Cultural references==  
The American [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' made numerous references to Lois over its nine-year run:   

* In a 1993 episode, Jerry tells a female reporter for a college newspaper: "I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane."   

* A 1994 episode [[The Mom & Pop Store (Seinfeld episode)|("The Mom & Pop Store")]] has Elaine tell Jerry she's been doing some snooping for him. "Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?" he replies.

* In the episode "The Race," Jerry dates a woman named "Lois" and makes several Superman-related references to her name.   

* In [[The Face Painter (Seinfeld episode)|"The Face Painter"]] (1995), George discovers that a woman he is dating is deaf in one ear and therefore might not have heard him tell her he loves her. "Don't you see what this means?" he says. "It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!"   

*The 1998 episode [[The Cartoon (Seinfeld episode)|"The Cartoon"]] has Jerry make fun of Elaine's drawings, leading her to reply: "It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane."   

* In [[The Strong Box (Seinfeld episode)|"The Strong Box"]] (also 1998), Elaine dates a man whose mysterious ways lead Jerry to joke that he is a crimefighter protecting his secret identity. When they find out the man is poor, Jerry and George comment, respectively, that his "super power was lack of money" and that "maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan."

* Teri Hatcher appeared (with no mention of Lois Lane) in two episodes.

* In a 1994 episode, The Marine Biologist, when Elaine accuses Jerry of helping a strange woman just so he can take her out on a date, Jerry replies that Superman is never suspected of such intentions when saving a woman's life, prompting Elaine to comment "Well, you're not Superman,"  to which Jerry responds, "Well, you're not Lois Lane..."
