'''Lois Lane''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], she first appeared in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938). Lois is an award-winning journalist for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper, the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', and the love interest of the superhero [[Superman]]. In DC continuity, she is also his wife and the mother of their son, [[Jonathan Samuel Kent]], the current [[Superboy]] in the [[DC Universe]].

Lois' physical appearance was originally based on [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]], a model hired by Joe Shuster. For her character, Jerry Siegel was inspired by actress [[Glenda Farrell]]'s portrayal of the fictional reporter [[Torchy Blane]] in a series of films. Siegel took her name from actress [[Lane Sisters|Lola Lane]].<ref>Letters to the Editor, ''Time'' magazine (May 30, 1988), pp. 6–7.</ref> She was also influenced by the real-life journalist [[Nellie Bly]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Farghaly |first=Nadine|title =Examining Lois Lane: The Scoop on Superman's Sweetheart.|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press, Inc.]]|year=2013|location= Lanham, Maryland|isbn= 0810892375|page=44}}</ref>

Depictions of the character have varied spanning the comics and other media adaptations. The original [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a tough-as-nails [[journalist]] and intellectually equal to Superman. During the [[Silver Age of Comics]], she was the star of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'', a comic book series that had a light and humorous tone. Beginning in 2015, she is the protagonist in the young adult novel series, ''Lois Lane'', by writer Gwenda Bond.

Lois is among the best-known female comic book characters. She has appeared in various media adaptations. Actress [[Noel Neill]] first portrayed Lois Lane in the 1940s ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' film series and later reprised her role in the 1950s television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', replacing [[Phyllis Coates]] from season two. [[Margot Kidder]] played the character in four [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman films]] in the 1970s and 1980s. [[Teri Hatcher]] portrayed her in the 1990s television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and [[Erica Durance]] in the 2000s series, ''[[Smallville]]''. In the 2006 film, she was played by [[Kate Bosworth]] in ''[[Superman Returns]]''. [[Amy Adams]] in the [[DC Extended Universe]]. The character was most recently portrayed in [[The CW]] [[Arrowverse]] by [[Bitsie Tulloch|Elizabeth Tulloch]]. Actresses who have voiced Lois Lane in animated adaptations include [[Joan Alexander]] in the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Fleischer Superman cartoons]] and [[Dana Delany]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', among others.

==Creation==
[[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] first conceived Lois Lane in 1934, when they were still developing Superman.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster Interview|publisher=Nemo: the Classic Comics Library No. 2|date=August 1983|page=11}}</ref> One of the major influence on Lois' characterization was actress [[Glenda Farrell]] and her portrayal of the fictional reporter [[Torchy Blane]] in a series of [[Warner Bros.]] films. The Torchy Blane movies were popular second features during the later 1930s. On the conception of Lois Lane, Jerry Siegel stated in the 1988 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine:

{{quote|My wife Joanne was Joe's original art model for Superman's girlfriend Lois Lane back in the 1930s. Our heroine was, of course, a working girl whose priority was grabbing scoops. What inspired me in the creation was Glenda Farrell, the movie star who portrayed Torchy Blane, a gutsy, beautiful headline-hunting reporter, in a series of exciting motion pictures. Because the name of the actress Lola Lane (who also played Torchy) appealed to me, I called my character Lois Lane. Strangely, the characterization of Lois is amazingly like the real-life personality of my lovely wife.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel |first=Joanne |url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics.php?topic=articles/lois-lane |title=The True Inspiration for Lois Lane |publisher=Superman Home Page |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721154956/http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics.php?topic=articles%2Flois-lane |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |df= }}</ref>}}

Joe Shuster based Lois' physical appearance on a model name [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]]. Carter had placed an ad in the ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'' newspaper in the Situation Wanted column, advertising herself as a model.<ref>This ad appeared in ''The Plain Dealer'' on 13 January 1935, according to [https://twitter.com/bradjricca/status/936617623223242753?lang=en this Twitter post] by Brad Ricca. Brad Ricca is a historian who wrote a biography of Siegel and Shuster (''Super Boys'').</ref> Shuster corresponded with her and hired her as the model for Lois Lane. Shuster's depiction of Lois was modeled on her hairstyle and facial features. "To me she was Lois Lane. She was a great inspiration for me, though. She encouraged me, she was very enthusiastic about the strip; it meant a lot to me." Shuster said about Joanne Carter.<ref name="Joanne Carter"/> 

Joanne Carter married co-creator Jerry Siegel in 1948. On working with Joe Shuster for Lois Lane, Carter said in the 1983 ''[[Nemo (magazine)|Nemo]]'' magazine interview: "Joe was redrawing the strip, and it was going to be more realistic, rather than cartoony. I used to model for him every Saturday until he had enough drawings. He made so many stock drawings that it got to a point where he didn't need any more. We became such good friends by that time we decided we would always stay friends."<ref name= "Joanne Carter">{{cite book|title=The Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster Interview|publisher=Nemo: the Classic Comics Library No. 2|date=August 1983|page=14}}</ref>

Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years, depending on the comic book writers handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time. In most incarnations, she is shown to be an independent person who is smart, determined and strong-willed. Her physical appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion or media adaptations. In the 1990s, when the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' began airing Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress [[Teri Hatcher]], and her eyes were typically violet to match her character on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. From the late 1980s through the 1990s she was depicted with auburn hair in the comic books. 
 
In the 1940s, Lois had a newspaper comic strip, ''[[Superman (comic strip)#Spinoff|Lois Lane, Girl Reporter]]'', a direct spin-off of the Superman comic strip running at the time. A similar title comic series began appearing in the ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' comic book in 1944, starting with ''Superman'' #28. In 1958, DC Comics gave Lois a comic book series, ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]''. The series focuses on her solo adventures and began publication in April 1958. In the 1960s, the series was one of DC's most popular titles and was the top ten best-selling comic books in America.<ref name="1962 Comic Book Sales Figures">{{cite web |url= http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1962.html|title= 1962 Comic Book Sales Figures|first= John Jackson|last= Miller|date= n.d.|publisher= Comichron: The Comics Chronicles|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141008070224/http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/1960s/1962.html|archivedate= October 8, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref> She had a series featured in ''[[The Superman Family]]'' comic book from 1974 to 1982.

==Fictional character biography==

===Golden Age===
[[Image:Superman27.PNG|thumb|The Golden Age Lois Lane and Superman, from the cover of ''Superman'' #27 (March–April 1944), art by [[Wayne Boring]].]]

In the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was an aggressive, career-minded reporter for the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'' (the newspaper's name was changed to the ''Daily Planet'' in ''Action Comics'' #23 in 1940). After Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, Lois found herself attracted to Superman but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent. 

Starting early as the 1940s, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman, and started to make various attempts at uncovering his [[secret identity]], all of which backfired because of Superman's efforts. The first such story appears in ''Superman'' #17 (July–August 1942).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]]| penciller= [[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]]| inker= Sikela, John| story= Man Or Superman?| title= [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]| issue= 17 | date= July–August 1942}}</ref> This theme became particularly pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age comic books]].

Lois gained her first series of stories (without Superman) starting with ''Superman'' #28 (May–June 1944),<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Cameron, Don| penciller=Dobrotka, Ed|story=Lois Lane, Girl Reporter story–The Suicidal Swain| title=Superman| issue=28|date=June 1944}}</ref> ''Lois Lane, Girl Reporter'', running in the ''Superman'' comic book for a number of years, had Lois defeating bad guys and getting front-page stories on her own, without any help from Superman.

In the Golden Age comics, Lois had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated [[tall tale]]s and fibs to adults.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry| penciller= Sikela, John| inker=Dobrotka, Ed| story= Cinderella – a la Superman| title= Action Comics | issue= 59| date= April 1943}}</ref> Susie's last appearance was in ''Superman'' #95 (February 1955).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[William Woolfolk|Woolfolk, Bill]]| penciller= [[Wayne Boring|Boring, Wayne]]| inker=Kaye, Stan| story= Susie's Enchanted Isle| title= Superman| issue= 95| date= February 1955}}</ref> Subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

===Earth-Two version===
DC Comics instituted its [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity and introduced the [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #73 (August 1969).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]| penciller= [[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]| inker= [[Sid Greene|Greene, Sid]]| story= Star Light, Star Bright—Death Star I See Tonight!| title= [[Justice League of America]]| issue= 73| date= August 1969}}</ref> This [[retcon]] declared the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane stories (i.e. comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) as having taken place on the parallel world of "[[Earth-Two]]" versus the then mainstream ([[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]) universe of "Earth-One". In ''Action Comics'' #484 (June 1978), a flashback story reveals Earth-Two's Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old [[Justice Society of America]] enemy, [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted. Clark and Lois began to date each other and were soon married. During the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman, and after recruiting the aid of the Wizard, restored Clark's memory.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]]| penciller= [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]] | inker= [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]]| story= Superman Takes a Wife| title= Action Comics| issue= 484| date= June 1978}}</ref>

The now-married Lois and Clark appeared in a series of stories in ''[[The Superman Family]]'' #195 – #199 and #201 – #222 titled ''Mr and Mrs Superman'', which presented their further adventures early in their marriage. Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[E. Nelson Bridwell|Bridwell, E. Nelson]]| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= Giella, Joe| story= Susie's Flying Saucer| title= Superman Family| issue= 199| date= January–February 1980}}</ref> Years later, Lois and Clark acted as parental figures for [[Power Girl]], Superman's cousin, after she arrived on Earth.

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seemingly seen for the final time, as Lois, the Earth-Two Superman, and the [[Superboy Prime|Superboy of Earth-Prime]] are taken by [[Earth-Three]]'s [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] into a paradise-like dimension at the end of the story. Following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths,'' this version of Lois was retroactively removed from DC's continuity.

In 2005's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis [[DC Universe]] from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and dying for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her [[octogenarian]] status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in ''Infinite Crisis'' #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words "''It's... not... going...''" as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]]'s, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.

Lois later returns as a sinister [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] with her husband in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover. Her first task is to kidnap [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]] with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for [[Superman|Kal-El]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Connor Kent]], and Martha, to be reunited with [[Jonathan "Pa" Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in death. She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until [[Krypto]] intervened, ripping the black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], and reaching town to aid others unhindered.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]| penciller= [[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]| inker=Jose, Ruy; [[Julio Ferreira|Ferreira, Julio]]| story= A Sleepy Little Town | title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 1| date= October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= Psycho Piracy!| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 2| date= November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Goldman, Allan| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Eber| story= The Long Dark Knight| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 3| date= December 2009}}</ref>

Black Lantern Lois later appears to [[Power Girl]], claiming that she has escaped the ring's corrupting influence, and needs her help. This was just a ploy to get close enough to her husband's body, which was being held in the JSA headquarters after his black ring had been removed. Black Lantern Lois "sacrifices" herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L, restoring him to full undead status, and causing her own body to become inert.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Marz, Marcos| inker= Ferreira, Julio; Del Negro, Luciana; Jose, Ruy| story= Lost Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= 1| date= February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James; [[Tony Bedard|Bedard, Tony]]| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Marz, Marcos| inker= Ferreira, Julio; Ferreira, Eber; Del Negro, Luciana| story= Troubled Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= 2| date= March 2010}}</ref>

===Silver Age and Bronze Age===
[[File:Supermans girlfriend Lois Lane 53.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #53 (Nov. 1964), art by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].]]

When the reading audience of superhero comic books became predominately young boys in the mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving [[extraterrestrials]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures, and bizarre plots. 

Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to Superman imposter from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Otto Binder|Binder, Otto]]| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Shrinking Superman!| title= Action Comics| issue= 245| date= October 1958}}</ref> and a man from the future.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bernstein, Robert| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Man Who Married Lois Lane| title= Superman| issue= 136| date= April 1960}}</ref> All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during the 1950s, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC's title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in 1957,<ref>[[Alexander C.

While Lois suspicious of Superman's secret identity as early as ''Superman'' #7 (1940), her suspicions grew during the early Silver Age, with many stories in her series focusing on her attempts to prove Superman and Clark Kent were one and the same. Stories showed Superman using various means to protect his secret identity from Lois, including his [[Superman robot]]s or Batman disguising himself as Clark/Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Schwartz, Alvin]]| penciller= Swan, Curt| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= Batman – Double for Superman!| title= [[World's Finest Comics]]| issue= 71| date= July–August 1954}}</ref>

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society changed, Lois' character changed as well. In ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look.<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 128: "She started trading in her generic blouse and pencil skirt combinations for a "mod" wardrobe filled with printed dresses, go-go boots, mini skirts, and hot pants."</ref> Stories in the 1970s depicted Lois as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more adventures without Superman being involved and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity.

Lois had a series featured in ''[[The Superman Family]]'' (an [[anthology]] title started in the mid-1970s after the cancellation of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' and ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'') from 1974 to 1982. In her series, Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian [[martial arts|martial art]] of Klurkor, taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Dorfman, Leo| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= [[Pete Costanza|Costanza, Pete]]| story= Courtship, Kryptonian Style!| title=Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane| issue= 78| date= October 1967}}</ref> There were several cameos of the [[New Gods]], including [[Desaad]] and [[Darkseid]]. Lois Lane was the backup series in ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl]]'' in 1982 to 1983.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2626|title= The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl}}</ref>

During the Silver and Bronze Age, Lois' backstory became more fully fleshed out, with various stories explaining her life before becoming employed at the ''Daily Planet''. This backstory was attributed to the Lois Lane of Earth-One.

As summarized in various stories, Lois was born to Sam and Ella Lane and grew up on their farm in the small town of Pittsdale.<ref name="loislane13" /> While Lois was a toddler, she encountered a [[rattlesnake]] in the woods near the Lane family farm. The snake was scared away by one of Kal-El's baby toys which had landed nearby in one of Jor-El's experimental rockets.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry|penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt|inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt|story= Lois Lane's Childhood|title= Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane|issue= 26|date= July 1961}}</ref> At the age of two, Lois suffered [[measles]], and at the age of three, [[Pertussis|whooping cough]].<ref name="supermanfamily206">{{cite comic| writer= [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|penciller= [[Bob Oksner|Oksner, Bob]]|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= Have You Ever Told Me the Story of My Life?|title= Superman Family|issue= 206|date= March–April 1981}}</ref> At an unspecified time during Lois' childhood, her younger sister Lucy Lane was born.<ref name="supermanfamily206" />

During Lois' adolescence, she won a youth contest run by the ''Daily Planet'', with the prize being a trip to Metropolis to spend a week working as a cub reporter for the newspaper. There, she first met Clark Kent of Smallville, who was the other winner of the contest. Lois found Clark dull and became more interested in asking him for information about Superboy after learning Clark came from Smallville. During the week in Metropolis, Lois made a bet with Clark to see who would get the most [[Scoop (term)|scoops]], which turned out to be Lois, as Clark was forced to constantly go into action as Superboy. Lois met Superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories. At the end of the week, Clark paid off Lois' bet (an [[ice cream sundae]]), and the two returned to their respective hometowns.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Finger|Finger, Bill]]|penciller=Wenzel, Al|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= How Clark Kent Met Lois Lane|title= [[Adventure Comics]]|issue= 128|date= May 1948}}</ref> Lois would meet Superboy (but not Clark Kent) again during her adolescence while attending an all-girls summer camp near Smallville.

Upon finishing high school, Lois left Pittsdale and attended Raleigh College to study journalism. While in college, Lois worked for the student newspaper, the ''Raleigh Review'', as a reporter and eventually its co-editor.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Dorfman, Leo|penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt|inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt|story= Lois Lane's College Scoops|title= Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane|issue= 55|date= February 1965}}</ref> After graduating from college, Lois became permanently employed at the ''Daily Planet''.

After the 1985–1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] revised the Superman legend and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity. Before this happened, a final non-canonical imaginary story ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'' was written by [[Alan Moore]], meant as a send-off for the pre-Crisis versions of the characters, including Lois. Published at the same time but in Earth-One continuity was a two-issue miniseries, ''Lois Lane'', in which she investigates missing children.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mindy Newell|Newell, Mindy]]|penciller= [[Gray Morrow|Morrow, Gray]]|inker= Morrow, Gray|story= Chapter I: Ignorance Was Bliss/Chapter II: Dark Realities|title= Lois Lane|issue= 1|date= August 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Newell, Mindy|penciller= Morrow, Gray|inker= Morrow, Gray|story= Chapter Three: Quicksand/Chapter Four: Quicksand!|title= Lois Lane|issue= 2|date= September 1986}}</ref>

===Modern Age===
[[Image:loislane.png|left|thumb|Lois Lane, as she appears on the cover of ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' #2 (Oct. 1986), art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]

Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which significantly rewrote [[Origin of Superman|Superman's origin]] and history. In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive.

Lois' first real relationship in this version was with [[Gangbuster (DC Comics)|Jose Delgado]], a Metropolis vigilante whose legs are shattered in a battle with a [[Lexcorp]] [[cyborg]]/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL and Lois' attraction to Superman with whom Delgado felt he had to compete.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry|penciller= Ordway, Jerry|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The Ledge|title= [[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]|issue= 448|date= December 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry|penciller= Ordway, Jerry|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Triple Threat|title= The Adventures of Superman|issue= 450|date= January 1989}}</ref>

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with just Superman, although she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #460–463 and ''Action Comics'' #650.

Following Clark's brief rampage under the influence of the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]], Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for "selling out" to [[Blaze and Satanus|Collin Thornton]] and running ''Newstime'' Magazine, but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to "''grovel for his job back''". Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her. The two became a couple, and eventually, Lois accepted a proposal of marriage.<ref name="Superman50" /><ref name="Manning247" /> Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]]| penciller= [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]]| inker= McLeod, Bob| story= Secrets in the Night| title= Action Comics| issue= 662| date= February 1991| publisher= DC Comics}}</ref><ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 249: "With their nuptials looming, Clark thought it was time to reveal his dual identity to the love of his life, in this landmark issue by writer Roger Stern and artist Bob McLeod."</ref>

DC Comics had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's ''[[Superman vol. 2]]'' #75. With the then-upcoming television show ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV. Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in ''Superman'' #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a [[battle royal]] with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the [[mermaid]] [[Lori Lemaris]]). Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her. When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been depleted, and that he was her editor (due to [[Perry White]]'s cancer). Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief, Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

Lois and Clark were finally married in the comic book ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'' (Dec. 1996), which featured the work of nearly every living artist who had ever worked on Superman.<ref name="Manning275" /> The issue was published during the week of October 6, 1996, coinciding with an episode of the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', which featured the wedding of the two characters.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kryptonsite.com/manyfaces-wedding.htm|title= The Many Faces Of...

Since their marriage, Clark and Lois continue to be one of the strongest relationships in comics. In 2006, the couple took the next step in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they named [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]]. The boy is later discovered to be the son of [[Jor-El]]'s foe, [[General Zod]]. Although initially uneasy about raising a super-powered child, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being 'Mommy Lois.' Following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the [[Phantom Zone]] rift, trapping himself inside with Zod's forces, leaving Lois without her son.

In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lois and Perry are caught in an explosion triggered by [[Clayface]] destroying the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and Lois is critically injured. In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he is to save his wife's life. The story is continued in the [[Stereoscopy|3D]] tie-in comic ''Superman Beyond'', where [[Monitor (comics)|the female Monitor]] Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him and several of his multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising care for Lois. After defeating the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brings back a distilled drop of [[Bleed (comics)|The Bleed]] and administers it to Lois through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois is later seen in ''Final Crisis'' #6, one of the few still free humans.

After the events of ''[[Superman: New Krypton]]'' Superman must leave Earth for an undetermined amount of time swearing off his Earthly connections in the eyes of his fellow [[Kryptonian]]s to keep an eye on General Zod the New Kryptonian military commander, but he secretly tells Lois he still considers her his wife and will come back to her. In the issues of ''[[Action Comics]]'' Lois has reunited with [[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]] who has aged to adulthood in the past months and became the new Metropolis hero [[Nightwing]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Greg Rucka|Rucka, Greg]]| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= The Sleepers Part I| title= Action Comics| issue= 875| date= May 2009}}</ref> Supergirl and Lana visit Lois' apartment to tell her the bad news that her sister [[Lucy Lane]] was killed during a battle with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].

Lois hands her exposé in and the government is after her for treason. With agents on her tail, she makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the ''Daily Planet'' under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow.

In ''[[Superman: Grounded]]'', Superman begins a journey through America to reconnect with the American people, and Lois, though confused at first, supports his choice.

Following ''Convergence'', DC announced the spin-off comic book series ''Superman: Lois and Clark'', debuting in October 2015 by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Lee Weeks]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Yehl |first=Joshua |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/comic-con-lois-and-clark-return-for-new-superman-comic-with-their-son|title= Comic-Con: Lois and Clark Return For New Superman comic - With Their Son!|publisher= IGN|date=July 10, 2015|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151103104655/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/comic-con-lois-and-clark-return-for-new-superman-comic-with-their-son|archivedate= November 3, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref> The eight-issue series is set several years after the ''Convergence'' event, where Clark and Lois and their son Jonathan has been living and working in the New 52 universe.

===DC Rebirth===
In June 2016, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic book titles with [[DC Rebirth]]. The publisher once again re-established the Post-''Crisis'' Superman as the principal Superman in DC comics, along with his wife, Lois Lane, and their son, [[Jonathan Samuel Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen|first=Jess|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/13/11-cool-things-we-learned-from-dcs-rebirth-catalog|title= 11 Cool Things We Learned From DC's Rebirth Catalog|publisher=IGN|date=April 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424000801/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/13/11-cool-things-we-learned-from-dcs-rebirth-catalog|archivedate= April 24, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref>

===Superwoman===

Lois was the first person to assume the [[Superwoman]] persona and has become the [[superheroine]] on several occasions. Her first appearance as Superwoman (as well as Superwoman's first appearance in DC Comics) was in ''Action Comics'' #60 (May 1943).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry|penciller= Shuster, Joe|inker= Shuster, Joe| story=Lois Lane -- Superwoman| title= Action Comics| issue=60| date=May 1943}}</ref> The story is set in a dream sequence, where, after Lois is hit by a truck, she dreams a transfusion of Superman's blood gives her superpowers and she becomes Superwoman. In ''Superman'' #45, Lois believes Hocus and Pocus—a pair of fraudulent magicians—have given her superpowers, and with Superman's help and intervention, Lois once again becomes Superwoman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Schwartz, Alvin]]| penciller= Sikela, John|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]| story= Lois Lane, Superwoman!| title= Superman| issue=45| date=March–April 1947}}</ref> In ''[[The Superman Family]]'' #207, the Earth-Two Lois gained superpowers from her husband, after Superman brought an extraterrestrial plant into their home, with Lois losing the powers after the death of the plant.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[E.

In the original [[Crime Syndicate of America]] on [[Earth-Three]], Lois Lane and Superwoman were two separate individual characters.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]| penciller= [[Mike Vosburg|Vosburg, Mike]]|inker= [[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]] | story= Crisis on Earth-3 (Reprise)!| title= Secret Society of Super-Villains| issue=14| date=April–May 1978}}</ref> Superwoman is a [[supervillain]] and Lois married Earth-Three's greatest champion, Alexander Luthor.

She inhabits the same [[antimatter]] universe which contains the planet [[Qward]]. The New 52 version of Superwoman of Earth-3 is also named Lois Lane and is part of the Crime Syndicate.

In ''[[All-Star Superman]]'', the 12 issue comic book series by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]], Lois becomes a [[Kryptonian]] Superwoman for 24 hours. In the story, Superman (who believed he was dying) revealed his secret identity to her and takes Lois to his [[Fortress of Solitude]] to spend her birthday. While at his Arctic sanctuary, he presents Lois with her birthday present, a formula called "Exo-Genes" created by Superman from his own [[DNA]], that allows Lois to have his powers for twenty-four hours. With her new Kryptonian powers and new Superwoman costume (made by Superman), the two spend the whole day together on different adventures and shared a kiss on the moon.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]| penciller=[[Frank Quitely|Quitely, Frank]]|inker= Grant, Jamie| story=Superman's Forbidden Room| title=All Star Superman| issue=2| date=February 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Morrison, Grant| penciller= Quitely, Frank|inker= Grant, Jamie| story=Sweet Dreams, Superwoman| title=All Star Superman| issue=3| date=May 2006}}</ref> At the end of the story, Superman proclaims his love for Lois, before he flies off into the sun to repair it. Lois later appeared as Superwoman in the animated [[All-Star Superman (film)|All-Star Superman]] film, voiced by [[Christina Hendricks]].

In [[DC Rebirth]], the ''New 52'' Lois and Lana gained superpowers due to the solar energy explosion caused by the death of the New 52 Superman. This results in both Lois and Lana becoming Superwoman, with Lois possessing all of Superman's traditional powers, while Lana has the ability to absorb solar energy and release it in other forms. Lois later dies at the hands of a female [[Bizarro]], being overloaded with solar energy the same way Superman was killed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://screenrant.com/superwoman-comic-lois-lane-superman-dead/|title= DC’s New Superwoman Unlocks Secret of Superman’s Death|first= Andrew|last= Dyce|date= August 11, 2016|publisher= Screen Rant|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161006054537/http://screenrant.com/superwoman-comic-lois-lane-superman-dead/|archivedate= October 6, 2016|deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Red Tornado===

Following the DC relaunch, the series ''[[Earth-Two#Reimagined: Earth 2 in The New 52|Earth 2]]'' debuted in 2012, set on the [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|parallel world]] of that name. It depicts a modern take on the Golden Age world, starring the [[Justice Society of America]] and superheroes of that period.

In ''Earth 2'', Lois Lane is married to [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]]. When Clark's cousin, [[Power Girl|Kara]] arrived on earth, she stayed with Clark's parents, before moving in and living with Clark and Lois. Lois considers Kara as her daughter and Kara calls Lois mom.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Bennett, Marguerite; [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Taylor, Tom]]|penciller= Smith, Andy; To, Marcus;|inker= Hanna, Scott |story = Collision |Title = Earth 2|Issue = 27|date = December 2014}}</ref> Five years prior to the start of the story, during the first [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] invasion of Earth 2, Lois was killed by one of [[Darkseid]]'s assassins at the Daily Planet, she died in her husband's arms.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Paul Levitz|Levitz, Paul]]| Penciller= Dougherty, Jed|inker= Dougherty, Jed|Title = [[Worlds' Finest]]|Issue = 32|date = May 2015}}</ref> Superman and many other heroes of Earth 2 perished in the war.

Five years later, as various heroes begin to rise and various gods from Apokolips begin to wreak havoc again.

Lois bands together with Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Batman (Thomas Wayne), Accountable (Jimmy Olsen) and the other gathered heroes to fight against the forces of Apokolips. After a protracted battle with what was thought to be a surviving brainwashed Superman, Lois realizes he is, in fact, a [[Bizarro]], and takes advantage of his deteriorating form to disintegrate him with a cyclone blast.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Taylor, Tom|penciller= Scott, Nicola|inker= Scott, Trevor |Story= The Kryptonian, Part Six |Title = Earth 2|Issue = 26|date = October 2014}}</ref> In the story, Lois is referred to by [[Doctor Fate]] as the "Resurrection hope".

During Superman's rampage and destruction on Earth 2, Lois is among a group that discovers Val-Zod, a Kryptonian, hidden in a cell beneath Arkham.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Taylor, Tom||Penciller=Scott, Nicola|inker= Scott, Trevor; Alvert, Oclair|Story=The Dark Age, Part 3 |Title = Earth 2|Issue = 19|date = March 2014}}</ref> Lois helps Val feel accepted and welcomed on Earth 2, learn to control his superpower, and overcome his [[agoraphobia]] (due to his prolonged travel in space to Earth).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Taylor, Tom|penciller= Scott, Nicola|inker= Scott, Trevor | Story= The Kryptonian, Part Two |Title = Earth 2|Issue = 22|date = June 2014}}</ref> Val-Zod eventually becomes the new Superman of Earth 2.

In the second Apokoliptian invasion of Earth 2, Lois and Kara are reunited, after Kara and [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] return to Earth 2 from Prime Earth.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Bennett, Marguerite; Johnson, Mike; Wilson, Daniel |Penciller= [[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]; Jimenez, Jorge; Siqueira, Paulo; [[Ardian Syaf|Syaf, Ardian]]|inker= Ferreira, Eber; Hope, Sandra; Jimenez, Jorge; Miki, Danny; [[Cam Smith|Smith, Cam]]| Story= Apokolips Now |Title = Earth 2: World's End|Issue = 1|date = December 2014}}</ref> Lois, along with Kara, Val, Huntress, Batman and other heroes, fights against the armies of Apokolips and new villains appearing across Earth 2.

He was revived by [[Desaad|DeSaad]] and was used as the genetic source for the Kryptonian clones. The extraction of his [[DNA]] corrupted his body leaving him without any powers.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer =Wilson, Daniel H.; Bennett, Marguerite; Johnston, Mike|penciller=Kirkham, Tyler; Sivesay, John; Segovia, Stephen; Paz, Jason; Rocha, Robson; Ortego, Guillermo; Pansica, Eduardo; Wong, Walden|Story=All Good Deeds...|Title = Earth 2: Worlds End|Issue = 9|date =February 2015}}</ref> Lois and Superman reunite briefly, before he sacrificed himself one last time, destroying the Parademon facilities using his corrupt DNA.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer =Wilson, Daniel H.; Bennett, Marguerite; Johnston, Mike|penciller=Kirkham, Tyler; Silva, R.B.; Pansica, Eduardo; Jimenez, Jorge; Rocha, Robson; Barrows, Eddy|Story=Sacrifice|Title = Earth 2: Worlds End|Issue = 15|date =March 2015}}</ref> After Superman's death, Lois gave Kara the symbol from his uniform, which was then worn by Kara in remembrance.

In the final days of Earth 2, Lois' instincts as a journalist lead her to attempt to preserve and record the history and stories of Earth 2 in her large memory bank in the hope that someday, someone will read the data and rebuild this world.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer= Levitz, Paul|penciller= Dougherty, Jed|inker= Hanna, Scott| Story= The Secret History of Superman & Batman Part One|Title= Worlds' Finest|Issue= 27|date= December 2014}}</ref> After the destruction of Earth 2, Lois and the remaining civilians and heroes of Earth 2 relocated to a new world.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer= [[Daniel H.

The writer of ''Earth 2'', [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Tom Taylor]], specifically resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 after he was told to kill off the character in the ''Injustice'' comic series. Taylor stated "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if I could bring back Lois. Then it was just a matter of working out exactly how."<ref>{{cite web|last= Santori-Griffith|first= Matt|url= http://www.comicosity.com/interview-tom-taylor-batman-earth-2/ | title = Tom Taylor Talks Batman and the Cast of ''Earth 2''|publisher= Comicosity|date= February 5, 2014|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150818072758/http://www.comicosity.com/interview-tom-taylor-batman-earth-2/|archivedate= August 18, 2015|deadurl= no| accessdate= December 1, 2014}}</ref> Taylor received "[[Women in Refrigerators#Women in Refrigerators Syndrome|Women in Refrigerators]]" criticism for his ''Injustice'' comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to "unfridge" Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope."<ref>{{cite web |last=Roger |first=Vaneta |url = http://www.newsarama.com/19662-unfridging-lois-just-one-of-the-surprises-tom-taylor-plans-for-dc-s-earth-2.html|title= 'Unfridging Lois' Just One of the Surprises Tom Taylor Plans For DC's ''Earth 2''|publisher= Newsarama|date= November 22, 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150722034314/http://www.newsarama.com/19662-unfridging-lois-just-one-of-the-surprises-tom-taylor-plans-for-dc-s-earth-2.html|archivedate= July 22, 2015|deadurl= no| accessdate=December 1, 2014}}</ref>

[[Nicola Scott]], the long-time artist on Earth 2, on drawing Red Tornado Lois, "I wanted Lois to be Lois, despite the fact that she’s metal.

==In other versions==
During the years 1942–1985 Editora Brasil-América and the [[Editora Abril]] which published the [[Brazil]]ian versions of Superman comics, Lois Lane's name was translated to "Miriam Lane" and later to "Miriam Lois Lane."

===''Kingdom Come''===
In the [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' (now Earth-22 in the [[DC Multiverse]]), flashbacks reveal that ten years prior to the story's beginning, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] murdered ninety-three people in the ''Daily Planet'' offices, including Lois.  Her death is the reason for Superman's retirement from heroics.

In the ''[[Justice Society of America]] Kingdom Come Special: Superman'' by [[Alex Ross]], the fate of Earth-22's Lois is fully revealed. She survived the Joker venom by wearing a gas mask and tried to fight the Joker with a fire extinguisher, only to be bashed in the head with her ''Daily Planet'' paperweight. By the time Superman arrives at the ''Daily Planet'' building she was still alive, but dying from the fatal wound. Lois' dying words to Superman were "Thank you for loving me", and to remind him not to cross the line by becoming a killer or lose Clark Kent.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]]| penciller= Ross, Alex| inker= Ross, Alex| story= Kingdom Come Special: Superman| title= JSA Kingdom Come Special: Superman| issue= 1| date= January 2009}}</ref>

===''Superman: Red Son''===
In this [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[Superman: Red Son|Red Son]]'', Superman's escape rocket did not land in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], but in the Soviet Union under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Lois is married to [[Lex Luthor]] but still uses the surname Lane for her articles in the ''Daily Planet''. Superman saves her life, and the two have an instant attraction with each other and Lois has feelings for him through the rest of the story. After the fall of Superman's Greater [[Soviet Union]] and presumed death, he attends his "funeral" wearing a suit and glasses. Superman's secret identity as Clark Kent does not exist on this alternate Earth.

===''JLA: The Nail''===
In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', where the Kents never found Clark, Lois is selected by [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to provide the Justice League with some positive media presentation after a recent propaganda campaign focuses on the idea that many modern metahumans are alien invaders. Tracking recent kidnapped heroes to a secret base, Lois is introduced to the Kents, who provide a safe house for various heroes after Lana Lang smuggled them out of the facility, and later discovers that the true mastermind behind the conspiracy is [[Jimmy Olsen]], mutated into a Kryptonian through genetic experiments carried out based on DNA samples found in Kal-El's crashed and abandoned ship. Jimmy is finally defeated by Kal-El, who was here raised by an Amish couple until their deaths at Olsen's hands, with Lois writing about how Kal-El's time with the Kents helped him accept his abilities and grow into the Superman he should have been.

In the sequel, ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Lois helps the Kents create Kal-El's 'Clark' disguise- albeit naming him 'Carl' on impulse- to give him a chance at a normal life outside of his role as Superman, reasoning that the simplicity of the glasses will stop people paying too much attention to him, while their original plan to completely cover him with a false beard would make people suspect that Kal-El had something to hide.

===''Superman: Kal''===
In ''Superman: Kal'', where Kal-El's rocket landed on Earth in the Middle Ages, Lady Loisse is the daughter of the late Lord Lane, the protector of the village who was murdered. She is held captive by Baron Luthor, who hopes to make her his bride. Lois falls for Kal, a blacksmith's apprentice after he wins a contest against Luthor's best fighters. She accepts his request for her hand in marriage, as payment for him forging a suit of armor for Luthor from his rocket. After their wedding, Loisse is taken from Kal by Luthor, who subsequently killed her.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dave Gibbons|Gibbons, Dave]]| penciller= [[José Luis García-López|García-López, José Luis]]| inker= García-López, José Luis| story= Superman: Kal| title= Superman: Kal| issue= 1| date= 1995}}</ref>

===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, a young Lois Lane sneaks into the facility where her father Sam Lane is stationed to bring him a birthday cake. During a breakout, Lois briefly encounters [[Superman|Kal-El]] and [[Apollo (comics)|Neil Sinclair]]. Sinclair attempts to pursue revenge against her father for the experiments that were performed on him. Sam traps Sinclair and himself in the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]; Francis, Lowell| penciller= [[Gene Ha|Ha, Gene]]| inker= Ha, Gene| story= In These Small Hands| title= Flashpoint: Project Superman| issue= 2| date= September 2011}}</ref>

Years later, Lois is reporting on a fashion show in [[Montmartre]] when the Atlanteans flooded Europe. She is saved by the Amazons who take her to "New Themiscyra" (the United Kingdom). Once there, she learns that Jimmy Olsen, who dies in the flood while trying to save an old man, was an agent of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. Lois agrees to spy on the Amazons for Cyborg.
