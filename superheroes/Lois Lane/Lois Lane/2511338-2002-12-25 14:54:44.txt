'''Lois Lane''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Superman]] stories.

She is Superman's chief romantic interest and a reporter for the major metropolitan newspaper, the [[Daily Planet]].  She debuted in [[Action Comics]] #1 ([[1938]]).  Though an accomplished [[journalism|journalist]] the social climate of the era and the fact that rival reporter [[Clark Kent]] got an amazing number of exclusive stories about Superman led to her demotion to "lovelorn" columnist.  This led to her rivalry with Clark Kent and a penchant for taking more risks in the pursuit of news stories.

As the audience for comics began gravitating towards young boys, comic stories shifted in focus from investigative journalism, political corruption and mobsters to fantastic plots involving aliens, fantasy creatures and bizarre, often contrived, plots.  Lois's main interests became vying with rival [[Lana Lang]] for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, and tricking or otherwise forcing Superman into [[marriage]].  Her popularity rose during this period and she gained her own comic book though with her role clearly delineated in the title as ''Superman's Girl Friend Lois Lane''.  Eventually as attitudes to women changed in the 1970s, Lois was increasingly depicted as being very capable in dealing with more mundane dangers and more respectful of Superman's privacy.

When the Superman comics were [[retcon]]ned in [[1986]] Lois Lane began her relationship with both Clark Kent and Superman anew.  Lois remained respectful of Superman but embarked upon a relationship with Clark.  After a number of years of courtship Clark proposed to Lois.  She accepted, after which she was told of Clark Kent's identity as Superman.  After an extended engagement during which Superman died and returned to life, the couple finally married in [[1996]].
