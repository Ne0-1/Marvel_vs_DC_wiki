'''Lois Lane'''<!-- <ref>Superman: The Wedding and Beyond, 1997</ref> --> is a fictional character appearing in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She is the primary [[love interest]] of [[Superhero]] [[Superman]]. Like Superman's alter ego, [[Clark Kent]], she is a reporter for the [[Metropolis]] newspaper "[[The Daily Planet]]". Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], she [[First appearance|first appeared]] in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938). Lois is Superman's chief romantic interest, and for fifteen years in the DC [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], was his wife.
Lois Lane's character was created from many influences, her physical appearance was originally based on [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]], a [[model (person)|model]] hired by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster who would later marry Siegel. The character's personality was based on [[Torchy Blane]], a female reporter featured in a series of films from the 1930s. Siegel took her name from actress [[Lane Sisters|Lola Lane]], who portrayed Torchy in one of the middle entries.<ref>Letters to the Editor, ''Time'' magazine (May 30, 1988), pp. 6-7.</ref> She is also based on real life journalist [[Nellie Bly]].

Depictions of Lois Lane have varied since her character was created in 1938, spanning the 70 year history of [[Superman comics]] and other media adaptations. During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], she was the star of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'', a comic title that had a light and frivolous tone. However, the original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] version of Lois, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a tough-as-nails [[journalist]] and intellectual equal to Superman. One thing has remained throughout the character's 70 year history, she has always been the most prominent love interest in Superman's life and is seen by many fans as the archetypical comic book love interest.

The character was ranked 78th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 50| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==Publication history==

Lois Lane made her debut in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 (June 1938) in the first published Superman story.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1930s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 20 |quote = Lois Lane was established early...but she rejected Clark [Kent] as a 'spineless, unbearable coward.'}}</ref> Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years (depending on the comic writers' handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time), but in most incarnations she has been depicted as a determined, strong-willed person, whether it involves beating her rival reporter [[Clark Kent]] to a story or (in what became a trademark of 1950s and 1960s era Superman stories) alternating between elaborate schemes to convince Superman to marry her and proving to others her suspicion that Clark Kent was in reality Superman. She also traditionally had a cool attitude toward Clark, who in her view paled in comparison to his alter ego Superman. At times, the character has been portrayed as a damsel in distress.

Lois's appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion, or media adaptations. For instance, in the mid 1990s, when the series [[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]] began airing, Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress [[Teri Hatcher]], and her eyes were typically violet to match her character on the television cartoon series [[Superman: The Animated Series]], after that show began airing. Traditionally, Lois has black hair, though for a period from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, Lois was depicted with reddish brown hair in the comics.

Lois is the daughter of Ellen (alternately Ella) and [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]]. In the earlier comics, her parents were [[farmer]]s in a town called Pittsdale;<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Bernstein, Robert]] | penciller= [[Kurt Schaffenberger|Schaffenberger, Kurt]]| inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt| story= Introducing ...

Lois also has one younger sibling, her sister [[Lucy Lane]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | penciller = Byrne, John| inker = [[John Beatty (illustrator)|Beatty, John]] | story = The Power That Failed! | title = [[Superman vol. 2|Superman]] | volume = 2 | issue = 19 | date = July 1988 | publisher = DC Comics | page = 2 | panel = 6 }}</ref>

In most versions of Superman, Lois is shown to be a crack investigative reporter, one of the best in the city and certainly the best at the newspaper she works at. However, despite such brilliance, she has generally been unable to see through Clark's rather primitive disguise of glasses, and figure out that he is Superman. Despite being the character that is most up close and personal with both Superman and Clark Kent. Sometimes (particularly in [[Silver Age]] stories) Lois suspects that Clark is Superman, but generally fails to prove it. Sometimes the contradiction is played for humor.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Superman27.PNG|thumb|210px|The Golden Age Lois Lane and Superman, from the cover of ''Superman'' #27 (March–April 1944). Pencils by [[Wayne Boring]].]]
The comics have seen several incarnations of Lois Lane over the decades.

===Golden Age===

In the earliest [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was featured as an aggressive, career minded reporter for the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'' (the paper's name was changed to the ''Daily Planet'' in ''Action Comics'' #23 in 1940). After Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, Lois found herself attracted to Superman, but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent. Starting as early as the early 1940s, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]]| penciller= [[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]]| inker= [[John Sikela|Sikela, John]] | story= Man Or Superman?| title= [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]| issue= 17 | date= July–August 1942}}</ref> and started to make various attempts at uncovering his [[secret identity]], all of which backfired usually thanks to Superman's efforts.

In the Golden Age comics, Lois also had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated [[tall tale]]s and fibs to adults.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry| penciller= Sikela, John| inker= [[Ed Dobrotka|Dobrotka, Ed]]| story= Cinderella -- a la Superman| title= Action Comics | issue= 59| date= April 1943}}</ref> Susie's last appearance was in ''Superman'' #95 (February 1955).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[William Woolfolk|Woolfolk, Bill]]| penciller= [[Wayne Boring|Boring, Wayne]]| inker= [[Stan Kaye|Kaye, Stan]]| story= Susie's Enchanted Isle| title= Superman| issue= 95| date= February 1955}}</ref> Subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

===Earth Two version===
DC instituted its [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity, and introduced the [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #73 (August 1969).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]| penciller= [[Dick Dillin|Dillin, Dick]]| inker= [[Sid Greene|Greene, Sid]]| story= Star Light, Star Bright--Death Star I See Tonight!| title= [[Justice League of America]]| issue= 73| date= August 1969}}</ref> This [[retcon]] declared the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane stories (i.e. comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) as having taken place on the parallel world of "[[Earth-Two]]" versus the then mainstream ([[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]) universe of "Earth-One." In ''Action Comics'' #484 (June 1978), a flashback story reveals Earth Two's Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old [[Justice Society of America]] enemy, [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted. Clark and Lois began to date each other, and were soon married. However, during the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman, and after recruiting the aid of the Wizard, restored Clark's memory.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]]| penciller= [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]] | inker= [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]]| story= Superman Takes a Wife| title= Action Comics| issue= 484| date= June 1978}}</ref>

The now-married Lois and Clark starred in a series of stories in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #195-#199 and #201-#222 titled "Mr and Mrs Superman," which presented their further adventures early in their marriage. Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[E. Nelson Bridwell|Bridwell, E. Nelson]]| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= Giella, Joe| story= Susie's Flying Saucer| title= Superman Family| issue= 199| date= January–February 1980}}</ref> Years later, Lois and Clark acted as parental figures for [[Power Girl]], Superman's cousin, after she arrived on Earth.

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seemingly seen for the final time, as Lois, the Earth-Two Superman, and the [[Superboy Prime|Superboy of Earth Prime]] are taken by [[Earth-Three|Earth Three's]] [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] into a paradise like dimension at the end of the story. Following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths,'' this version of Lois was retroactively removed from DC's continuity.

In 2005's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post Crisis [[DC Universe]] from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her [[octogenarian]] status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, however, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of Superman in ''Infinite Crisis'' #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he couldn't let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy Prime at the end of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words "''It's... not... going...''" as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]]'s, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.

Lois later returns as a sinister [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] with her husband in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover.  Her first task is to kidnap [[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha Kent]] with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for [[Kal-El]], [[Connor Kent]], and Martha, to be reunited with [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in death. However, she proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until [[Krypto]] intervened, ripping the black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], and reaching town to aid others unhindered.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (comics)|Robinson, James]]| penciller= [[Eddy Barrows|Barrows, Eddy]]| inker= [[Ruy Jose|Jose, Ruy]]; [[Julio Ferreira|Ferreira, Julio]]| story= A Sleepy Little Town | title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 1| date= October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= Psycho Piracy!| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 2| date= November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; [[Allan Goldman|Goldman, Allan]]| inker= Jose, Ruy; [[Eber Ferreira|Ferreira, Eber]]| story= The Long Dark Knight| title= Blackest Night: Superman| issue= 3| date= December 2009}}</ref> 

Black Lantern Lois later appears to [[Power Girl]], claiming that she has escaped the ring's corrupting influence, and needs her help. However, this is just a ploy to get close enough to her husband's body, which was being held in the JSA headquarters after his black ring had been removed. Black Lantern Lois "sacrifices" herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L, restoring him to full undead status, and causing her own body to become inert.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; [[Marcos Marz|Marz, Marcos]]| inker= Ferreira, Julio; [[Luciana Del Negro|Del Negro, Luciana]]; Jose, Ruy| story= Lost Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= 1| date= February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Robinson, James; [[Tony Bedard|Bedard, Tony]]| penciller= Barrows, Eddy; Marz, Marcos| inker= Ferreira, Julio; Ferreira, Eber; Del Negro, Luciana| story= Troubled Souls| title= Blackest Night: JSA| issue= 2| date= March 2010}}</ref>

===Silver Age===
[[File:Supermans girlfriend Lois Lane 53.jpg|thumb|250px|Superman and Lois, from the cover of ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #53 (November 1964). Art by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].]]
When the reading audience of [[comic book]]s became predominately young boys in the mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward [[science fiction]] inspired plots involving [[extraterrestrials]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures, and bizarre plots. Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, and tricking or otherwise forcing Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies, and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to Superman imposter from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Otto Binder|Binder, Otto]]| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Shrinking Superman!| title= Action Comics| issue= 245| date= October 1958}}</ref> and a man from the future.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bernstein, Robert| penciller= Boring, Wayne| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= The Man Who Married Lois Lane| title= Superman| issue= 136| date= April 1960}}</ref> All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during this decade, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC's title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in 1957,<ref>[[Alexander C. Irvine|Irvine, Alex]] "1950s" in Dolan, p. 85: "The future title ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' got a tryout in issues #9 and #10 of ''Showcase'', when Lois Lane stepped in as the lead feature."</ref> DC created an on going title for the character, titled [[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]<ref>Irvine "1950s" in Dolan, p. 89: "Following her successful test run in the pages of ''Showcase'' #9 and #10, Lois Lane got her own title ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' in which Superman was ever the prankster."</ref> beginning in March 1958 and running for 137 issues until September 1974. Most of these stories placed an emphasis on Lois' romance with Superman, and were drawn by artist [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]; indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lois became cited by many<ref>{{cite book|last = Voger|first = Mark|authorlink = |coauthors = Voglesong, Kathy|chapter= Front Page Romance |title = Hero Gets Girl!: The Life & Art Of Kurt Schaffenberger|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2003|pages = 43–45| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8_mF5qdrMR0C&pg=PA43&dq=Front+Page+Romance+Kurt+Schaffenberger&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QUyfT7abB6fN6QGA3LCkAg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Front%20Page%20Romance%20Kurt%20Schaffenberger&f=false| isbn = 1-893905-29-2

While Lois had started to become suspicious of Superman's secret identity during the Golden Age (as early as ''Superman'' #7 in 1940), her suspicions reached their peak during the early Silver Age, with many stories in her solo series focusing on her attempts to prove Superman and Clark Kent were one and the same. To wit, various stories from this era show Superman using various means to protect his secret identity from Lois, including his [[Superman robot]]s or Batman disguising himself as Clark/Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alvin Schwartz (comics)|Schwartz, Alvin]]| penciller= Swan, Curt| inker= Kaye, Stan| story= Batman - Double for Superman!| title= [[World's Finest Comics]]| issue= 71| date= July–August 1954}}</ref>

Lana Lang, a character introduced in the ''Superboy'' series, was initially introduced in Superman's setting in ''Superman'' #78 in 1952, but became a permanent part of the Superman era stories with ''Showcase'' #9 in 1957. From that point on, Lana Lang became a frequently seen rival of Lois for Superman's affections.

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society changed, Lois' character changed as well. In ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' issue #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look.<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 128: "She started trading in her generic blouse and pencil skirt combinations for a "mod" wardrobe filled with printed dresses, go-go boots, mini skirts, and hot pants."</ref> Stories in the 1970s depicted her as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more solo adventures without Superman being involved, and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity.  In her solo stories in [[Superman Family]] (an [[anthology]] title started in the mid 1970s after the cancellation of [[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]] and [[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]), Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian [[martial arts|martial art]] of Klurkor, taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of [[Kandor]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Leo Dorfman|Dorfman, Leo]]| penciller= Schaffenberger, Kurt| inker= [[Pete Costanza|Costanza, Pete]]| story= Courtship, Kryptonian Style!| title=Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane| issue= 78| date= October 1967}}</ref> There were also several cameos of the [[New Gods]], including [[Desaad]] and [[Darkseid]].

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', writer and artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] revised the Superman legend, and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity; before this happened, a final non canonical "imaginary story" ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'' was written by writer [[Alan Moore]], meant as a send-off for the "pre-Crisis" versions of the characters, including Lois.

===Modern Age===
[[Image:loislane.png|160px|left|thumb|Lois Lane, as she appears on the cover of ''The Man of Steel'' (miniseries) #2 (1986). Pencils by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]
Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which significantly rewrote [[Origin of Superman|Superman's origin]] and history. In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive.

Lois' first real relationship in this version was with [[Gangbuster|Jose Delgado]], a Metropolis vigilante whose legs are shattered in a battle with a [[Lexcorp]] [[cyborg]]/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL and Lois' attraction to Superman with whom Delgado felt he had to compete. (''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #448/#450).

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with just Superman, although she was attracted to him.  One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this new revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #460-463 and ''Action'' #650.

Following Clark's brief rampage under the influence of [[The Eradicator]], Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for "selling out" to [[Blaze and Satanus|Collin Thornton]] and running ''Newstime'' Magazine, but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to "''grovel for his job back.''" Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her. The two became a couple, and eventually Lois accepted a proposal of marriage (''Superman'' (vol. 2) #50).<ref name="Superman50" /><ref name="Manning247" />  Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]]| penciller= [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]]| inker= McLeod, Bob| story= Secrets in the Night| title= Action Comics| volume= | issue= 662| date= February 1991| publisher= DC Comics| page= | panel= }}</ref><ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 249: "With their nuptials looming, Clark thought it was time to reveal his dual identity to the love of his life, in this landmark issue by writer Roger Stern and artist Bob McLeod."</ref>

DC had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's Superman (vol. 2) #75. However, with the then-upcoming television show [[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]], DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV. Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in Superman (vol. 2) #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a [[battle royal]] with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the [[mermaid]] [[Lori Lemaris]]). Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her. When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits, and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been depleted, and that he was her editor (due to [[Perry White]]'s cancer). Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief, Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

Lois and Clark were finally wed in the one-shot special ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'', which featured the work of nearly every then-living artist who had ever worked on Superman.<ref name="Manning275" /> The issue was published during the week of October 6, 1996, coinciding with an episode of ''Lois & Clark'' that also featured the wedding of the two characters.<ref>Dimino, Russ.
