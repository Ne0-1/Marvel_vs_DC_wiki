'''Lois Lane'''<!-- <ref>Superman: The Wedding and Beyond, 1997</ref> --> is a [[fictional character]], the primary [[love interest]] of [[Superman]] in the [[comic book]]s of [[DC Comics]].  Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], she [[First appearance|first appeared]] in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938).

Lois is Superman's chief romantic interest and, for fifteen years in the DC [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], was his wife. Like Superman's [[alter ego]] [[Clark Kent]], she is a [[journalism|reporter]] for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper, ''The [[Daily Planet]]''.

Lois' physical appearance was originally based on [[Joanne Siegel|Joanne Carter]],<ref name="Richardson">Richardson, James. "The Early History of Lois Lane: Superman's Girlfriend is Forever Needing Rescuing From Peril," Suite101.com (Dec. 16, 2008). Accessed Apr. 5, 2009.</ref> a [[model (person)|model]] hired by Siegel and Shuster who would later marry Siegel.

Lois' personality was based on [[Torchy Blane]], a female reporter featured in a series of films from the 1930s. Siegel took her name from actress [[Lane Sisters|Lola Lane]], who portrayed Torchy in one of the middle entries.<ref name="Richardson" /><ref>Letters to the Editor, ''Time'' magazine (May 30, 1988), pp. 6-7.</ref> She is also based on real life journalist [[Nellie Bly]].

Depictions of Lois Lane have varied since her character was created in 1938, spanning the 70-year history of Superman [[comic book|comic]]s and other media adaptations. During the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], she was the star of ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'', a comic title that had a light and frivolous tone. However, the original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] version of Lois, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portray Lois as a tough-as-nails [[journalist]] and intellectual equal to Superman. One thing has remained throughout the character's 70-year history, however: she has always been the most prominent love-interest in Superman's life and is seen by many fans as the archetypical comic book love interest.

==Publication history==
Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years (depending on the comic writers' handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time), but in most incarnations she has been depicted as a determined, strong-willed person, whether it involves beating her rival reporter [[Clark Kent]] to a story or (in what became a trademark of 1950s and 1960s era Superman stories) alternating between elaborate schemes to convince Superman to marry her and proving to others her suspicion that Clark was in reality Superman. She also traditionally had a cool attitude toward Clark, who in her view paled in comparison to his alter ego. At times, the character has been portrayed as a [[damsel in distress]].

Lois' appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion, or media adaptations. For instance, in the mid-1990s, when the series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois and Clark]]'' began airing, Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress [[Teri Hatcher]], and her eyes were typically violet to match the Lois of the television [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' after that show began airing. Traditionally, Lois has black hair, though for a period from the late 1980s through the late 1990s, Lois was depicted with brown hair in the comics.

Lois is the daughter of Ellen (alternately Ella) and [[Sam Lane]].<ref>Mark Waid bio, DragonCon comic book convention program.</ref> In the earlier comics, her parents were [[farmer]]s in a town called Pittsdale; the modern comics, however, depict Sam as a retired soldier, and Lois as a former "[[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Army brat]]", born at [[Ramstein Air Base]] with Lois having been trained by her father in areas such as hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms. Lois also has one younger sibling, her sister [[Lucy Lane]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | inker = [[John Beatty (illustrator)|Beatty, John]] | story = The Power That Failed! | title = Superman | volume = 2 | issue = 19 | date = July 1988 | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | page = 2 | panel = 6 }}</ref>

In most versions of Superman, Lois is shown to be a crack investigative reporter, one of the best in the city and certainly the best at the newspaper she works at. However, despite such brilliance, she has generally been unable to see through Clark's rather primitive disguise of glasses and figure out that he is Superman—despite being the character who is most up close and personal with both Superman and Clark. Sometimes Lois suspects that Clark is Superman, but generally fails to prove it. Sometimes the contradiction is played for humor.

After Clark reveals to Lois that he is Superman, and proposes to her,<ref>''Superman (vol. 2) #50 (1990)</ref> [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|she accepts and marries him]] in the December 1996 special ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]''.<ref>[[Dan Jurgens]], [[Karl Kesel]], [[David Michelinie]], [[Louise Simonson]], [[Roger Stern]].

==Fictional character biography==
The comics have seen several incarnations of Lois Lane over the decades.

===Golden Age===
[[Image:Superman27.PNG|thumb|240px|The Golden Age Lois Lane and Superman, from the cover of ''Superman'' #27 (March–April 1944). Pencils by [[Wayne Boring]].]]
In the earliest [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was featured as an aggressive, career-minded reporter for the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'' (the paper's name was changed to ''The Daily Planet'' in the early 1940s), who, after Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, found herself attracted to Superman, but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent. Starting in the late 1940s or early 1950s comics, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman, and started to make various attempts at uncovering his [[secret identity]], all of which backfired (usually thanks to Superman's efforts).

In the Golden Age comics, Lois also had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated [[tall tale]]s and fibs to adults. Susie's last appearance was in 1955; subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

After DC instituted its [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity, it was deemed that the Lois of the Golden Age comics (i.e., comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) lived on the parallel world of "Earth-Two" versus the then-mainstream ([[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]]) universe of "Earth-One."  In 1978's ''Action Comics'' #484, it was revealed that sometime in the 1950s, the Earth-Two Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old [[Justice Society of America]] enemy, [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted. Clark and Lois began to date each other, and were soon married; however, during the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman, and after recruiting the aid of the Wizard, restored Clark's memory. A series of stories in ''The [[Superman Family]]'' #195-199 & #201-222 titled "Mr. and Mrs. Superman" presented the further adventures of the now-married Lois and Clark (in several of which Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character).

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent was seen for one of the final times, as she, the [[Kal-L|Earth-Two Superman]], and the [[Earth Prime]] [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] are taken by [[Earth-Three]]'s [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] (who himself was the son of Earth-Three's Lois Lane, who had perished, along with her husband Alexander Luthor, Sr., in the first issue of the series) into a paradise-like dimension at the end of the story (after all the parallel Earths, including Earth-Two, had been eliminated in favor of just one Earth), after which this version of Lois was (seemingly) permanently discarded from DC's continuity.

In 2005's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis [[DC Universe]] from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy-Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her [[octogenarian]] status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-2, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-2, however, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of Superman in ''Infinite Crisis'' #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he couldn't let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]] at the end of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words- "''It's... not... going...''"- as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]]'s, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.

Lois later returns as a sinister [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] with her husband in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover. Now an [[undead]], Lois is now lacking the compassion she used to have.  Her first task is to kidnap [[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha Kent]] with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for [[Kal-El]], [[Connor Kent]], and Martha, to be reunited with [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in death. However, she proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until [[Krypto]] came to her aid, ripping the black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], and reaching town to aid others unhindered.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #1-3 (August - October 2009)</ref>

Black Lantern Lois later appears to [[Power Girl]], claiming that she has escaped the ring's corrupting influence, and needs her help. However, this is just a ploy to get close enough to her husband's body, which was being held in the JSA headquarters after his black ring had been removed. Black Lantern Lois "sacrifices" herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L, restoring him to full undead status, and causing her own body to become inert.<ref>''Blackest Night: JSA'' #1-2 (December 2009 - January 2010)</ref>

===Silver Age===
When the reading audience of [[comic book]]s became predominately young boys in the mid-to-late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward [[science fiction]]-inspired plots involving [[extraterrestrials]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures, and bizarre, often contrived, plots. Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival [[Lana Lang]] for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, and tricking or otherwise forcing Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that she could not be trusted to keep his secret identity hidden, and that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies (of course, this ignored the fact that his romantic relationship with her was already public knowledge). This change in Lois' personality from her earlier 1940s self might also be a result of American society's attitudes toward women and their societal roles in the 1950s. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era — to other characters such as [[Batman]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]]. She also married a convicted criminal on death row (and various Superman [[pastiche]]s). All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during this decade, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC's title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in 1957, DC created an on-going title for the character, titled ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' beginning in March 1958 and running for 137 issues until September 1974. Most of these placed an emphasis on Lois' romance with Superman, and were drawn by artist [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]; indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lois became cited by many<ref>Voger, Mark and Voglesong, Kathy (PHT). "Front Page Romance," ''Hero Gets Girl!: The Life and Art of Kurt Schaffenberger'' (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2003).</ref><ref name="Eury">Eury, Michael. "Kurt Schaffenberger: Ladies' Man," in "The Superman Mythology," ''The Krypton Companion: A Historical Exploration of Superman Comic Books of 1958-1986'' (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2006), p. 67.</ref>  as the "definitive" version of Lois, and he was often asked by DC editor [[Mort Weisinger]] to redraw other artists' depictions of Lois Lane in other DC titles where she appeared.<ref name="Eury" />

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society changed, Lois' character changed as well. In ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' issue #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then-more contemporary look.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 128 |quote = She started trading in her generic blouse-and-pencil skirt combinations for a "mod" wardrobe filled with printed dresses, go-go boots, mini-skirts, and hot pants.}}</ref> Stories in the 1970s depicted her as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more solo adventures without Superman being involved, and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity. For example, in her solo stories in ''[[Superman Family]]'' (an [[anthology]] title started in the mid-1970s after the cancellation of ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' and ''Superman's Pal, [[Jimmy Olsen]]''), Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian [[martial arts|martial art]] of Klurkor, taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle-city of [[Kandor]].<ref>''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #78 (Oct. 1967).</ref> There were also several cameos of the [[New Gods]], including [[DeSaad]] and [[Darkseid]].

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', writer and artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] revised the Superman legend, and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity; before this happened, a final non-canonical "imaginary story" ''[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'' was written by writer [[Alan Moore]], meant as a send-off for the "pre-Crisis" versions of the characters, including Lois.

===Modern Age===
[[Image:loislane.png|150px|left|thumb|Lois Lane, as she appears on the cover of ''The Man of Steel'' (miniseries) #2 (1986). Pencils by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]
Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which significantly rewrote [[Origin of Superman|Superman's origin]] and history. In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive.

Lois' first real relationship in this version was with [[Gangbuster|Jose Delgado]], a Metropolis vigilante whose legs are shattered in a battle with a [[Lexcorp]] [[cyborg]]/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL and Lois's attraction to Superman with whom Delgado felt he had to compete. ([[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]] #448/#450).

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with just Superman, although she was attracted to him.  One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this new revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This some times ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until The [[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]] #460-463 and Action #650.

Following Clark's brief rampage under the influence of [[The Eradicator]], Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for "selling out" to [[Blaze and Satanus|Collin Thornton]] and running ''Newstime'' Magazine, but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to "''grovel for his job back.''" Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her. The two became a couple, and eventually Lois accepted a proposal of marriage (''Superman'' (vol. 2) #50). Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.

DC had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #75.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  However, with the then-upcoming television show ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a [[battle royal]] with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the [[mermaid]] [[Lori Lemaris]]).  Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her. When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits, and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been recently depleted, and that he was her editor (due to [[Perry White]]'s [[cancer]]). Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a [[handkerchief]], Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

Lois and Clark were finally wed in the one-shot special ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'', which featured the work of nearly every then-living artist who had ever worked on Superman. The issue was published during the week of October 6, 1996, coinciding with an episode of ''Lois & Clark'' that also featured the wedding of the two characters.<ref>Dimino, Russ.

Since their marriage, Clark and Lois continue to remain one of the stronger relationships in most comic series. In 2007, the couple recently took the 'next step' in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they name [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]].  The boy is discovered to be the son of [[Jor-El]]'s arch-foe, [[General Zod]]. Although initially uneasy about raising a super-powered boy, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being 'Mommy Lois'. However, following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the [[Phantom Zone]] rift, trapping himself inside with Zod's forces, leaving Lois without her son.

When the [[Titans Tomorrow]] arrive at the Kents' apartment in order to kidnap Superman, Lois is knocked out, bound and gagged, and hidden in the couple's bedroom. Before Clark can untie her, he is ambushed and beaten into submission by the Titans.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (Vol.3) #50</ref>

In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lois and Perry are caught in an explosion triggered by [[Clayface]] destroying the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and apparently Lois is seriously injured or possibly even dead. In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he is to save his wife's life. The story is continued in the [[Stereoscopy|3D]] tie-in comic ''Superman Beyond'', where [[Monitor (comics)|the female Monitor]] Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him and several of his multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising immediate care for Lois. After facing off against the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brought back a distilled drop of [[Bleed (comics)|The Bleed]], and administered it through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois was later seen in ''Final Crisis'' #6, one of the few still free humans.

After the events of ''[[Superman: New Krypton]]'' Superman must leave Earth for a undetermined amount of time swearing off his Earthly connections in the eyes of his fellow [[Kryptonian]]s to keep an eye on General Zod the New Kryptonian military commander but secretly tells Lois he still considers her his wife and will come back to her. In recent issues of ''Action Comics'' Lois has reunited with [[Christopher Kent]] who has aged to adulthood in the past months and became the new Metropolis hero [[Nightwing]] and spoke to his partner [[Thara Ak-Var]] the new [[Flamebird]] on the two's (possible romantic) relationship.<ref>''Action Comics'' #875 (2009)</ref>

Lois hears that her sister [[Lucy Lane]] is killed during battle with [[Supergirl]] where Supergirl and Lana visit Lois' apartment to tell her the bad news. Lois doesn't believe that her sister is dead and refuses to accept the news until she has irrefutable proof. Supergirl is very apologetic, but Lois wants nothing to do with her right now. Before kicking her out, Lois asks Supergirl for a recovered piece of [[Superwoman]]'s costume.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #42 (June 2009)</ref>

Lois hands her exposé in and the government are after her for treason. With agents on her tail, Lois makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody and awakens, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Although Lois is happy to see her father alive her love soon turns to anger when she realizes Lucy was fully aware of her actions and Kara was telling the truth. Sam tells Lois the only reason he's being this lenient with her is that she is his daughter. He threatens to make her disappear forever, never to see the light of day again, where not even Superman could save her, if she continues. He tells Lois, he does love her but the planet will always come first over his family. Lois returns to the ''Daily Planet'' under cover of night and explains all to Perry. Lois points out that the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he refuses to run the story but notes the story must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the ''Daily Planet'', as Lois gets her edge back.<ref>''Action Comics'' #884</ref> However, it was later revealed that Lois never really quit the ''Daily Planet''.<ref name="autogenerated1">''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>

Lois finds out that his father's forces destroyed [[New Krypton]]. However, Lucy kidnaps her and takes her to her father's secret base.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> There, Lois argues with her father, saying that the Kryptonians think of him as a genocidal maniac. In the war between New Krypton and Earth, Supergirl finds them and threatens to kill Sam. Lois stops her, saying that her father will be judged for his war crimes. However, Sam takes a gun and commits suicide.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #4 (May 2010)</ref>

Later, Lois visits the imprisoned Lucy and talks with her.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #58 (November 2010)</ref> She expresses disbelief on what her sister has become. Lois says that while she will not miss her father, she will miss her sister.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #59 (December 2010)</ref>

In ''[[Superman: Grounded]]'', Superman begins a journey through America to reconnect with the American people, and Lois, though confused at first, supports his choice. Lois later travels to Rushmark, where Superman is supposed to make an appearance. There, she finds Brian, a old college friend. Brian invites her to have dinner with him and his wife Huong. There, Lois admits she has been having doubts about her current life. Later, she catches Brian and Huong having an argument, so she leaves and is met by Superman. The two reaffirm their love to each other and go to Chicago.<ref>''Superman'' #704 (October 2010)</ref> There, Lois helps Superman arrest a violent father that has been attacking his wife and son.<ref>''Superman'' #705 (November 2010)</ref> Later, Lois and Superman investigate a factory in Des Moines.

Lois wants to publish an article, which would reveal the workers's illegal activities, but Superman forces her not to. Feeling betrayed, Lois returns to Metropolis and does not speak to Superman for a while.<ref>''Superman'' #707 (July 2010)</ref> Lois is kidnapped by Lisa Jennings, a woman who wants to destroy Superman.<ref>''Superman'' #713 (July 2011)</ref> However, Superman rescues her and takes Jennings to a hospital so she can receive medical attention.

Knowing that his wife did the right thing, Superman kisses her. The two then return home.<ref>''Superman'' #714 (August 2011)</ref>

===2011 DC Relaunch===
In September 2011, the [[The New 52|main continuity was rebooted]].  In this new timeline, Lois Lane now works for [[Morgan Edge]] heading up the media division of the Daily Planet and has never been married to Clark Kent, instead she is seen to be dating a man called Jonathan Carrol. She views Clark as a friend, but regards him as a loner who has difficulty letting people get close to him ( [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] Vol 3 #1/p26 )

==In other versions==
During the years (1942–1985) that Editora Brasil-América (EBAL), and the [[Editora Abril]] published the Brazilian versions of Superman comics, Lois Lane's name was translated to "Miriam Lane" and later to "Miriam Lois Lane".

===''Kingdom Come''===
In the [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' (now Earth-22 in the [[DC Multiverse]]), flashbacks reveal that ten years prior to the story's beginning, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] murdered ninety-three people in the ''Daily Planet'', and Lois was the only woman in that body count. While her face is never shown in any of the flashbacks, her body is seen hunched over her desk.

In the ''[[Justice Society of America]] Kingdom Come Special: Superman'' by [[Alex Ross]], the fate of Earth-22's Lois was fully revealed. She actually survived the [[Joker venom]] by wearing a gas mask and tried to fight the Joker with a fire extinguisher, only to be bashed in the head with her ''Daily Planet'' paperweight. By the time Superman got to the ''Planet'' building she was still alive, but dying from the fatal wound. Lois' dying words were thanks for Superman's love for her, and telling him not to cross the line by becoming a killer, or to lose Clark Kent. She died in her husband's arms.<ref>''Justice Society of America Kingdom Come Special: Superman''</ref>

===''All-Star Superman''===
In 2005, DC launched a new ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' comic series by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]]. The series takes place outside normal DC continuity. In this storyline, they are not married, and although Superman revealed his secret identity to Lois in issue #2, she didn't believe him. At the end of the issue, Superman (who believed he was dying) presents Lois with a super-powered chemical and a superhero costume and Lois Lane becomes [[Superwoman]] for 24 hours.  {{-}}

===''JLA: The Nail''===
In the alternate world seen in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', where the Kents never found Clark, Lois is selected by [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to provide the Justice League with some positive media presentation after a recent propaganda campaign focuses on the idea that many modern metahumans are alien invaders. Tracking recent kdinapped heroes to a secret base, Lois is introduced to the Kents, who provide a safehouse for various heroes, and later discovers that the true mastermind behind the conspiracy is [[Jimmy Olsen]], mutated into a Kryptonian through genetic experiments carried out based on DNA samples found in Kal-El's crashed and abandoned ship. 

In the sequel, ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Lois helps Kal-El assemble his 'Clark' disguise, reasoning that the simplicity of the glasses will stop people paying too much attention to him.

===''Superman: Kal''===
