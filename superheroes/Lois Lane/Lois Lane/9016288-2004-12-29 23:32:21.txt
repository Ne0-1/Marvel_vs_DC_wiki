'''Lois Lane''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in the [[Superman]] stories produced by [[DC Comics]].
She is Superman's chief romantic interest and a reporter for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] newspaper, the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. She debuted in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 ([[1938]]). Her physical appearance was originally based on a [[model (person)|model]] hired by Shuster and Siegel named [[Joanne Carter]].

Though an accomplished [[journalism|journalist]], the social climate of the era and the fact that rival reporter [[Clark Kent]] got an amazing number of exclusive stories about Superman, led to her demotion to "lovelorn" columnist.  This led to her rivalry with Clark Kent and a penchant for taking more risks in the pursuit of news stories.

She is one of several Superman characters with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lana Lang]], and [[Lori Lemaris]] (the Mermaid).

==History==

As the audience for [[comic book]]s began gravitating towards young boys, stories shifted in focus from investigative journalism, [[political corruption]] and [[mobster]]s to fantastic plots involving [[extraterrestrial|aliens]], [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] creatures and bizarre, often contrived, plots.  Lois's main interests became vying with rival [[Lana Lang]] for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same, and tricking or otherwise forcing Superman into [[marriage]].  Her popularity rose during this period and she gained her own comic book though with her role clearly delineated in the title as ''Superman's Girl Friend Lois Lane''.  Eventually as attitudes towards women changed in the [[1970s]], Lois was increasingly depicted as being very capable in dealing with more mundane dangers and more respectful of Superman's privacy.  For example, in her solo stories in ''Superman Family'', she regularly battled criminals in her investigations and defeated them with quick wits and considerable skill in [[martial arts]].


===Modern History===

Lois underwent a serious character alteration with the 1986 revamp of [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] (which included "[[reboot (continuity)|rebooting]]" Superman for the modern world). This time around, Lois was a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive. She's every bit as comfortable in fatigues as she is in an evening gown. One important change in Lois is that she did not fall head over heels in love with Superman.
A reason for this is because the nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship had changed. Whereas before he was Superman and Clark Kent was essentially a pair of glasses that helped him blend in, now he was Clark Kent and Superman was just the cape and costume that let him help people. After some time, Lois and Clark began dating. Later they became engaged and Clark revealed the secret of his dual life.

DC had planned on Lois and Clark being married with ''Superman'' #75, slated to come out in January 1993. However, with the upcoming TV show ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV (and they had dreams of doing the two stories concurrently). Partially as a result of this, [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]] in the comics, dying in Lois's arms after a battle royal with the monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. The subsequent months of comics, which did not have Superman, were some of the best examples of characterization for Lois. Superman returned to life and he and Lois resumed their relationship. With the TV show going full steam, the engagement dragged on for several years, resulting in a number of problems ([[Lori Lemaris]] being one, Clark's old college flame) and Lois actually broke it off for a while (for reasons not adequately explored). But then, in the course of a single issue, Lois decided she couldn't live without Clark. She and Clark were married in the spectacular ''[[Superman: The Wedding Album]]'', which featured the work of nearly every artist who had ever worked on Superman and was still living.

Lois is either attractive in a simple girl-next-door sort of way or the most georgeous [[supermodel]]-level woman who ever lived depeneding on who draws her. Typically, she falls somewhere in the middle. One thing to note is that the comic is constantly being put under pressure to parallel other forms of media: i.e. Lois got a hair cut to look more like [[Teri Hatcher]] when ''Lois and Clark'' began airing and her eyes were typically violet to match the Lois on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' after that show began airing.

Lois is the daughter of Sam and Ellen Lane. Her father, Sam Lane, was a grizzled old soldier who always wanted a son and ending up with two girls improvised. Consequently, Lois was trained in hand to hand combat, could operate firearms, and could even throw knives with her toes. The somewhat estranged relationship she had with her father was exacerbated when he was recruited into President [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]'s cabinet. When he died in battle, she was devastated however, and part of her wanted to blame Superman for not being able to save him. She has one sibling, her younger sister, [[Lucy Lane-Troupe]].

Arguably the best Lois Lane story is to be found in ''[[Adventures of Superman]]'' #525.

==Trivia==

Lois is famous for being a bad speller, though that's not much of a big deal anymore with computer spell checks. 
She used to own a cat named Elroy.
Lois and Clark live in an apartment at 1938 Sulivan St. (1938 being the year Superman was first published).
