'''Maria Stark''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She is the wife of [[Howard Stark]] and the mother of [[Iron Man|Anthony "Tony" Stark]].

==Fictional character biography==
Maria Stark was born '''Maria Collins Carbonell''', although her young life is unknown. In her adulthood, Maria married Howard Stark and together they had a son: Anthony "Tony" Stark. While Howard constantly pushed Tony to be the best (saying "iron in their backbone" to be successful), Maria was unsuccessful to prevent Tony from seeing Howard's alcoholism (something their son would later face on his own). Howard secretly programmed Mistress, the AI that controlled the [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]] robots with Maria's brain patterns.{{issue|date=February 2012}}

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Maria Stark shows her as '''Maria Cerrera''', the second wife of Howard Stark. Maria was a brilliant scientist suffered a genetic accident while she was pregnant with her and Howard's child. After Maria died during childbirth, Howard uses a newly invented biological armor to save the life of their son: [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Antonio "Tony" Stark]], named after "'''Antonio Cerrera'''" (Maria's brother) that died at a young age. Years later, [[Loni (Ultimate Iron Man)|Loni Stane]] (Howard's first wife) tells Tony twice that she could have been his mother in a different set of circumstances but Tony says he'd still prefer his own mother instead of Loni.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #0-5</ref>

While Ultimate Maria Stark's life that was depicted have been [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as an in-universe fictional TV show about Iron Man's life, his mother is briefly mentioned by [[Gregory Stark]] (Tony's brother within the retconned Ultimate Marvel) when he joking says how he "came out of Mother before [Tony]".<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers 3'' #3</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Despite not appearing in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', Maria Stark's image was used in the second season episode "Iron Monger Lives" when [[Madame Masque]] uses her mask to impersonate her to mess with Tony Stark's head after he de-activated the [[Iron Monger]] armor using [[Extremis]].

===Film===
Maria Stark is referenced several times in the direct to DVD film ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]''.

Maria Stark is shown during a brief slideshow presentation in the beginning of the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''. Along with her husband, she dies in an accident many years before the events of the film, leaving Tony an orphan at 17.
