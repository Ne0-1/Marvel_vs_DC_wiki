'''Maria Stark''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She is [[Howard Stark]]'s wife, [[Iron Man|Anthony "Tony" Stark]]'s mother but not biologically, and [[Morgan Stark]]'s aunt.

==Fictional character biography==
Maria Stark was born '''Maria Collins Carbonell'''. In her adulthood, Maria married Howard Stark, and together they had a son that was not her biological son: Anthony "Tony" Stark. Maria was unsuccessful in preventing Tony from seeing Howard's alcoholism, something Tony would later face on his own. Howard secretly programmed Mistress, the AI that controlled the [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]] robots, with Maria's brain patterns.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' # 9 (1979)</ref>

On the Ides of March, Maria and Howard were killed in a 'planned' car accident.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://marvel.com/universe/Iron_Man_%28Anthony_Stark%29 | title=Iron Man (Anthony Stark) | publisher=marvel.com | accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref>(possibly arranged by the [[Roxxon Oil Company]]).<ref>''Iron Man - The Iron Age # 2'' (1998)</ref> Afterwards, Tony ran his father's company, started a charity in his mother's name (which donated funds to finance various charities and renovation projects as well as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]) and later became [[Iron Man]].

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the character is renamed as '''Maria Cerrera''', the second wife of Howard Stark. Maria was a brilliant scientist who suffered a genetic accident while she was pregnant with her and Howard's child. After Maria died during childbirth, Howard uses a newly invented biological armor to save the life of their son: [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Antonio "Tony" Stark]], named after Antonio Cerrera (Maria's brother), who died at a young age. Years later, Loni Stane (Howard's first wife) tells Tony twice that she could have been his mother in a different set of circumstances but Tony says he'd still prefer his own mother instead of Loni.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #0-5</ref>

While the Ultimate version of Maria Stark's life that was depicted has been [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as an in-universe fictional TV show about Iron Man's life, her character is briefly mentioned by [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Gregory Stark|Gregory Stark]] (Tony's brother within the retconned Ultimate Marvel) when he joking says how he "came out of Mother before [Tony]" but this has since been discounted.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers 3'' #3</ref>
