'''Maria Stark''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She is the mother of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and the wife of [[Howard Stark]].

==Fictional character biography==
Maria Stark was born '''Maria Collins Carbonell''', although her young life is unknown. In her adulthood, Maria married Howard Stark and together they had a son: Anthony "Tony" Stark. While Howard constantly pushed Tony to be the best (saying "iron in their backbone" to be successful), Maria was unsuccessful to prevent Tony from seeing Howard's alcoholism (something their son would later face on his own). Howard secretly programmed Mistress, the AI that controlled the [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]] robots with Maria's brain patterns.{{issue|date=February 2012}}

On the Ides of March, Maria and Howard were killed in a plane accident (It has been hinted that the incident was not random and possibly arranged by the [[V-Battalion]]).{{issue|date=February 2012}} Tony ran his father's company, started a charity in his mother's name (donated funds to finance various charities and renovation projects, as well as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]), and later became [[Iron Man]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Maria Stark===
The Ultimate Iron Man version of Maria Stark shows her as '''Maria Cerrera''', the second wife of Howard Stark. Maria was a brilliant scientist suffered a genetic accident while she was pregnant with her and Howard's child. After Maria died during childbirth, Howard uses a newly invented biological armor to save the life of their son: [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Antonio "Tony" Stark]], named after "'''Antonio Cerrera'''" (Maria's brother), who died at young age. Years later, after [[Loni Stark/Loni Stane|Loni Stane]] (Howard's first wife) tells a teenage Tony that she could've been his mother in a different set of circumstances, Tony says he'd still prefer his mother (Maria) instead of her (Loni). Sometime later, Loni (before shooting Tony in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself) again says that she could've been his mother in a different set of circumstances.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #0-5</ref>

While Ultimate Maria Stark's life that was depicted have been [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as an in-universe fictional TV show about Iron Man's life, his mother is briefly mentioned by [[Gregory Stark]] (Tony's brother within the retconned Ultimate Marvel) when he joking says how he "came out of Mother before [Tony]".<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers 3'' #3</ref>

==In other media==
Maria Stark is shown during a brief slideshow presentation in the beginning of the  2008 film ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]''. Along with her husband, she dies in an accident many years before the events of the film, leaving Tony an orphan at 17.
