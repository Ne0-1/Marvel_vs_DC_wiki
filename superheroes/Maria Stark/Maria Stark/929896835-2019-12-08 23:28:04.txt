==Fictional character biography==
Maria Stark was born '''Maria Collins Carbonell'''. In her adulthood, Maria married Howard, and together they had a [[Iron Man 2020#616|son]] that was not her biological son Anthony "Tony" Stark. Maria was unsuccessful in preventing Tony from seeing Howard's alcoholism, something Tony would later face on his own.

On the Ides of March, Maria and Howard were killed in a 'planned' car accident<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://marvel.com/universe/Iron_Man_%28Anthony_Stark%29 | title=Iron Man (Anthony Stark) | publisher=marvel.com | accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> (possibly arranged by the [[Roxxon Oil Company]]).<ref>''Iron Man - The Iron Age # 2'' (1998)</ref> Afterwards, Tony ran his father's company, started a charity in his mother's name (which donated funds to finance various charities and renovation projects as well as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]) and later became [[Iron Man]].

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the character is renamed as '''Maria Cerrera''', the second wife of Howard Stark. Maria was a brilliant scientist who suffered a genetic accident while she was pregnant with her and Howard's child. After Maria died during childbirth, Howard uses a newly invented biological armor to save the life of their son named after Antonio Cerrera (Maria's brother) who died at a young age. Years later, Loni (Howard's first wife) tells Tony twice that she wishes she could have been Tony's mother under different circumstances, but Tony still prefers his own mother.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #0-5</ref>

While what has been depicted is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as an in-universe fictional TV show about [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]]'s life, the actual Ultimate version of her character is briefly mentioned by her other son Gregory Stark when joking says how Gregory "came out of [Maria] before [Tony]" but this has since been discounted.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers 3'' #3</ref>
