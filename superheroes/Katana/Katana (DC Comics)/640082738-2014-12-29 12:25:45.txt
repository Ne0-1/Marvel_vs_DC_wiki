==Fictional character biography==

===Becoming Katana===
{{nihongo|'''Tatsu Yamashiro'''|山城 たつ}} was an average Japanese girl, save for her proficiency in the [[martial arts]], a trait encouraged by her parents.<ref name="Batout12">''Batman and the Outsiders'' #12 (July 1984), pp. 9–15. Reprinted in ''[[Showcase Presents]]: Batman and the Outsiders, Vol. 1'' ([[DC Comics]], Sept. 2007, ISBN 1-4012-1546-7, pp. 319–325).</ref> Two brothers — Maseo and Takeo Yamashiro — both proclaimed their love for her. While she liked both, she chose Maseo. Takeo, "did not take this well," and refused to attend the couple's wedding.<ref name="Batout12"/> Unmissed — indeed, Maseo (his only family) disowned his brother, who had joined the [[Yakuza]], taking their mark of a large dragon [[tattoo]] across his chest — Tatsu and Maseo, mourning the deaths of Tatsu's parents (cause unknown), started a family of their own. Tatsu gave birth to twins, Yuki and Reiko, while Takeo rose in rank of the Yakuza, indulging his "exotic tastes" for ancient weapons.<ref name="Batout12"/> He was presented with a pair of matching swords by General Karnz (later henchman to [[Baron Bedlam]]), one of which Takeo favored for its mystical properties.

Takeo spent days preparing himself, before taking both swords to the Yamashiro residence, demanding his brother duel for the "prize" of Tatsu.<ref name="Batout12"/> During the course of the struggle, a fire was started, and — while Maseo was distracted by his children — Takeo killed his brother with the sword which would become known as "Soultaker". Tatsu arose just in time to see her husband die and engaged Takeo, gaining the upper hand and disarming him. Attempting to save her children, she heard her husband's voice coming from the sword, telling her they were already lost. Escaping with her life, Tatsu began training as a samurai under a master called Tadashi. After much time she graduated from his tutorship and left for America where she intended to use her talents to fight for justice. She took the codename Katana after the sword that she wielded, possessed for some time by the soul of her husband.<ref name="Batout12"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=katana | title=The Unofficial Katana Biography | work=DCU Guide}}</ref>

[[File:Katana (comics).jpg|thumbnail|left|Katana's classic appearance]]

===Becoming an Outsider===
{{Main|Outsiders (comics)}}
Eventually Tatsu journeyed to [[Markovia (comics)|Markovia]], a small [[Baltic region|Baltic]] state, where she had tracked down Karnz, and she was successful in killing him, inadvertently implicating [[Black Lightning]] (coincidentally there with [[Batman]]) in her crime.<ref>''Batman and the Outsiders'' #1 (August 1983), pp. 13–15.</ref> Attempting to rectify the misunderstanding by freeing Black Lightning, she encountered a young girl who was named [[Halo (comics)|Halo]].<ref name="Batout2">''Batman and the Outsiders'' #2 (Sept. 1983), pp. 5–6.</ref> The two joined up to rescue Black Lightning, Batman (himself captured due to a blunder by Halo), and Bruce Wayne's employee [[Lucius Fox]] from their captor, [[Baron Bedlam]].<ref name="Batout2"/>

Batman was himself in Markovia to rescue Lucius Fox, and having sought — and failed to gain — the help of the [[Justice League of America]], had resigned his membership in the Justice League. Inspired by the teamwork he encountered between Black Lightning, Katana, Halo, [[Geo-Force]] (Prince Brion of Markovia), and [[Metamorpho]] (also coincidentally present), Batman decided to form the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>''Batman and the Outsiders'' #2 (Sept. 1983), p. 24.</ref> The team managed to end the Baron's tyranny in Markovia and moved to [[Gotham City]], where they set up their headquarters (a former penthouse of Bruce Wayne, secretly the Batman). Tatsu became Halo's guardian and the two moved into the penthouse.

At the same time, Takeo was still at large and had followed Tatsu to Gotham City. Secretly he switched swords with her and left for Tokyo with the Outsiders on his tail. Takeo took the sword to his master, the godfather of the Yakuza, known only as the [[Oyabun]]. Performing a specific ritual, the Oyabun and Takeo managed to recall the souls that inhabited the sword, who proceeded to take corporeal form.<ref name="Batout11">''Batman and the Outsiders'' #11 (June 1984), pp. 20–23.</ref> Among them were legendary mercenaries and assassins, but also Maseo, who was now a slave to the Oyabun. Katana — and the Outsiders — had to fight them all, but was ultimately able to reclaim the Soultaker from Maseo. Forced to kill her husband, she was also able to kill Takeo, finally putting some of her ghosts to rest. By undoing the ritual however, her husband returned into the sword as well.<!--Is this the case? I thought he did ''not'' re-enter the sword..?-->

At one point the Outsiders split from Batman's leadership and took up residence in Markovia where they were funded by the Markovian crown (Geo-Force is a prince of the royal family). They became the official agents of Markovia and moved to the city of [[Los Angeles]] where they made their headquarters in the Markovian embassy, while retaining another secret HQ just off the shore. Although Tatsu had left her past behind, the Oyabun returned in her life and sent a [[tengu]] after her, with which he captured her. Her teammates in the Outsiders, namely Halo and [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] were able to save her using other tengu and the tengu leader, who aided them in battle.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/outsiders/index.html | title=The Outsiders!}}</ref><ref>''Adventures of the Outsiders'' #34 (June 1986)</ref>

===Family debt===
After a while, the team disbanded after various tragic events surrounding Geo-Force's parents and Markovia. Nonetheless the Outsiders were forced to defend Markovia against the Manhunters, but during the fight Halo was knocked into a coma, saving Katana's life. Bounded by ''giri-ninjo'' (a debt of honor even unto death), Tatsu left the team so she could tend to Halo's wounds. During that time however, she was approached by a family member of her husband, who wished her to accompany the [[Suicide Squad]] on a mission to destroy a large hoard of weapons that was about to be sold to the Yakuza. She declined on the basis of her ''giri-ninjo'', although she was willing to help if the need was truly desperate. That family member was later killed, and she went after the killer, the Daichi-Doku's Oyabun (of which her relative was a member), who did not wish to see the weapons destroyed and tried to stop the Suicide Squad. During that adventure, she saved the life of [[Bronze Tiger]] and [[Manhunter (comics)#Mark Shaw|Manhunter]] (Mark Shaw), making them honor-bound to her by ''giri-ninjo''. Mark Shaw then assisted her in taking down the Daichi-Doku's Oyabun. The Oyabun committed ritual suicide and Katana stood by as his "second", ready to help with a blade strike so he could keep his honor.

===Returning to the Outsiders===
Eventually though the Outsiders re-form and return to Markovia. Instead of a peaceful reunion however, the team become trapped in a web of public relations that brands them outlaws. Although the charges would be dropped eventually the team was fractured. Halo dies from an assassin's blast but was reborn in a new body, which put an immense strain on Tatsu's relationship with Halo. Katana joins a team with Geo-Force and [[Technocrat (comics)|Technocrat]], taking the lead. She develops a mild romantic relationship with Joey Hong, an Asian associate of [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].<ref>"Guy Gardner: Warrior" Vol 1. #39 (Feb. 1996)</ref>  During a lone mission, Tadashi, her old mentor sends [[Lady Shiva]] to claim Katana's Soultaker sword. Shiva confronts Katana, who had been battling a gang of drug dealers. Katana had slain many, but refuses to kill the youngest member, something Shiva insults her for. Shiva, being world-renowned as the world's greatest assassin and fighter, was able to kill Katana with her own sword. Katana returns to life after a trial by combat within her sword, which includes confronting many of the souls of the people she had killed. Afterwards, she manages to find her old mentor and take his life. The two splinter teams would eventually reunite, to take on more supernatural threats focused around the new team member [[Sebastian Faust]]. Katana and her friends suffer through the mental and physical tortures that Faust's father, [[Felix Faust|Felix]], puts them through. Halo eventually frees them by destroying several of Felix's items of power. Soon after, the group breaks apart. After disbanding, Tatsu has kept her association with her old allies among the Outsiders (such as Black Lightning, Geo-Force, and Halo), and although they did not operate as an official team, were always seen alongside each other during major crises. Her close ties to Batman also saw her fighting by his side, several times, notably during the [[Imperiex]] crisis and the [[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]] incident when Hell invades Earth. The main battle against the villain, the rogue angel Asmodel, with the power of the Spectre, takes place in New York. Katana personally protects [[Madame Xanadu]] who is guarding the rest of Asmodel's power with a mystical shield. Katana's protection of Xanadu is assisted by [[Doctor Occult]], [[Phantom Stranger]], and [[Alan Scott]]. Later, Katana assists Batman when he and [[Superman]] were declared outlaws. Katana was also called upon by [[Black Canary]], together with [[Birds of Prey (comics)|other female mercenaries]], in order to rescue [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] from Senator Pullman. After Oracle was saved, Katana received a card, together with the promise of a favor if required. Katana later returns to assist Oracle in issue #108 alongside dozens of other agents.

[[File:Outsiders 16 Cover.jpg|thumbnail|right|Katana as she appeared with the Outsiders in 2009]]

===New Outsiders===
Later Katana joined a new team of Outsiders after assisting them in defeating a more powerful [[Sabbac]]. That team consisted of all new members, with the exception of [[Metamorpho]] who rejoined the team after [[Metamorpho#Shift|Shift's]] demise. In ''Outsiders'' #42, Katana dons a new costume, as she felt it inappropriate to wear a costume based on Japan's flag, since the country had revoked her citizenship due to her membership with the controversial team. Later, Katana summons Sabbac to destroy Dr. Sivana's base with his Hellfire. Katana remains an active member of the Outsiders following the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity jump. Initially, the team is led by [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], but later leadership transfers to Batman. Batman decides to 'test' Katana and the rest of the initial team, in order to design a better team. Katana is Batman's first official recruit.

===Blackest Night===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
While escorting [[Killer Croc]] to incarceration, the Outsiders' vehicle is demolished by Maseo, Yuki, and Reiko, who have all been revived as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. Katana, believing that she has been reunited with her lost family, lets her guard down, but is saved from death by her teammates. Realising the truth, she draws her sword, preparing to fight her undead husband.<ref>''Outsiders'' vol. 4, #24</ref> When Katana stabs Maseo, Soultaker reveals to her the Black Lanterns' full intentions. Her attacks soon prove to be completely ineffectual against Maseo, who is instead destroyed by an outpouring of light from Halo, who also destroyed Katana's undead children.<ref>''Outsiders'' vol. 4, #25</ref>

The events of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' led to reboot in continuity for the DC Universe which altered some of the fictional history but left other pieces in place. Each of the DC Universe titles were relaunched and the rebooted titles have been labeled [[The New 52]]. In this rebooted continuity, a newly healed [[Barbara Gordon]] returns to the [[Batgirl]] identity and takes a leave of absence from the Birds of Prey<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> and suggests that Katana take her place full-time on the team.

Katana joins [[Black Canary]] and Starling as the third member of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. Katana is described as a lethal fighter who has spent the last year waging war on the Yakuza clan that is responsible for the death of her husband. She is rumored to be mentally unstable due to her belief that her husband's soul, whom she often converses with in Japanese, resides in her sword.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #2</ref>

After a number of adventures with the Birds of Prey, Katana leaves the group in order to keep an eye on a cult of assassins known as the Daggers.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #15</ref> She later accepts membership in [[Amanda Waller]]'s new [[Justice League of America]] in exchange for information on her husband's murderers.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> When DC launched ''Justice League of America'', they also launched the solo series ''Katana'', focusing on Tatsu's abiding mission to track down her husband's killer. The series lasted 10 issues. After this, Katana made an appearance in ''Green Arrow'' #27 (2014), where she is told by the mysterious blind man Magus that the death of her husband relates to the Outsiders, the society formed of various weapon clans and connected to Green Arrow's new origin story. The Soultaker is worked into the Green Arrow mythology as the totem of the Sword Clan, which has parallels in the Fist, Mask, Shield, Axe, Arrow, and Spear Clans. Representatives from each of these clans make up the Outsiders, a [[secret society]] dedicated towards ending global corruption, but which is itself largely corrupt. Katana joins the Outsiders. In ''Green Arrow: Futures End'' #1 (2014), set five years later in [[The New 52: Futures End|one possible future]], Tatsu is shown to still be a member of the Outsiders, which has developed a grudging relationship with Green Arrow, who rejected leadership of the Arrow Clan in the main ''Green Arrow'' series five years before.

==Powers, abilities, and weapons==
Katana is a highly proficient hand-to-hand combatant and swordswoman, having studied martial arts as a child and later being trained by the samurai Tadashi. From her time with the Outsiders and Batman, she has also developed strong tactical skills.

Katana's Soultaker sword, along with its non-powered twin, was forged in the 14th century by [[Muramasa]], whose swords were said to be cursed and make those who were evil commit evil acts. It sometimes takes the souls of those it kills, storing them inside the sword, where they can engage in limited communication with whoever wields it. These souls can be reincarnated by the means of a sacred ritual, under which they serve their summoner, even if it is against their will. In The New 52, the Soultaker is established as being the 'Sword Totem' of the Outsiders, meaning like the other totems it supposedly bestows immortality and enlightenment upon its wielder, although some like Green Arrow are sceptical of the literal truths of these claims.

In addition to the Soultaker, Katana often carries additional weaponry into battle.

==Other versions==
* In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' universe, Katana joined with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]' [[Female Furies|Furies]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

* A character similar to Katana called '''Tsukuri''' (voiced by [[Karen Maruyama]]) appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, in the episode "Fury", as an assistant to the villainness [[Aresia]] and later as a member of [[Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]].

====Animation====
[[File:Katana (Batman BB).jpg|right|thumb|Katana as she appears in season 1 of ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''.]]
* Katana appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[Vyvan Pham]], and later by [[Kim Mai Guest]]. In the episode "Enter the Outsiders!", she is shown as a member of the Outsiders alongside Black Lightning and Metamorpho, as teenagers rather new to their abilities. They serve the sewer-dwelling villain [[Sleez|Slug]] until Batman and Wildcat defeat him and persuade them not to follow Slug's ways. Katana was mostly silent, typically letting her actions speak for her. In "Inside the Outsiders!", a different origin is explored via a nightmare created by [[Psycho-Pirate]]: Katana was the student of Tadashi, who was killed by the evil samurai Takeo. Psycho-Pirate makes her believe that it was her talkative nature that led Takeo to Tadashi, and she becomes silent out of shame. Batman reminds her that this was not what happened; Tadashi sacrificed himself to make her a greater warrior, and her silence honors his teachings of self-control. In the teaser of the episode "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!", she and the other Outsiders fight and defeat [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra]] with the aid of two new members: Geo-Force and Halo.

[[Alfred Pennyworth]] was a friend of her father during their MI-6 days, and later became Tatsu's godfather.  Tatsu agrees to serve as Bruce Wayne's bodyguard while Alfred is recovering from injuries. In "Safe", she is guarding [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Dr. Jason Burr]] when she is confronted by Silver Monkey, who reports her survival to [[Lady Shiva]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicvine.com/news/character-bios-and-designs-for-beware-the-batman-revealed/145485/ | title= Character Bios And Designs For 'Beware The Batman' Revealed |first= Sara 'Babs' |last= Lima |date= 5 November 2012 | publisher= Comicvine.com |accessdate= 7 May 2013}}</ref> In "Family", Tatsu confesses to Bruce that she has acquired the Soultaker sword and hidden it on the estate. Alfred vouches for her reliability, but Bruce demands their resignations. Bethanie Ravenscroft and Silver Monkey capture Wayne and demand the Soultaker as ransom. With Alfred's assistance, Tatsu rescues Wayne and then fights the League's ninjas by Batman's side. Tatsu learns that Batman is Bruce Wayne and that she passed her "final test" to become his partner. In "Allies", she takes the codename "Katana", which was also her codename in the League of Assassins. In "Fall", a flashback reveals that [[Ra's al Ghul]] encountered MI6 Agents Alfred Pennyworth and Edogawa Yamashiro (the father of Katana) in the past with Edogawa forced to betray Alfred to Ra's in their last encounter under threat of his family. Ra's ordered Edogawa to use the Soultaker Sword on Alfred, but Alfred fought back, causing the powers of the sword to activate, leading to Edogawa's death. In the present, Batman and Katana arrive to stop Ra's al Ghul. Katana and Alfred barely escape from the League of Assassins with Ra's al Ghul commenting on how Alfred killed Edogawa. In "Darkness", Ra's al Ghul has Alfred and Katana captured when they try to break into his lair. In "Reckoning" Ra's al Ghul manipulates Katana into killing Alfred to avenge the death of her father. She refuses nearly having Ra's al Ghul kill them all only for [[Tobias Whale]] to arrive with a captured Batman.
