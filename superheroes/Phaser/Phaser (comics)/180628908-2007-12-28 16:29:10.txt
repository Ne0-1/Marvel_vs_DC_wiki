'''Radian''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in New X-Men #135, created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]].

==Fictional character biography==
Radian was one of the many mutant teenagers that enrolled into the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] after the revelation to the public that [[Professor X]] was a mutant.  When [[Cassandra Nova]] made her second attack on the school, Radian and other students, even knowing how dangerous Nova was, wanted to face her. Instead, they were put under her control and turned against [[X-Men]] members Wolverine, Beast, and Xorn. Radian and the others were freed soon after thanks to the intervention of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]].

After the death of mutant fashion designer [[Jumbo Carnation]], Radian joined the [[Omega Gang]], led by fellow student Quentin Quire, who is also known as [[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]]. Radian and the Omega Gang participated in an assault on a small group of human racists whom they believed responsible for the death of Jumbo. They also attacked a team of [[U-Men]].

The Omega Gang then caused a riot at the Xavier Institute during Open Day, when the school was going to accept human students. During the riot, Radian and other members of the gang confronted several X-Men on the mansion's front lawn. Radian was stopped by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who broke his leg with his optic blasts. Afterwards, Radian, along with [[Redneck (comics)|Redneck]] and [[Tattoo (comics)|Tattoo]], were sent to a jail, run by humans. Wolverine informed him that he and the others would be sent overseas to do charity work after they completed their jail time. Radian was one of many mutants that lost their superhuman powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

However, he appears to have been let out of jail, and then decided to pay his debt in another way: by joining the newest incarnation of the New Warriors.<ref>Marvel News: New Warriors: Out With the Old Pt. 2 [http://marvel.com/news/comics.2008.New_Warriors%3A_Out_with_the_Old_Pt%7Edot%7E_2]</ref> After being given new armor, he took up the codename Phaser, and began training with the team, including his sister Tattoo. However, on one of the team's first missions out to stop the Zodiac, she got too cocky when fighting Cancer, and was brutally killed in front of the rest of the team. He is currently in mourning over her death.

==Powers and abilities==
Before he was depowered on M-Day, Radian had the superhuman ability to generate blinding flashes of ultraviolet light from his body. Radian could control the intensity of these bursts, choosing to either blind or burn his opponents.
