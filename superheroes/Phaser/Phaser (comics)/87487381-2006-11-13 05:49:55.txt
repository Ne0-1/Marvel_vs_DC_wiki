'''Radian''' is a fictional [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in New X-Men #127, created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[John Paul Leon]].

==History==
Radian was one of the many mutant teenagers that enrolled into the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] after the revelation to the public that [[Professor X]] was a mutant. When [[Cassandra Nova]] made her second attack on the school, Radian and the other students were ready to face her. But instead, they were put under her control and turned against the [[X-Men]]. Radian and the others were freed soon after thanks to the intervention of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]].

After the death of mutant fashion designer Jumbo Carnation, Radian joined the Omega Gang, led by fellow student Quentin Quire, who is also known as [[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]]. Recently, Radian and the Omega Gang participated in an assault on a small group of human racists, and after, a team of U-Men.

The Omega Gang then caused a riot at the Xavier Institute during Open Day, where the school was going to accept human students. During the riot, Radian was stopped by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who broke his leg with his optic blasts. Afterwards, Radian, along with [[Redneck (comics)|Redneck]] and [[Tattoo (comics)|Tattoo]], were sent to a jail, run by humans. Radian was one of many mutants that lost their superhuman powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers==

Radian had the superhuman ability to generate blinding flashes of ultraviolet light from his body. Radian can control the intensity of these bursts, choosing to either blind or burn his opponents.
