'''Fenris''' are two [[fiction]]al characters from the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, namely [[German people|German]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[twins]] '''Andrea''' and '''[[Andreas Strucker|Andreas]] von Strucker''', children of supervillain [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] of [[HYDRA]]. Andrea is female, Andreas is male.

'''Fenris''' is also the name of the terrorist organization the two are head of, which is made up of armored soldiers based on technology developed by HYDRA.

==Fictional character biography==
Like their extremely notorious father, the twins are [[white supremacist]]s, have great sympathy for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] agenda and strive for the [[Fourth Reich]]. The Strucker twins have made numerous appearances in ''Uncanny X-Men''. One of their earliest appearances happens in ''Uncanny X-Men'' 194, when Storm interrupted Andreas' attempted assault on a native woman in Africa. Andrea retaliated for Storm's humiliation of her brother by shooting her in the head and leaving her to die.

The Strucker twins despise [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for his role in their father's seeming death during World War II. In issue 200, they conducted acts of terrorism and finally attacked Magneto during his trial by the International Court of Justice for his many crimes against humanity, which was held in Paris. The X-Men foiled their assassination attempt, but Fenris managed to escape by allowing themselves to be swept into the old city sewers. 

The twins later resurfaced as part of "The [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]", a group of mutant millionaires who engaged in a campaign of murder as part of a game organized by the mutant telepath Gamemaster and the former Hellfire Club Black Queen Selene. The twins tried to acquire Omega Red for the Upstarts but failed. The twins ultimately met their match, though, when they tried to kill former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]] [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], who along with her X-Factor teammates easily beat the twins.

The twins resurfaced in the pages of the 1999 "[[Citizen V]]" mini-series, where they were seen working with their father Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker. During the mini-series they fight [[Citizen V]] though Andrea realizes that Citizen V is in truth [[Baron Helmut Zemo]]. Having been decapitated by Nomad under orders of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], Zemo had survived as [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]], to Zemo's own surprise, transferred his mind into the comatose body of the second Citizen V, John Watkins III. Zemo quickly kills Andrea to keep her from telling anyone of his being alive. 

{{spoilerabout|''New Thunderbolts'' #17}}

The fourth [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] was confirmed as Andreas von Strucker in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|New Thunderbolts]]'' #17, able to access his former powers as part of Fenris by tanning his sister's skin and using it as the grip on his sword.
The new Swordsman was, indeed confirmed in this issue as Andreas Von Strucker and he is now part of that group.

==Powers and abilities==
Despite being born with their abilities, the twins are not mutants. As a result of genetic engineering when they were still in utero, the twins possess bio-energy powers which only function if the twins are in physical contact - usually by holding hands.  Andrea generates blasts of destructive energy that can disintegrate matter, while Andreas fires bolts of pure concussive force.  Their powers also allow them to fly, though again, only when they are in physical contact.

==Alternate versions==
===Ultimate Fenris===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Fenris are two androgynous [[German people|German]] mutant business tycoons who seek mutant supremacy through economic control. Although their motives seem honorable, they are deep in [[corporate crime]]. It is unknown whether they are siblings or lovers, although according to [[Archangel (comics)#Ultimate X-Men|Warren Worthington III]], there are rumours that they are both.  They have dealings with a thus-far unseen [[Black Tom Cassidy]], and have tried to recruit [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]]; however, Rogue rejected the offer and Gambit, who was already in their employ, rebelled to help her escape.

==Appearances in other media==
===Film===
In the [[1998]] film ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of Shield]]'' Andrea von Strucker was played by [[Sandra Hess]]. Andreas did not appear, but Andrea did have a younger brother named Werner. The two had no apparent mutant powers. Confusingly, Andrea was codenamed [[Viper (comics)|Viper]].
