'''Fenris''' are two characters from the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, namely [[German people|German]] [[mutant]] [[twins]] Andrea and Andreas von Strucker, children of supervillains [[Elsbeth von Strucker]] and [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] of [[HYDRA]]. Andrea is female, Andreas is male.

Both have bioelectric powers which emanate when the twins have physical contact, usually by holding hands. Fenris is also the name of the terrorist organisation the two are head of.

Like their extremely notorious parents, the twins are [[white supremacist]]s, have great sympathy for the [[Nazi]] agenda and strive for the [[Fourth Reich]]. The Strucker twins have made numerous appearances in Uncanny X-Men. They despise Magneto for his role in their father's death during World War II. In issue 200, they attacked Magneto during his trial by the International Court of Justice for his many crimes against humanity, hosted in Paris. The X-Men foiled their assassination attempt, but Fenris managed to escape.

The twins later resurfaced as part of "The Upstarts", a group of mutant millionaires who engaged in a campaign of murder as part of a game organized by the mutant telepath Gamemaster and the former Hellfire Club Black Queen Selene. The twins tried to acquire Omega Red for the Upstarts but failed. The twins ultimately met their match though when they tried to kill former New Mutant Wolfsbane, who along with her X-Factor teammates easily beat the twins.

The twins resurfaced in the pages of the 1999 "Citizen V" mini-series, where they were seen working with their father Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker. During the mini-series they fight [[Citizen V]] though Andrea realizes that Citizen V is in truth Baron Helmet Zemo. Having been decapitated by Nomad under orders of Henry Peter Gyrich, Zemo survived by moving his mind into the comatose body of the second Citizen V, John Watkins III. Zemo quickly kills Andrea to keep her from telling anyone of his being alive. 

Andreas Von Strucker has not been seen since, though it has been heavily rumored that Fabian Nicieza will have the recently introduced fourth Swordsman be revealed to be Andreas after Brian Bendis used his influence within the Marvel editorial hierchy to veto Swordsman being revealed to be Hawkeye despite Fabian being given explicit permission to bring Hawkeye back, going so far as to create the fourth Swordsman character as a vehicle to bring the popular character back. 

==Ultimate Fenris==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Fenris are two androgynous [[German people|German]] mutant business tycoons who seek mutant supremacy through economic control. Although their motives seem honourable, they are deep in [[corporate crime]].
