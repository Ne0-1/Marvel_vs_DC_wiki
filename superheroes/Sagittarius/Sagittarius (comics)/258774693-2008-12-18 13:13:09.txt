'''Sagittarius''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
The original Sagittarius first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #72 (January 1970), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Avengers'' #80-82 (September-November 1970), ''Daredevil'' #69 (October 1970), ''Iron Man'' #33-36 (January-April 1971), ''Daredevil'' #73 (February 1971), ''Avengers'' #120-125 (February-July 1974), ''Iron Man'' #184-185 (July-August 1984), and ''West Coast Avengers'' #26 (November 1987), in which he is killed.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Harlan Vargas''' is a founding member of the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], and his base of operations was [[Washington, D.C.]]. The Zodiac Cartel was founded by [[Taurus (comics)|Cornelius van Lunt]] (Taurus), handpicking the eleven other members; van Lunt concealed his own identity, while he was the only one who knew the identities of the others. Each member was based in a different American city as part of his nationwide criminal network, with the ultimate goal of world economic and political domination.

Sagittarius has no powers; however, he is skilled at hand-to-hand combat.

Some time later, Harlan was murdered by the LMD Zodiac team.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #26 (November 1987)</ref>

===Sagittarius II===
An android Sagittarius was a [[Life Model Decoy]] created by [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio (Jacob Fury)]] in his "Theatre Of Genetics" to be part of his Zodiac crime organization. Scorpio went after his brother, [[Nick Fury]], with his new group, but was defeated by [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Moon Knight]]. The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destroy [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for their imagined wrong doings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody.

The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. He was destroyed by Hawkeye in a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].

This Sagittarius is equipped with special wrist-launchers which can fire arrows at its opponents, including flame-arrows.

===Sagittarius III===
This Sagittarius was created by Scorpio after the first Sagittarius LMD was destroyed by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in a battle with the West Coast Avengers. This version of Sagittarius, was created to look exactly like Hawkeye to infiltrate the West Coast Avengers compound. 

It was soon discovered by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], and with the help of the [[Leo (comics)|Leo]] LMD created to appear exactly as Tigra to also infiltrate the West Coast Avengers, this version of Sagittarius was destroyed.

===Ecliptic Sagittarius===
Ecliptic Sagittarius is one of the first recruits in the latest incarnation of the Zodiac. Recruited by their leader, [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], Sagittarius was a bow-wielding centaur and has demonstrated a tendency towards violent acts, for which he apparently feels no remorse. He apparently had a relationship with fellow member [[Pisces (comics)|Pisces]]. Sagittarius was apparently killed by [[Weapon X]].

==Other media==
Sagittarius appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' alongside the other Zodiac. Just like the other Zodiac members in this show, he is an alien with a centaur-like appearance with the horse-half mechanical.
