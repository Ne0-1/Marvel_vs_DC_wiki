'''Tigra''' ('''Greer Grant''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] [[superhero#superheroines|superheroine]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. [[First appearance|Introduced]] as the non-superpowered crime fighter '''The Cat''' in ''Claws of the Cat'' #1 (Nov. 1972), she was co-created by writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]], writer [[Linda Fite]], and [[penciller|penciler]] [[Marie Severin]]. She mutated into the superpowered tiger-woman Tigra in ''Giant-Size Creatures'' #1 (July 1974), by writer [[Tony Isabella]] and penciler [[Don Perlin]].

==Publication history==
The Cat was introduced in one of a trio of Marvel Comics aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]]'' and ''[[Shanna the She-Devil]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]]...
{{cquote|...had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for way to expand our franchise. My idea ... was to try to get women to write them. And of course, if we could get a woman to draw them, too, that was great. Stan tapped [artist] [[Marie Severin|Marie <nowiki>[Severin]</nowiki>]] ... for ''The Cat''. ... [Writer] [[Linda Fite]] was working on staff, had done a couple of [[X-Men]] back-up features".<ref>''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 1970): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50</ref>}}

The series lasted four issues, each with a different art team. Severin was teamed with acclaimed 1950s [[EC Comics]] artist [[Wally Wood]] as [[inker]] for the premiere, followed by Severin and inker [[Jim Mooney]] in issue #2; newcomer Paty Greer <!--spelled ok--> co-penciling with 1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] legend [[Bill Everett]], who also inked, in issue #3; and [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Alan Weiss (Comics)|Alan Weiss]] co-penciling the finale, with [[Frank McLaughlin]] inking.

The Cat next appeared alongside [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #8 (April 1973), but was soon revamped as the superpowered, part-animal Tigra in a two-part story in ''Giant-Size Creatures'' #1 (July 1974; "Giant-Size" refers to the comic's page-count, not giant creatures) and ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #20 (Aug. 1974). Tigra made her solo-feature debut with a 15-page story in the black-and-white [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics magazine ''Monsters Unleashed'' #10 (Feb. 1975), followed by a brief run in the umbrella series ''Marvel Chillers'' #3-7 (Feb.-Oct. 1976), and one more solo story in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #42 (June 1978).

Tigra went on to guest star throughout the Marvel line, often appearing in issues of the superhero-team comic ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and later in the cast of the spin-off ''[[West Coast Avengers]]''. She starred in the four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Tigra'' (May-Aug. 2002) by writer Christina Z. and artist [[Mike Deodato]], and has since guest starred in ''[[She-Hulk]]'', ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'', various Avengers comics, and elsewhere.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Cat===
[[Image:The Cat 1.jpg|left|thumb|''The Cat'' #1 (Nov. 1972). Cover art by [[Marie Severin]] & [[Wally Wood]]]]
Greer Grant was a native of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. She was a sophomore at the [[University of Chicago]] when she met her future husband, policeman Bill Nelson. She left college to marry him. The marriage was a strong one, flawed only by Bill's overprotective nature. Bill was killed in an off-duty shooting, and Greer had to find a job of her own. After weeks of searching, she ran into her old physics professor, Dr. Joanne Tumulo.

Dr. Tumulo was working on the human potential experiments that turned Shirlee Bryant into the superpowered villainess called the Cat. Not trusting the test subject chosen by her financial backer, Malcolm Donalbain, Greer persuaded Dr. Tumulo to let her undergo the experimental treatments as well. She emerged with superhuman physical and mental capabilities. When Donalbain had Dr. Tumulo's lab destroyed with dynamite, Greer donned one of dozens of the Cat costumes that he had created and the doctor had appropriated and set out to put an end to his scheme. With her new abilities, she adapted quickly to the strange garb and wrecked Donalbain's headquarters. Rather than let himself be touched by the Cat's raking claws, Donalbain committed suicide. A fire set off by the ruined equipment destroyed Donalbain's headquarters. Greer embarked on a brief career as the Cat, mostly battling old [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)#Enemies|foes]].

Another of Donalbain's Cat costumes surfaced years later, when Patsy Walker discovered it while accompanying the Avengers. She donned it and dubbed herself [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]].

===Tigra===

"The Tigra" is the historical defender/champion of the [[Cat People (comics)|Cat People]], a humanoid race created by sorcery during the Dark Ages. Concerned about the Cat People's uncontrollable population growth and savagery, a community of sorcerers eventually banished the entire original Cat People population to a demonic netherworldly realm.

The two very first Cat People, who were themselves very capable scientists and sorcerers, were able to evade banishment through their magic. They continued to live amongst humanity in secret and worked to refine the Cat People's biology to make a peaceful integration into the human population possible. However, they were constantly persecuted and required a protector. Discovering that the original spell for transforming cats into Cat People like themselves had been rendered inoperative, they created a process combining science, sorcery, and focused mental power that could transform a human female into a "Tigra," a being with abilities that far surpassed those of either race.

This unnamed first Tigra defended the Cat People with great effectiveness, and allowed a new community to establish themselves on Earth, separate from the group that had been banished. This new population continued to live amongst humanity in secrecy through the present-day, relying on enchantments that cast the illusion of a human appearance.
 
Nothing is known about the other Tigras who may have existed, or even if there have been more than two. At the time when Greer was transformed into a Tigra, "The Tigra" was only remembered by the Cat People as a distant but powerful legend. It has been strongly implied that only one Tigra can exist at any given time.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TIGRA 1.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Promotional art for ''Avengers Icons: Tigra'' no. 1 (2002). Art by [[Mike Deodato Jr.]] ]] -->
Dr. Tumulo was revealed to be one of these modern Cat People.<ref>''Giant-Size Creatures'' #1</ref>  When members of [[HYDRA]] tracked Tumolo down to obtain "The Final Secret" (the Black Death plague, which was another creation of the first two Cat People), Greer once again donned the Cat costume and drove them off. However, she was fatally injured by a blast from one of their alpha radiation pistols.

Greer regained consciousness in a Baja, California cave, surrounded by a gathering of Cat People summoned by Tumolo. Rapidly dying from the radiation's effects, Greer was offered one last hope of survival: a combination of ancient science, sorcery, and mental power that would transform her into Tigra, the Cat People's legendary half-human, half-cat warrior. She readily consented, began wearing only her black [[bikini]] from this time on, and arose from the ceremony as a superhuman-powered human-animal [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]. Striped fur covered her entire body, her hands and feet bore razor-sharp [[claw]]s, her teeth became long and pointed, and her eyes were now cat-eyes. In addition to superhuman strength and senses, she also gained many of the drives and instincts of a cat.

Though initially unable to change back to her human self, the Cat People ultimately gave her a mystical cat-headed amulet that allowed her to change at will. She seldom made use of it, however, preferring her feline, superpowered form and mostly abandoning her life as Greer Grant-Nelson.

Greer resumed her superhero career, with most of the world unaware that the woman who briefly fought crime as The Cat was now the feline Tigra. She fought alongside most of Marvel's heavy-hitters in wide-ranging adventures. She made a particular enemy of [[Kraven the Hunter]] and became a friend and associate of the [[Fantastic Four]].

When the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] found themselves shorthanded, [[Moondragon]] used her mental powers to compel a dozen unaffiliated heroes (apparently selected at random) to travel to Avengers Mansion and audition for the vacant position. Though he disapproved of Moondragon's methods, Captain America offered Tigra a spot on the team.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' vol. 1 #211 (September 1981)</ref>

Though Tigra's first tenure with the Avengers was brief, she served well. Her time was highlighted by her single-handedly saving the world from destruction by the [[Molecule Man]], who intended to consume the planet's energy a la [[Galactus]]. Alone among the Avengers, she was able to get close enough to him to talk him out of his plan. She convinced him to seek help from a therapist and the Molecule Man has ceased to be a threat to this day.

The Avengers fought the Ghost Rider, who blasted the team with his terror-inducing hellfire. The nature of Tigra's powers caused her to be affected by the exposure on a far deeper level than her teammates. She was left with great self-doubts about her qualifications as a member of Earth's premier superhero team, particularly alongside such heavy-hitters as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Iron Man]]. Ultimately she resigned her membership, leaving the team on good terms.

She resumed her solo career, eventually settling in San Francisco where she had a series of adventures with [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]] (the then-depowered [[Spider-Woman]]), who had gone into the detective business. They enjoyed such a pleasant friendship and made such an effective team that they were making plans to make their arrangement permanent when [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|The Vision]] recruited Tigra to become a founding member of the Avengers' new west coast-based team.

While with the West Coast Avengers, she seemed to have shed the remainders of her hellfire-induced self-doubt. However, the cat-like aspects of her personality (such as a penchant for savagery and a need for affection) had begun to dominate her human intellect, causing her increasing distress. Ultimately, she came into contact with the banished colony of Cat People, who agreed to resolve her crisis in exchange for carrying out her historical function by murdering the Cat People's longtime foe, [[Master Pandemonium]]. Though she initially accepted their terms, when the critical moment came at an arena in the Cat People's realm, Tigra refused to violate the Avengers' code against killing. The Cat People stripped her of her "Tigra soul" (the peculiar articulation of her Tigra powers in this demonic realm). She was reduced to her normal, pre-transformation human state.

[[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], who had accompanied Greer and the [[West Coast Avengers]], lent Greer the super-suit that she used to wear as The Cat, and a battle ensued. As the tide began to turn against the Cat People, their leader released the "Tigra soul" as a means of confusing Greer. The tactic backfired. The cat-suit had been designed by a Cat Person (Tumolo) specifically to amplify Greer's human capabilities. So instead of Greer being dominated by the "Tigra soul" as before, the suit caused her human and feline personalities to successfully integrate together. 

This time, Greer's transformation into the legendary cat-warrior was much more complete than before. Her strength and abilities were far greater than they were originally. Her appearance became more feline, however, and she grew a tail like the rest of the Cat People. She also lost the ability to shift back to a human form, though as before she showed no sense of loss for her human identity.

Her transformation was so complete and the Tigra legend was so strong amongst the Cat People that they immediately ceased hostilities. Tigra continues to hold a position of significant reverence among the Cat People.

The transformation also resolved the conflicts between the human and feline aspects of her personality. Tigra could now exploit the full range and ferocity of her abilities without fear of going so far that she would lose control of her actions, and she could also indulge her natural feline inclinations (such as hunting and chasing prey for enjoyment) without feeling guilty or self-conscious. This integration was confirmed in concrete ways immediately upon the team's return to Earth. Tigra performed a sport dive off the highest span of the Golden Gate Bridge, exhibiting no signs of any injury or fear of the water. She also terminated her ongoing relationship with [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]], explaining that although she no longer felt a cat-like need to seek affection at every opportunity, she had no conventional human desire to be tied down to one mate, either.

Around this time, the Arthurian Lady of the Lake summoned the West Coast Avengers to England to aid the superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. With the others, Tigra ventured into the realm of limbo to help stop [[Doctor Doom]]'s mad plans to gain power at the cost of killing everyone in Britain.

Tigra briefly left the [[West Coast Avengers]] in a dispute over the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' policy against killing. Tigra stated that she believed by her very nature that killing prey was sometimes necessary. She joined [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Moon Knight]] in forming an independent group.

After returning to the team, Tigra inexplicably underwent another "inversion" and transformed into a more beast-like feline shape, losing her human intellect completely and becoming a danger to her fellow Avengers. This was possibly due to the reality-warping machinations of [[Immortus]], who at the time sought to distract the team so as to have unimpeded access to the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Tigra was forcibly shrunken down to sub-housecat size by Hank Pym and kept in a cage in his lab while the team tended to other urgent matters. She escaped and traveled into suburbia where she lived as a wild animal. She was ultimately rescued and restored to her former appearance and stability by noted witch [[Agatha Harkness]], who was an associate of the [[West Coast Avengers]] at that time. 

Tigra resumed her membership in the West Coast Avengers. On an intelligence-gathering mission in Japan, she and Iron Man battled a team of Asian supervillains known as the [[Pacific Overlords]]. During the fight, Iron Man was incapacitated and Tigra suffered a deep, critical stab wound to the abdomen before dispatching her attackers and making her escape. She flew away in the Avengers' Quinjet, intending to report back to headquarters on the Overlords' plans, but severe loss of blood caused her to lose consciousness and crash land in [[Arnhem Land]], an [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] territory in northern Australia. Rescued by Aborigines, she decided to stay put while she recovered from her wounds, naming Spider-Woman [[Julia Carpenter]] as her replacement. She briefly made Arnhem Land her home, enjoying the company of the Aborigines and the pleasures of living wild.

After the West Coast Avengers disbanded, Tigra resumed her wide-ranging adventures. Though no longer an active Avenger, she continued to participate in Avengers operations when needed, as a member of the team's extended family.

With the aid of a new transformation device to disguise her true identity from her fellow officers, Tigra spent some time on the New York City police force. She focused much of her time on a personal case and in combating a force of vigilante police officers. 

Later, mystical forces which attacked all Avengers brought her to the [[Avengers Mansion]]. There, she and all the other Avengers were entrapped by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan LeFay]], to live out in an alternate universe where LeFay ruled, fighting alongside the others as one of the "queen"'s guards under the name "Grimalkin." After the defeat of Morgan, Tigra went off into space with [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]], to enjoy the pleasures found there. She appeared off and on, having a series of adventures as part of the ad-hoc space-faring [[Avengers Infinity]] team in which she helps in preventing an extra-universal race from destroying all life in our universe.

Tigra returned to Earth with the [[Avengers Infinity]] team during the [[Maximum Security]] storyline, during which she helped to save the Earth from becoming a penal colony for alien criminals.

===Civil War===
Tigra is seen fighting along Iron Man's side during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]. She supports the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration act|registration act]], although she expresses concern about the fate of [[Captain America]] and the other heroes who opposed the Act and turned fugitive. Nonetheless, in ''Civil War Files'', Tigra is listed not merely as having registered to comply with the law, but also as having become an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to actively aid in its enforcement. 

Pretending to switch allegiances, she successfully infiltrates Captain America's Secret Avengers team as a mole. She passes information to Iron Man until the very last day of the conflict, when she was "outed" by [[Hulkling]], Captain America's own spy among the pro-registration forces. Captain America had kept quiet, exploiting her presence to feed [[disinformation]] to Iron Man about his team's strategy, a plan to rescue imprisoned heroes.

===The Initiative===
Greer has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are part of the [[Fifty State Initiative]].<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> She served as a founding instructor at [[Camp Hammond]], the training compound for The Initiative, and resumed her romantic relationship with fellow superhero [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''[[Mighty Avengers]]'' #3 (May 2007)</ref>, unaware that he had been kidnapped and replaced by a Skrull duplicate. 

Tigra was captured by Chilean soldiers controlled by the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]], who sculpted a figure in her likeness and thus put her under his mental control. He uses her and the other superhuman women he's enslaved (including as [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], [[Araña]], and [[Silverclaw]]) as elite guards at his South American base of operations. Tigra and the rest of the heroes were restored to their normal free will when [[Ms. Marvel]] and her S.H.I.E.L.D. strike team liberated the compound and killed the Puppet Master<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #18-19</ref>.

Later she is shot and severely beaten by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] in her home in retaliation for having beaten [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]], a member of his fledgling supercriminal organization. While Tigra is incapacitated, the Hood threatens the life of her mother, and Jigsaw steals the mystic talisman she occasionally uses to transform to her human identity.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #35</ref>

The Hood and his entire crew later appear at her apartment, demanding to know the location of the [[New Avengers]]' secret headquarters. Tigra intentionally gives him information that leads them into an ambush. She joins in the battle and personally beats down The Hood, saving the life of [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in the process.{{issue}}

By the time of The Hood's second appearance in her apartment, she has completely recovered from her injuries and has either reacquired her talisman or replaced it with a close facsimile. <ref>"New Avengers Annual"" #2</ref>. 

Tigra currently serves in the Initiative as a member of the Arkansas team "The Battalion,"<ref>''The Initiative'' vol. 1 #19</ref> and also appears as a member of the Invisible Woman's "Lady Liberators" team. <ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tigra's physical appearance is distinctly cat-like. A thick, sleek coat of striped orange fur covers her entire body. She has pointed ears, sharper-than-normal teeth with pronounced upper and lower canines, eyes with enlarged irises and vertically-slitted pupils, and retractable claws on her feet and hands instead of nails. Her claws and teeth are sufficiently strong to puncture sheet steel, such as that found in a car body. Tigra also has a long semi-prehensile tail, and can willfully contact (but not grasp and lift) objects with it. Tigra's feline physiology grants her various superhuman attributes including superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and resistance to physical injury. If she is injured, her physiology enables her to heal much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human is capable of.

Tigra's senses of sight, smell, and hearing extend far into the superhuman range and are also superior to those of real cats. Tigra can see farther, and with much greater clarity, than an ordinary human. She has this same level of clarity at night, and her vision also extends slightly into the infrared spectrum, allowing her to see in complete darkness.

Her hearing is similarly enhanced, allowing her to hear a wider range of frequencies than a normal human as well as clearly hear sounds that would be far too faint for a human to detect. Exposure to intense, high-frequency sound is far more painful for Tigra than a normal human, however.

Tigra's sense of smell is developed to the point that she can recognize a person by scent alone, and track an individual across great distances and through complex environments. She can also sense changes in a person's mood through changes in scent.

The unusual animal-human hybrid configuration of her brain makes her somewhat resistant to telepathic assaults. Though Tigra is not immune to such tactics, attackers have been forced to focus their powers carefully in order to make them effective on her.

On occasion, she has demonstrated the ability to shift her bones like a cat, intentionally dislocating joints in order to slip free from mechanical restraints.

Tigra possesses a mystical talisman that allows her to change her appearance from feline to human at will. She rarely uses it and only appears in her human form when circumstances require it.

Tigra is an experienced and formidable hand to hand combatant, with a unique fighting style that exploits her feline speed, agility, and instincts. Like all Avengers of her generation, she has sparred and trained extensively with Captain America.

She is also a capable leader and pilot, qualified to operate Avengers aircraft as well as interstellar spacecraft.

==Other versions==
===House Of M===
In the [[House of M]], a reality in which [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] rules the world and mutants are the dominant species, Tigra exploits her feline appearance to "pass" as a mutant. She operates unnoticed in mainstream mutant society on behalf of pro-human groups, first as a member of the Sapien Liberation Army and then as a founding member of [[Luke Cage]]'s underground "Avengers" team.<ref>"House Of M: Avengers" vol. 1 #1</ref> During an FBI ambush set up by [[Misty Knight#House of M|Misty Knight]], Tigra spots the Taskmaster taking aim at Cage from a distant rooftop and leaps into the line of fire. She takes the bullet, saving Cage's life, and dies at the scene.<ref>"House Of M: Avengers" vol. 1 #2</ref>

===Marvel Mangaverse===
She also appears in the "[[Marvel Mangaverse]]" alternate reality as Dr. Strange's assistant/familiar, bound by a magical curse that keeps her in were-tiger form until she completes a thousand good deeds.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' continuity, Tigra as a zombie is seen in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #23. She is part of a huge group of superpowered zombies who have learned of the existence of a trio of humans. The humans are successfully rescued by [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Marvel Zombies|this universe's Magneto]] and the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]].

===Marvel Adventures===
Tigra appears in the alternative "all-ages" version of the Marvel Universe. Though identical in appearance to the main-universe Tigra, she wears a modest high-collared one-piece black swimsuit instead of her usual bikini. She also appears to be younger and less-experienced than her mainstream Marvel counterpart.

She is working as an independent private investigator when a masked man, purporting to be a famous author researching a book about the Avengers, hires Tigra to secretly trail and collect information about its members. After two weeks of following individual Avengers and attempting to avoid detection, she observes the team fighting a losing battle against The Griffin. She leaps in to join the fray. The Griffin is subdued with her help and the team reveals to Tigra that her mysterious client was actually Spider-Man; the assignment was merely a ruse designed to evaluate her potential as an Avenger. She is offered a spot on the team and eagerly accepts.<ref>"Marvel Adventures: Avengers vol. 1 #30"</ref>

==In other media==
===Animation===
Tigra was a member of the Avengers in the animated series and tie-in comic ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]''. Tigra was voiced by [[Lenore Zann]], who also supplied the voice for [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in the [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men cartoon]]. In this incarnation, Greer is an athlete who underwent genetic treatments to give her a competitive edge. These treatments went awry, leaving her with the form and abilities of a cat. This series supported both a toy line and a brief tie-in comic.

In the animated series, the pronunciation of her name is given as "TIE-gra."

===Toys and collectibles===
* In 2006, [[Bowen Designs]] released a Tigra minibust. It was sculpted by Jim Maddox, based largely on a 2001 sketch by [[Sean Chen]].
* An action figure based on Tigra's animated design was released as part of a line of Toy Biz "Avengers United" tie-in toys in 2000.
* A Tigra action figure appeared as part of [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]]'s Marvel Hall Of Fame: She Force line in 1997. It was a repaint of an existing Toy Biz [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] action figure and as such featured many details that are incorrect, giving Tigra boots and a studded collar, as well as large rings of bushy fur around her calves and forearms where the thick fur trim on the tops of the Black Cat's boots and gloves would be.
