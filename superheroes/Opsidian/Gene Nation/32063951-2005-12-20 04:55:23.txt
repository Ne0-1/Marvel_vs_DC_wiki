Gene Nation is a collection of mutants that were an offshoot of the tunnel-dwelling clan called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].  Their history is short-lived, but in their few appearances they happened to make a lasting impact on the [[X-Men]] and their affiliated groups.

==History==

====First Incarnation====
When the mentally unstable [[Mikhail Rasputin]] flooded the Morlock tunnels, many were believed dead.  However, at the last instant Mikhail used his powers to open a [[portal]] into a [[parallel dimension]] dubbed '''The Hill'''.  In this dimension, time moves at a faster rate, and even though it was a manner of months in the main ''Marvel Universe'', it had been between 10-20 years on the Hill.

On the annivesary of the [[Mutant Massacre]], a horrific event in which [[Mr. Sinister]]'s henchmen the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] killed many Morlocks, the members of Gene Nation reappeared in the main universe ([[Earth-616]]).  Their mission was to destroy one human for every Morlock life that was lost, and also, in a side mission performed by Hemingway and Marrow, to kill some of the original Morlocks.  In Marrow's eyes, [[Leech (comics)|Leech]], one of the few to survive the massacre, was weak and instead of defending his people he hid like a coward.  Fortunately, the [[White Queen]], who was trying to recruit Leech to her teenage mutant team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], is able to thwart their efforts. However, with the intervention of the [[Dark Beast]] Marrow and Hemingway escape.


Afterwards, a team of X-Men and the Morlock [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] confront an attack group from Gene Nation including Marrow, Hemingway, Reverb, Sack, and Vessel.  In order to assure that their mission succeeds, Marrow alerts the X-Men that she has a bomb strapped to her heart. Seeing it as the only way of stopping the terrorist, [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] rips out Marrow's heart. Callisto takes the remaining members of Gene Nation back to The Hill.

A few months later, Storm is kidnapped by Mikhail and taken to The Hill. Once there she has to fight her way to the top of the hill where Mikhail lives, where she successfully overpowers him. Having won the victory, Storm forces Mikhail to take all of the people living on The Hill back to the real world.  In an effort to give the mutants a new start, she settles them in a village outside of her home town in [[Africa]].

====Second Incarnation====

However, they wouldn't get much of a chance to start over because shortly after they were placed in Africa the [[Dark Beast]] gathers some of the original members, along with some new recruits, to form a new team. The express purpose of this team is to capture test subjects for the [[evil genius]], namely the students of Generation X.  They succeed in capturing all but the White Queen and the newcomer [[Gaia (comics)|Gaia]] and, with the help of Nate Grey a.k.a. [[X-Man]], they liberate her charges.  

====Third Incarnation====

The teams' final appearance was in the pages of [[Weapon X]] where it is Marrow who is now the leader, having survived her encounter with Storm due to a mutated second heart.  After manipulating the perfect killing machine [[Agent Zero]] into unintentionally killing his former sidekick, the [[assassin]] hunts down and kills every member of Gene Nation in an act of vengeance.  However, he spares the life of Marrow because he doesn't want others to see her as a [[martyr]].

==Notes==

[[Image:xmen68.jpg|thumbnail|right|170px|Cover to ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #68]] 
In between the first and third [[incarnation]] of Gene Nation, Callisto fell sick and sent Marrow to live with the X-Men. The love/hate relationship lasted for a few months and eventually Marrow began to feel at home.  Her bone growths even fell under control with the help of an alien device that healed her. However, it didn't last long as the ''Six-Month Gap'' happened and Marrow mysteriously had lost control again.


[[Image:uncanny403.jpg|thumbnail|left|170px|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #403 showing several members of X-Corps including: [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], and [[M (comics)|M]]]] 
Fever Pitch was seen for a short time terrorizing [[Europe]], where he was taken down by [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]'s [[paramilitary]] group called [[X-Corps]]. Although his group consisted of several members of the X-groups such as [[M (comics)|M]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Multiple Man]], former [[Alpha Flight]] member [[Radius (comics)|Radius]], and the one-time [[interim]] X-Man [[Sunpyre]], it also included reformed villains [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]]. They captured Fever Pitch and forced him, through [[brainwash| brainwashing]] techniques, to be a member of their group...or so they thought. The villian [[Mystique]] had infiltrated the group and was collecting the so-called reformed villains to her side. Joing the [[shapeshift |shapeshifting]] mutant, Fever Pitch went on a rampage in Paris, actually destroying the [[Eiffel Tower]] with the help of his teammates. However the combined efforts of the X-Men and the good members of X-corps stop the villains from doing any further damage.

==Appearances in Other Media==

In the [[video game]] [[X-Men: Legends]], Marrow takes a band of Morlocks dubbed Gene Nation and makes a [[pact]] with the enemy to enable her people to be able to live on the surface. Even though they never make an official appearance, the premise is similar.
