'''Gene Nation''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization and enemies of the [[X-Men]]. They originated from a group of [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] that survived the "[[Mutant Massacre]]" by escaping to another dimension.

==Founding==

===First Incarnation===
When the mentally unstable [[Mikhail Rasputin]] flooded the Morlock tunnels, many were believed dead. However, at the last instant Mikhail used his powers to open a [[Portal (doorway)|portal]] into a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimension]] dubbed '''The Hill'''.  In this dimension, time moves at a faster rate, and even though it was a matter of months in the main ''Marvel Universe'', it had been between 10â€“20 years In the Hill.

On the anniversary of the Mutant Massacre, a horrific event in which [[Mister Sinister|Mr. Sinister]]'s henchmen the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] killed many Morlocks, the members of Gene Nation reappeared in the main universe ([[Earth-616]]).  Their mission was to destroy one human for every Morlock life that was lost, and also, in a side mission performed by Hemingway and Marrow, to kill some of the original Morlocks.  In Marrow's eyes, [[Leech (comics)|Leech]], one of the few to survive the massacre, was weak and instead of defending his people he hid like a coward.  Fortunately, the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], who was trying to recruit Leech to her teenage mutant team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], is able to thwart their efforts. However, with the intervention of the [[Dark Beast]], Marrow and Hemingway escape.<ref>''Generation X'' #5-6</ref>

Afterwards, a team of X-Men and the Morlock [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] confront an attack group from Gene Nation including Marrow, [[Hemingway (comics)|Hemingway]], Reverb, Sack, and [[Vessel (comics)|Vessel]].  In order to assure that their mission succeeds, Marrow alerts the X-Men that she has a bomb strapped to her heart. Seeing it as the only way of stopping the terrorist, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] rips out Marrow's heart. Callisto takes the remaining members of Gene Nation back to The Hill.

A few months later, Storm is kidnapped by Mikhail and taken to The Hill. Once there she has to fight her way to the top of the hill where Mikhail lives, where she successfully overpowers him. Having won the victory, Storm forces Mikhail to take all of the people living on The Hill back to the real world.  In an effort to give the mutants a new start, she settles them in a village outside of her hometown in [[Africa]]. Unfortunately anti-mutant extremists later attack this village and many members of Gene Nation are murdered.

===Second Incarnation===

However, they would not get much of a chance to start over because shortly after they were placed in Africa the [[Dark Beast]] gathers some of the original members, along with some new recruits, to form a new team. The express purpose of this team is to capture test subjects for the [[villain|evil genius]], namely the students of Generation X.  They succeed in capturing all but the White Queen and the newcomer [[Gaia (Marvel Comics)|Gaia]] and, with the help of [[Nate Grey]], also known as X-Man, they liberate her charges.

===Third Incarnation===

The teams' final appearance was in the pages of [[Weapon X]] where it is Marrow who is now the leader, having survived her encounter with Storm due to a mutated second heart.  After manipulating the perfect killing machine [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]] into unintentionally killing his former sidekick, the [[assassination|assassin]] hunts down and kills every member of Gene Nation in an act of vengeance.  However, he spares the life of Marrow because he does not want others to see her as a [[martyr]].
