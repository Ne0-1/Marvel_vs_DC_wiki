The '''League of Assassins''' (renamed the '''League of Shadows''' or '''Society of Shadows''' in other media) is a group of [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[villain]]s, an organization of killers led by [[Ra's al Ghul]], an enemy of [[Batman]] in the [[DC Universe]].

==Fictional history==

===Doctor Ebeneezer Darrk===
The League of Assassins was founded by Ra's al Ghul (exactly when is unknown) to be "the fang that protects the head" (''Batgirl'' #67, 2005). Members of the League demonstrated willingness to die at a word from Ra's. They have included some of the most dangerous [[assassins]] in the world including [[Lady Shiva]], [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], and [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]]. For much of its current history, any member who failed in an assassination was in turn targeted by the League. Indeed, one of its best-known members, the master-archer Merlyn, was eventually forced to flee from the League, fearing for his life, having failed to assassinate [[Batman]]. In more recent years, this policy has apparently relaxed somewhat.

Ebeneezer Darcel, aka Doctor Darrk, was the first known individual assigned to head the League of Assassins by Ra's al Ghul. Darrk himself was seconded by [[Sensei (DC Comics)|The Sensei]], a martial arts master from [[Hong Kong]]. Although many of the League's leaders over the years have been accomplished martial artists, Darrk himself did not depend on physical prowess, and as an assassin he instead relied upon careful planning and manipulation, ambushes and death traps, as well as a variety of cleverly concealed weapons and poisons. Although the League apparently had an inner circle of elite fighters as well as a large number of warriors trained in the martial arts, the League during Darrk's tenure as leader reflected his personal methodology. Following a "falling out" with Ra's (the exact details of which were never made clear) Darrk kidnapped Ra's daughter, [[Talia al Ghul]]. [[Batman]] became involved in this matter while attempting to bring the League to justice for a number of recent killings. Although he had connected the League to several assassinations over the years, all previous attempts to investigate had met dead-ends. Batman rescued Talia (the first time the two would meet, laying the foundation for all their future interaction) and Darrk died while trying to kill them.

===The Sensei===
Under the direction of the organization's second known leader, the villainous [[Sensei (DC Comics)|Sensei]], the League became more brutal, and rebelled against Ra's' rule. Although The Sensei's methods closely resembled Darrk's, and the majority of the League's operatives showed little to no real skill in personal combat, The Sensei did show slightly more reliance on skilled martial artists. This version of the League is best known for two assassinations. As part of an initiation process, the operative known as 'the ''[[Hook (comics)|Hook]]''' was assigned to murder Boston Brand (who became [[Deadman]] after his death). Additionally, [[Professor Ojo]] successfully brainwashed [[Bronze Tiger|Ben Turner]] (best friend and partner of [[Richard Dragon]]), creating an alternate personality dubbed '''The Bronze Tiger''', and turning the master martial artist into a League operative. As The Bronze Tiger, Turner defeated Batman in personal combat while another League operative murdered [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] (the secret identity of Batwoman in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] continuity, and a close personal friend of Batman's post-crisis). Eventually Turner's earlier training at the hands of [[O-Sensei (Comics)|O-Sensei]] (not to be confused with the leader of the League) proved too strong for the League to fully break, and when he refused to kill Batman he was forced to flee the League. Not long afterwards, the insane Sensei - no longer motivated by anything but a desire to raise assassination to an art – attempted to cause an artificial earthquake in order to kill a number of diplomats gathered for peace talks. Batman traced Ben Turner to a hospital, foiling a League attempt to assassinate the man. Turner could not fully remember the actions of his alternate personality (although years later, as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]], he would reveal that the League had used him to kill a number of people) but he was able to aid Batman in uncovering The Sensei's latest plot. Although Batman was unable to prevent the earthquake, ultimately it was only The Sensei himself that died in the disaster, and control of the League returned to Ra's.

===Role in the creation of Lady Shiva===
It was more recently revealed that, prior to the betrayals of Doctor Daark and the Sensei, Ra's had grown tired of the fickle loyalties of his warriors. Ra's assigned [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]] to create a perfect bodyguard ("''The One Who Is All''"). After early attempts to raise such a person resulted in hopelessly psychotic children, Cain decided that he needed a genetically suited child and began searching for a possible mother. To this end he assassinated Carolyn Woosan/Wu-San, one of two astonishingly talented martial artist sisters he had seen fighting in an exhibition. Carolyn's sister, Sandra, swore revenge and tracked Cain down, only to be subdued by the combined might of the League. Both intoxicated and frightened by the levels of skill she was attaining now that she was no longer holding back for her sister's sake, Sandra agreed to be the mother of Cain's child. In return, the League spared Sandra's life, and assisted her in further training. By the time Sandra gave birth she had surpassed the entire League in skill. She left immediately following the birth of her daughter, [[Cassandra Cain]], rechristening herself '''[[Lady Shiva]]'''.

Other stories would suggest that at some points afterwards Shiva worked as a member of the League, and eyewitness testimony from former League member [[Onyx (comics)|Onyx]] indicates that she kept in contact with the League, although she apparently did not see her daughter. Although most of her appearances over the years show her working independently, she apparently had some degree of League membership, and was called upon by Ra's to "rescue" Talia during the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline.

In keeping with Ra's and Cain's plans, the League attempted to train Cassandra Cain from birth to be the ultimate assassin, unknowingly giving her the skills she would use as the hero [[Batgirl]].

===Nyssa al Ghul===
[[Image:Nyssasleague.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Nyssa's League, including (bottom) Lady Shiva and Mad Dog Cain]]
After the death of Ra's, his first-born daughter [[Nyssa Raatko]] formed a new League. [[Lady Shiva]] was recruited to serve as [[Sensei]] to this incarnation of the League, with the intent that Batgirl (Cassandra Cain) would lead the warriors themselves.

Reflecting Shiva's emphasis for martial arts, the known members of Nyssa's League were all skilled in this area, and included the warriors [[Shrike (comics)|Shrike]], Kitty Kumbata, Wam-Wam, Joey N'Bobo, Tigris, Momotado, Krunk, White Willow, the twin warriors Los Gemelos, Ox, [[The Mad Dog (comics)|"The Mad Dog"]], [[Alpha (DC Comics)|Alpha]], and Cristos. The new League was present when [[Mr. Freeze]]'s wife [[Nora Fries]] was brought back to life as the monstrous Lazara, and several members died in the resulting chaos.

Due to the conflict between their loyalty to Shiva and Nyssa and their near-worship of Batgirl as "The One Who is All", the League split at that point, with Ox, White Willow, and Tigris pledging themselves to Cassandra. Several more members of the League (including all the defectors except Tigris) died when the insane "Mad Dog" went on a killing spree. "The Mad Dog", it was revealed, had been one of David Cain's early attempts to create Ra's' perfect warrior. The Mad Dog had been considered useless as a child, since Cain's methods had driven him murderously insane, and Ra's had ordered the child be killed. Nyssa, however, knew that the servant ordered to carry out this execution had instead released him into the wild, explaining how it was possible to recruit him. The Mad Dog was successful in killing Batgirl (who gave her life to protect the [[burqa]]-clad assassin Tigris). She was quickly restored to life in a [[Lazarus Pit]] by Shiva, in order that the two could face each other in a final battle. Batgirl won leaving Shiva on a meat hook suspended over the Lazarus Pit.

===Infinite Crisis===
Although most of its members had died or defected, the League survived the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and was seen to play an important role in [[Secret Society of Super-Villains|The Society]]'s worldwide prison break. Throughout the period of [[52 (comics)|aftermath]] it remained under the control of Nyssa, until she was apparently killed in a car explosion. Cassandra Cain has apparently taken over the League as its new leader, although she abandoned the league at some point prior to the ''Teen Titans'' storyline ''Titans East'', where it is revealed that she was being drugged by Deathstroke.

Furthermore, it appears that Cassandra was battling for complete control of the League of Assassins with Ra's Al Ghul's youngest daughter Talia, as well as the Sensei. Talia who would naturally assume control of her father's empire by default following Nyssa's death, has recently been seen in the ''[[Batman & Son]]'' storyline, leading ninja members of the League of Assassins, against Batman. At the same time, several members felt neither Talia nor Cassandra were up to the role, and, after failing to recruit Black Canary's adopted daughter Sin, gave the leadership to the Sensei, who recently reappeared in the Resurrection of Ra's Al Ghul storyline.

''[[One Year Later]]'', Talia al Ghul forced [[Man-Bat|Kirk Langstrom]] to give her the Man-Bat formula which she used to turn some of its members into Man-Bats. Currently, the League of Assassins and its Man-Bat Commandos are used by Talia as her personal army and bodyguards, carrying her orders and taking retribution over her enemies.<ref>''Batman'' $655</ref>

In the series ''[[Green Arrow]]/[[Black Canary]]'' #11, a [[metahuman]] faction of the League of Assassins was introduced. They were involved in the abduction of an injured [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]]. This groups members included Bear, Tolliver, Ruck, Spike, Mazone, and their leader Targa. However, although they thought they were being commanded by Ra's al Ghul, they were apparently duped by an imposter [[Shado (DC Comics)|Shado]].<ref>''Green Arrow/Black Canary'' #11</ref>

===The New 52===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), the League of Assassins is shown to be part of Talia al Ghul's organization called Leviathan.<ref>''Batman Incorporated Vol. 2 #3</ref>

==Members==
* '''[[Ra's al Ghul]]''' - First appearing in ''Batman'' #232 (June 1971), Ra's al Ghul ("Demon's Head" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), is a centuries-old world-wide [[eco-terrorist]]. He knows Batman's secret identity. He utilizes special pits known as [[Lazarus Pit]]s which enable him to evade death, and live for centuries. He is the founder of The League of Assassins, though exactly when is unknown.

* '''[[Talia al Ghul]]''' - First appearing in ''Detective Comics'' #411 (May 1971), she's the daughter of Ra's al Ghul. Her father encouraged a relationship between Talia and Batman, desiring for Batman to marry his daughter in hopes of recruiting him as his successor. Talia admires Batman in his drive, determination, and nobility, but was always torn between him and the love for her terrorist father. Unlike Catwoman, Talia is more than willing to play second-fiddle to Bruce's mission. She claims he's the father of her son Damian.

* '''[[Nyssa Raatko]]''' - First appearing in ''Detective Comics'' #783 (August 2003), she's the daughter of Ra's al Ghul, born in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1775, and a [[Holocaust]] survivor. She eventually broke off from her father and his crusade, which resulted in a rift between them. She had in her possession a [[Lazarus Pit]] that could be reused over and over again. She was responsible for brainwashing her half-sister Talia into despising not only Batman, but their father as well, whom she ended up killing with a sword. It appears, however, that Nyssa was killed in a car bombing in Northern Africa, presumably by the League of Assassins.

* '''Ebeneezer Darrk''' (Also known as Doctor or Professor Darrk) - He is the first ''known'' individual assigned to head the League of Assassins by Ra's al Ghul. Although many of the League's leaders over the years have been accomplished martial artists, Daark himself did not depend on physical prowess, and as an assassin he instead relied upon careful planning and manipulation, ambushes and death traps, as well as a variety of cleverly concealed weapons and poisons. After earning Ra's enmity (for reasons unknown), Daark died during a plot to kidnap Talia which was foiled by Batman.

* '''[[Sensei (DC Comics)|The Sensei]]''' - First appearing in ''Strange Adventures'' #215 (October/November 1968) as an aged martial arts master from [[Hong Kong]], he was Darrk's second in command. He was put in charge of the League after Darrk's death. However, he would prove just as disloyal as his predecessor, and the Sensei would eventually struggle with Ra's al Ghul for the control of the organization. One of his personal goals is to raise assassination to an art form. He is revealed to be Ra's al Ghul's father in ''Batman'' #671 (January 2008).

* '''[[Doctor Moon]]''' - First appearing in ''Batman'' #240 (March 1972), he is a brain surgeon with skills that make him the person to contact to recover dead brains, erase or modify minds, or mental torture.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', Ra's led the '''Society of Shadows'''. It first appeared under the control of a character loosely based on [[Count Vertigo]] (simply called "Vertigo") who filled a role similar to that of Ebeneezer Darrk. The League of Assassins appears now under Ra's control in "The Demons Quest", "Showdown", and "Avatar".

* The Society of Shadows appears in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "The Demon Reborn."

* In the future of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', [[Terry McGinnis]] (the future [[Batman]]) confronts [[Curaré (Batman Beyond)|Curaré]], the deadliest member of the '''Society of Assassins''', a guild of [[Ninja]] assassins for hire in the future. Terry and an elderly Bruce Wayne later battle against the League of Shadows when Ra's al Ghul (who had taken over Talia's body) attempted to take Bruce's body. It's also known as the Society of Shadows.

* The '''League of Assassins''' appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Sidekicks Assemble". This marks the first media appearance of the League of Assassins that has not had its name altered.

* The '''League of Shadows''' appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' TV series. Known members of the group are Ra's al Ghul, Sensei, [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], [[Professor Ojo]], [[Black Spider]], and Hook. The League of Shadows make their headquarters on Infinity Island, located somewhere in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. In "Infiltrator", the League of Shadows had abducted a nano-technology expert named Dr. Serling Roquette in order to make the "Fog" as part of a plot to steal schematic technologies. [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] managed to save her from a League of Shadows base on Infinity Island, but the "Fog" has been complete. When Dr. Serling Roquette was working on an "Anti-Fog," the Sensei finds out her project and sends Cheshire to dispose of Dr. Roquette only for her to run afoul of Young Justice while Professor Ojo operates the "Fog." When Dr. Roquette is relocated, the Sensei sends [[Black Spider]] and Hook to help Cheshire kill Dr. Roquette only to discover that Dr. Roquette was actually Miss Martian in disguise. The upload of the "Anti-Fog" was a success destroying the "Fog." Cheshire gets away due to Artemis recognizing her while Black Spider and Hook were apprehended. It is later revealed that the Sensei is in league with "[[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]]" ([[Project Cadmus]]' [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]]). He tells "The Light" about Young Justice's interference and discussion between Sensei and L-2 reveal that they have "someone on the inside." In "Targets", the League of Shadows works on a plot to assassinate politicians. During that time, Sportsmaster is seen as a member of the League of Shadows when it comes to helping Cheshire. It turned out that Lex Luthor and Ra's al Ghul had orchestrated the events in order to further the goals of "The Light." In the episode "Bloodlines," Cheshire and Red Arrow raid a League facility in [[Tibet]] in order to find the real Roy Harper (who had been kidnapped and replaced with a clone).

* The '''League of Assassins''' is featured in ''[[Beware the Batman]]''.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/07/12/beware-the-batman-animated-series/2513533/</ref> Known members of the group include Ra's al Ghul, Lady Shiva, Cypher, and Silver Monkey. As revealed in "Broken," [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] infiltrated the League of Assassins to find al Ghul. However, finding the Soultaker Sword (a vessel containing the souls of different conquerors which can drain souls from its victims), she faked her death while taking the sword to keep it from being used. However, during the events of "Safe," sent to capture [[Kobra (comics)|Dr. Jason Burr]] so that they can get their hand on the Ion Cortex, Silver Monkey ends up learning that Katana survived and reports it while concealing his knowledge of the Soultaker's location. In "Family," Batman and Katana fight the League of Assassins' ninjas as Silver Monkey is sent to target the Soultaker Sword. Six hours earlier, Katana is confronted by Silver Monkey in Bruce Wayne's limousine and attacks her for the location of the Soultaker so that the League of Assassins can reclaim the Soultaker. When Bethanie Ravencroft and Silver Mask lead the League of Assassins' ninjas into capturing Bruce Wayne at the A.R.G.U.S. Club, Katana is sent a message to bring the Soultaker to the A.R.G.U.S. Club in one hour. Katana confronts Bethanie Ravencroft and Silver Monkey where she wants them to release Bruce Wayne in exchange for the Soultaker. After Bruce Wayne is hit out the window by Bethanie Ravencroft's arrow (though he had a special padding underneath), the League of Assassin ninjas are unleashed upon Katana while Alfred helps Bruce Wayne to become Batman. When Katana is being overwhelmed by the ninjas, Batman arrives in the nick of time. Batman then uses a smoke pellet to cause a smokescreen where Batman and Katana fight the ninjas. A League of Assassin ninja manages to seize the Soultaker by the time the smokescreen cleared and begins to present it to Silver Monkey. Lady Shiva then arrives stating that Silver Monkey's plans to succeed her won't work. Lady Shiva then unleashes the ninjas on Silver Monkey who end up defeating him. A ninja then gives the Soultaker to Lady Shiva as Bethanie Ravencroft states that she never had motives to betray her. Lady Shiva then uses the Soultaker to drain Bethanie Ravencroft's soul as she states that she has plans for Silver Monkey. Upon getting free and with the help of Alfred, Batman and Katana fight Lady Shiva and the League of Assassins' ninjas. Lady Shiva manages to get away as Batman and Katana escape from the ninjas. Batman claimed that he used Katana to turn the League of Assassins against each other as he plans to reclaim the Soultaker Sword from the League of Assassins. In "Control," the League of Assassins sends their half-human half-computer agent Cypher to control Jason Burr in another attempt to get control over the Ion Cortex. This plot is thwarted by Batman. In "Sacrifice," the League of Assassins have a shipment that ends up stolen by [[Anarky]]. When Lady Shiva orders her ninjas to reclaim the package, Anarky shows up and makes a deal with her where he will return their package in exchange for a small favor. Lady Shiva leads some of her ninjas into obtaining the Calibosix (a cell mutation virus) from the Gotham Contagion Research Center where two of her ninjas got infected. By the time Batman had gotten the serum that cured Katana and the infected ninjas, Lady Shiva had gotten away while the two ninjas were sent to Blackgate Penitentiary. When Lady Shiva returns to her lair, she finds the package and a letter from Anarky as the package contained the body of Ra's al Ghul.

* The League of Assassins appears in the second season of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. Ra's al Ghul is said to be the leader and possibly the founder and also has a child that plays some important role in the League's functions. [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Malcolm Merlyn]] and [[Black Canary|Sara Lance]] were both members at one point but Sara left after realizing the darkness and evil of the League and Merlyn is now wanted for breaking the League's code of honor with the Undertaking. A single nameless member of the League approached Sara in "Broken Dolls" and was killed by Sara when he tried to bring her back to the League. Three more members later came in "League of Assassins" to bring Sara back again, but she beat them with the help of Arrow and her father.

===Film===
* In the first film of [[Christopher Nolan]]'s Batman trilogy, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), they are called the '''League of Shadows'''. They utilized a number of martial arts, including [[ninjutsu]], [[jujitsu]] and various forms of [[kung fu]]. A mysterious man calling himself [[ Henri Ducard]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) recruited and trained Bruce Wayne ([[Christian Bale]]) for a man that he called their leader, Ra's al Ghul ([[Ken Watanabe]]), for an unspecified period of time. He told Wayne the story of how the injustice of his wife being taken from him led him on the path of the League of Shadows. Bruce rejected the League when he was ordered to kill a criminal to prove his commitment to justice, and he learned that the League wanted him to lead a mission to destroy Gotham City. The League's base was destroyed in the subsequent battle as Wayne fought the man that he believed to be Ra's al Ghul and left him for dead. The League later enacted their plan to destroy Gotham and Ducard revealed to Wayne that he was Ra's al Ghul at Bruce Wayne's birthday party. They attacked Gotham because they felt that the city had become decadent; Ra's al Ghul said that the League had worked to restore the world to balance throughout history as human civilization achieved decadence around the world; Ra's stated "We [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome]], [[Black Death|loaded trade ships with plague rats]], [[Great Fire of London|burned London to the ground]]." The plan was to use the stolen Wayne Enterprises microwave emitter to vaporize [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s ([[Cillian Murphy]]) toxin and have the city's inhabitants tear each other apart in a state of fear. Despite their best efforts, Bruce Wayne, now Batman, was able to fight off four members of the League single-handedly, before defeating Ra's himself aboard a train where Ra's was left to die as it crashed.
* [[Alfred Pennyworth (The Batman)|Alfred]] mentions the reconstruction of Wayne Manor to Bruce in [[2008 in film|2008's]] ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Nolan's second [[Batman in film|Batman film]], due to the fact that Ra's al Ghul ordered the League of Shadows to burn it down in ''Batman Begins''.

This time, the League plots to hold Gotham under siege by converting a fusion reactor, developed by Wayne Enterprises in a project sponsored by Miranda Tate ([[Marion Cotillard]]), into a nuclear bomb. Its membership includes a large number of Bane's fellow mercenaries who were former employees of corrupt Wayne Enterprise board member [[Roland Daggett|John Daggett]] ([[Ben Mendelsohn]]), a business rival of Bruce Wayne's. Alfred researched rumors about Bane's past with the League, concluding that he was excommunicated by Ra's al Ghul for being too extreme. During their first confrontation, Bane defeated Batman and placed him in Bane's former home, a foreign penitentiary known only as "the [[Lazarus Pit|Pit]]". Bane then proceeded to hold Gotham hostage while giving the citizens false hope of survival by means of a faux revolution. He exposed the truth about Harvey Dent and had all of the inmates of Blackgate Penitentiary released. 

:While in his cell, Bruce was told the story of an exiled mercenary and his wife and child that were once imprisoned there. The child was said to be the only one who successfully escaped the prison. Ra's al Ghul appeared to Bruce in the form of a hallucination, who implied that he was "immortal" through the birth of his child within the Pit, the [[heir]] to the League of Shadows. Based on the information he learned earlier from Alfred regarding Bane's upbringing and a reference made by Bane himself,<ref>[http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/quotes?qt=qt1748343 The Dark Knight Rises (2012): Quotes].

After Batman had defeated Bane, Miranda stabbed Batman and revealed herself as [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]], Ra's al Ghul's child and rightful heir, who climbed out of the Pit with the aid of her childhood friend and protector, Bane. Bane was secretly working with her while she operated under the name of Miranda Tate to complete her father's mission, showing Batman that she held the trigger to the nuclear bomb.<ref>Warner, Kara (2012-07-28).

Talia resented her father for this, but she was never able to forgive him until he died fighting Batman. [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] ([[Anne Hathaway]]) killed Bane with the [[Batcycle|Bat-Pod]]'s cannon at short range, and Batman forced Talia's truck carrying the bomb off the road where she died believing that her father's work was finished. Following a battle within Gotham City's streets, the rest of the League members in the city along with Gotham's criminals are either jailed, incapacitated, or killed in battle against the GCPD.

===Video games===
* Lady Shiva appears in batman: arkham origins as one of the 8 assassins key to the story, also there are various challenge maps containing the initiation of bruce wayne into the league of assassins

* One of the achievements ([[Xbox 360]])/trophies ([[PlayStation 3]]) of the game ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'' is called League of Assassins. This achievement is unlocked if the player manages all the villains of the game.

* The League of Assassins appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

* The League of Assassins appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. They are first hinted in the game when several grunt inmates exclaim they may have just seen a ninja, though they are not actually seen until Batman tries to rescue [[Mr. Freeze]] from the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]. The League is made up of Talia's elite guard, and is notably the only incarnation of the League of Assassins in both comics and media to be composed of mostly female members, with Ra's being the only male member shown in Arkham City. A member of the League is first seen on display meditating in the Penguin's museum, Penguin explaining he had no idea who she actually was, but that she had broken into his museum (why she was in the museum at all is never explained) and managed to kill eight of his men before she was beaten into unconsciousness. After Penguin is defeated and Batman mentions Ra's al Ghul to Mr. Freeze, the assassin opens her eyes and desperately tries to break the glass to her display, eventually succeeding at the cost of a bloody shoulder wound. She exclaims that Batman and Freeze are unworthy to speak of the great Ra's al Ghul before fleeing the museum, the bloodstains leaving a trail for Batman to follow out of the museum and onto the Bowery rooftops. Batman finds a bloody rag used to clean the wound and tries to scan it before the ninja attacks him. Batman follows the ninja and manages to put a tracer on her before she has him in a death stroke and two other assassins at her side. [[Tim Drake|Robin]] saves the Dark Knight from the trio before Batman follows them down into the sewers and eventually into Wonder City. Batman is surrounded by multiple ninjas and about to be killed before he is saved by Talia al Ghul. After Batman takes the Demon Trial they are not seen again, but it is revealed that Ra's, Talia and the League of Assassins were funding Quincy Sharp's mayoral campaign and rigged it to win in his favor. They were also the power behind [[Hugo Strange]] and Protocol 10, which, if successful, would have meant Strange was Ra's al Ghul's successor. As Strange, Ra's al Ghul and Talia al Ghul are all dead by the end of the game it appears the League has lost both its leader and possible successors. Though as both Ra's al Ghul and Talia al Ghul's bodies are missing, it is possible the League may have taken their bodies to a [[Lazarus Pit]].

* ''[[The Batman Adventures|Batman: The Gotham Adventures]]'' (based on ''Batman: The Animated Series'') revealed that the League of Assassins existed as a separate entity from the Society of Shadows (although both groups served Ra's al Ghul). Much like their counterpart in the mainstream DC Universe, this version of the League of Assassins was responsible for the murder of [[Deadman|Boston Brand]], creating the ghostly hero Deadman. The Sensei was loyal to Ra's in this continuity and, faced with either living out the last of his years in prison or defying Ra's wishes, chose a third option where he walks out of his mountain home and off the cliff.
