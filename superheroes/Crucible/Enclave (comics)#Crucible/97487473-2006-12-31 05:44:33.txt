The '''Enclave''' is a fictional group of [[dictator]]ially-minded scientists featured in [[comics]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The characters are a part of the [[Marvel Universe]].  The Enclave was founded by four scientists: Dr. Jerome Hamilton, an American medical biologist (now deceased), Maris Morlak, a Lithuanian nuclear physicist, Professor Wladyslav Shinsky, a Polish genetecist, and Carlo Zota, a Spanish electronics technician.  They are responsible for the creation of [[Adam Warlock|Him/Adam Warlock]] and [[Kismet (comics)|Paragon/Her/Kismet]].

==Crucible==
'''Crucible''' is the supervillain identity used by  Maris Morlak and Professor Wladyslav Shinsky, two members of the Enclave.  Crucible went after [[Mister Fantastic]] in a plot to steal his inventive genius and kickstart the Enclave's genetics program.  They wore identical suits of [[power armor]], forged by the same monks who forged [[Doctor Doom]]'s armor, which have the ability to [[transmutation|transmute]] the shape and composition of materials.

==Ultimate Enclave==
In the [[Ultimate Extinction]] miniseries, it was revealed that a group of scientists rented a radio telescope, applied their own algorithms to it, and were able to see a 'processional entity'(the creature known as Gah-Lak-Tus, the Ultimate version of [[Galactus]]) which would arrive within 20 years. To fight the entity when it arrived, they hired Heather Moon, a contract killer(and the Ultimate version of the Avenger [[Moondragon]]), cloned her, and raised the clones to be an army against Gah-Lak-Tus. The clones refer to the scientists as 'the Enclave', but it also operates as the Paragon Corporation.
