'''Jocasta''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in the [[Marvel Universe]]. A member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the character is a robot created by the villain [[Ultron]].

==Fictional character biography==
The robot named Jocasta was built by the robot [[Ultron]] in an abandoned aerospace research center in Nassau, Long Island, New York, in order that he might have a mate.  To better allow this robot sentience, Ultron based her mind and brain patterns on Janet Van Dyne, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], the wife of his maker, [[Henry Pym]]. To animate his bride, Ultron also brainwashed Pym into transferring the lifeforce of the Wasp into the feminine robotic shell, which he would named Jocasta, after the [[Jocasta|wife/mother]] in the legend of [[Oedipus]] (A reference to the fact that Ultron's obsession with Pym — his "father" — reflects a real-life manifestation of the [[Oedipus Complex]]). However, realizing that the Wasp would have to die in order for her to live, Jocasta alerted the Avengers, who defeated Ultron and reversed the process, leaving Jocasta a mindless husk.<ref>''Avengers'' #162</ref>

Henry Pym retained custody of the inanimate robotrix, intending upon studying her. Upon the urging of the Wasp, he had Jocasta moved to the Avengers Mansion. There, Ultron revived Jocasta with a remote link, activating the mental "residue" the Wasp left behind. Jocasta escaped from Avengers custody, and led the Avengers into Ultron's trap. Jocasta was programmed to be loyal to Ultron but she eventually betrayed him, choosing to help the Avengers defeat him again.  She was then abducted by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]].<ref>''Avengers'' #170-171</ref> She was freed from the Collector by the Avengers, and then she aided the Avengers against [[Korvac]].<ref>''Avengers'' #174-177</ref> 

Afterward, Jocasta lived in the Avengers Mansion for a time. Due to their similar backgrounds, she developed feelings for [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], but he was happily married to the [[Scarlet Witch]] and could not return Jocasta's feelings. Jocasta proved particularly helpful in the Avengers' first confrontation with the villainous [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], who possessed photographic reflexes that let him duplicate any move he'd seen only once; having never even seen Jocasta before, the Taskmaster couldn't predict what she might be about to do. Jocasta was granted provisional status with the team. During this period, she aided them against threats such as the giant robot Red Ronin, the [[Yellow Claw]], the Berserker, Pyron, and the second incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. At one point, she was electronically deactivated by [[Iron Man]] under control by Ultron, but was reactivated following Ultron's defeat.<ref>''Avengers'' #202-203</ref>

Jocasta did not believe she was accepted by most of the team and she was never officially inducted into the Avengers. After she single-handedly defeated a rogue sentient weather satellite, she left the Avengers following a membership reorganization. She was unaware that they had planned to grant her special substitute member status, which allowed her to remain with the team despite limits imposed on the team's membership roster.<ref>''Avengers'' #211</ref>

Wandering the country, Jocasta discovered that her cybernetic senses and powers were malfunctioning. She sought help from the [[Fantastic Four]] and was befriended by them and [[Alicia Masters]]. Soon, it became apparent that her malfunctioning powers were the symptoms of a pre-programmed suggestion, which compelled Jocasta to rebuild Ultron. She did, but soon teamed up with Fantastic Four member [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the robot called [[Machine Man]] to defeat Ultron. Jocasta intentionally detonated a weapon Ultron was holding, knowing she would be caught in the resulting blast. Ultron nevertheless survived, until Machine Man reached down his throat to tear out vital circuitry.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #93</ref>  The Avengers held a memorial for their fallen ally, and the Machine Man attended, realizing his love for Jocasta.

Jocasta was reassembled some time later by technicians of the [[High Evolutionary]].  Jocasta retained enough of her programming to send out a signal to the Avengers. The team had disbanded at the time, but the signal reached reserve members, including [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Captain America#1980s|The Captain]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the second [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]]. Jocasta helped them fight the Evolutionary's force and located his base deep below the surface of the ocean. Jocasta sacrificed herself once again to blow up the Evolutionary's command ship by deliberately disrupting the ship's matter/anti-matter drive, which caused an explosion that destroyed the ship and its contents.  Before she sabotaged the ship, [[Captain America]] assured her that she was a true Avenger.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #17</ref>

Jocasta's robotic head assembly was later retrieved by the Avengers. They turned it over to Machine Man, who had been working on a way to resurrect his lover, just before he was attacked by a form of the alien [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].  In the same area, the arms dealer known as [[Sunset Bain|Madame Menace]] became involved in the fray, and found Jocasta's lost head, appropriating it for her own purposes.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #11</ref>  Much later, Madame Menace manipulated events so [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] would unlock Jocasta's programming so that she would become the basis for Menace's new weapons systems.  Tony Stark soon realized the identity of the android, helped Jocasta to awaken, and Jocasta managed to turn the tables on Madame Menace, seemingly sacrificing herself yet again. 

In reality, Jocasta managed to survive by downloading her intelligence into Iron Man's computerized armor, where she reasserted herself.  Jocasta's intelligence was placed within Tony Stark's computerized mansion, and she would help him with daily operation of his mansion as well as to procure information as needed. Having been programmed with the latest in diagnostic, preventative medical and surgical techniques, Jocasta also spent time serving as Stark's [[physician]]/[[psychologist]], providing him with someone he could talk to about his problems and who could examine his latest injuries without risking his secret identity being compromised.

Since the Iron Man armor was used to house the programming that made up Jocasta, it became infected with the pre-programmed subconscious suggestion to rebuild Ultron, but instead managed to develop its own artificial intelligence.  Stark was almost killed in a confrontation with the armor, but in the end, it sacrificed itself to allow Stark to live.  Stark left the armor buried on a deserted island.  The armor was revived, however, by the [[Sons of Yinsen]], a quasi-religious cult founded in remembrance of [[Yinsen]], the co-creator of the original Iron Man armor that allowed Tony Stark to escape his [[Communist]] captors in [[Vietnam]].  Free of its [[artificial intelligence]], the armor was contacted via remote by the head of Ultron, disembodied after his most recent encounter of the Avengers and in the company of the bio-synthetic robot being known as [[Antigone (comics)|Antigone]].  The head attached itself onto the armor and took control of the Sons of Yinsen and the flying city that they inhabited.

Another member of the Sons of Yinsen was helping Tony Stark in the guise of Iron Man.  The two learned of Ultron's activities and that he planned to use the cult to wipe out humanity.  Stark confronted Ultron directly and finally managed to download Jocasta's intelligence into the armor once more.  The vestiges of the armor's intelligence battled with the presence Jocasta, the result of which caused Ultron's head to come shooting off the armor.  The head hit Antigone, and both fell off the floating city, which Ultron rigged to explode after his defeat.  Stark failed to find a trace of Jocasta and assumed her to have died fighting the sentient armor. 

In reality, Jocasta did not die.  She appeared in possession of Antigone's body and left, taking Ultron's head with her.

During a crisis that nearly destroyed the Avengers, Jocasta was seen at Avengers Mansion in her classic silver robotic form<ref>''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''</ref>.

===Marvel Zombies===
{{main|Marvel Zombies 3}}
Jocasta's next mission is with A.R.M.O.R., to retrieve a blood sample from a living human of the "[[Marvel Zombies]]" universe. [[Machine Man]] accompanies her and [[Portal (comics)|Portal]] transports them there.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #1</ref> Jocasta and Machine Man ran into [[Vanessa Fisk]], the wife of the zombified Kingpin and extracted a blood sample from her. Machine Man remained behind to attack the zombies and Jocasta is forced to leave him behind when Portal returns to collect them.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #3</ref> The two later rejoined and reconciled at A.R.M.O.R. after the zombie threat was (albeit temporarily) neutralized.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #4</ref>

===The Initiative===
Jocasta is next seen as a member of the [[New Mexico]] [[Fifty State Initiative]] superhero team, the Mavericks, alongside a [[Skrull]] posing as veteran hero [[Sharon Ventura|She-Thing]].<ref name="newsaramalist">[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=158856 FRED VAN LENTE ON MARVEL ZOMBIES 3 - NEWSARAMA]<!--Mentions that MZ3 takes place before Secret Invasion.--></ref> Jocasta searches for her teammate and tracks her signal to the home of [[3-D Man|Chuck & Hal Chandler]]. She retrieves [[Devil-Slayer]] from the Hawaii team, and they teleport to where [[Delroy Garrett|the new 3-D Man]], the [[Skrull Kill Krew]], [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], and [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], to join them in the fight against the Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #17</ref> Jocasta and Dice confronted a Skrull posing as Skyhawk, but had a hard time getting through the crowd to stop the Skyhawk-Skrull.<ref>Avengers: The Initiative #19</ref>

===Mighty Avengers===
Writer Dan Slott has confirmed that Jocasta will be a member of his new [[Mighty Avengers]] lineup following the completion of Secret Invasion #8.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090828-SlottAvengers.html</ref> Jocasta joins the Mighty Avengers along with Henry Pym, the new Wasp.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref> During this time, Jarvis witnessed Jocasta kissing Pym. When Jarvis brought up the subject, stating it was akin to kissing her grandfather, Jocasta countered by saying that, since Pym was the creator of modern artificial intelligence, the act was more along the lines of "kissing God". Jocasta later physically plugged herself into Pym's "Salvation Two" machine, preventing the Mighty Avengers' base from falling out of its dimensional pocket.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #26</ref> This act allowed the Mighty Avengers to enter their new headquarters, the Infinite Avengers Mansion, from which Jocasta was able to transfer her consciousness into multiple different bodies created within the Mansion, to ensure that no one gets lost in it. She can only inhabit one body at a time.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #27</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jocasta's body is composed of titanium steel with remarkable superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and reflexes, which can withstand most physical and energy attacks.  Being a "non-living" construct, she requires no food, water, or oxygen to survive and thus is also immune to poisons and diseases and can easily survive in the vacuum of space and underwater.  She is able to project beams of electromagnetic energy from her eyes, and erect a force field around herself to protect her from incoming attacks.  She also possesses a heightened sense of sight, smell, and hearing along with superhuman strength and dexterity.  Jocasta can also perceive electromagnetic particles, and detect energy patterns and track them to their source.  She is hyper-intelligent, with a capacity for unlimited self-motivated activity, creative intelligence, and human-like emotions. Jocasta can communicate through an incalculable number of media. She possesses superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities and has the ability to make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. Recently, it has been revealed that Jocasta's internal circuitry has a built-in holographic image inducer, allowing her to disguise herself as a human being,<ref>''The Mighty Avengers #25</ref> and on one occasion to appear as Janet Van Dyne to give Henry Pym a therapy session to tell him things as if Janet was not dead. <ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> Jocasta, besides sharing the same brain patterns with Van Dyne, has her voice also.

==Other versions==
===Madame Menace===
In an alternate reality, Madame Menace kept Jocasta's head; she rebuilt her body and revived her (but at the same time, she captured and deactivated Machine Man).  For years, Jocasta served as the villainess' advisor and companion.  When Machine Man was revived in 2020 A.D. and exacted his revenge on Madame Menace, Jocasta elected to stay with Menace to make sure she keeps her promise to leave Machine Man and his newfound friends alone.<ref>''Machine Man'' Vol. 2 #1-4</ref>

===Proctor===
Another Jocasta from an alternate timeline had appeared with the team called The Gatherers, consisting of members of Avengers from other timelines whose worlds had been destroyed by a being known as [[Proctor (comics)|Proctor]].  This Jocasta was gold in color and had an array of weaponry strapped to her right arm.  She was married to Wonder Man in her timeline.

===Avengers Forever===
In the Avengers Forever miniseries, Captain America and Giant-Man encounter a group of future Avengers battling a Martian invasion, counting Jocasta as a member. This version of the character somewhat resembles the Vision, bearing intangibility powers and a caped costume. In this future, Jocasta has married Machine Man (though he is dead) and is pregnant with their artificial child.

===Ultimate Universe===
During [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]] [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Pym]] is found dead, being eaten by the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]]. After killing the Blob, [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] takes her body back to the Triskelion and tells Iron Man to take her inside and open an encrypted file titled "The Jocasta Project."

==Other media==
===Film===
* Jocasta is the A.I. of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark's]] arctic base in the animated feature [[Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow|Next Avengers]].  No confirmation if this is a nod to her previous comic history with a body, or if Stark had created/programmed her.
