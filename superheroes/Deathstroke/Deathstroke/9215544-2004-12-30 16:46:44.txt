'''Slade Wilson''', also known as '''[[Deathstroke the Terminator]]''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He is a [[mercenary]] and [[assassin]].  He first appeared in ''[[New Teen Titans]]'' vol. 1 #2 ([[1980]]).

Imbued with amazing physical prowess by secret army experiments, he also has an amazing healing factor which can regenerate his body, even from death.  He is also a crack marksman and skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and is willing to fight dirty when necessary.

However, he kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was a crack military combat instructor, until a criminal kidnapped his younger son, Joseph, as a hostage to force Slade to divulge some secret information.  Slade refused to do so and attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous.   Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying his [[vocal cords]] and rendering him mute.  After taking Joseph to the hospital, Slade's wife, enraged at his endangerment of her son, tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy one of his eyes.  Afterward, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black featureless half covering his lost eye.

Slade has a long history as an enemy of the Teen Titans, beginning when his other son, Grant, became an early Titans foe called the Ravager who was physically enhanced to fulfill a contract to kill or capture the Teen Titans.  However, those enhancements proved fatal and Slade agreed to complete the contract.  As a result, he attacked the Titans continually and finally succeeded in capturing them by introducing [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] into the team as a spy.  At the end of this plot, Slade was defeated and captured with the help of Joseph, who joined the team as [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]].  Despite their enmity, he has grudgingly worked alongside the Titans on occasion, usually to battle a greater evil.

Deathstroke was eventually forced to kill Jericho after his possession by the tainted souls of Azerath.  Recently it was revealed that Jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into Deathstroke in the instant before his death.  Taking control of his father, Jericho launched a series of attacks against the current Teen Titans, most notably shattering [[Impulse (comics)|Impulse]]'s knee with a shotgun blast.  Deathstroke was freed of Jericho's control and has since brought his one remaining child, Rose Wilson, into the mercenary business as the new Ravager.

Deathstroke received his own series, ''Deathstroke the Terminator'', in [[1991]]; this series lasted for 45 issues (plus a special #0 issue), being cancelled shortly after [[Zero Hour]] retitled the series to ''Deathstroke the Hunted'' for issues #0 and #41-45.

Many critics complain that writer [[Rob Liefeld]] copied the Deathstroke character in his work at [[Marvel Comics]], creating Wade Wilson, alias [[Deadpool]], an amoral, quick-healing mercenary who clashed with Marvel's formerly-teenaged hero team, [[X-Force]].

The character appears as a recurring villain in the ''[[Teen Titans#The Animated Series|Teen Titans]]'' animated series as a mysterious criminal mastermind known only as Slade.
