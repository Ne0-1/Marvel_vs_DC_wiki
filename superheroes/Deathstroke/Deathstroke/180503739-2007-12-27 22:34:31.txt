'''Deathstroke the Terminator''' ('''Slade Wilson'''), also called simply '''Deathstroke''' (and originally simply the '''Terminator''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] and sometime [[anti-hero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. He is a [[mercenary]] and [[assassination|assassin]] who first appeared in ''[[Teen Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'' (1st series) #2 ([[1980]]). [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard Magazine'']] rated him the 84th greatest villain of all time.<ref>''Wizard'' #177</ref>

==Publication history==
Deathstroke received his own series, ''Deathstroke the Terminator'', in [[1991]]; It was retitled to ''Deathstroke the Hunted'' for issues #0 and #41-45 and then simply "Deathstroke" from 46 through 60. The series was cancelled with issue 60 shortly after the conclusion of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''. In total Deathstroke ran for 65 issues (#1-60, plus 4 annuals and a special #0 issue).  

Even though the character of Deathstroke the Terminator pre-dates Arnold Schwarzenegger film ''[[The Terminator]]'' by four years, the Slade Wilson character is now simply called "Deathstroke", even by characters who had called him "Terminator" for years. The full title has not completely fallen out of use, having been referenced as recently as [[Justice League Elite]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Imbued with enhanced physical prowess by secret army experiments attempting to create metahuman soldiers for the U.S. military, Deathstroke the Terminator (called "Terminator" for most of his published existence) became a mercenary soon after the experiment.  However, he kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor, until a criminal named the [[Carlos the Jackal|Jackal]] kidnapped his younger son, Joseph, as a hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin.  Slade refused to do so, claiming that it was against his personal honor code, and attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous.  Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying his [[vocal folds|vocal cords]] and rendering him mute.  

After taking Joseph to the hospital, Slade's wife Adeline, enraged at his endangerment of her son, tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye.  Afterward, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black featureless half covering his lost eye.  Without his mask, Slade wears an eyepatch.

===The Teen Titans===
[[Image:Tt2ravager.PNG|left|170px|thumb|Cover to ''New Teen Titans'' #2. The first appearance of '''Deathstroke''' (in the shadows). Art by George Perez.]]
Slade has a long history as an enemy of the Teen Titans, beginning when his other son, Grant, became an early Titans foe called the [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]] who was physically enhanced to fulfill a contract to kill or capture the Teen Titans.  However, those enhancements proved fatal and Slade agreed to complete the contract.  As a result, he attacked the Titans continually and finally succeeded in capturing them by introducing [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] (whom he shared an intimate relationship with, despite her being barely sixteen years old) into the team as a spy. 

At the end of this plot, Slade was defeated and captured with the help of Joseph, who joined the team as [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]. Slade was put on trial for his crimes, but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by Garfield Logan, aka [[Beast Boy]] so that he could kill Slade himself, believing he was responsible for Terra's betrayal of the Titans. However, when the two confronted each other, Beast Boy found himself unable to kill Slade. Feeling some empathy for his grief, Slade explained his past with Terra, and Beast Boy realized he was not to blame for the choices Terra had made. The two men parted on peaceful terms afterward. 

Months later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating a mysterious plague linked to a group of biologically engineered beastmen, one of whom was a target of an assassination by Slade himself. When [[Donna Troy|Troia]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] were both stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion. Shortly after this, he came to the Titan's assistance again during the ''Titans Hunt'' storyline when most of their members were abducted by the [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest Society]], and proved instrumental in tracking them down, only to discover their leader was none other than Jericho himself.

It was revealed that Jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of [[Azarath]], who were using him to capture the Titans and use them as physical hosts in order to survive. During the transfer process, Jericho's true self resurfaced briefly, begging his father to kill him. To spare his son any more pain and save the remaining Titans, Slade was forced to drive a sword through Jericho's heart, seemingly killing him. This act still haunts him to this day, though Jericho later turned out to have survived death by transferring his mind into his father's body seconds before his death. 

Afterward, Slade continued his life as a mercenary, but also acted as an occasional hero, aiding the Titans or acting on his own to help others, most notably during the ''Total Chaos'' storyline when the [[Team Titans]] arrived in the 20th Century to assassinate Donna Troy before she could give birth to her son, who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot, [[Lord Chaos]]. His relationship with Garfield Logan had also changed around this time to the point where they became friends as well. Slade also met Pat Trayce, a tough former-cop who would become the new costumed [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. Pat Trayce and Slade quickly became lovers, and began a tumultuous on again/off again relationship.

===Family business===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AddieHIVE.jpg|right|thumb|Deathstroke finds his wife Addie dying.]] -->
[[Image:Roseslade.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Deathstroke with his daughter [[Rose Wilson]].]]
After Slade thwarted an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S. Senator. The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones. Eventually with the help of the Titans and [[Sarge Steel]], Slade was able to prove his innocence, and the true culprit was revealed to be [[Mento (comics)|Steve Dayton]], under the alias of the Crimelord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.

Meanwhile, his relationship with his estranged wife Adeline took a tragic turn as Slade underwent a process to gain regeneration power, allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact (this power is limited, as Slade can not regenerate his lost eye since that injury happened before he gained his healing factor) . After gaining the power, Slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion, resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality. This drove Adeline insane, shaming Deathstroke into going into a semi-retirement state. 

In ''Titans'' #12, Deathstroke teamed up with the Titans to face his wife Adeline, who in her insane state, had revived The [[H.I.V.E.]] and sought to rid the world of all superhumans, blaming them for Jericho's death. During the battle, interrupted by [[Vandal Savage]] and a band of villains that he had organized from recent Titan battles, Adeline's throat was slit and begged Slade to kill her, since her version of her healing factor wouldn't heal the wound but allow her to live in spite of it. Deathstroke refused, but Koriand'r, aka [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] shocked her teammates and Deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrating her completely, per Adeline's wishes. This was a turning point, as Deathstroke renounced all ties with the Titans as a result of this act of mercy on Starfire's part. 

Recently, it was revealed that Jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into Deathstroke in the instant before his death.  Taking control of his father, Jericho forced Deathstroke to murder his longtime butler, mentor, and companion [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]].  He then launched a series of attacks against the current Teen Titans, most notably shattering [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'s knee with a shotgun blast, before leaving his father's body.  Deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child, [[Rose Wilson]], into the mercenary business as the new Ravager, in order to find and kill Jericho. 

In ''' ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]],'' ''' Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], who was being chased by the [[Justice League]].  In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of [[Elongated Man]], the [[Wally West|Flash]] (Wally West), [[Zatanna]], [[Hawkman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], and [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]] (Kyle Rayner).  He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower. But before the outcome of this conflict with Rayner ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him. Slade went ballistic and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground. Dr. Light used his powers, and the two escaped. Near the end of Identity Crisis, Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop. Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone. Instead Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket. The note reads, "''This is yours - We're not done''."

===''Infinite Crisis''===
Deathstroke was a founding member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline.  He was seen in ''Infinite Crisis'' #1, hiding in a warehouse south of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] waiting to ambush the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] with several other members.  The battle didn't last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had impaled [[Phantom Lady]] through the chest, calling his action "just business".

He was the employer of an undercover [[Dick Grayson]], whom he hired to train his daughter Rose.  However, after the two had a confrontation with [[Superman]], Deathstroke discovered that Nightwing had been teaching Rose the values of heroism.  He could not kill Grayson in front of his daughter because doing so would undo all of Slade's teachings.  Nightwing offered a deal: he would stay away from Rose if Slade would keep the [[metahuman]] villains out of [[BlÃ¼dhaven]]. The deal held for 34 hours until ''Infinite Crisis'' #4, when Slade, under the orders of Alexander Luthor Junior, the real leader of the Society, went with several villains &mdash; who included old Titans [[Doom Patrol]] foes and [[Brotherhood of Evil]] members [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Brain (comics)|Brain]] &mdash; to drop [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]], another fellow villain who appeared to be a nearly brainless monster made of pure energy and radioactive chemicals, on BlÃ¼dhaven, killing thousands.  Slade gave the explanation to the Brotherhood that Nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again.

Grayson took the first of his revenge by bursting in on Deathstroke and [[Rose Wilson|Rose]]'s training session, revealing to the latter that the [[Kryptonite]] that Deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to [[Kryptonian]]s (though slower in its effects on humans).  Angered, Slade went after Nightwing with a grenade, only to have Rose try to stop him.  Amid the smoke of the resulting explosion, Rose fled, telling her father that she hated him.  Dick disappeared as well, but not before leaving a note for Slade warning him that he'd be back to make him pay for BlÃ¼dhaven.

At the climactic Battle of Metropolis at the conclusion of ''Infinite Crisis'', Slade was confronted by Batman, Robin and Nightwing.  During the struggle he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the Secret Society.  His claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory, and he was told to take responsibility before being rendered unconscious.

===One Year Later===
[[Image:Titanseast.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Cover to ''Teen Titans'' #43: Titans East Part 1. Art by [[Tony Daniel]].]]
Slade appears in the ''Green Arrow'' series after the [[One Year Later|one year]] jump in DC Comics's storylines.  Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] businessmen who want to hire him for a murder.  Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target; when informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job.  

However, things don't quite go according to plan, with Green Arrow using the resources of both his identities, then trapping him within a ring of armed [[United States National Guard|National Guardsmen]].  The fight ends with Deathstroke's arrest and subsequent conviction and incarceration; however, this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to another jailed foe of Green Arrow's who has information on the hero's activities in the "lost year", which include Green Arrow studying under an assassin who once trained Deathstroke himself.

Deathstroke is also active behind the scenes in ''Teen Titans'', currently in the process of organizing a counter-team of teen superhumans that will be known as [[Titans East]]. The current Titans team includes Ravager, who now wants nothing to do with her father. Deathstroke intends to "reclaim" Ravager and a recently resurrected Jericho from the Titans or, if that fails, to crush them along with the rest of the team. For these reasons, he's specially choosing each member of Titans East. Deathstroke believes Titans East, overall, will successfully counteract every member of the current Teen Titans line-up.

As indicated over the course of recent issues, Deathstroke is manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another. He has blackmailed former Titan [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage, is drugging [[Cassandra Cain]] and supplying [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a formula which grants superhuman speed. His team however is slowly falling apart, as Robin managed to free Batgirl of his mind control serum, and Raven has managed to convince Duela Dent to switch sides.  Then Slade and his Titans faced off against both the current Titans and a group of old Titans led by Nightwing. Although he is defeated, he still manages to escape with the aid of Inertia. In the end, however, it is revealed to the readers that Slade's real mission to was provide his children with something he could never offer them - a real family, in the form of the Teen Titans, and by attacking the Titans, have Rose and Jericho become more trusted and grow closer to the team.

Shown in [[Justice League of America|Justice League of America #12]], Deathstroke has been blackmailing [[Geo-Force|Brion Markov]], the half-brother of the original [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], and ruler of Markovia, by way of claiming to have disrupted his powers. Using this leverage, Deathstroke hopes to gain information regarding the Justice League's current roster.

==Powers and abilities==
Deathstroke possesses various enhanced abilities. These include the strength of ten men, heightened speed, agility, stamina and reflexes. He has the capacity to use up to 90% of his brain making him a combat skills and tactical genius (written at a time when it was conjectured that humans only used 10% of their capacity), making him adept at turning opponents' own abilities against them, stemming from his years in the military and combat with various heroes. Deathstroke also possesses a regenerative factor in his blood that enables him to heal from physical injury much faster than a normal person. This has also made him effectively immortal, enabling him to recover from what would otherwise be fatal injuries, though recovering from what would be a fatal injury renders him insane and animalistic for a short period.

He is also a highly formidable opponent in physical combat to the point that even Batman can only fight him into a stalemate. ''Green Arrow'' #66 claims that an assassin known as [[Natas (comics)|Natas]] taught Deathstroke "almost everything he knows". There has been argument over how good of a martial artist Deathstroke is. While he has defeated multiple opponents in hand-to- hand combat and has even been acknowledged by Cassandra Cain as "toying with me, he is holding back", he is not considered one of the DCU's greatest martial artists. Despite his impressive record, Slade is not often listed due to his metahuman capabilities and artificial enhancements. Deathstroke is also skilled in the use of many weapons ranging from guns, rifles and swords, which are usually among his current weapons of choice. His signature weapon is a power staff that fires lethal and non-lethal energy blasts from both ends. The staff can also be used to strike using energy at each end. His bodyarmor is composed of a mesh-woven, kevlar, chainlink mail, capable of stopping small arms fire.

==Alternate Versions==

* In the [[intercompany crossover]] ''The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans'', Deathstroke meets his equal in the form of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who fought each other to a near stand-still.

* The [[Marvel Comics]] character Deadpool is similar to Deathstroke. Deadpool commonly uses the name "Wade Wilson", similar to "Slade Wilson". In ''Superman/Batman Annual'' #1 written by former Deadpool author [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], Deathstroke from the anti-matter universe appears and has similar characteristics related to [[Deadpool]] (such as Deadpool's "merc with a mouth" wisecracks, a black spot on his mask over his eye somewhat resembling Deadpool's, and some measure of a healing factor). This character tries to introduce his name multiple times but is always interrupted. The most he was able to get out was "Dea-". It could be implied Deadpool is the Marvel counterpart of Deathstroke, who was created 11 years earlier. Marvel seemingly acknowledged this in the ''Cable/Deadpool'' series, where Deadpool sometimes answers a letters column. Deadpool claimed that he didn't want to be in a Marvel/DC crossover, because people might mistake him for a certain DC character.

==In other media==
===Lois & Clark===
In the fourth season of "[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]", an assassin by the name of Deathstroke appeared in "Bob and Carol and Lois and Clark."  The only commonality is the fact that he is an international assassin known as Deathstroke. In "Lois and Clark,"  Deathstroke is a former scientist.  An accident in the lab exposed him to magnetic particles, permanently altering his body and granting him magnetic powers.  His assistant, who afterwards becomes his wife, helps by creating a special suit to contain his powers and keep metal from being drawn to him while out in public.  The suit even has a symbol of its own: resembling the force lines of a magnetic field, forming a stylized figure eight.  After this, he becomes an assassin, murdering his targets with his powers, first by drawing the target to him, then by magnetizing the iron in their blood cells, causing a figure-eight mark on the chest as the person dies of a heart attack.

The couple take the name Bob and Carol when the arrive to Metropolis, making friends with [[Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane]] as they discover that Lois is going to be interviewing an eccentric reclusive billionaire.  The couple plan to assassinate the billionaire before he goes public, taking his identity and thus his fortune.  The plan is foiled when [[Superman]] interferes, destroying Deathstroke's containment suit, which causes him to be magnetically drawn to a steel pillar until the police arrive. Very much like Superman, this Deathstroke kept a secret identity by wearing a pair of glasses.

===''Teen Titans The Animated Series''===
[[Image:Slade.png|left|frame|Top-left: Slade with the mark of [[Trigon (comics)|Skath]]. Top-right: Slade disguised as the '''Old One''' from [[Forces of Nature (Teen Titans)|Forces of Nature]]. Bottom: Slade's "normal" appearance.]]
Deathstroke appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, where he is referred to only by his first name, Slade, and voiced by actor [[Ron Perlman]].  The name "Deathstroke" did not make it through the censors due to hesitance to use the word "death" in a children's animated series.  Like his comic book counterpart, he has only one eye and an orange and black color scheme to his clothes.

Slade is the Titans' main adversary and was the primary antagonist for the first two seasons of the show. He is shown to be ambitious, calculating, and emotionless. His main goal is apparently to "destroy" the Titans and conquer the city, and quite possibly the world, for unknown reasons â although it is possible that he is simply a [[Crime|criminal]] with ambitions of power and has no ulterior motives.  He has at least one extremely advanced secret hideout, and a seemingly massive army of technologically advanced robot [[minions]]. In addition, he has superior physical strength, and fighting skills that surpass [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s. Slade is also a bona-fide [[genius]], with great knowledge in [[robotics]]. He seems to also possess some knowledge of ceremonial [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] (as seen in ''Forces of Nature''). But Slade's most notable quality, is that he is a master of manipulation. He is able to discover the worst quality or fear in his opponents or the people he plans to use. Then he picks at it, until it has become their "Achilles Heel", with which he will then exploit. 

In many episodes, he tries to recruit others to his side. He initially hires [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]], and [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] from the H.I.V.E. Academy, but the Titans succeed in beating the three [[Alumnus|graduates]]. Slade then disguises himself as Old One from The Forces of Nature and tries to trick [[Thunder and Lightning (comics)|Thunder and Lightning]], two teenage storm elementals, into destroying Jump City, but that too failed when [[Beast Boy]] helped the brothers to see the error of their ways. [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appears to capture Slade in "Masks", only to discover that it is a robotic duplicate. In the "Apprentice" story arc, Slade forced Robin to join him, with the threat that if he did not, Slade would use [[nanorobotics|nanobot]]s he planted in the Titans to destroy them from the inside out. Robin eventually overcame Slade with his friends' help. From that day on, Slade seems to have become more determined to have Robin and his comrades eradicated. Slade had tried to be Robin's mentor, a father-figure, but Robin shunned him saying he already had a father. This is one of the very few references to Batman in the series, as he looks up to the sky and bats fly by. In season two, Slade recruited the superpowered girl [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], who in the animated series is portrayed as a merely misguided enemy than a wholly irredeemable villain.  In "Betrayal", Terra betrayed the Titans to Slade. In "Aftershock" Parts One and Two, Terra seemingly destroyed the Titans at the command of Slade, who took over the city with her help.  The Titans returned, however, and with Beast Boy's help, Terra overcame the link her new suit had to Slade, and she sent him to his doom in a lava pit. 

As a result, Slade was absent for most of the third season, with the exception of "Haunted". In this episode, he is a figment of Robin's imagination, due to a reagent chemical released from his mask into Robin's body, which made him see, hear, and feel Slade. Robin was nearly killed, but Robin saved his own life by turning on the lights, thus banishing the Slade hallucination, which only worked in the dark. Oddly enough, it was revealed that this gas had been triggered from the outside, and the series was finished without answering the question of who set it off. Slade's appearance in later episodes may indicate that Slade set it off himself long before actually returning in person. 

Slade returned for season four, as the servant of [[Raven (comics)|Raven's]] demonic father [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]]. Now possessing [[pyrokinetic]] powers, the ability to fly, superhumanly durability, and a red mark on his forehead, called the Mark of Skath. He delivered Trigon's message to Raven on her birthday that she would cause the end of the world. In the episode "The End Part 2", it is explained that Slade's defeat at Terra's hands had indeed killed him, and that Trigon had promised to give him back his flesh and blood body in exchange for his services. However, Trigon went back on the deal, and Slade decided to join forces with the Teen Titans. While [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], and [[Beast Boy]] tried to distract Trigon, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and Slade went to find [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] in the underworld. Upon returning to the surface with Raven, Slade led the final assault on Trigon, having recovered his flesh and stolen the demonic weapon of one of Trigon's minions using it to slice off Trigon's horns. Raven finally defeated her father and restored the world to normal, but Slade escaped the Titans shortly thereafter, with a solemn promise from Robin that nothing has changed, and will make that clear if he ever sees him again. 

Slade makes a final appearance in the last episode of the series, "Things Change" when [[Beast Boy]] was searching for answers on why a newly revived [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] seemed to have lost all memory of her past or superpowers. Slade confronts Beast Boy, denying anything to do with Terra's sudden return, saying that if Terra didn't remember her past, it was because she didn't want to remember; that he should leave her alone, in peace. Infuriated by his speech, Beast Boy attacks Slade, only to find that it was just another of his many robot-duplicates.

===The Judas Contract===
Slade will appear in the upcoming straight-to-DVD Teen Titans adaptation, ''[[Teen Titans: The Judas Contract]]'', an adaptation of the Terra storyline from the comics. However due to the targeted [[PG-13]] rating and the subject matter, he will be called Deathstroke in the film. This is unrelated to the more youth-oriented anime-like Teen Titans.  It is currently unknown whether or not he will keep the sexual nature of his relationship to Terra for the film.

==Similarities to other comics characters==

A similarity between Deathstroke and the Marvel Comics mercenary [[Taskmaster]] was also noted in [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]] #177: "Both Tasky and Slade are amoral profiteers, and thanks to mutual designer George PÃ©rez, even their original costumes are similar."  They share an orange/blue colour scheme and many design elements (such as buccaneer boots, flared gloves, and a near-identical collection of weapon belts).  The largest differences were their masks, Taskmaster's cloak, and the white in Taskmaster's costume.  Both characters were designed by [[George PÃ©rez]] in 1980, within a few months of each other.
