'''Slaymaster''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] character from [[Marvel Comics]]'s ''[[Captain Britain]]'' series. His first appearance was in ''[[Captain Britain|Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain]]'' #243 (October 1977), a weekly [[Marvel UK]] title which featured a mix of reprint and original material.

He was created by Jim Lawrence, [[Larry Lieber]], and Ron Wilson but the character was later adapted by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Alan Davis]] in ''[[The Daredevils]]'' #3.

==Fictional character biography==
Slaymaster first encounters Captain Britain while carrying out an assassination, managing to defeat the Captain.<ref>''Super [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]]'', #243-247</ref> 

Later, Slaymaster has been hired by [[Vixen (Marvel Comics)|Vixen]] (a British villain and old enemy of Captain Britain) to kill all of the members of [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]]'s psi-division, including Captain Britain's sister, before her planned infiltration of the intelligences facility. Slaymaster manages to kill most of the psi-division, bar Tom Lennox and [[Psylocke|Betsy Braddock]] (Captain Britain's sister), keeping the division away long enough for Vixen to take control.

Still in the employ of Vixen, Slaymaster was to bring Captain Britain to her. Slaymaster manages to capture the Captain and in the course of the story steals his costume which is thought to be the source of Captain Britain's powers. Captain Britain is still able to control the suit and telekinetically rams Slaymster into a wall, knocking him out.<ref>''Captain Britain Monthly'' #1-3</ref>

In their final meeting, Betsy Braddock, Captain Britain's sister had assumed the mantle of Captain Britain while her brother was elsewhere. Her taking up the role was in fact a trap set by Vixen. <ref>''Captain Britain Monthly'', #13</ref>

Wearing a Vixen supplied version of Captain Britain's costume Slaymaster confronts Captain Britain and defeats Betsy Braddock by gouging out her eyes. Betsy manages a telepathic summons to her brother who flies to rescue her and confront Slaymaster. Slaymaster soon discovers that the costume that Captain Britain wears is, in fact, little more than a regulatory device- his powers are intact without it. In a fit of rage he defeats Slaymaster and kills him, crushing his head with a boulder.

==Powers and abilities==
*Slaymaster is a master hand-to-hand combatant and a world class assassin. 
*At various times he is depicted as having more than normal balance and reflexes. 
*His preferred weapons are specialized high tech needles that he wields to great effect. 
*He can shower assailants with a deadly barrage of these needles, and even managed to drop Captain Britain on occasion with them.

==Other versions==
*An alternate version of Slaymaster appears when the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] visit a world that has been almost completely taken over by [[HYDRA]], which is ruled by [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]].<ref>[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] #92-94</ref>
