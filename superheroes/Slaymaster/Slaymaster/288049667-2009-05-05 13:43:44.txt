'''Slaymaster''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] character from [[Marvel Comics]]'s ''[[Captain Britain]]'' series.

==Publication history==
The Slaymaster's first appearance was in ''[[Captain Britain|Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain]]'' #243 (October 1977), a weekly [[Marvel UK]] title which featured a mix of reprint and original material.

He was created by Jim Lawrence, [[Larry Lieber]], and Ron Wilson but the character was later adapted by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Alan Davis]] in ''[[The Daredevils]]'' #3.

==Fictional character biography==
Slaymaster first encounters Captain Britain while carrying out an assassination, managing to defeat the Captain.<ref>''Super [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]]'', #243-247</ref> 

Later, a more skillful and refined Slaymaster has been hired by [[Vixen (Marvel Comics)|Vixen]] (a British villain and old enemy of Captain Britain) to kill all of the members of [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]]'s psi-division, including Captain Britain's sister, before her planned infiltration of the intelligences facility. Slaymaster manages to kill most of the psi-division, bar Tom Lennox and [[Psylocke|Betsy Braddock]] (Captain Britain's sister and Lennox's lover), keeping the division away long enough for Vixen to take control. Captain Britain's intervention on behalf of his sister results in a rematch between himself and Slaymaster, a tightly run affair in which Slaymaster proves his intelligence, weapons and martial skill would be enough to defeat the more powerful Captain again. However, thanks to a distraction by Betsy, Captain Britain is able to overwhelm Slaymaster and beat him into unconsciousness.

Still in the employ of Vixen, Slaymaster was to bring Captain Britain to her. Slaymaster manages to capture the Captain and in the course of the story steals his costume which is thought to be the source of Captain Britain's powers. Captain Britain is still able to control the suit and telekinetically rams Slaymster into a wall, knocking him out.<ref>''Captain Britain Monthly'' #1-3</ref>

In their final meeting, Betsy Braddock, Captain Britain's sister had assumed the mantle of Captain Britain while her brother was elsewhere. Her taking up the role was in fact a trap set by Vixen. <ref>''Captain Britain Monthly'', #13</ref>

Wearing a Vixen supplied version of Captain Britain's costume Slaymaster confronts Captain Britain and defeats Betsy Braddock by gouging out her eyes. Betsy manages a telepathic summons to her brother who flies to rescue her and confront Slaymaster. Slaymaster soon discovers that the costume that Captain Britain wears is, in fact, little more than a regulatory device- his powers are intact without it. In a fit of rage he defeats Slaymaster and kills him, crushing his head with a boulder.

==Powers and abilities==
Slaymaster is a master hand-to-hand combatant and a world class assassin, on various occasions he is depicted as having more than normal balance and reflexes. His preferred weapons are specialized high tech needles with which he can shower a deadly barrage upon opponents.

==Other versions==
An alternate version of Slaymaster appears on a world visit by the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] that has been almost completely taken over by [[HYDRA]], which is ruled by [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]]<ref>[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] #92-94</ref>. This Slaymaster escape his reality along with Sue Storm and began hunting down Elizabeth Braddock's of alternate worlds killing them and taking their eyes much like his 616 counterpart did to Betsy Braddock.<ref>[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|New Exiles]] #7</ref>
