==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=March 2017}}
Harold Meachum first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15 and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]].

==Fictional character biography==
Harold Meachum was the business partner of [[Wendell Rand]], father of Daniel (who would later become [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]). When traveling with his business partner and his young family to uncover what would be a major discovery in business, they came across [[K'un-L'un]], a stronghold of a colony of humanoid aliens whose spaceship crashed in a pocket dimension that intersects with Earth.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #15</ref>

After having left Wendell Rand, Harold began to trek back to civilization and got lost in the Himalayas. Due to the dangerous weather even upon being found by a woman and some sherpas, Harold had to have his legs amputated. Upon being told about what happened to his legs, Harold had to remain at the hut until a cart can be afforded to carry him to the airport. During this time, Harold had heard a monk talking about the K'un-L'un and about a boy who was taken in by its inhabitants upon his parents ending up dead. Knowing that the boy is Danny, Harold knew that his training would excel and that he would come to take revenge on him when the portal to K'un-L'un opens in the next 10 years. Paranoid at this, he spent the next ten years setting up death traps and hiring assassins to stop Danny Rand. He also hired Triple-Iron to be his chief assassin who kept Harold in a chamber that he will emerge from when Danny Rand is killed. On the tenth year, Harold instated a $10,000 contract to whoever can bring the wearer of the Iron Fist dragon band to him dead or alive.<ref name="Marvel Premiere'' #18>''Marvel Premiere'' #18</ref>

When Iron Fist defeated a gang of four men wanting to take in on the bounty offered by Harold Meachum, he also defeated [[Scythe (comics)|Scythe]] who surrendered Harold's location.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #16</ref>

Iron Fist made his way to Meachum Industries where he fought his way past every death trap and had a fight with Triple-Iron.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #17</ref>

When Iron Fist confronted Harold Meachum upon defeating Triple-Iron, he took pity on Meachum's current state and spared his life. However, a ninja working for [[Master Khan]] ended up assassinating Meachum anyway after throwing a shuriken at the gun that Meachum was going to use on Iron Fist. His daughter [[Joy Meachum|Joy]] assumed Iron Fist had killed him and his brother [[Ward Meachum]] started planning his revenge on Iron Fist.<ref name="Marvel Premiere'' #18"/>
