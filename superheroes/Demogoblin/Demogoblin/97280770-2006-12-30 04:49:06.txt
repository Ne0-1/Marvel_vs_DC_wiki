'''Demogoblin''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared as Demogoblin in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #86, and had previously appeared as an unnamed demon in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147.

==Fictional character biography==

The Demogoblin was originally an unknown [[demon]] who inhabited Limbo and had been banished there eons ago for unknown reasons. He was fused with the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] (Jason Macendale) when the goblin asked N'astirh for more power in exchange for his soul. Hobgoblin quickly realized being possessed by a demon was less than beneficial and managed to expell his demon half, creating the Demogoblin, a darker, mystical version of the hobgoblin persona. 

Demogoblin believed himself to be on a holy mission, and killed only those he deemed sinners. However, his definition of sinner was extreme and excluded only children. He often tried to kill heroes and even holy men. He claimed that he was a member of a demonic group known as the 'Righteous,' demons who sought redemption for their sins by exterminating other demons and destroying evil wherever they found it.

Demogoblin's physical form was killed in a final showdown with Hobgoblin. In an ironic twist, he died trying to save children from collapsing debris, showing himself to be, in a way, more moral and heroic than Macendale, despite his murderous ways.

In a side story in the pages of Marc Spector: Moon Knight, Demogoblin was trying to possess the body of Moon Knight after a confrontation with the Hobgoblin. Spector having a very sinful past was seen as a suitable host. Moon knight was saved due to the intervention of Dr Strange and Mr Fantastic.

The Demogoblin was destroyed by the vampire-hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] while Blade was empowered by the [[Darkhold]], but those who had been killed by Blade were restored to life when the Darkhold's spell was reversed.

==Powers and abilities==
Demogoblin was endowed with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and resistance to injury. He had a magical ability to mentally control and levitate his glider and propel it at high speeds. He could project [[hellfire]] from his hands.  He could throw two types of "pumpkin bombs."  Orange pumpkin bombs were bombs that exploded conventionally (albeit magical) similar to those of the [[Green Goblin]] or Hobgoblin. Black pumpkin bombs caused their target to be overwhelmed by massive feelings of despair and helplessness. These powers were all derived from magic. Though of demonic origin, Demogoblin's corporeal form could be killed.

Apart from his physical and magical advantages, he was knowledgeable about military training and [[hand-to-hand combat]] absorbed from his time merged with the Hobgoblin. Although deranged, the Demogoblin was highly intelligent.
