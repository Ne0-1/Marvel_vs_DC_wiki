'''Demogoblin''' is a fictional character in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in as Demogoblin in Web of ''Spider-Man'' #86, but was attached to his host earlier in ''Specatular Spider-man'' #147.

==Character biography==

The Demogoblin was originally some unknown demon who inhabited Limbo and had been banished there eons ago for unknown reasons. This Demon was summoned by N'Astirh and attached to a human host as described by the events below.

After losing fights with [[Spider-Man]] and the second [[Green Goblin]], Jason Philip Macendale Jr., AKA the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], took advantage of the [[Inferno crisis]] by following several [[demon]]s back to their lair and confronting their demonic lord, [[N'Astirh]]. Macendale wanted enough power to defeat his enemies, and offered his [[soul]] to N'Astirh in exchange for such power. When N'Astirh stopped laughing, the demon lord decided that Macendale's effrontery was worth something even if his soul wasn't, and had him [[spiritual possession|possessed]]. This gave Macendale the physical strength he craved, coupled with superhuman speed and endurance; unfortunately, the demon who possessed him proved to be incompatible, and the two fought many a battle for control of Macendale's physical form until the demon literally ripped away from its human host and began a separate existence as the Demogoblin.

Although of demonic origin, Demogoblin was a religious fanatic who considered himself a servant of the Lord. He had no interest in personal wealth or position. He was determined to destroy all sinners and thus gain redemption for himself. Unfortunately most people have sinned at some point in their lives, and his definition of sinner was rather strict and exempted only children. He found himself in continual conflict with Spider-Man, [[Ghost Rider]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and even his former host, Macendale. His interest in purifying New York City caused him to join with Carnage and Co., although he deplored [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]'s lack of discipline. 

Demogoblin eventually forgave Macendale, which annoyed the Hobgoblin so much he decided to rid the world of his other half once and for all. The final battle took place in a church. When a pillar in the church started to give way and threaten a nearby child, Demogoblin held the pillar up long enough for the child to escape, but was crushed to death when his strength gave out. Ironically, a demon died a noble and heroic death.

==Powers and abilities==
Demogoblin was endowed with Superhuman strength; the upward limit of what he could lift was under 10 tons. His reflexes, agility, endurance, and stamina were all enhanced. He had a magical ability to mentally control and levitate his glider and propel it at speeds of up to 90 mph. He could project hellfire from his hands. These powers were all derived from magic.
Though of demonic origin, Demogoblin's corporeal form could be killed.

Apart from his physical and magical advantages, he possessed knowledge of military training in hand-to-hand combat absorbed from his time merged with Hobgoblin II. Though mentally deranged the Demogoblin was highly intelligent.
