'''Demogoblin''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared as Demogoblin in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #86 (March 1992), and had previously appeared as an unnamed demon in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147.

==Fictional character biography==
Demogoblin was originally an unnamed [[demon]] who inhabited [[Otherplace|Limbo]] and was banished there eons ago for unknown reasons. His essence was fused with the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] ([[Jason Macendale]]) when Jason asked [[N'astirh]] for more power in exchange for his soul.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref> As a part of Hobgoblin, he infected [[Moon Knight]] with a demonic virus that would slowly mutate him.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #33</ref> As part of Hobgoblin, he fought the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]], and was defeated by Blaze's hellfire gun and Ghost Rider's mystical chain.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #17</ref> Hobgoblin quickly realized being possessed by a demon was less than beneficial, and thanks to the effects of the hellfire and mystical chain, managed to expel his demon half, creating the Demogoblin, a darker, mystical version of the Hobgoblin persona.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #86-87</ref>

Demogoblin believes himself to be on a holy mission, and kills everyone whom he deemed a sinner. However, his definition of sinner is extreme and excludes only children. He often tries to kill heroes and even holy men. He claims that he is a member of a demonic group known as the 'Righteous,' demons who sought redemption for their sins as self-proclaimed servants of the Lord by exterminating other demons and destroying evil wherever they found it.

Once freed from the Hobgoblin, Demogoblin next fought and defeated [[Spider-Man]] and Macendale.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #25</ref> He then joined with the [[Doppelganger (comics)|Spider-Man doppelganger]] to kill the Hobgoblin, but was defeated by Spider-Man, [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]], Ghost Rider, and Blaze.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #93-96; ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #5</ref>

Demogoblin then confronts Moon Knight, trying to possess his body, which was ravaged by Demogoblin's bloodlink virus from the previous confrontation with the Hobgoblin. Moon Knight is saved due to the intervention of Dr. Strange and Mr. Fantastic.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #45-46</ref>

During the events of "[[Maximum Carnage]]", Demogoblin joined [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and the Spider-Man doppelganger on their killing spree throughout Manhattan. He battled Spider-Man, Venom, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Captain America]], [[Deathlok#Michael Collins|Deathlok]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], and [[Firestar]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378-380; ''Spider-Man'' #35-37; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101-103; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201-203</ref>

The Demogoblin is destroyed by the vampire-hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] while Blade was empowered by the [[Darkhold]],<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #40</ref> but those who had been killed by Blade were restored to life when the Darkhold's spell was reversed.

Demogoblin's physical form is killed in a final showdown with Hobgoblin. He dies trying to save children from collapsing debris. Post-mortem, the Demogoblin makes an appearance as a taunting hallucination of the heroic [[Green Goblin]], [[Phil Urich]] alongside hallucinations of the original Green Goblin and Hobgoblin.

==Powers and abilities==
Demogoblin is a demonic being, with numerous supernatural powers granted by magic. He is endowed with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and resistance to injury. He has a magical ability to mentally control and levitate his one-man miniature "[[goblin glider]]" composed of hellfire and propel it at high speeds. He can project [[hellfire]] from his hands.  

Demogoblin is able to mystically create "pumpkin bombs", similar to those of the Green Goblin or Hobgoblin. Orange pumpkin bombs are bombs that explode conventionally (albeit magical) as concussion and incendiary Jack O' Lanterns. Black pumpkin bombs cause their target to be overwhelmed by massive feelings of despair and helplessness. He also can create wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, and bat-shaped razor-edged throwing blades.

Apart from his physical and magical advantages, he is knowledgeable about military training and [[hand-to-hand combat]] absorbed from his time merged with the Hobgoblin. Although deranged, the Demogoblin is highly intelligent.

==In other media==
===Toys===
[[Hasbro]] released a Demogoblin figure for their Spider-Man: Origins toy line in 2007. This figure was a repaint of a previously released Hobgoblin figure.

===Video games===
Demogoblin is featured several times as a Boss character in the [[Sega Genesis]]/[[Super Nintendo]] game ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]''.
