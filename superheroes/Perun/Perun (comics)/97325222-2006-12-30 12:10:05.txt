'''Perun''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character based on the [[Perun|mythical deity]] in [[Slavic mythology]], with control over thunder and lightning similar to that of the [[List of Norse gods and goddesses|Norse god]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==Fictional character biography==

In the mainstream [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], Perun is the name of a fictional Russian superhero who was once a member of 'The People's Protectorate' alongside Fantasma, The [[Red Guardian]], Vostok and [[Dmitri Bukharin|Crimson Dynamo]]. 

He wore a helmet and red cloak similar to those of Thor. He had long hair and a beard, with a great deal of body hair. He uses a large [[hammer and sickle]], which he used to focus and direct his electrical powers.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Perun===

In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], Perun is a member of [[Liberators (comics)|The Liberators]], described simply as a "Soviet Thor." His Ultimate universe appearance is vastly different from his mainstream appearance - he is clean-shaven and has no visible head hair. His powers are seemingly derived from a force-belt similar to that of [[Ultimate Thor]]. Like his mainstream Marvel counterpart he carries a hammer and sickle. 

Alongside the other members of The Liberators, Perun attacked and rapidly subdued the forces of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the weakened Ultimates. He incapacitated Quicksilver with a lightning strike.

In ''Ultimates 2'' # 11, Perun and the Crimson Dynamo attacked [[Air Force One]] in which [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] was captured.

Curiously, Perun was absent in issue #12, where all his Liberator teammates were killed by their Ultimates counterparts.
