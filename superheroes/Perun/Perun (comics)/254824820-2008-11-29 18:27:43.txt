'''Perun''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character based on the [[Perun|mythical deity]] in [[Slavic mythology]], with control over thunder and lightning similar to that of the [[List of Norse gods and goddesses|Norse god]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==Publication history==
Perun first appeared in ''Captain America'' #352-353 (April-May 1989), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Kieron Dwyer]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Avengers'' #319-324 (July-October 1990), ''Incredible Hulk'' #393 (May 1992), ''Soviet Super-Soldiers'' #1 (November 1992), ''Quasar'' #54-55 (January-February 1994), ''Starblast'' #2-3 (February-March 1994), ''Quasar'' #56-57 (March-April 1994), and ''Starblast'' #4 (April 1994).

Perun appeared as part of the "Supreme Soviets" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #7, and in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update'' #2 (2007).

==Fictional character biography==
In the mainstream [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], Perun is the name of a fictional Russian superhero who was once a member of 'The People's Protectorate' alongside [[Fantasia (comics)|Fantasma]], The [[Red Guardian]], [[Sputnik (comics)|Vostok]] and [[Dmitri Bukharin|Crimson Dynamo]]. 

He wears a helmet and red cloak similar to those of Thor. He had long hair and a beard, with a great deal of body hair. He uses a large axe, and later a [[hammer and sickle]], which he uses to focus and direct his electrical powers. Perun is an avatar of the Slavic god [[Perun]] inhabiting the body of Valeri Sovloyev.

Perun and his team come into conflict with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] over the kidnapping of Igor, a Russian spy. The Hulk believes Igor to have been responsible for his, the Hulk's, creation. Ivan is put through a re-creation of the incident, which causes great distress. The Hulk easily defeats Perun and takes his weapons, using them to temporarily entrap Vostok. The confrontation ends in a stalemate, for Ivan had gone mad with guilt and nobody was sure what to do.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Perun===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], Perun is a member of [[Liberators (comics)|The Liberators]], described simply as a "Soviet Thor." His Ultimate universe appearance is vastly different from his mainstream appearance; he is clean-shaven and has no visible head hair. His powers are seemingly derived from a force-belt similar to that of [[Ultimate Thor]]. Like his mainstream Marvel counterpart he carries a hammer and sickle. 

Alongside the other members of The Liberators, Perun attacked and rapidly subdued the forces of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the weakened Ultimates. Strategic locales all across the United States are taken. The Liberators kill thousands of soldiers and citizens alike. Perun personally incapacitates Quicksilver with a lightning strike.

In ''Ultimates 2'' # 11, Perun and the Crimson Dynamo attack [[Air Force One]] capturing [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. The plane and the passengers are brought back to the White House in Washington D.C. This is where most of Perun's teammates are killed in battle. He is seen in issue #13, wandering the streets, trying to find someone to surrender to.
