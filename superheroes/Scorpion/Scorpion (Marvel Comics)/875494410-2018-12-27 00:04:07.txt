==Fictional character biography==

===Monster Scorpion===
The first Scorpion was seen as  a giant monster. During an experiment with a [[bismuth]] isotope, Paul Rodgers accidentally struck a normal scorpion with a stream of [[delta particle]]s. It was mutated into a giant monstrous form and gained the consciousness to hate the human race. It told Paul Rodgers and Edward Bentley that it would mutate another bunch of scorpions and take over the world. Edward managed to hypnotize the Scorpion that it was feeling the pains from the radiation poisoning. When the Scorpion begged for Paul and Edward to end its life, they complied and killed the Scorpion by firing another stream of delta particles at it.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #82</ref>

===Sam Scorpio===
'''Sam Scorpio''' is an inventor who used his "sting" (a derringer fitted to a silencer on his forearm) to terrorize the [[American frontier|Old West]]. Scorpion later encountered [[Kid Colt]] while running from a 50-man posse and begged for his help. Kid Colt refused until an earthquake occurred and they hid under a boulder. By the time Kid Colt and Scorpion emerged, the posse caught up to them and they were taken to prison. While in jail, Scorpion used his "sting" on a guard. Upon grabbing the guard's keys, Scorpion forced Kid Colt to accompany him. He took Kid Colt to a hideout in the hills and wanted Kid Colt to join him. When Kid Colt asked about the secret of his "sting," Scorpion turned on him. Kid Colt shot out the lamp for cover from Scorpion's sting and Scorpion fled where he told the posse where they can find Kid Colt. Afterwards, Scorpion set up a gang where he kept them in line with his "sting." Kid Colt went after Scorpion's gang upon figuring out what his gimmick was. Kid Colt defeated Scorpion's gang and defeated Scorpion in hand-to-hand combat before he could use his "sting." Kid Colt then turned Scorpion and his gang over to the authorities.<ref>''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #115</ref>

Scorpion was imprisoned in a State Prison where he was part of a chain gang with Dr. Danger and Bull Barton. When Kid Colt ended up in the same prison after turning himself over to the law. Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton decided that this was the opportunity for revenge. One day, they attacked Kid Colt in unison while on work detail. When a prison guard intervened, they took his gun, overpowered the guard, and broke their chains. Then they grazed Kid Colt with another bullet and fled. Across the border, Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton came across a town where Fred Yates (the man that Kid Colt turned himself over to) lived. When Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton confronted Fred Yates and his sister Susan, Fred fled in sheer terror. Kid Colt caught up to the trio, disarmed them, and saved Susan. Kid Colt then sent Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton back over the border to the waiting arms of the law.<ref>''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #118</ref>

===Mac Gargan===

Jonah Jameson]] to find out how Peter Parker was able to obtain the photos of [[Spider-Man]]. When Spider-Man evaded Gargan, J. Jonah Jameson decided to use Gargan as a test subject for an experiment done by [[Farley Stillwell]] which led to Gargan becoming the Scorpion in order to defeat Spider-Man.

===Jim Evans===
'''Jim Evans''' is a successful apothecary in Dustville during the Old West. He began to date Sarah (the prettiest girl in town) until she began to neglect him upon stating that she already has a boyfriend in Matt Cody. Matt Cody was not pleased that Sarah went out with Jim and challenged him to a shootout. Jim drew his gun first and only managed to wing Matt in the left arm as Matt managed to shoot Jim's gun out of his hand. Matt then made Jim dance with his gun. Jim was humiliated and vowed revenge. Upon inventing a liquid paralytic that he can fire no matter where he would hit them, Jim took on the identity of Scorpion and embarked on a crime spree. Scorpion managed to hold up a stagecoach and the sound of his gun attracted the attention of [[Rawhide Kid]]. Rawhide Kid managed to tackle Scorpion who hit Rawhide Kid with a paralytic pellet and continued to rob the stagecoach where he made off with the payroll. Upon questioning the nearby town about Scorpion, Rawhide Kid learned that there had been an apothecary who had been around for four months which allowed Rawhide Kid to determine his identity. Rawhide Kid followed Jim to an abandoned mine, watched him change into Scorpion, and then confronted him. Their fight collapsed the mine and Rawhide Kid fell into an underground stream. Rawhide Kid recovered and went after Scorpion again. When Scorpion fired the paralytic pellet again, Rawhide Kid twisted Scorpion's wrist causing Scorpion to get hit by his own paralytic pellet. Rawhide Kid then turned Scorpion over to Dustville's sheriff.<ref>''Rawhide Kid'' #57</ref>

After six months in jail, Jim Evans managed to mix up a small amount of his stun potion in the prison workshop. He used it on a guard, grabbed his keys, and escaped from jail.

Sting-Ray robbed a bunch of people at Bison Bend's square dance. Clay Riley and Sheriff Ben Brooks tried to stop him, but ended up victims of his stun pellets. Sting-Ray later kidnapped Sheriff Ben Brooks' daughter Natalie holding her hostage until he got the power he demanded. However, he was foiled by [[Phantom Rider]] who attacked Sting-Ray. Phantom Rider managed to defeat Sting-Ray and unmasked him after he was distracted by Natalie's shouting. The sheriff and his men arrived and chased after Phantom Rider.
