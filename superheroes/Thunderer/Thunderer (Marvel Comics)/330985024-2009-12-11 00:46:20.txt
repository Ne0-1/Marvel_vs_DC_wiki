==Other media==
The Thunderer also appeared in the 1990s [[Spider-Man]] cartoon:

During WWII, the Thunderer fought alongside a number of other heroes. When [[Captain America]] vanished near the end of the war, apparently disintegrated in the middle of a struggle with the [[Red Skull]] while standing on a weapon the villain had invented, the five other heroes vowed to see no one else would ever use the weapon. Each hero took one of the keys to the base and retired, scattering across the country to make the keys harder to gather. Eventually, they were forgotten by the general public. In the modern day, the [[Kingpin]] led a group of criminals in trying to gather the keys, and hunted down each of the "[[Six Forgotten Warriors]]". The Thunderer was the last one to be located. Ironically, he had stayed close to the base, determined to guard it while disguised as a [[hobo]]. The gathered heroes allied with Spider-Man to stop the device being activated, but when it was turned on, it reintegrated both the Red Skull and Captain America, albeit temporarily. Afterwards, the heroes returned to their retirement.

The Thunderer was voiced by [[Hansford Rowe]].
