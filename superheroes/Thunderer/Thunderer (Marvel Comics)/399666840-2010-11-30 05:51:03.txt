===Television===
* The Thunderer also appeared in the 5-part ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "[[Six Forgotten Warriors]] voiced by [[Hansford Rowe]]. In this version, the Thunderer's powers are the result of an attempt at recreating the process that empowered Captain America. During WWII, the Thunderer fought alongside a number of other heroes. When [[Captain America]] vanished near the end of the war, apparently disintegrated in the middle of a struggle with the [[Red Skull]] while standing on a weapon the villain had invented, the five other heroes vowed to see no one else would ever use the weapon. Each hero took one of the keys to the base and retired, scattering across the country to make the keys harder to gather. Eventually, they were forgotten by the general public. In the modern day, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] led the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] (consisting of [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]) in trying to gather the keys, and hunted down each of the "Six Forgotten Warriors". The Thunderer was the last one to be located. Ironically, he had stayed close to the base, determined to guard it while disguised as a homeless man. The gathered heroes allied with [[Spider-Man]] to stop the device being activated, but when it was turned on, it reintegrated both the Red Skull and Captain America, albeit temporarily. Captain America and his fellow warriors fought against the Red Skull's forces until Red Skull revealed his doomsday device which involved turning his son Rheinholdt Kragor into the show's version of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. After Captain America and Red Skull were knocked into the vortex and Electro was defeated, the heroes returned to their retirement.
