'''Virginia "Pepper" Potts''' is a [[fictional character|fictional ]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], debuting in 1960s [[comic book]]s as executive secretary to Tony Stark, a.k.a. [[Iron Man]], in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Pepper, originally in the secretarial pool, got her job by fixing an accounting mistake made by Stark himself. Pepper was originally infatuated with Tony and responded to the attentions of Stark's chauffeur and assistant [[Happy Hogan]] with caustic remarks. This, almost immediately after her first appearance, coupled with Stark's growing affection for her, put her in an immediate love triangle between Stark and Hogan. Pepper was for a time interested in Iron Man, unaware that he and Stark were the same person. However, she eventually fell in love with and married Hogan, eloping with him in Tales of Suspense #91, though that relationship wasn't without its troubles. 

Pepper and Happy eventually left Stark Industries settling in the Rocky Mountains and then finally in Cleveland where they adopted children after being unable to conceive and disappeared from the main Iron Man storyline. After being kidnapped by Stark's rival [[Obadiah Stane]] Pepper told Tony to stay out of their lives. At one point during their absence they divorced. After Tony Stark's return from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe Pepper and Happy joined Tony at his new company Stark Solutions and once again became core characters. After some time, Happy and Pepper once again became involved and remarried eventually considering starting a family to supplement their adopted children. At this point Tony and Pepper's relationship had a brief rekindling during trouble in Happy and Pepper's marriage. Pepper eventually did conceive only to lose the baby at the hands of Stark's former lover and enemy Ayisha.

After Happy sustained massive injuries in a fight with [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] during the [[Marvel Civil War]] story arc, Pepper requested that Tony turn off Happy's life support. The final pages of Invincible Iron Man vol. 4 #14 show the apparent death of Happy; it is debated as to whether Tony actually complied with Peppers request as the only link between Happy's heart failure and Tony is the fact that they are side by side in the panel.

Pepper recently joined the Initiative team of [[The Order (comics)|The Order]]. She took the role of Greek Goddess Hera.
