'''Virginia''' "'''Pepper'''" '''Potts''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[supporting character]] and a [[love interest]] of [[Iron Man]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].  She first appears in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #45 (September 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]]. 

In 2007, she joined the [[Fifty State Initiative]] under the codename '''Hera''', and after being given her own suit of armor by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], assumed the codename '''Rescue''' in ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #14.

She is portrayed by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] in the films [[Iron Man (film)|''Iron Man'']] and ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Pepper, originally in the secretarial pool, gets her job by fixing an accounting mistake made by Stark himself. Pepper is originally infatuated with Tony and responds to the attentions of Stark's chauffeur and assistant [[Happy Hogan]] with caustic remarks. This, almost immediately after her first appearance, coupled with Stark's growing affection for her, puts her in a love triangle between Stark and Hogan. Pepper is for a time interested in Iron Man, unaware that he and Stark are the same person. However, she eventually falls in love with and marries Hogan, eloping with him in ''Tales of Suspense'' #91, though that relationship is not without its troubles.

[[Image:Peppervirginiapotts.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Pepper and Happy.]]

Pepper and Happy eventually leave [[Stark Industries]] settling in the Rocky Mountains and then finally in Cleveland where they adopt children after being unable to conceive, and disappear from the main Iron Man storyline. After being kidnapped by Stark's rival [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], Pepper tells Tony to stay out of their lives. Pepper and Happy soon divorce after she had an affair with a former college boyfriend. After Tony Stark's return from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, Pepper and Happy join Tony at his new company [[Stark Industries#Stark Solutions|Stark Solutions]] and once again become core characters. After some time, Happy and Pepper once again became involved and remarry, eventually considering conceiving a child to supplement their adopted children. Stark entrusted Pepper with a special remote that could shut him down. However, Pepper was tortured and was forced to hand it over. The trauma caused her to miscarry. Iron Man was able to deal with the remote, but felt guilty that he had placed her in such danger.
After Happy sustains massive injuries in a fight with [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] story arc, Pepper requests that Tony turn off Happy's life support. The final pages of ''Invincible Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #14 shows the apparent death of Happy; it is debated as to whether Tony actually complied with Pepper's request as the only link between Happy's heart failure and Tony is the fact that they are side by side in the panel.

===The Order===
After the events of the superhuman Civil War, Pepper joined the [[Fifty State Initiative]] as a member of '[[The Order (comics)|The Order]]', a government sanctioned superhero team operating within [[California]]. She assumed the moniker of the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Hera]] and used advanced computer hardware and prosthetics to monitor and coordinate the team's missions. Upon the absorption of The Order into the Initiative, Tony Stark offers her a job on the special projects team at Stark Enterprises, which she accepts.

===The Invincible Iron Man===
[[image:Pepper Potts Rescue.JPG|thumb|right|Pepper Potts as '''Rescue'''.]]
Pepper Potts resumes her activities as personal secretary of Tony Stark, in a manner reminiscent of [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s portrayal in the ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' feature film, constantly hinting at some sexual tension between herself and Tony, though neither act on it beyond flirting. However, this abruptly comes to an end when [[Ezekiel Stane]], son of [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], causes an explosion during a party hosted by Stark in [[Taipei]], and Pepper, unable to flee, is trapped under debris and wounded by shrapnel. Suffering a [[concussion]], damage in almost every internal organ, some degree of [[hearing impairment|deafness]] in the right ear, and pieces of shrapnel embedded in her chest, she's far too weak to withstand a prolonged surgery, so Tony Stark embeds a strong magnet (similar in appearance to the ''arc reactor'' of the movie) in her chest, essentially turning Pepper Potts into a [[cyborg]] dependent on keeping her chest magnet engaged to stay alive like he was once.<ref name="invincible3">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #3 (September 2008)</ref>

Pepper survives the less invasive procedure, but, as it was for Tony, it's uncertain when, or if, the magnet can ever be removed. Later, Pepper's body is further enhanced with new cybernetics and upgrades to the magnet. At first Pepper is shattered: even though the bionics saved her life and gave her back her full mobility and her hearing, Pepper feels herself losing her humanity and becoming a weapon, until Tony is forced to admit that Pepper's bionics is not Starktech in origins: instead, it comes from [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]]'s design for a new battery, and is not weapons-based at all. Comforted by the humanitarian origins of her tech, Pepper embraces her cyberization, exploring her new magnetic powered abilities, like gliding over magnetic lines.<ref name="invincible4">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #4 (September 2008)</ref>

When Tony is blamed for the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is taken over by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], replaced with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and Tony and Maria Hill are fired, along with the rest of the S.H.I.E.L.D. employees. When Tony and Maria go underground, Tony makes Pepper the new [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Stark Industries, telling her that the company needs to be shut down, and that he only trusts her to do it in his place. She reluctantly accepts, kissing Tony once before she goes. Later, in a fit of frustration over everything that is happening, she inadvertently discovers a secret room in Tony’s office, which contains a suit of armor that he made especially for her. When Osborn issues an arrest warrant for Tony and sends teams to seize all Stark Industries facilities, Pepper uses this suit to escape just before she herself is arrested.<ref name="invincible10">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #10 (February 2009)</ref>

While Pepper practices using her new suit, instructed by an onboard [[artificial intelligence]] patterned after the persona of [[Edwin Jarvis]], a large earthquake hits, and she rescues a group of students just before their school collapses on them. This causes her to be detected by H.A.M.M.E.R., and Osborn orders a large commercial jet near her to be shot down, just to see what her suit is capable of. Pepper successfully catches the plane, but when she brings it to the nearest airport she is arrested by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. Pepper is later being interrogated by Osborn at a H.A.M.M.E.R. facility. Pepper insists that everything she has done and all the components of her armor are legal and that anyone has access to the design specs. Pepper also continues to insist that she doesn't know where Tony is. Osborn threatens her with incarceration of loved ones if she interferes with his search for Tony, attempts any more heroic actions, or flies above a certain limit. After being freed she takes off to find Tony herself, ignoring Osborn's warning.<ref name="invincible13">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #13 (May 2009)</ref>

Before beginning her search for Tony, Pepper meets with the doctor who implanted the magnet in her chest. He tells her it is functioning as expected and that her body has fully accepted and adjusted to the implant. Jarvis interrupts, saying there has been an accident and the victims are "calling for immediate rescue." This inspires Pepper to adopt the codename "Rescue," and after helping the victims, she heads to Russia, where she finds Tony. His mental condition has apparently deteriorated, as he does not recognize the suit he gave Pepper, and attacks her, believing she is an enemy sent by Osborn.<ref name="invincible14">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #14 (June 2009)</ref>

Tony eventually halted his attack. During his time with Pepper, they've begun a passionate affair with each other. However, the pair are captured by [[Madame Masque]], who was assigned by Norman Osborn to track down Tony. After Masque tortures them both, Tony admits that, though they have been fighting, he had loved Masque in the past.<ref name="invincible15">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #15 (July 2009)</ref> However, when pressed to make a choice, with his own life on the line, Tony chooses Pepper.  While the Rescue armor, controlled by the Jarvis A.I., restrains Masque, Pepper urges Tony to escape while she delays their attacker. As he flees to Afghanistan, Masque and Pepper go hand-to-hand with each other.<ref name="invincible16">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #16 (August 2009)</ref>

It initially appears that Masque kills Pepper in combat and recovers the Rescue armor, which is placed in storage with other Stark armors that Osborn has acquired.<ref name="invincible17">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #17 (September 2009)</ref> However, this Madame Masque is actually Pepper in disguise, having disposed of the real Masque by sealing her in the Crimson Dynamo armor. Potts reveals herself when she rescues [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Maria Hill]] from Avengers Tower, while the Rescue suit uploads a virus into the H.A.M.M.E.R. mainframe, taking control of the Helicarrier's armory of suits.<ref name="invincible18">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #18 (September 2009)</ref> They then retrieve the hard drive that Hill was assigned by Stark to get, escaping to give it to [[Bucky|Captain America]].<ref name="invincible19">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #19 (October 2009)</ref> Later, when a message from Tony (who had gone into a vegetative state) is transmitted by his armor revealing a way to reboot his brain, she is uncertain if he deserves the procedure. As part of bringing Tony back, the strong magnet in her chest is removed and placed into him. Fortunately, Pepper survives the removal of the device. 

As of Invincible Iron Man #27, Pepper demands the repulsor tech be re-installed. It is also suggested that a new, faster Rescue armor will be built by Tony Stark and Reed Richards, as the bleeding edge armor was.

==Powers and abilities==
The cybernetic technology implanted in Pepper’s chest caused a number of physical changes to her body: it fixed her eyesight (she needed glasses before), increased her metabolism, made her stronger, improved her reaction time and reflexes, and increased her IQ by about 25 points. The electromagnet has also been shown to give her some control over the magnetic fields around her, once allowing her to levitate briefly. She can also disintegrate bullets with it.

Pepper’s suit, the Mark 1616, appears similar to Iron Man's and can fly. It contains an AI version of [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]] to assist her and answer questions, and is ideally suited to her biology and cybernetic enhancements.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #11 (March 2009)</ref> However, in respect to Pepper’s wishes that she not become a weapon, the suit contains no weapons whatsoever, and is instead designed for “heavy rescue and recovery”. It contains repulsor technology, and electromagnetic field generators allowing her to suspend and tow massive loads and is powered by solar cells.<ref name="invincible12">''The Invincible Iron Man'' #12 (April 2009)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] Universe, [[DC Comics]]' [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and Marvel's Iron Man are combined to create [[Iron Lantern]].<ref>[http://www.io.com/%7Ewoodward/chroma/amalgam.html Who's Who Handbook of the Amalgam Universe]</ref> Iron Lantern is secretly Hal Stark, owner of Stark Aircraft, a developer of experimental aircraft. One of his test pilots is '''Pepper Ferris''' (an amalgamation of Pepper Potts and DC's [[Carol Ferris]]). Like both her DC and Marvel counterpart, she is involved in a love triangle, this time with Stark and his chief mechanic Happy Kalmaku (an amalgamation of Marvel's [[Happy Hogan]] and DC's [[Thomas Kalmaku]]). When Pepper comes in contact with a mysterious alien gem, she is transformed into Madame Sapphire (a combination of Marvel's [[Madame Masque]] and DC's [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]). Pepper Ferris first appeared in ''Iron Lantern'' #1 (April 1997), published jointly by Marvel and DC.  She was created by [[Kurt Busiek]] (script) and [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] (art).

===Heroes Reborn===
In the alternate universe of [[Heroes Reborn]], Pepper and Iron Man are lovers, although she can also be seen in a relationship with Happy Hogan. Stark is forced to leave her unexpectedly and without explanation, as his very presence in the universe will endanger her life and the lives of everyone else.

===Marvel Zombies Return===
Pepper appears in the [[Marvel Zombies]] universe in ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', having just passed in her resignation to Stark, who at this point is a near-useless drunk. However, when the zombie [[Henry Pym|Giant Man]] initiates an outbreak at Stark International, Pepper and Happy are among the zombified casualties. She is killed by Stark when he vomits a nanite-ridden formula on her, which was being developed as a potential cure for cancer. The formula destroys necrotic tissue, and  dissolves Pepper into a skeleton. <ref>"Marvel Zombies Return" #2 (2009)</ref>

===The Ultimates===
Virginia "Pepper" Potts can be seen in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] during ''[[Ultimates#The Ultimates 2|Ultimates 2]]''. She and [[Happy Hogan#Ultimate Marvel|Happy]] (with whom she appears to be in a relationship) can be seen monitoring Tony when he uses the armor. She can also fire missiles.
