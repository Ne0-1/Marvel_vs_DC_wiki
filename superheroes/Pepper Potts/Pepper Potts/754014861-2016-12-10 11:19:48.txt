==Publication history==
Virginia "Pepper" Potts first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #45 (September 1963), which was written by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[Don Heck]]. Though she was named Pepper Potts from the start, Stark addresses her as "Kitty" in one panel, which is thought to be a typo. Heck modeled Potts as [[Ann B. Davis]]’ character of Schultzy from ''[[The Bob Cummings Show]]'', and is rendered with brown hair done up in a hairdo similar to that of Schultzy's. Someone on the creative team or in editorial came to feel that the resemblance was too great, and in ''Tales of Suspense'' #50, Potts' look was altered to give her red hair and a different hairdo.

==Fictional character biography==
{{recentism|section|date=December 2012}}
Potts is originally a member of a secretarial pool, and gets her job by fixing an accounting error made by Stark. She is depicted initially as being infatuated with Stark, and rejects the advances of Stark's chauffeur and assistant [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], who debuted in the same issue, with acerbic remarks. As Stark's affection for her grows in the ensuing issues, she becomes part of a love triangle between the two men, and eventually falls in love with and marries Hogan, eloping with him in ''Tales of Suspense'' #91.<ref>Cronin, Brian (June 29, 2010). [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/29/foggy-ruins-of-time-2/ "Foggy Ruins of Time – Which Brady Bunch Actress Was Pepper Potts Based On?"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].</ref>

[[File:Peppervirginiapotts.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Pepper and Happy Hogan.]]
Pepper and Happy eventually leave [[Stark Industries]], settling in the Rocky Mountains and then finally in Cleveland, where they adopt children after being unable to conceive, and disappear from the main Iron Man storyline. After being kidnapped by Stark's rival [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], Pepper tells Tony to stay out of their lives. Pepper and Happy soon divorce after she has an affair with a former college boyfriend. After Tony Stark's return from the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe, Pepper and Happy join Tony at his new company, [[Stark Industries#Stark Solutions|Stark Solutions]], and once again become core characters. After some time, Happy and Pepper once again became involved and remarry, eventually considering conceiving a child to supplement their adopted children. Stark entrusts Pepper with a special remote that could shut him down. However, Pepper, tortured by the responsibility, is forced to return it, and the trauma causes her to miscarry. Stark is able to deal with the remote, but feels guilty that he has placed her in such danger.

After Happy sustains massive injuries in a fight with [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] during the 2006-2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Pepper requests that Tony turn off Happy's life support (using his [[Extremis (comics)|Extremis]] abilities). The final pages of ''Invincible Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #14 shows the death of Happy; it is implied Tony complied with Pepper's request.

===The Order===
After the events of the "Civil War" story line, Pepper joins the [[Fifty State Initiative]] as a member of [[The Order (comics)|The Order]], a government sanctioned superhero team operating within [[California]]. She assumes the moniker of the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] '''[[Hera]]''', and uses advanced computer-hardware and prosthetics to monitor and coordinate the team's missions. Upon the absorption of The Order into the Initiative, Tony Stark offers her a job on the special-projects team at Stark Enterprises, which she accepts.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===2008 - present===
[[File:Pepper Potts Rescue.JPG|thumb|right|Pepper as Rescue]]
Pepper Potts resumes her activities as personal secretary of Tony Stark. When Pepper is caught in a terrorist explosion caused by [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel "Zeke" Stane]], she sustains multiple internal injuries, including shrapnel wounds, and rendered unable to withstand a prolonged surgery. In response, Tony embeds a strong magnet (similar in appearance to the arc reactor of the movie) in her chest, essentially turning Pepper into a [[cyborg]] dependent on keeping her chest magnet engaged to stay alive, as he was once.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=The Five Nightmares Part 3: Pepper Potts At the End of the World|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=3|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=September 2008}}</ref>

Pepper's body is further enhanced with new cybernetics and upgrades to the magnet, which are based on [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]]'s battery designs, and which afford Pepper new super abilities.<ref name="IronManVol5#4">{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=The Five Nightmares Part 4: Neutron Bomb Heart|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=4|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2008}}</ref>

When Tony is blamed for the [[Skrull]] invasion of Earth that occurs in the 2008 storyline "[[Secret Invasion]]", [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is taken over by [[Norman Osborn]], replaced with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], and Stark and Maria Hill are fired, along with all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s employees. Tony realizes that Osborn is after the identities of superhumans that registered with the government following the passage of the Superhuman Registration Act that occurred during the "Civil War" storyline, which is stored in a database in his brain. Stark decides to go underground with Hill, and to wipe the knowledge in his own brain. Stark makes Pepper the new [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Stark Industries, trusting only her to shut down the company in his absence. Pepper discovers a secret room in Stark's office which contains a suit of armor that he made especially for her,<ref name="IronManVol5#10"/> which she uses under the name '''Rescue'''.<ref name="IronManVol5#14"/> Though Osborn has seized all Stark Industries facilities and equipment, Pepper states that all components of her armor are legal and that the design specifications are available to anyone. Despite Osborn threatening her loved ones with prison if she interferes with his search for Tony or attempts any more heroic actions, after being freed she endeavors to find Tony herself.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 7: The Shape of the World These Days|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=14|date=August 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> They are reunited in Russia,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 6: Some King of the World|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=14|date=July 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and consummate a now-sexual relationship, but are subsequently captured and tortured by [[Madame Masque]], who was assigned by Norman Osborn to track Stark down. Stark admits that he had loved Masque in the past,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 8: The Danger We're All In|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=15|date=September 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> but when pressed to make a choice, with his own life on the line, Tony chooses Pepper. Pepper decides to engage Masque in a physical altercation in order to provide a distraction for Stark to escape.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 9: Titan of the Nuclear Age|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=16|date=October 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

During the 2009 "World's Most Wanted Storyline" (which ran concurrently with Marvel's company-wide storyline "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]"), Pepper, after defeating Masque, disguises herself as the former, infiltrating H.A.M.M.E.R. while presenting the Rescue armor to Osborn as spoils of battle. Pepper reveals herself when she rescues [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Maria Hill]] from Osborn's imprisonment, while the Rescue suit uploads a virus into H.A.M.M.E.R.'s computers, taking control of the Helicarrier's armory of suits.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 11: Kids with Guns vs. The Eternal Angel of Death|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=18|date=November 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> They then retrieve the hard drive that Hill was assigned by Stark to get, escaping to give it to [[Bucky|Captain America]] in order to restore Starks' mind.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Conclusion: Into the White (Einstein on the Beach)|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=19|date=December 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> As part of "re-booting" Tony (in a vegetative state), the magnet in her chest is removed and placed into his.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Stark: Disassembled Part 2: Digging in the Dirt|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=21|date=February 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Though Stark's memories are restored from a somewhat years-old backup, he no longer remembers the events of the "Civil War" nor his role in it, its aftermath or his affair with Pepper. Pepper survives the removal of her chest magnet, but demands that a new one similar to Tony's own chest repulsor be re-installed, which is done. Recovered, Stark also gifts Pepper with a new Rescue armor, complete with JARVIS.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Stark Resilient Part 4: Grand Mal Tokyo Moron Party|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=28|date=September 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

During the 2011 "Stark Resilient" storyline, when [[Justine Hammer]] and her daughter [[Sasha Hammer]] use their own armored enforcer [[Detroit Steel]] to attempt to sabotage Stark Resilient (Tony's new company) and its design for a repulsor technology-powered vehicle, Pepper joins [[War Machine]] in helping Stark, during which Pepper experiences a [[near-death experience]] in which JARVIS, masquerading as Happy, gives Pepper a cryptic warning of the future.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Stark Resilient Part 8: Drones Scream Down|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=32|date=January 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

In the 2012 storyline "The Future", Pepper returns to her civilian life following her destruction of J.A.R.V.I.S., the [[artificial intelligence]] that helped her control her Rescue armor,<ref name=IronMan526/> after its compromise led it to go rogue and attempt to kidnap her.<ref name=IronMan523>{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salavdor|story=The Future Part 3: Swarm|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=523|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2012}}</ref> She became engaged to Marc Kumar, a public relations and marketing consultant, but broke off the relationship after he briefly became a supervillain.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

After Tony undergoes a [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|moral inversion]] following a confrontation with the psychic [[Red Skull]], Pepper attempts to oppose his efforts to release Extremis on a large scale<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #1</ref> with the aid of an A.I. back-up of Tony's mind he created eight years ago in the event of his mind being attacked in such a manner.<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #7</ref> Although the A.I. concludes that Tony's mind is irreversibly twisted, and is subsequently destroyed by Tony, Pepper states that she bought one of the largest media companies from under him which she will use to destroy his reputation by broadcasting his plans to the rest of the world. She then proclaims that any attempts he makes to create his 'perfect world' will have to be carried out with people fully aware that he is now nothing but a monster.<ref name="Superior Iron Man #9">''Superior Iron Man'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Stark-tech mag-field generator implanted in Pepper’s chest was not weapons-based like Stark's, but borrowed non-weaponized electromagnetic technology from Rand Industries, which caused a number of physical changes to her body. It cured her [[tinnitus]], improving her hearing. It allows her to sense electromagnetic fields, and manipulate them to levitate her body.<ref name="IronManVol5#4"/>

Potts' Stark-tech armor suit,<ref name="IronManVol5#10"/> which is designated Mark 1616,<ref name=IronMan11>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 4: Breach|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=11|date=May 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> but named '''Rescue''' by Potts,<ref name="IronManVol5#14"/> represents a hybrid of repulsor technology and portable electromagnetic super-field generators that give the suit flight, speed, strength, and magnetic-field manipulation.

==Other versions==
* In the [[Amalgam Comics]] Universe, [[DC Comics]]' [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and Marvel's Iron Man are combined to create [[Iron Lantern]].<ref>[http://www.io.com/%7Ewoodward/chroma/amalgam.html Who's Who Handbook of the Amalgam Universe]</ref> Iron Lantern is secretly Hal Stark, owner of Stark Aircraft, a developer of experimental aircraft. One of his test pilots is '''Pepper Ferris''' (an amalgamation of Pepper Potts and DC's [[Carol Ferris]]). Like both her DC and Marvel counterparts, she is involved in a love triangle, this time with Stark and his chief mechanic Happy Kalmaku (an amalgamation of Marvel's [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] and DC's [[Thomas Kalmaku]]). When Pepper comes in contact with a mysterious alien gem, she is transformed into Madame Sapphire (a combination of Marvel's [[Madame Masque]] and DC's [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]). Pepper Ferris first appeared in ''Iron Lantern'' #1 (April 1997), published jointly by Marvel and DC.  
* In the alternate universe of the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" storyline, she and Iron Man are lovers, although she can also be seen in a relationship with Happy Hogan. Stark is forced to leave her unexpectedly and without explanation, as his very presence in the universe will endanger her life and the lives of everyone else.{{issue|date=July 2012}}
* She appears in the [[Marvel Zombies]] universe in ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', having just submitted her resignation to Stark, who at this point is a near-useless drunk. However, when the zombie [[Henry Pym|Giant Man]] initiates an outbreak at Stark International, Pepper and Happy are among the zombified casualties. She is killed by Stark when he vomits a nanite-ridden formula upon her, which dissolves Pepper into a skeleton.<ref>"Marvel Zombies Return" #2 (2009)</ref>

At the close of the story, Ginny buries the two next to a gravestone with the name '''Virginia Potts Stark'''. Howard is also said to be 41 years old, suggesting that he will be born within the following year.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=[[Kano (comics)|Kano]]|story=The New Iron Age|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=500|date=March 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

** In ''Iron Man'', Stark notes that Potts, his [[secretary]]/personal aide, is virtually the only real friend he has at the company.    
** In ''Iron Man 2'', Pepper is promoted to CEO of Stark Industries. She later attempts to resign after Tony finds a cure for the [[palladium]] poisoning that was killing him but he does not accept it.<ref>[http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/07/this-weeks-cover-iron-man-2.html "This week's cover: 'Iron Man 2' with exclusive photos!"] ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. July 16, 2009</ref>  At the end of the film, Pepper becomes Tony's girlfriend and partner.
** In ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', Potts is instrumental in helping with the development of [[Stark Tower]], the new upgraded arc reactor, and Tony's assistance to S.H.I.E.L.D. She apparently got along with [[Phil Coulson|Agent Coulson]], even knowing his first name.
** In ''Iron Man 3'', Pepper is still the CEO of Stark Industries; the only difference is that she has moved in with Tony. During an attack on Stark's mansion, Tony wills his Mark 42 armor to encase her instead of himself thus saving her and [[Maya Hansen]] who Potts rescues using the armor. After being captured, [[Aldrich Killian]] uses her as a test subject for the [[Extremis (comics)|Extremis]] process and thus as leverage to force Tony to complete the work to make Extremis stable. However, she turns the tables on Killian by using her Extremis powers and parts of an Iron Man suit to kill him. Tony is able to modify Extremis so that it is no longer a danger to herself or others.
** Pepper Potts does not appear in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', but is mentioned along with [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] during a conversation involving [[Maria Hill]] (asking why they're not in the party), [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Pepper is mentioned to still be the CEO of Stark Industries, by Tony saying "She runs the biggest tech conglomerate on Earth", which helps around the world. Any doubts about her romance with Tony are put to rest at the end of the film, after he mentions wanting to settle down in a peaceful, quiet place with her (having been inspired by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Barton]]'s family life).
** Pepper is mentioned again in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). It is revealed that she and Tony are "taking a break." Pepper even cancelled an appearance at a university event that Tony Stark was speaking at. Tony later explains that the strain of being Iron Man finally took its toll on their relationship. The Sokovia Accords would be a blessing, since it's strongly implied Pepper would consider Tony more responsible if he were acting in less of a vigilante role.
* Pepper Potts appears in ''[[Iron Man: Rise of Technovore]]'' voiced by [[Hiroe Oka]] in the Japanese version and by [[Kate Higgins]] in the English dub.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the film, she's taking vacation time on an island mansion Tony gave her as a gift for a past blunder.
