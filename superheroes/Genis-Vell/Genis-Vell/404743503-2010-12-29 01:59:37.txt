'''Genis-Vell''', also known as '''Legacy''', '''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]''', and '''[[Photon (comics)|Photon]]''', is a [[fiction]]al [[superhero]] (and sometime [[antihero]]) in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is depicted as the son of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]] of the extraterrestrial [[Kree]] Empire, who was the first character to be known as [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] in the Marvel Universe. Genis-Vell would become the third to carry the name.

==Publication history==
Genis-Vell first appeared in ''[[Silver Surfer]] Annual'' #6 (1993) using the codename of "Legacy". He appears in the various Marvel titles in 1994 and 1995, primarily [[Silver Surfer]] and the ''Cosmic Powers'' miniseries. A six month guest appearance in the former culminated with the launch of his own series, ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 2).

Legacy was featured in ''Captain Marvel'' by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist [[Ed Benes]] with an initial publication date of December 1995. The series was abruptly canceled after only six issues; the unpublished issues #7-12 were later summarised by Nicieza in a fill-in issue (#14) of the next ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 3) series in 2000.

Legacy appeared in ''Avengers Unplugged'' #5 (June 1996) wherein he meets [[Monica Rambeau]], who at that time was the bearer of the "Captain Marvel" title. Monica cedes the title to Genis and adopts the codename "Photon" instead. After a single appearance in ''Silver Surfer'' later that year Genis-Vell wouldn't appear for another two years, when he was included in a new [[Warlock (comics)|Warlock]] title for four issues. An appearance in the [[Avengers Forever]] 12 issue limited series led to a new partner with his father's former companion, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and the second ''Captain Marvel'' series featuring Genis-Vell starting in the fall of 1999. The numbering would last for 35 issues, until October 2002.

In 2002 Marvel launched the [[U-Decide]] campaign in an attempt to bolster sales on several comics. Although critically popular, sales for ''Captain Marvel'' were flagging. U-Decide was initiated as a contest between ''Captain Marvel'', ''[[Marville (comics)|Marville]]'' (written by [[Bill Jemas]]), and ''[[Ultimate Adventures]]'' (written by Ron Zimmerman), in which the comic that sold the most copies would remain while the others would be discontinued. In order to compete against the other two series, Captain Marvel was renumbered to issue number one, and [[Peter David]], its head writer, took the book in a new direction. The ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 4) series won by a decidedly strong margin, and ''Marville'' and ''Ultimate Adventures'' ended after seven and six issues, respectively.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

Eventually the ''Captain Marvel'' ongoing series was canceled with issue #25 in 2004 due to low sales. [[Peter David]] was given the chance to wrap up the plot in a single  issue. He brought back the pastiche of the Endless, and joked that Rick Jones could sense the impending end of the series via his "comics" awareness. Genis-Vell appeared sporadically until the character was killed off in [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] #100 (May 2006).

At the 2009 New York Comic Con - as part of the War of Kings panel - it was announced that people interested in Genis-Vell should check out Guardians of the Galaxy #11.<ref>[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/951/951877p1.html NYCC 09: Marvel's War of Kings Panel]</ref> This was, however, nothing more than an image of Mar-Vell and Genis-Vell and not the actual person.

==Fictional character biography==
===Birth and early life===
[[Image:Ssa6.jpg|''Silver Surfer Annual'' #6.<br>Cover art by [[Ron Lim]].|right|180px|thumb]]
After the death of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]] (Captain Marvel), his lover [[Elysius]] decides to have a son. As one of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] living on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], she uses the advanced technology of her race to impregnate herself with some of Mar-Vell's genetic material. Elysius seeks to protect her new son, Genis-Vell, from Mar-Vell's powerful enemies by taking him to a distant planet. There, she artificially ages him and implants false memories in his brain, making him believe that he had a natural childhood and that he is the son of [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]].

===Avengers Forever (the Destiny War)===
When the Destiny Force resurfaces in Rick Jones for a second time (the first time occurring during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]), it triggers a time-spanning conflict known as the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]]. A motley crew of Avengers are gathered. Among them is a future version of Genis, now known as Captain Marvel. At the climax of the Destiny War and with Rick Jones' life in jeopardy, Genis recreates the Nega-Band connection with Rick in order to save him. After the war, Rick returns to the current day and the Genis of the present finds himself unwillingly bonded with Jones, a process which triggers his latent [[Cosmic Awareness]].

===Bonded===
Rick and Genis spend a considerable time adventuring together, in an arrangement somewhat reminiscent of the one that existed between Genis' father, [[Mar-Vell]], and Rick years before. During their time together, Mar-Vell and Rick exchanged places with each other between the regular universe and the [[Negative Zone]] and could hear each other's thoughts unaided. 

Genis-Vell and Rick, however, alternate between the [[Microverse]] and the regular [[Marvel Universe]] and can not only hear each other's thoughts unaided but can also see each other in reflective surfaces or as red ghostly visions.

Whereas Mar-Vell and Rick formed a strong friendship during their time together, Genis-Vell and Rick have a much harder time getting along. Genis' alien (and immature) perspective make him unfathomable to Rick's jaded-sidekick sensibilities. Their ability to see and hear what the other is experiencing lead to awkward situations with Rick's wife, [[Marlo Chandler]], and Genis' many amorous partners. Eventually, however, they become good friends.

===Insanity===
Genis, now known as '''Captain Marvel''', suddenly acts in an unpredictable and volatile fashion. The cause of Genis-Vell's irrationality is his inability to deal with the potentially infinite information generated by his [[omniscience|Cosmic Awareness]]. Furthermore, foreseeing the potential outcome of any action shows Genis that all of the good he does results in just as much, or more, evil. 

Genis goes on a self-destructive spiral, joining the Kree space navy, and eventually destroying the universe at the behest of Entropy and Epiphany. Captain Marvel also helps the two recreate the universe with a [[Last Thursdayism]] effect on the new universe's population, although with several alterations. The Captain Marvel of the new universe becomes the hero that Genis-Vell had always wanted to be. This Genis-Vell had never gone on the insane binge that resulted in the universe's destruction. 

In the new universe, Genis' mother Elysius still lives. In fact, Genis' recreation of himself is such a success that Elysius genetically engineers another offspring with the DNA of herself and Mar-Vell: a daughter named [[Phyla-Vell]]. An ironic twist to this redemption results when the original Genis, seemingly cured of his insanity by Epiphany, reenters the timestream: the original self "overwrites" the healthy, recreated self of the new reality. Reversing the incident which had caused him to snap, Genis finds the "new" future ''still'' embroiled in a galaxy-wide war.  He promptly breaks down in insane laughter, transforming his red and blue costume into the Kree uniform once more in the process.

[[Image:CaptainMarvel15.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Genis in the uniform of the [[Kree|Kree Navy]]. Art by [[Neal Adams]].]]
Delirious with power, Genis orders Rick's death while giving the Kree, the [[Shi'ar]], and the [[Skrull]] coalition aligned against him three days before he kills them all. In response, they call in a delegation of Titans - including the mother he still thinks dead.

Confused and enraged by the discrepancies of the new reality, he raises Rick from the dead, and leaves for Titan with Elysius and [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]] in pursuit. Elysius warns Titan of their impending arrival, and tells Phyla that the Captain Marvel title will now belong to her. When Genis arrives, he finds that all the other Titans are unreachable and out of phase with reality. Their elusiveness angers Marv further. 

As Genis begins doubting his own perceptions of reality, Phyla makes her presence known, and he becomes further disoriented. The two fight, and Genis eventually gains the upper hand. Before he can hurt her too severely, Elysius and Eros intervene. In response, Captain Marvel opens a portal which sucks in Phyla, Eros, and Elysius. As Phyla is sucked in, she forms an energy lasso and pulls Captain Marvel into the portal with them. 

Now in a realm of different physical laws, the more experienced Eros, Elysius, Phyla, and Rick Jones overcome the less experienced mind of Captain Marvel, leaving him a crying heap. He then changes to a white and navy version of the costume which was first seen in the series ''[[Avengers Forever]]''.  Although he swears to do good throughout the universe, a hallucination of Epiphany tells him that he is still insane.

===Odyssey===
Genis sets up an office for his superhero activities on [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]]. Phyla arrives to mock his efforts, but they are interrupted by an alternate version of Marlo, who attacks Rick. During the battle, the alternate Marlo deteriorates into nothing.

Captain Marvel travels through time to resolve the conflict with the future Marlo. Phyla takes the [[Earth-616]] Marlo to Titan for protection, where they witness the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] attacking and badly injuring [[Moondragon]]. Via a time portal, Captain Marvel reenters the present day. However, he is in great anguish from being forced to swear to kill his son in the cradle as soon as he is born. Phyla tries to get him to confide in her, but he refuses.

One issue after Odyssey concluded, the series ended. Moondragon told Rick that her and Marlo's attraction to each other was a "spill-over" from psychic tampering by Magus (although this was apparently a lie on Moondragon's part, to make the others happy). Marlo got back together with Rick, and Phyla-Vell showed up hooked up with Moondragon. Al showed up and revealed he was really "Eulogy," one of the "Seven Friendless" (including Eternity, Entropy, Epiphany, Empathy, Enmity, and Expediency). As he oversaw the wrap-up of the set, props, and costumes, Expediency separated Genis-Vell from Rick Jones. Genis waited, all alone, on an empty set, for someone to call who needed his help. No one did, so he gave up, and left the set. Then the phone rang.

===Photon and the New Thunderbolts===
[[Image:Thunderbolts100.png|thumb|180px|right|Genis (upper right) battling [[Baron Zemo]]. Cover to ''Thunderbolts'' #100. Art by [[Tom Grummett]].]]
Genis travels to Earth and joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. During this time, he develops an interest in [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]].<ref>alluding to their relationship as depicted in "[[Avengers Forever]]" and the ''Captain Marvel'' series by [[Peter David]]</ref> The manipulations of the [[Purple Man]] cause [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] to attack Genis in a rage, apparently killing him and throwing his body into the [[Hudson River]]. Though Genis would have recovered on his own, former Thunderbolt [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] uses a pair of alien [[Moonstone (comics)|moonstones]] to form a cocoon of energy, feeding him energy from the beginning and end of the universe to speed his recovery. When he emerges, he has absorbed the Nega-Bands into his body. 

Genis' subsequent adoption of the name "Photon" causes him to quarrel with [[Monica Rambeau]], who had also called herself "Photon" and "Captain Marvel." In the end, Genis is allowed to use the name "Photon" and Monica decides to use the codename "Pulsar". 

However, Zemo realises that his mistake of siphoning energy from the beginning and end of time created a link between Genis and the universe that threatens to end existence. Zemo explores all future timelines with the moonstones, but fails to find a way to save both Genis and the universe: In every possible future timeline, Genis destroys the universe. Genis is aware of this, but keeps trying to tune his cosmic awareness in order to find a way to prevent this from happening. Finally, in a fight with Zemo, Genis is defeated. Zemo traps Genis in a moment in time. He then uses a combination of Blackout's Darkforce powers and the moonstones to separate Genis into individual pieces, trapping them in separate, far-off parts of the Darkforce Dimension so that they cannot be reunited.

== Powers and abilities ==
Due to his [[Eternals (comics)|Titanian Eternal]] mother, Genis is far more powerful than his father, although he still needs the Nega-Bands to make full use of his abilities.

Initially, he only uses the Nega-Bands for flight, energy blasts, and transportation to and from the [[Negative Zone]]. After bonding with Rick, his latent [[Omniscience|Cosmic Awareness]], inherited from his father, is activated. His link to another dimension is redirected from the Negative Zone to the [[Microverse]].

Originally, he can focus his cosmic awareness, allowing him to realize exactly what he needs to know at a particular time. When his powers grow, however, he is driven mad by the vast scope of his awareness. While insane, he returns from the dead, raises Rick Jones from the dead, controls other dead bodies, creates [[hologram]]s, empowers an alien serial killer, and survives a combined assault from multiple alien spacefleets.

After Zemo accidentally links him to other areas of time, Genis absorbs the Nega-Bands and develops teleportation powers that could transport him through both time and space.

Photon's fellow Thunderbolt, [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Dr. Chen Lu]], the Radioactive Man, theorises that Genis could control the photons of which everything is composed, implying large scale [[reality warper|reality altering]] powers.
