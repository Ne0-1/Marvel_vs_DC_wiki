'''Genis-Vell''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==Character biography==
===Origin===
Genis-Vell is the son of the previous Kree [[Captain_Marvel_(Marvel_Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Mar-Vell]].  His father died of cancer before he was born.  His mother, Elysius, decided to age him artificially, apparently in an effort to make him capable of better defending himself of potential revenge from Mar-Vell enemies.

He was first seen as a young adult in a [[Silver Surfer]] annual, using the codename '''Legacy'''.  At the time he was somewhat psychologically immature.

===Genis as Captain Marvel===
Some time later the character was given his own mini-series, where he met the Monica Rambeau Captain Marvel, who eventually granted him the use of that alias.  Monica decided to adopt the codename ''Photon'' instead.

===Effects of the Kree-Skrull War===
Years before, perennial sidekick [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] had been bonded with Genis' father Mar-Vell, the first heroic Captain Marvel.  In an attempt to free Mar-Vell from the [[Negative Zone]] where he was trapped, Rick wore a pair of Nega-Bands in his wrists and struck them together.  Somehow that caused an exchange between dimensions, bringing Mar-Vell back to the regular universe and putting Rick in the Negative Zone is his place.  

At all times, Rick and Mar-Vell could telepatically "talk" with each other, even across dimensions (apparently due to the nega-bands).  They also shared some level of awareness of each other's perceptions.  After a few hours they would automatically switch places again, although they could use their nega-bands to switch again immediatelly if they wanted to.

This arrangement persisted by a long time.  Naturally enough, that made Rick Jones increasingly aware of the involvement of Mar-Vell with the activities of his people, the alien Kree, and their longtime enemies, the Skrulls.  He was therefore present when Skrull agents captured Mar-Vell as part of a skirmish with the Kree in Earth's solar system.  From Earth's perspective, that is the event known as the first [[Kree-Skrull War]].  Its climax happened when the Kree [[Supreme Intelligence]] awoke in Rick Jones the impressive powers that would later come to be known as the [[Destiny Force]].  With them, Rick managed to end the hostilities in Earth's solar system nearly single-handed, although it took a lot out of him and put his life in risk.

===Avengers Forever (the Destiny War)===
The Destiny powers resurfaced for a second time much more recently, and Rick Jones and Genis, now Captain Marvel, became pawns in a time-spanning conflict known as the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]].  At the climax of the Destiny War, Captain Marvel found himself unwillingly merged with Jones, a process which triggered his latent Cosmic Awareness. 

===Bonded===
Rick and Genis spent a considerable time adventuring together, in an arrangement somewhat reminescent of the one that existed between Genis' father and Rick years before.  While Mar-Vell and Rick exchanged places with each other between the regular universe and the Negative Zone and could hear each other's thoughts unaided, Genis-Vell and Rick alternated between the [[Microverse]] and the regular [[Marvel Universe]] and could also see each other in reflective surfaces.

===Insanity===
When Captain Marvel was manipulated by the cosmic entities known as Entropy and Epiphany and helped them recreate the universe, the universe was remade with several differences. When the universe was recreated, so was everybody in it, including Captain Marvel himself. The Captain Marvel of this universe was the hero that the true Captain Marvel had always wanted to be, and his creation was such a success, that his mother, Elysius, created another genetically engineered offspring, Phyla.

As the insane Captain Marvel was headed for Titan, with Elysius and Eros on his trail, Elysius sent a message to Phyla telling her that her brother was coming and to be ready to fight him when he arrived on Titan. Phyla assured her mother that she could handle her brother. Elysius told Phyla that her brother had betrayed his responsibilities as Captain Marvel, and the title now belonged to Phyla. 

Phyla watched when Genis arrived on Titan and saw that all the other Titans were out of phase, and existed a few seconds in the past or future. Captain Marvel reasoned that the Titans were afraid to face him. As Captain Marvel began to doubt his own perceptions of reality, Phyla made her presence known to her brother, who became incredibly confused at her existence, remembering her, but feeling as if he shouldn't. Phyla began to bicker with her older brother, flaunting the fact that their mother had given her the title of Captain Marvel, and filling her brother's head with doubt. Captain Marvel then attacked Phyla, and the two began to fight. Phyla hit Captain Marvel with a couple of energy blasts. However, he seemed more annoyed by them than anything else. Phyla claimed to her older brother that he was the first draft and a fluke, the one that made all the mistakes. Phyla claimed that she was the one which their mother got right. Captain Marvel then continued fighting Phyla and eventually gained the upper hand. However, before Captain Marvel could badly injure his sister, several Titans, including Elysius and Eros, intervened. In response, Captain Marvel opened a portal and Phyla, Eros, and Elysius were sucked into it. But at the last second, Phyla formed an energy lasso and pulled Captain Marvel into the portal with them. 

Now in a realm that had different physical laws and was truly not of this universe, the minds of Eros and Elysius were able to overcome the less experienced mind of Captain Marvel and expel his insanity. Phyla was there as well and helped defeat Captain Marvel as well, even though she did not contribute as much to Captain Marvel's defeat as Eros and Elysius.

===Odyssey===
Phyla met with Rick Jones, who was molecularly bonded to Captain Marvel, in an office that Captain Marvel had set up for himself so that if anybody needed help they could call him. Phyla explained to Rick Jones and Captain Marvel that nobody was going to come to them for help because now the universe was terrified of Captain Marvel for the atrocities that he committed while he was insane. She also suggested that Captain Marvel cede the title to her, which Captain Marvel was not willing to do. Before the conversation could continue, they were interrupted by the arrival of an alternate super powered version of Marlo Jones, whom attacked Rick. Phyla attacked this alternate Marlo, and kicked her in the face, but was then promptly punched into orbit. Later on, while Captain Marvel was fighting the alternate Marlo, Phyla returned and fired an energy blast at her, but by that time, the alternate Marlo had deteriorated into nothing. 

While Captain Marvel traveled to the future to resolve the conflict with the future Marlo, he sent Phyla to the apartment of the Marlo Jones of Earth-616 and Moondragon to make sure they were safe in the present as well. Phyla introduced herself and explained why she was there in very little detail. 

Phyla inquired to Moondragon as to whether or not her and Marlo were "together." Moondragon responded that it was none of Phyla's business. Meanwhile, Marlo was attacked by the Magus in the bathroom and was being pulled through a portal in the mirror when Phyla burst in and shattered the mirror with an energy blast, saving Marlo. Phyla insisted that Marlo accompany her to Titan where she would be able to protect Marlo far better and more efficiently with Titanian science at her disposal. Marlo hesitantly agreed and left with Phyla for Titan. 

Phyla led Marlo into the main monitor room of their base on Titan, explaining what had happened with the alternate Marlo along the way, causing a great deal of shock and some mild fear in Marlo of Earth-616, as well as bickering with Marlo a bit. Phyla explained that from the monitor room, they would know if the Magus approached. Phyla used the technology of the monitor room to discover that the Magus was on Earth. She then observed the Magus attacking and badly injuring Moondragon through a view screen. Phyla tried to hold back Marlo, who was thrown into a fit of rage upon seeing Magus injure Moondragon. 

As Captain Marvel reentered the present day through a time portal, Phyla and Marlo assumed it would be the Magus coming through the portal, and Phyla prepared to fight and held the still enraged Marlo back. When Captain Marvel entered through the portal, Phyla noticed he was in great pain, and tried to get him to confide in her what was weighing so heavily on his mind. He refused to tell her. 

===Separation===
After Moondragon lied about her affection for Marlo to make it easier for Marlo to leave her for Rick Jones, Phyla confronted Moondragon and told her that she could tell that Moondragon was making that up. She also told Moondragon she found that very attractive. She then invited Moondragon to go and see the spiral nebula near Renault VII with her. However, before anything more could happen, a portal opened which the curious Phyla and Moondragon wandered through. Unbeknownst to them the portal had been opened by Eulogy, who was striking the set of the universe of Captain Marvel.

===Photon and the Thunderbolts===
Recently, Genis came to Earth and joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Genis's interest in Songbird and the manipulations of the Purple Man caused Atlas (Erik Josten) to attack him. Genis was able to recover, displaying a remarkedly different appearance. Although his Nega Bands seem to be gone, he seems to possess the same if not more power before. 

Genis's use of the 'Photon' name caused him to quarrel with Monica Rambeau, who has also called herself Photon and 'Captain Marvel'. In the end, Genis was allowed to use the Photon name and Monica agreed on a new codename, Pulsar.
