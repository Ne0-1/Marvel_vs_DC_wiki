'''Invisible Kid''' is the name used by two [[fictional character]]s in the future of the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], both of whom were members of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] with the [[superhuman]] ability to become [[invisibility|invisible]].

The first Invisible Kid was Lyle Norg, an early member of the Legion who gained his powers from a chemical serum he invented.  He was killed by the monster called [[Validus]].  He first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #267, and was a permenent member of the Legion Espionage Squad. His aptitude at science meant he got on well with [[Brainiac 5]]. 

The second Invisible Kid was Jacques Foccart, a native of Earth who duplicated the original Kid's powers to save Earth from [[Computo]].  He first appeared in ''Legion of Super-Heroes Annual'' #1. He later served as President of Earth. His younger sister Danielle was also a Legionnaire, with the ability to comunicate with computers. With deliberate irony, she adopted the name "Computo".

Following the [[Zero Hour]] Legion Reboot, Lyle Norg is still alive and serving with the Legion. Jaques Foccart is a schoolfriend of his, who was forced by a rival student to drink Norg's serum, which had been calibrated only for Norg's physiology, as a test to see if it was safe for her. Although he was believed killed, he was saved by EarthGov's Intelligence Division. The serum grants him the ability to render him undetectable by any means, though this ability causes him severe pain to use. He currently works for EarthGov's Intelligence Division.
