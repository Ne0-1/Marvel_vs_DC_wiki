'''Invisible Kid''' is the name used by two [[fictional character]]s in the future of the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], both of whom were members of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] with the [[superhuman]] ability to become [[invisibility|invisible]].

==Lyle Norg ==
The first Invisible Kid was Lyle Norg, an early member of the Legion who gained his powers from a chemical serum he invented. He first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #267. His scientific aptitude meant he got along well with the super-intelligent [[Brainiac 5]]. His abilities made him a valuable asset to the Legion Espionage Squad, of which he was a permanent member. Norg also served one term as Legion Leader.  He was killed by the monster [[Validus]] of the [[Fatal Five]] in ''Superboy and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #203 (July/August 1974).

===Reboot===
Following the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] Legion reboot, Lyle Norg was still alive and serving with the Legion. As well as a brilliant chemist, he was also a professional spy at a very young age. He invented the invisibility serum while in Earthgov Intelligence's spy school. Rather than his scientific aptitude resulting in his getting on well with Brainiac 5, they had more of a rivalry going on. While Querl was more intelligent, Lyle had more imagination, being quicker to see unexpected applications for discoveries. 

The 2005 Legion reboot began with Lyle joining the team. In this version he is exceedingly nervous and prone to making bad decisions under pressure. His father is a senior officer in the Science Police, something he attempted to conceal from the Legion.

==Jacques Foccart ==
The second Invisible Kid was Jacques Foccart, a native of Earth who drank Lyle Norg's serum and gained the original Kid's powers in order to save Earth from [[Computo]], who had taken over the mind of his sister.  He first appeared in ''Legion of Super-Heroes Annual'' #1 (1982). He later served as President of Earth. His younger sister Danielle was also a Legionnaire, with the ability to communicate with computers. With deliberate irony, she adopted the name "Computo".

===Reboot===
Following the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] Legion reboot, Jaques Foccart, a schoolfriend of Lyle's, was forced by a rival student to drink Norg's serum, which had been calibrated only for Norg's physiology, as a test to see if it was safe for her. Although Foccart was believed killed by the serum, he was saved by the Intelligence Division. The serum worked differently for him than for Norg, granting him the ability to become undetectable by any means, though this ability causes him severe pain to use. He continued to work for EarthGov's Intelligence.

==Other appearances==
Invisible Kid appeared in the [[Amalgam Comics]] title [[Amalgam_Comics#Spider-Boy_Team-Up|Spider-Boy Team-Up]].  He was merged with [[Fantastic Four]] member [[Invisible Woman]] to form the character also named Invisible Girl.  She was a member of the [[Legion of Galactic Guardians 2099]].
