'''Lyle Norg''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th and 31st centuries.  He was the first to assume the name '''Invisible Kid'''.

==Lyle Norg ==
The first Invisible Kid was Lyle Norg, an early member of the Legion who gained his powers from a chemical serum he invented. He first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #267. His scientific aptitude meant he got along well with the super-intelligent [[Brainiac 5]]. His abilities made him a valuable asset to the Legion Espionage Squad, of which he was a permanent member. Norg also served one term as Legion Leader.  He was killed by the monster [[Validus]] of the [[Fatal Five]] in ''Superboy and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #203 (July/August 1974).

Some years after the "five-year gap" and shortly before the destruction of Earth, a story-line was begun with the mysterious discovery of batch SW6 by the alien Dominators.  SW6 was a group of twenty of the Legionnaires in their teens, as if they had been put into suspended animation.  The SW6 group included several members of the Legion who had previously died, including Norg, among others.  Their interactions with the adult Legion created a complex storyline that eventually resulted in the spin-off series 'Legionnaires.'  The adult and young [[Brainiac 5]] collaborated and determined the adult Legion must be clones of the younger one, and the young Legion must be the 'true' [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  It was eventually revealed that the [[Time Trapper]] had manipulated time to create and preserve the young Legion.  As the events of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] coalesced, the young Norg and other Legionnaires who had no living counterparts vanished.

===Reboot===

Following the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] Legion reboot, Lyle Norg was still alive and serving with the Legion. As well as a brilliant chemist, he was also a professional spy at a very young age. He invented the invisibility serum while in Earthgov Intelligence's spy school. Rather than his scientific aptitude resulting in his getting on well with Brainiac 5, they had more of a rivalry going on. While Querl was more intelligent, Lyle had more imagination, being quicker to see unexpected applications for discoveries.

According to ''The Definitive Guide to The Characters of the DC Universe'' (2004), he was in a homosexual relationship with [[Chemical King|Condo Arlik]].

===Current Continuity (2005-  )===
Lyle Norg is a genius with a skill for xenochemistry who was used by his father to develop an invisibility serum. His [[Science Police]] officer father used to bring him alien cell samples nearly every night to experiment with. By the time he had successfully created a serum, he discovered that his father promised to hand over Lyle’s research to the Science Police all along. So he injected the only existing serum into himself and lied about it before contacting [[Brainiac 5]] for help. Brainy invited Lyle to join the Legion. Eventually his father discovered the truth and tried to get Lyle to quit and hand over the serum. After the Legion was outlawed, Lyle reneged and produced a blood sample for his father to use. The sample was encoded with a monitoring virus allowing Legion access to the United Planets systemworks. Because of his relationship to Brainiac 5 his teammates have snarkily nicknamed him “Brainiac 6.”

When Lyle betrayed [[Cosmic Boy]]'s trust by revealing to Brainic 5 that several members had broken into Brainy's lab, he lied to the team by blaming everything on [[Shrinking Violet]]. He and Violet, who prefers the moniker Atom Girl, have since made a deal to continue the ruse, but his teammates still have a hard time trusting him.  When [[Supergirl]] mysteriously appeared in the 31st Century, Lyle, along with half the male Legionairres vied for her attention.  However, Lyle convinced Cosmic Boy that he did not have a crush on Supergirl in order to remove the competition for her affections. He recently had is arm torn off when his flight ring exploded. He is currently in Metropolis, the doctors reproducing his DNA to give him another arm.

==Jacques Foccart ==
{{main|Invisible Kid (Jacques Foccart)}}
The second Invisible Kid was Jacques Foccart, a native of Earth from what was once the [[African French|francophone African]] nation of [[Côte d'Ivoire]].  Following [[Brainiac 5]]'s advice, Jacques drank Lyle Norg's serum and gained the original Kid's powers (and later developed the ability to teleport) in order to save Earth from [[Computo (comics)|Computo]], who had taken over the mind of his sister.  He first appeared in ''Legion of Super-Heroes Annual'' #1 (1982). He later served as President of Earth, and as co-leader of the Legion along with an adult [[Cosmic Boy]]. His younger sister Danielle joined the SW6 Legionnaires, having acquired the ability to communicate with computers.  With deliberate irony, she adopted the name '''Computo'''.
