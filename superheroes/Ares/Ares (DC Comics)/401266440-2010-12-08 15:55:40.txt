'''Ares''' is a fictional character appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media.  Based upon the [[Ares|Greek mythological figure of the same name]], he is the God of War and the major adversary of [[Wonder Woman]].   He first appeared in ''Wonder Woman'' #1, volume 1, published in the summer of 1942, written by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]].  In the very next issue,<ref name="Wonder Woman vol. 1 #2">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #2</ref> he reappeared under his Roman name, Mars.  He would retain this name until February 1987,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> when comics writer/artist [[George Pérez]] restored the Greek name Ares as part of his reboot of the Wonder Woman mythos.  As the narrative continuity of the Wonder Woman comic has been adjusted by different writers throughout the years, various versions of Mars/Ares, with various personalities and physical appearances, have been presented.  His current incarnation has, in recent years, appeared in one of two guises - either as a muscular blond man in contemporary clothing, with red eyes and a scarred torso; or as a demonic Greek warrior clad in black and blue battle armor, face hidden by a hoplite helmet. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
During most of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]], [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], and [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]], Ares was called Mars and was one of the most recurrent enemies of Wonder Woman. He was depicted as a Greco-Roman warrior in orange armor. Unlike the contemporary version of the character, his face was visible.  

Ares, who eventually became known as Mars, sought to realize his vision of eternal war and conflict in the world of man. He was chiefly opposed by [[Aphrodite]], goddess of love, who sought to realize a contrary vision of loving civilization.  Meanwhile the men who worshipped Ares killed each other. When Ares taunted Aphrodite with the success of his plans, Aphrodites molded from clay and breathed life into a new race of women, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], who built a city-state called Amazonia in which they created a [[Matriarchy|women-centered civilization]] for spreading the gospel of Aphrodite's Way. They were stronger then Are's men. Hippolyte was granted a golden girdle which made her invincible.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #1</ref>
[[Image:Ww1-ares-mars.jpg|150px|thumb|left|When she arrives in Man's World and leaves [[Steve Trevor]] in a hospital, [[Wonder Woman]] accidentally drops a manuscript depicting Ares, Aphrodite, and the history of the Amazons. From ''Wonder Woman'' #1]]
Enraged at the success of the Amazon nation, Ares, now known chiefly as Mars, called upon [[Hercules]] to steal the golden girdle and enslave the Amazons.  He was defeated by Hippolyta, but tricked her and stole the girdle. Aphrodite answered the prayers of the contrite Amazons and allowed them to break free, then sent them to a new hidden home they would call [[Themyscira|Paradise Island]].

During a period when the Amazons of [[Earth-One]] sent a champion, named Artemis, into Man's World as a champion for justice and peace, Mars manipulated circumstances so that Artemis would slowly drift from a path of trust and love, ultimately setting her up to appear to have betrayed the hidden location of the Amazons' interim hidden home called Themiscyra. 

Mars eventually created a home base on the planet of [[Mars]], with its superpowerful population enslaved to serve him and his chief deputies, the [[Duke of Deception]], [[Lord Conquest]], and the [[Earl of Greed]].  He used Mars as an interplanetary headquarters, supplementing the enslaved Martian population with the spirits of the dead he collected from war zones on multiple planets, including Saturn and Earth.  Slave spirits became embodied after being ferried to the planet Mars, where they were subjected to strength tests to determine how they would best be used, whether as gladiators in slave games, personal slaves in the retinue of Mars himself, or employees in the War Factories, one of which included the Lie Factory run by the Duke of Deception.  The very strongest would be trained and given new bodies to be sent to wage future wars on earth.  He also set up the Injustice Court for humiliating slaves and meting out punishments.<ref name="Wonder Woman vol. 1 #2" />

From this base, he sought to defeat the Allied cause in World War II, but he found himself repeatedly thwarted by the Amazon champion [[Wonder Woman]].

Mars repeatedly tangled with Wonder Woman on [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-One]] and [[Earth-Two]].  During a period when Diana abandoned her powers to live among the world of men as the Amazons retreated temporarily to another dimension, Mars (calling himself Ares this time) and his children Phobos, Deimos, and Eris battled the Amazons to secure from Hippolyta the secret to domination of all dimensions of existence.  Later, he enlisted his descendant Helen Alexandros to become the [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]].

His final scheme before the history-changing battle of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] was to ally himself with Hades and the [[Anti-Monitor]] to subdue the Gods of Olympus.  As [[Wonder Woman]] engaged him in final battle, [[Steve Trevor]] freed the gods and Hades' wife Kore appealed to her husband with a message of love, leaving Mars isolated.

===Post-''Crisis''===
[[Image:AresBuchanan.JPG|150px|thumb|right|Ari Buchanan transformed into Ares Buchanan]]

Despite being [[Zeus]]' son, Ares never fit in with the other gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and created his own realm, the [[Areopagus]]. [[Aphrodite]], the patron of the Amazons, swore that her women would save the world with love from the hatred and warfare of Ares, meaning he opposed their creation. Recently, through his deceit and manipulations, Ares deposed [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]] and became ruler of the underworld.

Ares did his best to destroy the Amazons, using [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] against them, who sacked the island, but [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] was born and raised just in time to fight Ares as [[Steve Trevor]]'s plane, driven by one of Ares's human puppets, crashed into Paradise Island. His plot was to fire the missiles between the [[United States]] and [[Russia]] at the same time, provoking [[World War III]], but Diana managed to make him see, trapped in her magic lasso, how this chaos would lead to his own disappearing, with Ares having no one to worship him. He then tasks her with "saving mankind from themselves", promising to return if she fails, essentially acting as a continuous test of her success.

Although Ares abandoned his plans that time, he managed to possess an unimportant criminal, Ari Buchanan. Possessing his body, he changed his name to Ares Buchanan.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #78-84</ref> He began climbing the business ladder by providing hi-tech weapons for [[gang]] [[feud|war]]s. As Buchanan, he had a relationship with his lawyer Donna Milton (who was [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] in disguise, although not even she knew it then), conceiving a daughter named [[Lyta Milton]]. Lyta has been shown to possess a great amount of magic, which she is still practicing. However, Ares didn't care much about Donna, shooting her while she was pregnant. Circe, as Donna, later tried to help Diana out of a trap he laid. She used the last of her forces to shoot a gun, which produced a sort of mini-black hole and absorbed Ares into it. She, Diana, and the child survived. 

As opposed to ancient times, the role of various gods were shown to have altered somewhat according to modern practices and beliefs. Because of this, the actual faith-based power Ares' father [[Zeus]] received proved to be very much diminished. On the other hand, other gods such as [[Athena]], [[Aphrodite]], and Ares began to gain more power due to the appearance of the computer age, love never diminishing, and conflict remaining consistent. Thus the three godly siblings eventually took over Olympus as the godly home's new masters. 

Realizing that conflict proved to maintain his strength over the output of war, Ares changed his title to the ''God of Conflict''. To celebrate this change he altered his appearance to a more approachable visage. His rule under this name proved to be short-lived though as the god [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]] was also overthrown and Ares was all too eager to take up the mantle of ''God of the Dead''.

====Family reunited====
Realizing that a crossroads for the gods of Olympus was at hand, Ares confided in his half sister [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie Sandsmark]] about a future war. In exchange for additional powers, the only wish he requested in return from his sister was her love. He then traveled to [[Themyscira]] and kidnapped his daughter Lyta who was under the protection of the [[Amazons (comics)|Amazons]]. Discovering this fact, [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] confronted Ares and was surprised to learn of his new godly title. She agreed to remain as his consort and to raise their daughter Lyta in the Underworld.

During Ares' family bonding with Cassie, he blessed her with a powerful lasso able to expel Zeus's lightning in times of anger for her to use in her persona as [[Wonder Girl]]. Ares has since appeared to Cassie repeatedly in order to warn her about "[[Infinite Crisis|the coming war]]." In one story the [[Teen Titans]] were thrown ten years into the future, where Cassie had inherited the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana's death.<ref>''[[Teen Titans]]'' (v3) #17–19</ref> She was also referred to as "Ares' champion."

Ares later appeared to Cassie informing her that the gods were leaving this plane and Zeus was taking the power he had granted Cassie as well.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #33</ref> In exchange for acknowledging their siblinghood and becoming his champion, he offered her some of his power, saying only that she would be "more powerful than [she's] ever been." The full extent of Cassie's powers has not been revealed, though there is some indication that she has retained all of her former powers at this point.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #6 and ''Teen Titans'' #34</ref>

During the events of ''[[Amazons Attack!]]'' it is discovered that Ares left Circe and kidnapped their daughter to raise on his own. As he and Lyta were only spoken of during the storyline, their presence is yet unknown.

Cassie is confronted by Ares' son, '''Lord Lycus''', whom Ares has sent to interfere with Cassie's powers.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #63</ref>

====Death====
[[Image:AresDeath.jpg|thumb|left|Ares death scene.]]Shifting himself into the future, Ares stole the dead body of Wonder Woman and brought it back into the present. He then manipulated several villains to use the body to create his bride and chief agent [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]]. He then imbued this new creature with his own magical dominance, causing the new being's persona to be more deadly but also completely obedient to him. Ares' plans to destroy the present day Wonder Woman went awry when Diana was able to destroy Genocide, leaving the monster's dead body to drown in the ocean. Angered, Ares commanded a son of [[Poseidon]] to cause a swarm of deadly sea creatures to attack Themyscira and the new island nation of [[Thalarion]]. During this battle Diana deduced that Ares was the grand manipulator and confronted him. Not allowing Ares much time to gloat in his latest masterpiece of war, Diana took a battle axe and used it to strike Ares' head, splitting his helmet in two. The then dead Ares falls to the floor uttering in his last breath, "Amazon what have you done?"

===After Death===

Ares has since appeared to Diana, now sans helmet, his head crudely stitched together, to reveal he has gone to some level of the afterlife reserved for the gods, where he is being tortured by all those who have died in all the world's wars. 

Despite being gone from the mortal world he reveals he is still manipulating events to lead to the end of the Amazons. This new plot involves the birth of five male children via five random Amazons. Once they are born he takes them under his wing before Ares is banished from Themyscira both in body and spirit by his father Zeus.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #39</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As do all the [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian gods]], Ares possesses tremendous strength, though he is now perhaps the physically strongest of them, except perhaps for Heracles{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Moreover, he is a master of conflict and strategy, and has complete command over any weapon. Pertaining to his being a war god, violence and bloodshed make him stronger. His armor is virtually indestructible and his weapons are greater than mortal ones. He can regenerate his physical being into any form he wishes and can [[teleport]] himself and others, as well as alter reality to whatever he desires. He is now also recognized as the [[death deity|Death god]] of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek Pantheon]] and thus has control over the dead. 

Being a god, he is also [[immortality|immortal]] and cannot be harmed by mortal weapons, only magical ones.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:aresanimated.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ares in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
Ares made an appearance in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Hawk and Dove", voiced by [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]. In the episode, Ares commissions [[Hephaestus]] to forge the [[wikia:DCAnimated:Annihilator|Annihilator]], a living suit of armor fueled by violence. He uses it to incite conflict between North and South [[Kasnia]], hoping to destabilize the entire region and create more conflict. [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Hawk and Dove]] intervene, forcing Ares to back down after discovering the Annihilator's weakness. The suit is confiscated by the Justice League. He appeared by the name of Tom Sera in the episode (Sera spelled backwards is Ares).

===Film===
Ares was featured in the [[direct-to-video]] [[animated]] movie, ''[[Wonder Woman (film)|Wonder Woman]]'' as the main antagonist of the film. He is voiced by actor [[Alfred Molina]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0806/26/index.htm Comics Continuum cast list]</ref> He differed slightly in this incarnation in that he had long platinum hair, although he wears a variation of his classic armor early in the film.

===Toys===
[[DC Direct]] released an Ares action figure in 2001 as part of their ''Amazons and Adversaries'' line of Wonder Woman action figures. [[Mattel]] released an Ares action figure in 2008 as part of their [[DC Universe Classics]] line of toys.
