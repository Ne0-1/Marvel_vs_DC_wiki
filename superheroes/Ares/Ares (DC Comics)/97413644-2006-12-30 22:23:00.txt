'''Ares''' is a [[DC Comics]] character based on the [[Ares|Greek god of the same name]]. He is most often depicted as an antagonist of [[Wonder Woman]], though recently has appeared to be assisting [[Cassandra Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]]. His first appearance was in ''Wonder Woman'' (v2) #1. His modern incarnation was first created in the [[DC Universe]] by [[George Pérez]] though, as Mars (his Roman name), he had plagued Wonder Woman for decades. 

==Fictional character biography==
Despite being [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]]'s son, Ares never fit in with the other gods of [[Olympus]] and created his own realm, the [[Areopagus]]. [[Aphrodite]], the patron of the Amazons, swore that her women would save the world with love from the hatred and warfare of Ares. Recently, through his deceit and manipulations, Ares deposed [[Hades]] and became ruler of the underworld.

===World War III===
Ares did his best to destroy the Amazons, using [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] against them, but [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] was born and raised just in time to fight Ares as [[Steve Trevor]]'s plane, driven by one of Ares's human puppets, crashed into Paradise Island. His plot was to fire the missiles between the [[United States]] and [[Russia]] at the same time, provoking [[World War III]], but Diana managed to make him see, trapped in her magic lasso, how this chaos would lead to his own disappearing, with Ares having no one to worship him.

===Buchanan and Circe===

Although Ares abandoned his plans that time, he managed to possess an unimportant criminal, Ari Buchanan. Possessing his body, he changed his name to Ares Buchanan. He began climbing the business ladder of hi-tech weapons for [[gang war]]s. As Buchanan, he had a relationship with his lawyer Donna Milton (who was [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] in disguise, although not even she knew by then), conceiving a daughter named Lyta. Lyta has been shown to possess a great amount of magic, which she is still in practice of using.

However, Ares didn't care much about Donna, shooting her while she was pregnant. Circe, as Donna, later tried to help Diana out of a trap he laid. She used the last of her forces to shoot a gun, which produced a sort of mini-black hole and absorbed Ares into it. She, Diana, and the child survived.

===New godly order===
As opposed to ancient times, the role of various gods were shown to have altered somewhat according to modern practices and beliefs. Because of this, the actual faith-based power Ares' father [[Zeus]] received proved to be very much diminished. On the other hand, other gods such as [[Athena]], [[Aphrodite]] and Ares began to gain more power due to the appearance of the computer age, love never diminishing and conflict remaining consistent. Thus the three godly siblings eventually took over Olympus as the godly home's new masters.

Realizing that conflict proved to maintain his strength over the output of war, Ares changed his title to the ''God of Conflict''. To celebrate this change he altered his appearance to a more approachable visage. His rule under this name proved to be short-lived though as the god [[Hades]] was also overthrown and Ares was all too eager to take up the mantle of ''God of the Dead''.

===Family reunited===
Realizing that a crossroads for the gods of Olympus was at hand, Ares confided in his half sister [[Cassandra Sandsmark]] in a future war. In exchange for additional powers, the only wish he requested in return from his sister was her love. He then traveled to [[Themyscira]] and kidnapped his daughter Lyta who was under the protection of the [[Amazons]]. Discovering this fact, [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] confronted Ares and was surprised to learn of his new godly title. She agreed to remain as his [[consort]] and together they are raising their daughter Lyta in the Underworld.

===Teen Titans===
During Ares' family bonding with Cassie, he blessed her with a powerful lasso able to expel Zeus's lightning in times of anger for her to use in her persona as [[Wonder Girl]]. Ares has since appeared to Cassie repeatedly in order to warn her about "[[Infinite Crisis|the coming war]]." In ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' (v3) #17–19, the Teen Titans were thrown ten years into the future, where Cassie had inherited the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana's death. She was also referred to as "Ares' champion."

Ares appeared to Cassie for apparently the final time in ''Teen Titans'' #33, where he revealed that the gods were leaving this plane and Zeus was taking the power he had granted Cassie as well. In exchange for acknowledging their siblinghood and becoming his champion, he offered her some of his power, saying only that she would be "more powerful than [she's] ever been." The full extent of Cassie's powers has not been revealed, though ''Infinite Crisis'' #6 and ''Teen Titans'' #34 indicate that she has retained all of her former powers.

==Powers and abilities==
As do all the [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian gods]], Ares possesses tremendous strength and stamina, though he is now perhaps the physically strongest of them. Moreover, he is a master of conflict and strategy, and has complete command over any weapon. His armor is virtually indestructible. He can regenerate his physical being into any form he wishes and can teleport himself and others, as well as alter reality to whatever he desires. He is now also recognized as the Death God of the Greek Pantheon and thus has control over the dead.

Being a god, he is also [[immortal]].

==Ares in other media==

Ares made an appearance in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series. He was voiced by [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]. In the episode "Hawk and Dove," Ares fueled the dispute between East and South [[Kasnia]] when he brought in his custom made "robot" to aid the East, in an effort to take total control of the country. [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Hawk and Dove]] intervened and Ares was forced to back down. He appeared by the name of Tom Sera in the episode.
