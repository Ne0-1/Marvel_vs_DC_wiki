'''Ares''' is a [[fiction|fictional]] [[deity]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Comics Universe|Universe]] based on the [[Ares|Greek God of the same name]]. It is also the name of a 5 issue mini-series, written by [[Michael Avon Oeming]] and drawn by [[Travel Foreman]], that focuses on this character. 

Ares first appeared in the pages of ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #129, written by [[Stan Lee]] and drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]. He would often appear as a villain in both ''Thor'' and ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'',  but in the recent ''Ares'' mini-series, he has been portrayed as an [[anti-hero]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Ares is the son of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] and is the [[Mount Olympus|Olympian]] God of War. Ares revelled in war and combat in all its forms, not caring about sides or victims. With the rise of [[Christianity]], Zeus allowed the worship of the Greek Gods to die out though, and Ares became more and more displeased with his father. Over the years he would lead several revolts again his father, but was always stopped by his half-brother [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Ares has hated Hercules ever since Hercules killed Ares' pets, the monstrous Stymphalian birds, and his hatred increased when he noticed Hercules being favored by their father, while he was shunned for his brutal behaviour.

===About Ares===
An attempt by [[Hades]] to conquer [[Mount Olympus]] with an army of the [[dead]] led to a [[stalemate]] that the [[deity|Gods]] and [[Demi-gods]] (including Hercules and [[Achilles]]) were unable to break. In desperation to end the [[siege]] of Olympus, Zeus called upon his son Ares who defeated Hades' army almost single handedly. Hoping that this would allow him to join his kind in Olympus, Ares was disappointed to hear his parents and the other gods disparage his "crude" and "dishonorable" nature. Leaving before the gods could make a polite invitation to join them, he resigned his position to live on [[Earth]] as a [[builder]]/[[carpenter]]. During this time he had a son, '''Alexander''', with an unidentified human woman though he raised him on his own, not wanting the boy corrupted by the "softness" a woman would bring into his life.

===2006 miniseries===
The [[2006]] mini-series begins as Alexander is kidnapped by Achillies, trying to force Ares to help Olympus. Olympus is again under siege, this time by [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] (the [[Japan|Japanese]] god of evil). Mikaboshi is taking advantage of the chaos left by the fall of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to extend his influence and hopes that by first capturing Olympus and defeating the Olympians, a proud and strong [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], other pantheons will more readily yield in fear of him.

Mikaboshi kidnaps Alex a second time from Achillies and begins to turn him against his father by revealing the brutal history and [[patricide]]s committed by the Greek gods. Mikaboshi clouds Alex's mind hoping to create a new god of war to use against Ares. He promises Alex that as god of war he can turn war into an instrument to impose order and peace.  In the end however, thanks to the power of Zeus, and Ares' love for his son, Alexander breaks out of Mikaboshi's control, and slays Mikaboshi with the [[Kusanagi|Grasscutter]] sword.  The gods of the east, allied with the Greek gods by a plan through their respective messenger gods ([[Hermes]] for the west and [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]] for the east), help destroy Mikaboshi's armies.  Later, Ares and Alexander are found recouperating in Africa, and Alex decides he wants to see the world and learn of his heritage (and of his currently unnamed mother) with his father.

===Civil War===
Ares has appeared in promotional artwork for the post [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] [[Mighty Avengers]] lineup.

==Powers and abilities==
Ares possesses all of the conventional superhuman physical attributes common to the Olympians. Like all Olympians, Ares possesses superhuman physical strength. However, Ares is considerably stronger than the vast majority of his race. Among the Olympians, his strength is equaled only by his uncles, Poseidon and Hades, and is exceeded only by his father, [[Zeus]], and his half-brother, [[Hercules]]. Ares' body generates almost no fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him almost limitless superhuman stamina. He is also immortal; he doesn't age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases and poisons and while he can be wounded, most wounds he will receive will heal quickly. Only extreme force would be able to kill him and even then his divine essence may be untouched, allowing him to be resurrected. Olympian godhood also gives him other, more rarely used abilities; he can walk among humans unseen and possess any mortal (he once possessed [[Eric Masterson|Erik Masterson]]). 

He is, as fits his station as the Olympian God of [[War]], an impressive fighter of tremendous skill and an expert in many (if not all) weapons. In his earlier appearances, he preferred ancient weapons like axes and spears, but his most recent appearance shows him favoring a mixture of ancient and modern weapons, like guns.

He also possessed the ''Gauntlets of Ares'', which made its wearer gain 100 times their normal strength. He has since passed these on to his daughter [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]].

==Deviation from Mythology==
*Ares is considered an enemy of Aphrodite and he fathered Deimos and Phobos from a woman posing as Aphrodite.
