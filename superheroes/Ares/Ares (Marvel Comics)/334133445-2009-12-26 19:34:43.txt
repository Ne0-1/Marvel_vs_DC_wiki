'''Ares''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[deity]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Comics Universe|Universe]] based on the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Ares|god of the same name]]. He first appears in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' (vol. 1) #129 (June 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

Ares has commonly appeared as an enemy of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and starred in his own [[Ares (comic book)|self-titled series]] in 2006.

==Publication history==
Ares first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #129, 1969, written by [[Stan Lee]] and drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]. He would often appear as a villain in both ''Thor'' and ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' over the next 30 years.

A 5 issue [[limited series]], ''[[Ares (comic book)|Ares]]'', written by [[Michael Avon Oeming]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5999 Marvel's New God On The Block - Oeming Writes "Ares"], [[Comic Book Resources]], November 29, 2005</ref>  and drawn by [[Travel Foreman]],<ref>[http://classic.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Ares/Foreman_Ares.htm Travel Foreman' War Cry], [[Newsarama]], November 14, 2005</ref> was published in 2006 and focuses on this character. Since the release of the ''Ares'' mini-series, he has been portrayed as an [[anti-hero]].

Following the super hero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Ares was invited to join the official, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-sponsored ''[[Mighty Avengers]]'', led by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], and appeared in that title. He was one of only two members to remain on the team after [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] took Stark's position, and currently appears in ''[[Dark Avengers]]''.  Ares subsequently starred in a three-issue ''Dark Avengers: Ares'' miniseries written by [[Kieron Gillen]].<ref>''Dark Avengers: Ares'' #1-3 (October-December 2009)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Ares is the son of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] and is the [[Mount Olympus|Olympian]] God of War. Ares reveled in war and combat in all its forms, not caring about sides or victims. Ares has hated [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] ever since Hercules killed Ares' pets, the monstrous [[Stymphalian birds]],<ref>Greek Mythology</ref> and his hatred increased when he noticed Hercules being favored by their father, while he was shunned for his brutal behavior.  Further adding to his hatred, is that in modern times, war is shunned and disliked, whereas Hercules is still beloved by the masses, despite his own history of death and destruction.<ref>as noted in ''Incredible Hercules'' #115</ref> As the Romans took on worship of Greek gods and renamed them, Ares is also the deity Mars.

===Modern Years===
====Villain====
After Zeus allowed the worship of the Greek/Roman gods to cease, the dissatisfied Ares held a deep grudge and would try to overthrow Olympus more than once.  He refused to battle against Pluto on behalf of Hercules, and aided Pluto instead. Hercules teamed up with the Asgardian god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in order to defeat Ares, leading to Ares' retreat.<ref>''Thor'' #129</ref> Ares fought a duel with Hercules, forming an alliance with the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] to make Hercules her slave and ally against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #38</ref>

Ares organized the [[Warhawks (comics)|Warhawks]], and with them battled the Avengers. He dispatched Kratos and Bia to capture Hercules.  After allying with the Enchantress again, he used the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]'s [[Ebony Blade]] to quench the Promethean Flame and conquer Olympus.  He again battled the Avengers, and was defeated by Thor and the Black Knight.<ref>''Avengers'' #98-100</ref>

Ares also battled [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]].<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #57</ref> He formed another alliance with Pluto, and kidnapped Krista in an attempt to foment war between Olympus and [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' 221-222</ref> He also plotted with Pluto and Ares' daughter [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]] to marry Hercules and Venus to Hippolyta and himself.<ref>''Champions'' #1-3</ref>

It was revealed that in ancient times, he took part in the [[Trojan War]].<ref>''Thor Annual'' #8</ref> Alongside Zeus, Ares struck an alliance with [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] against the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]],<ref>''Thor'' #289</ref> and battled the Eternal [[Ikaris]].<ref>''Thor'' #291</ref> Alongside his fellow Olympians, Ares battled the Avengers at Zeus' behest.  Ares was defeated by Namor, and forbidden to set foot on Earth again by Zeus.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

He frequently battled teams and individuals while working as a villain, and continued to battle heroes like the Avengers.<ref>such as in ''Hercules and the Heart of Chaos'' #1-3</ref>

====Human Life====
In recent times, Ares' uncle [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] sought to overwhelm [[Mount Olympus]] with an army of the [[dead]], leading to a [[stalemate]] that the [[deity|gods]] and [[demi-gods]] (including Hercules and [[Achilles]]) were unable to break. In desperation to end the [[siege]] of [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], Zeus called upon his son Ares who defeated Hades' army almost single-handedly. Hoping that this would allow him to join his kind in Olympus, Ares was disappointed to hear his parents and the other gods disparage his "crude" and "dishonorable" nature. He abandoned his brethren to live amongst mortal men, but did not completely give up his god nature yet.<ref name="ares1">Ares 1</ref>

Ares tired of his own war mongering when he realized that was why the other gods despised him and decided to live a normal life. He gave up his position as god of war, but maintained his skills, weaponry, and immortality. On Earth, he set himself up as a [[Construction worker|builder]]/[[carpenter]]. He would later father a son with an unidentified mother.<ref name="ares1"/>

====Ares (2006 miniseries)====
{{main|Ares (comic book)}}
The [[2006]] mini-series begins with Ares living a relatively peaceful life with his son, Alexander. This life is interrupted when Hermes visits Ares with a request... help Olympus fight off a new threat from the east, [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] (the [[Japan]]ese god of evil). Taking advantage of the chaos left by the fall of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and the Norse [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], Mikaboshi planned to extend his influence by capturing Olympus and crushing the Olympian gods. With the Olympians defeated, Mikaboshi hoped to cow all the other pantheons into surrendering. To this end, Mikaboshi laid siege to Olympus, which was very close to succeeding.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Ares, still bitter about the treatment he received from the other Olympians, refuses to raise a finger to help them. Desperate for his aid and wishing to goad Ares into action, Zeus has Alexander kidnapped and brought to Olympus where he is placed under the care of Achilles and his Myrmidons. On Earth, Ares wages an assault against police forces, who have found his social security number to be false. One of the policemen states that the [[New Avengers]] have just formed as a team.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

With the tide turning against them, Hermes goes to Earth to fetch an enraged Ares in an attempt to get him to speak with Zeus, but Ares' only concern is his son. Relenting, [[Hermes (Marvel Comics)|Hermes]] transports them both to Achilles' stronghold where they were keeping Alexander, only to find the fortress destroyed and Alexander missing.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

While Achilles was away, Mikaboshi's forces managed to destroy the Myrmidon fortress and steal Alexander away to his own stronghold in the eastern lands. Mikaboshi slowly begins to warp Alexander's mind in an attempt to turn him against his father by revealing the brutal history and [[patricide]]s committed by the Greek gods. Mikaboshi hopes to turn Alex into the new god of war, one that could be used against the Greek gods and, more importantly, Ares himself.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Finding out his son is in the hands of Olympus' enemies, a furious Ares begrudgingly agrees to join in the fighting, but only to rescue his son.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Mighty Avengers===
After the events of [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], [[Ms. Marvel]] and [[Iron Man]] recruited Ares as part of the new [[Mighty Avengers]], citing their need for a combination "Thor and Wolverine in one" as their reasoning. Ares says he didn't get involved in the Civil War as "it was just a slapfight", choosing instead to live a peaceful life as a civilian with his son, while working as a construction worker, up until the Avengers blew his civilian cover. In order to provide compensation and secure his services, Iron Man offered him a higher salary than what he was making as a construction worker if he joined the Avengers—after which Ares revealed that it would have to be higher than $44/hour.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

As an Avenger, he seems often at odds, either vocally or internally, with the team's methods of combat, and particularly chafes at orders to stand down when he feels that the battle should continue. This seems to show when [[Iron Man]]'s robotic helper offered the team aid; instead of letting them listen to it, Ares brutally destroyed the robot much to the dismay of the others.<ref>Mighty Avengers #4</ref> He is also more likely to resort to violence first, as his "infiltration plan" for getting into Castle Doom is ramming the Quinjet into the castle walls.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

During the events of [[World War Hulk]], Ares was easily defeated by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], after the Mighty Avengers face the Green King (Hulk) and his [[Warbound]].<ref>[[World War Hulk]] #2</ref>

However in the aftermath of World War Hulk, the Hulk had been stopped and Ares' brother, Hercules, who supported the Hulk's cause, was captured. Ares goaded Hercules into rebuilding the fallen Stark Tower as his punishment for aiding the Hulk during the war. However, Hercules refused Ares' offer and escaped his enemies.  Ares, Wonder Man, and Black Widow then headed off to track and follow Hercules and [[Amadeus Cho]], though Ares showed preference for attacking and defeating Hercules in battle as opposed to simply arresting them, going so far as to knock [[Wonder Man]] unconscious when he counsels restraint in dealing with Hercules.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Secret Invasion===
{{Main|Secret Invasion}}
Ares was among the Mighty Avengers who were fighting heroes from the [[Skrull]] ship.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1-2</ref> His son Alexander was recruited for [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Secret Warriors]], by [[Daisy Johnson]], to oppose the Skrull [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] of [[New York City]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #13</ref>

===Dark Reign===
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
Ares has joined the [[Dark Avengers]], [[Norman Osborn]]'s personal team of Avengers.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> Writer of the ''Dark Avengers'' series, [[Brian Michael Bendis]], described Ares' role: "Ares is going to be a big part of this book. He's really going to step up and use his War God brain."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19645 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 22, 2008</ref> In the most recent run of ''[[War Machine]]'' Osborn pitted Ares against the iron clad Avenger, only for the two to realize their goal was one and the same, and Ares declared Rhodes as his "champion." Despite this Ares unleashed a top secret weapon just for the fun of it.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} During The [[Dark Avengers]]' first mission, [[Mac Gargan|"Venom-Spidey"]] is turned into a monster by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le fay]]. Venom (under her control) attempts to eat Ares.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2</ref> He is spit back out but is turned to stone shortly thereafter by Morgana.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3</ref> He returns to normal when Morgana is defeated by Dr. Doom in her own time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4</ref> Ares later receives a truancy notice in the mail regarding his son.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #5</ref> Deciding to investigate as best he can, he sends Alex to school, only to see him board [[Daisy Johnson]]'s scooter on the way to a new base for the Secret Warriors. Ares tails them on his motorcycle and rampages his way in through the wall. When Hellfire tries to attack, Ares easily dispatches him and in their own silent way, Nick Fury and Ares ask for a private audience with one another. Ares then uncharacteristically declares himself a horrid father, but only aims to raise Alex differently than he and his father were raised. He then peacefully leaves the place behind, allowing Alex the opportunity to not have to hide his allegiance anymore.<ref> ''Dark Avengers'' #9</ref> Ares appears to have a new respect for Fury, since he simply let Fury walk into Osborn's office and threw off helicopters attempting to chase Fury.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Utopia===
When the Dark Avengers and H.A.M.M.E.R. go to San Francisco to quell the riots, Ares was stomping out a group of pro-mutant activists. [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] challenged him but was easily dispatched. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] tried absorbing his powers which prove too much for her but nonetheless she manages to weaken him. [[Danger Room|Danger]], fearing that Rogue might injure herself threw an energized [[manhole]] at Ares, pushing him away from Rogue. She gained half of Ares' power as a result. The trio then hijack a H.A.M.M.E.R. tank and leave a bleeding Ares behind.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #226</ref>

Ares, having recovered from his injuries, is seen next during the Dark Avengers' assault on the X-Men's new base; [[Asteroid M]]. There he fights with several X-Men until he is confronted with the once more empowered valkyrie [[Danielle Moonstar]]. The two fight and are evenly matched with Dani quickly gaining the upper hand due to having borrowed some power from [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]] the Asgardian death Goddess. Eventually both he and his team of Avengers are forced to retreat.<ref>''Dark Avengers-Uncanny X-Men - Exodus'' #001</ref>

[[Molecule Man]] turned Ares into stone.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ares possesses the typical powers of an [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian]], including superhuman strength, speed, durability, and reflexes, and virtual immortality, though some of his powers are substantially greater than most other Olympians.

Like all Olympians, Ares is superhumanly strong, though far more so than the majority of his race.  Among the Olympians, his strength is equaled only by his uncles, [[Neptune (Marvel Comics)|Neptune]] and [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]], and is exceeded only by his father, [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], and his half-brother, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Ares' body generates almost no fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him almost limitless superhuman stamina in all physical activities. Ares' body is also highly resistant to physical injury. He can withstand great impact forces, temperature extremes, and falls from great heights without being injured. However, also like all other Olympians, he can sustain injury. Ares is functionally immortal in the sense that he is immune to the effects of aging and hasn't aged since reaching adulthood. He is also unaffected by any known disease or infection. 

While not as accomplished at magic as many of his fellow Olympians, as an Olympian god Ares has the potential to use magic. Ares can sense the presence of other gods, demons, and the use of magic, call other gods, summon weapons from Olympus, and transport himself by teleportation to Olympus and to Earth at will. However, neither his rudimentary magic nor his Olympian natural abilities were capable of overwhelming the [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]]-tutored [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] or preventing the mistress of the mystic arts from quickly transmuting him into stone.

He is, as fits his station as the Olympian God of [[War]], a formidable hand to hand combatant. He is also an expert with numerous weapons, including ancient weapons and conventional, modern-day firearms. In his earlier appearances, he typically carried Olympian weapons like battleaxes, spears, swords, and daggers, but his most recent appearance shows him favoring a mixture of ancient, like the jawbone of an ass, and modern weapons, like gases, rays, firearms, and high-explosives, as well as "Hydra blood bullets", which contain the lethal blood of a [[Lernaean Hydra]]. He is an aficionado, expert and collector of the most unusual instruments and methods of death dealing.  He is also well versed in torture, interrogation and combat tactics.

Ares sometimes wears Olympian battle armor and carries a mace and battle axe all forged from [[adamant]]ine by Hephaestus. He sometimes rides a chariot of enchanted Olympian horses. At one time, he possessed the ''Gauntlets of Ares'', which made its wearer gain strength comparable to Hercules. He has since passed these on to his daughter [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]].
