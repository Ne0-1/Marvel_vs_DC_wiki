'''Lori Lemaris''' was a character in the [[Superman]] [[comic book]]. She was a [[mermaid]] from Tritonis, [[Atlantis]]. She was a love interest for Superman/[[Clark Kent]]. She disguised her mermaid tail by pretending to be confined to a wheelchair. Like many characters, she died in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], but Lori was one of the ones who returned in a revised form. Her [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-Crisis]] incarnation appeared in ''Superman'' Vol. 2 #12 (December 1987).

The origin story was much the same in both versions. Superman relays the story in a [[flashback]]. He meets Lori in college, and is instantly attracted to her. However, he becomes suspicious of the secret she's hiding. Eventually he deduces she is a mermaid, and they share a kiss under the sea, before deciding they come from two different worlds. The main differences are that, in the post-Crisis version, Clark has not yet taken the name Superman, and his reminisces are prompted by being told of Lori's death (although this was later revealed to be untrue).  This Lori also had a mission to discover other cities of [[Atlantis]], a quest completed when Superman later met [[Aquaman]] who revealed he was a native of just such a city.

Lori acheived a certain noteriety when she was brought back into the comics during the late 90's. She had been magically altered so that she would be human when dry and a mermaid when wet. [[Lois Lane]] agreed to let her stay at her apartment for a while. This was during a time before Lois and Clark were married and Lori (being an extremelly attractive belle who dressed like [[Britney Spears]] and who obviously still carried a flame for Clark put a strain on their relationship).  She was a recurring character through the late 90's but has not been seen in some time.

Her name was probably created by combining the name of the [[Lorelei]] rock in the [[Rhine]] river with the [[Latin]] word ''[[mare]]'' meaning ''ocean''.

She is one of several Superman characters with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lana Lang]], and [[Lois Lane]].
