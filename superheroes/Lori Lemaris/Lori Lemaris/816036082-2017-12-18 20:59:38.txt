==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===
Lori was first introduced in the story "The Girl in Superman's Past" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #129 (May 1959). The story revealed that while attending [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] University, Clark met Lori, who was attending as a student and hiding her mermaid identity by posing as a [[wheelchair]]-using student with a blanket covering the lower half of her body. Clark and Lori soon fell in love with each other, but Clark started to wonder why Lori would repeatedly cut their dates short every night to return home at 8 PM. Clark eventually decided to propose [[marriage]] to Lori, but Lori told Clark that she couldn't marry him, and that she also had to return to her native country. Heartbroken, and growing suspicious of why Lori had to return home every night at a preset time, Clark investigated, and discovered Lori's mermaid secret. Lori, in turn, revealed that thanks to her people's [[telepathic]] powers, she knew that he was really Superman all along, but promised to keep the knowledge of his identity a secret. Lori also stated that since the two came from such different worlds, they could never be wed. After a parting kiss underwater, the two bid farewell to each other.

Lori made various appearances throughout the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Superman comics. Like many other minor DC characters, Lori was killed in the 1985 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

===Modern Age===
Lori was soon brought back in a new incarnation after [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]'' limited series, which revised Superman's origins. Her post-Crisis incarnation first appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (volume 2) #12 in December 1987. Lori's post-Crisis origin story and her relationship with Clark remained similar to the original, except that post-Crisis, Clark had not yet adopted a superheroic identity at the time he was in college. Additionally, in the modern version, Lori also had a mission to discover other cities of the continent of Atlantis, a quest completed when Superman later met [[Aquaman]], who revealed he was a native of just such a city.<ref name=superman12/>

In Lori's appearances in the mid-to-late 1990s, Lori had been magically altered so that she would be human when dry and a mermaid when wet, much like Madison, [[Daryl Hannah]]'s character in the 1984 movie ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]''. [[Lois Lane]] agreed to let her stay at her apartment for a while during a trip to Metropolis; however, Lori being an old flame of Clark's put a brief strain on Lois and Clark's relationship, though things were soon straightened out. Lori remained a recurring character through the rest of the 1990s. At one point she was accused of being a black market smuggler of underground artifacts and confronted by Daily Planet reporter [[Steve Lombard]] and a camera crew. To escape, she dove off a bridge and swam away. Not understanding her nature, Steve and the crew believed she committed suicide to escape the criminal charges leveled against her. <ref>"Superman" vol. 2 #117 (1996)</ref>

Lemaris made an appearance in ''[[Justice Leagues]]'', a ''[[Justice League of America]]'' comic event in 2001 involving her native Atlantis. In human form, her feet do not touch the ground, instead floating about an inch above it.

Lori was thought to be killed in the 2005-2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series when the out-of-control, magic-hating [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] destroyed the kingdom of Atlantis. She appeared again after the Crisis' reality-altering events in a flashback story shown in 2007's ''[[Superman Confidential]]'' #6-7.

==Background==
Lori's name was influenced by the myths of the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, but was also possibly created by combining the name of the [[Lorelei]] rock in the [[Rhine]] river with the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''mare'' meaning ''sea''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Lori is one of several Superman characters with the [[Alliteration|alliterative]] initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lana Lang]], [[Supergirl|Linda Lee]], Linda Lang (Supergirl's latest secret identity), [[Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter|Letitia Lerner]], [[Lena Luthor]] (Luthor's sister pre-Crisis, and daughter post-Crisis), [[Lyla Lerrol]], [[Liesel Largo]], [[Lenora Lemaris]] (one of Lori's sisters), [[Leta Lal]] (Lori's ancestor), [[Garth Ranzz|Lightning Lad]], [[Lightning Lass]] (sister of Lightning Lad), [[Lightning Lord]] (brother of Lightning Lad), Lorraine Lewis (scientist jealous of Lois Lane, Lana Lang and Lori Lemaris), [[Lucy Lane]], [[Luma Lynai]], [[Lionel Luthor]] and [[Lois Lane]].

==Other versions==
*In the [[Tangent Comics]] series ''Joker's Wild'', a human reporter named Lori Lemaris is one of three heroines masqerading as a heroic version of [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. After one of her comrades dies in action, Lori refuses to wear the Joker outfit anymore, instead wearing the recently deceased [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]'s costume. She also appears in the ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'' series (March 2008).

==In other media==
===Television===
* Lori makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Downtime" voiced by an uncredited [[Kath Soucie]]. This version is only a teenager and has no apparently connection to Superman, who is already an adult. She is shown alongside [[Lagoon Boy]], [[Aquagirl]] and [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] as one of the students attending an Atlantean sorcery conservatory.<ref>http://jerome-k-moore.deviantart.com/art/YOUNG-JUSTICE-LORI-LEMARIS-199776699?q=sort%3Atime%20young%20justice&qo=1</ref>
