'''Lori Lemaris''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Superman]] [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Lori is a [[mermaid]] from Tritonis, a city in the undersea lost continent of [[Atlantis]].

Lori was first introduced in the story "The Girl In Superman's Past" in ''Superman'' (volume 1) #129 in [[May]] [[1959]]. The story revealed that while attending [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] University, Clark met Lori, who was attending as a student and hiding her mermaid identity by posing as a [[wheelchair]]-bound student (with a blanket covering the lower half of her body). Clark and Lori soon fell in love with each other, but Clark started to wonder why Lori would repeatedly cut their dates short every night to return home at a preset time. Clark eventually decided to propose [[marriage]] to Lori, but Lori told Clark that she couldn't marry him, and that she also had to return to her native country. Heartbroken, and growing suspicious of why Lori had to return home every night at a preset time, Clark investigated, and discovered Lori's mermaid secret. Lori, in turn, revealed that thanks to her people's mental [[telepathic]] powers, she knew that he was really Superman all along, but promised to keep the knowledge of his identity a secret. Lori also stated that since the two came from such different worlds, they could never be wed. After a parting kiss underwater, the two bid farewell to each other.

Lori made various appearances throughout the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Superman comics. Like many other minor DC characters, Lori was killed in the [[1985]] miniseries [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], but she was soon brought back in a revised incarnation after [[John Byrne]]'s [[1986]] ''[[The Man of Steel|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, which revised Superman's origins. Her [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-Crisis]] incarnation first appeared in ''Superman'' (volume 2) #12 in [[December]] [[1987]]. Lori's post-Crisis origin story and her relationship with Clark remained similar to the original, except that post-Crisis, Clark hadn't adopted a superhero career at the time he was in college. Additionally, in the modern version, Lori also had a mission to discover other cities of the continent of Atlantis, a quest completed when Superman later met [[Aquaman]], who revealed he was a native of just such a city.

In Lori's appearances in the mid-to-late [[1990s]], Lori had been magically altered so that she would be human when dry and a mermaid when wet, much like Madison, [[Daryl Hannah]]'s character in the [[1984]] movie [[Splash (movie)|Splash]]. [[Lois Lane]] agreed to let her stay at her apartment for a while during a trip to Metropolis; however, Lori being an [[old flame]] of Clark's put a brief strain on Lois and Clark's relationship, though things were soon straightened out. Lori remained a recurring character through the rest of the [[1990s]], and made an appearance in a recent ''[[Justice League of America]]'' comic storyline involving her native Atlantis.

Lori's name was possibly created by combining the name of the [[Lorelei]] rock in the [[Rhine]] river with the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[mare]]'' meaning ''ocean''.

Lori is one of several Superman characters with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lana Lang]], [[Supergirl|Linda Lee]], [[Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter|Letitia Lerner]], [[Lex Luthor|Lena Luthor]] (Luthor's sister pre-Crisis, and daughter post-Crisis), [[Lyla Lerrol]], [[Brainiac (comics)|Liesel Largo]], [[Lenora Lemaris]] (one of Lori's sisters), and [[Lois Lane]].
