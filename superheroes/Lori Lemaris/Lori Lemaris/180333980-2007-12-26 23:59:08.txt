'''Lori Lemaris''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]]' [[Superman]] [[comic books]]. Lori is a [[mermaid]] from Tritonis, a city in the undersea lost continent of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]].

==Silver Age==
Lori was first introduced in the story "The Girl In Superman's Past" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (volume 1) #129 in May 1959. The story revealed that while attending [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] University, Clark met Lori, who was attending as a student and hiding her mermaid identity by posing as a [[wheelchair]]-bound student (with a blanket covering the lower half of her body). Clark and Lori soon fell in love with each other, but Clark started to wonder why Lori would repeatedly cut their dates short every night to return home at a preset time. Clark eventually decided to propose [[marriage]] to Lori, but Lori told Clark that she couldn't marry him, and that she also had to return to her native country. Heartbroken, and growing suspicious of why Lori had to return home every night at a preset time, Clark investigated, and discovered Lori's mermaid secret. Lori, in turn, revealed that thanks to her people's [[telepathic]] powers, she knew that he was really Superman all along, but promised to keep the knowledge of his identity a secret. Lori also stated that since the two came from such different worlds, they could never be wed. After a parting kiss underwater, the two bid farewell to each other.

Lori made various appearances throughout the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Superman comics. Like many other minor DC characters, Lori was killed in the 1985 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

==Modern Age==
Lori was soon brought back in a new incarnation after [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel|Man of Steel]]'' limited series, which revised Superman's origins. Her post-Crisis incarnation first appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (volume 2) #12 in December 1987. Lori's post-Crisis origin story and her relationship with Clark remained similar to the original, except that post-Crisis, Clark had not yet adopted a superheroic identity at the time he was in college. Additionally, in the modern version, Lori also had a mission to discover other cities of the continent of Atlantis, a quest completed when Superman later met [[Aquaman]], who revealed he was a native of just such a city.

In Lori's appearances in the mid-to-late 1990s, Lori had been magically altered so that she would be human when dry and a mermaid when wet, much like Madison, [[Daryl Hannah]]'s character in the 1984 movie ''[[Splash (movie)|Splash]]''. [[Lois Lane]] agreed to let her stay at her apartment for a while during a trip to Metropolis; however, Lori being an old flame of Clark's put a brief strain on Lois and Clark's relationship, though things were soon straightened out. Lori remained a recurring character through the rest of the 1990s, and made an appearance in ''[[Justice Leagues]]'', a recent ''[[Justice League of America]]'' comic event involving her native Atlantis. In human form, her feet do not touch the ground, instead floating about an inch above it.

Lori was apparently killed in the 2005-2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series when the out-of-control [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] destroyed the kingdom of Atlantis. However, from the sweeping changes brought about by that event, Lemaris' origin will be seeing a new incarnation in ''[[Superman Confidential]]'' #8.

Lori's name was definitely influenced by the myths of the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], but was also possibly created by combining the name of the [[Lorelei]] rock in the [[Rhine]] river with the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''mare'' meaning ''sea''.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

The song "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]" (1864) has a line in it that refers to Lorelei rock and mermaids.

Lori is one of several Superman characters with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lana Lang]], [[Supergirl|Linda Lee]], [[Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter|Letitia Lerner]], [[Lena Luthor]] (Luthor's sister pre-Crisis, and daughter post-Crisis), [[Lyla Lerrol]], [[Liesel Largo]], [[Lenora Lemaris]] (one of Lori's sisters), [[Lightning Lad]], [[Lucy Lane]], [[Luma Lynai]], [[Lionel Luthor]] and [[Lois Lane]].
