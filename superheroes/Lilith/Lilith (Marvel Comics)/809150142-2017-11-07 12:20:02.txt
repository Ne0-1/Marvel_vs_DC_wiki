===Fictional character biography===
Lilith is Dracula's oldest child, and is his only child by his first wife, Zofia, who was forced on Dracula by his father.  After Dracula's father died, he renounced Zofia and forced her and their infant daughter to leave Castle Dracula so that he could marry his second wife, Maria, the woman he truly loved. Lilith was raised by [[Romani people|gypsies]] to whom she had been entrusted after her mother's [[suicide]].  Lilith's foster-mother was the gypsy Gretchin.  When Lilith was a young girl, Dracula, now a vampire, attacked and murdered Gretchin's son Arni, enraging her into seeking revenge.  She cast a spell upon Lilith to make her into a vampire, but one with rather different powers: unlike conventional [[Marvel Comics]] [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]], she did not fear holy symbols, and was not harmed at all by being out in the daylight. As part of the curse, she would haunt Dracula, ever opposing him, until Dracula was finally, irrevocably destroyed.  Whenever she was "killed", she would reappear by taking over the body of an innocent woman who hated her father and wished for his death; this included the ability to shift forms and clothing between Lilith's own form and that of her "hostess".{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

Lilith normally appeared, when in her own form, as a tall, beautiful woman with long black hair and a family resemblance to Dracula, dressed in a skin-tight costume with a bat-like ornament in her hair.  As a vampire, she could change forms into a [[wolf]], a [[bat]], or [[mist]], and had limited control over weather, as well as the ability to command wolves, bats, and rats.  Although she can drink blood, she is not dependent upon it for sustenance.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

In the modern era, Lilith's spirit possessed a woman named Angel O'Hara, who had come to hate her father when he accidentally killed her husband, Ted Hannigan, after finding out that she had married him secretly and was carrying his child. Lilith killed Angel's father, but allowed her to live her life when Lilith was not using their shared body. Angel was eventually physically separated from Lilith by Viktor Benzel, a distant descendant of Gretchin; Viktor created separate bodies for Angel and Lilith.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

At one point, Lilith and Dracula agreed to avoid each other, but the agreement broke down.  When Dracula was stripped of his vampiric powers toward the end of the 70-issue ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' story-arc, he asked Lilith to bite him and restore him to vampirism, only to be refused.  In an issue of ''The Tomb of Dracula'' magazine that soon followed, Lilith and Dracula fought once more, and Dracula revealed to Lilith that the curse that made her his eternal nemesis also prevented her from being able to actually kill him.  Lilith was destroyed along with her father and the rest of Earth's vampires when [[Doctor Strange]] used the [[Darkhold]]'s Montesi Formula to eliminate vampirism.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #62</ref> The Montesi Formula eventually weakened, and both Lilith and her father returned to life. Lilith subsequently appeared as Dracula's antagonist in the three-issue ''Dracula: Lord of the Undead'' limited series in 1998 and as an agent of [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]] in 2005.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

The demon Lilith is an ancient demon goddess and sorceress. She gives birth to demons called the Lilin which have lives of their own, but always remain obedient to their mother.

===Fictional character biography===
Lilith is an immortal who had lived in the city of pre-cataclysmic [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], one of its few survivors. Over the centuries, she gave birth to many of her children – (the [[Lilin]]) – including Creed, Pilgrim, Fang, Doc, Meatmarket, Skinner, and Nakota. Trapped in the leviathan [[Tiamat]] by Atlantean sorcerers, she used her vast magics to influence outside affairs. While thus imprisoned, she encountered [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Dan Ketch]]'s spirit, and then appeared in a vision to [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #28</ref>

Lilith was finally released from her ancient imprisonment by two unknowing scientist explorers. Discovering that her Lilin children had been scattered across the dimensions centuries ago and that many of them were destroyed by [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], she soon made enemies of them. She recruited the Lilin and Blackout, and sent Blackout, Creed, and Pilgrim to abduct John Blaze's son, Craig Blaze.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #1</ref> She sent the Lilin Fang to attack [[Morbius the Living Vampire|Morbius]].<ref>''Morbius'' #1</ref> She witnessed Ghost Rider and John Blaze's battle with [[Steel Vengeance]].<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #2</ref> Alongside the Lilin, she abducted Doris Ketch, Jack D'Auria, and Arthur and Stacy Dolan.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #30</ref> She transformed the [[Darkhold]]ers' ninjas and sent them to kill [[Victoria Montesi]]. Alongside the Lilin, she battled Ghost Rider, John Blaze, and the Darkhold Redeemers.<ref>''Darkhold'' #1</ref> She then sent the Lilin Skinner to attack Ghost Rider and John Blaze.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #3</ref> She then hired the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] to kill Ghost Rider and John Blaze.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1</ref> Alongside the Lilin, she again battled Ghost Rider, John Blaze, Morbius, the Nightstalkers, and the Darkhold Redeemers.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #31</ref>

After many attempts to kill the two, her enemies list grew to include [[Doctor Strange]], [[Morbius the Living Vampire]], the [[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]], the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]] and the [[Midnight Sons]]. In her first attempt she and most of her children were killed.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Many months later her children were reborn with the assistance of Meatmarket, a child Lilith did not expect would help her. This time they are allied with [[Centurious]], the man without a soul.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #41 (1993)</ref> Their goal was to claim the mystical artifact called the [[Medallion of Power]], and kill its inheritors, John Blaze, Daniel Ketch, and [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]. Lilith and her offspring betrayed Centurious and allied with his most hated enemy, [[Zarathos]]. However the Midnight Sons banished Lilith and her offspring to the shadowside.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Zarathos was later turned into stone and killed. Lilith returned to the stoned Zarathos saying she abandoned her old offspring and replaced it with his offspring, promising vengeance for the both of them.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Lilith was one of several demonic beings imprisoned within Avalon at the start of the [[Secret Invasion]], but was then freed by [[Pete Wisdom]] during Captain Britain and MI3's battle with the [[Skrull]]s.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 3 | Date = September 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> Lilith subsequently joins [[Satannish]] and the other freed creatures in killing the invading Skrulls, after hearing them state that any magical creatures that do not serve the Skrulls will not be tolerated.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 4 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> She later joins Dracula's inner circle as he plans to invade the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker =  | Story = Vampire State | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 12 | Date = May 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>
