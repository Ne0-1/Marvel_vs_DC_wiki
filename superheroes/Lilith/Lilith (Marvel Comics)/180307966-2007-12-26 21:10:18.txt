Lilith is Dracula's oldest child, and is his only child by his first wife, Zofia, who was forced on Dracula by his father.  After Dracula's father died, he renounced Zofia and forced her and their infant daughter to leave Castle Dracula so that he could marry the woman he truly loved. Lilith was raised by [[Roma people|Gypsies]] to whom she had been entrusted after her mother's [[suicide]].  Lilith's foster-mother was the gypsy Gretchin.  When Lilith was a young girl, Dracula, now a vampire, attacked and murdered Gretchin's son Arni, enraging her into seeking revenge.  She cast a spell upon Lilith to make her into a vampire, but one with rather different powers: unlike conventional [[Marvel Comics]] [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]], she did not fear holy symbols, and was not harmed at all by being out in the daylight. As part of the curse, she would haunt Dracula, ever opposing him, until Dracula was finally, irrevocably destroyed.  Whenever she was "killed", she would reappear by taking over the body of a woman who hated her father and wished for his death; this included the ability to shift forms and clothing between Lilith's own form and that of her "hostess".

Lilith normally appeared, when in her own form, as a tall, beautiful woman with long black hair and a family resemblance to Dracula, dressed in a skin-tight costume with a bat-like ornament in her hair.  As a vampire, she could change forms into a [[wolf]], a [[bat]], or [[mist]], and had limited control over weather, as well as the ability to command wolves, bats, and rats.  Although she can drink blood, she is not dependent upon it for sustenance.

In the modern era, Lilith's spirit possessed a woman named Angel O'Hara, who had come to hate her father when he accidentally killed her husband. Lilith killed Angel's father, but allowed her to live her life when Lilith was not using their shared body. Angel was eventually physically separated from Lilith by Viktor Benzel, a distant descendant of the Gretchin; Viktor created separate bodies for Angel and Lilith.

At one point, Lilith and Dracula agreed to avoid each other, but the agreement broke down.  When Dracula was stripped of his vampiric powers toward the end of the 70-issue ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' story-arc, he asked Lilith to bite him and restore him to vampirism, only to be refused.  In an issue of the ''Tomb of Dracula'' magazine that soon followed, Lilith and Dracula fought once more, and Dracula revealed to Lilith that the curse that made her his eternal nemesis also prevented her from being able to actually kill him.  Lilith was destroyed along with her father and the rest of Earth's vampires when [[Doctor Strange]] used the [[Darkhold]]'s Montesi Formula to eliminate vampirism.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #62</ref> The Montesi Formula eventually weakened, and both Lilith and her father returned to life. Lilith subsequently appeared as Dracula's antagonist in the four-issue ''Dracula: Lord of the Undead'' limited series in [[1998]] and agent of [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]] in [[2005]].

The demon Lilith is an ancient demon goddess. She gives birth to demons called the Lilin which have lives of their own, but always remain obedient to their mother. She is an immortal having lived in the city of Atlantis, one of its few survivors. Trapped in the leviathan [[Tiamat]] by Atlantean sorcerers, she used her vast magics to influence outside affairs until she was finally freed by two unknowing scientist explorers. Discovering that many of her [[Lilin]] children were destroyed by [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Johnny Blaze]], she soon made enemies of them. After many attempts to kill the two, her enemies list grew to include [[Doctor Strange]], [[Morbius the Living Vampire]], [[Witches (Marvel Comics)|The Witches]], [[Nightstalkers (comics)|The Nightstalkers]] and the [[Midnight Sons]] just to name a few. In her first attempt she and her children were killed. Many months later her children were reborn this time allied with [[Centurious]], the man without a soul. Their goal was to claim the mystical artifact called the [[Medallion of Power]], and kill it's inheritors, John Blaze, Daniel Ketch, and [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]. Lilith and her offspring betrayed Centurious and allied with his most hated enemy, [[Zarathos]]. However the Midnight Sons banished Lilith and her offspring to the shadowside. Zarathos was later turned into stone and killed. Lilith returned to the stoned Zarathos saying she abandoned her old offspring and replaced it with his offspring, promising vengeance for the both of them. This has yet to be seen.
