==History==
Hero Hotline is a corporate 24/7 hero for hire company created by the Coordinator, a man who was secretly World war II hero Harry "Tex" Thompson the [[Tex Thompson|Americommando]]. The Coordinator only communicates with the agency as a shadowy figure on a communication screen. Their hotline number is '''1-800-555-HERO'''. They regularly take on the smaller missions from the common man, on occasion they have to fight the odd supervillain.
