'''Elasti-Girl''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]] as a member of the [[Doom Patrol]]. She first appeared in ''My Greatest Adventure'' #80 (June 1963).

Rita Farr was an Hollywood [[actress]] who was exposed to unusual volcanic gases while shooting a [[film]] in [[Africa]]. When Farr recovered, she discovered that she could grow or shrink her body at will from microscopic to thousands of feet tall. Elasti-Girl later enhanced her powers to enlarge one limb at a time. Unfortunately, her powers were slowly killing her. She was the sole member of original Doom Patrol to stay dead. When writer-artist [[John Byrne]] [[reboot (continuity)|rebooted]] the Doom Patrol in 2004, Elasti-Girl was among the original Doom Patrol members to be reintroduced.
