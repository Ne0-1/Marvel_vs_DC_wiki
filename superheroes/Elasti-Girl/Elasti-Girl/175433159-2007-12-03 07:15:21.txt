'''Elasti-Girl''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] of the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] and a member of the [[Doom Patrol]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Rita Farr''' is a Hollywood [[actress]] who is exposed to unusual volcanic gases while shooting a [[film]] in [[Africa]]. When Farr recovers, she discovers that she can expand or shrink her body at will &mdash; from hundreds of feet tall to microscopically small. When she gains greater control of her powers, she is able to return to her normal size, or enlarge one limb at a time. 

Considered a freak and a menace, her Hollywood career is ruined. However, Rita is approached by Dr. Niles Caulder (also known as The [[Chief (comics)|Chief]]) who offers her a place among fellow "freaks" attempting to use their powers for good. As Elasti-Girl, she joins Caulder's team, the Doom Patrol. Rita falls in love with, and marries, [[Steve Dayton]], the hero Mento. Later on, the couple adopts young Gar Logan, who would become the Teen Titans' [[Beast Boy]]. 

In the ''JLA: Year One'' storyline, the [[Martian Manhunter]] tells Rita that he was something of a fan of her "chiller pictures" and that he was disappointed that she did not continue making films.  Flattered, she kisses him on the cheek and later tells him that she has met ''[[Alien (film series)|Aliens]]'' actress [[Sigourney Weaver]] and that she is sure she would approve of him. 

Tragedy strikes when the Doom Patrol's enemies, the Brotherhood of Evil, threaten a small New England fishing village. The Patrol members elect to sacrifice themselves to save the innocents, and are killed in an explosion. Although it is revealed that several members of the team actually cheated death (to  appear in Doom Patrol revivals), Elasti-Girl is the sole member of the original Doom Patrol who remained dead.

''"I remember the explosion on the island. And then nothing but darkness. Am I supposed to be dead?"''
&mdash; Elasti-Girl, ''Teen Titans'' #32

When writer-artist [[John Byrne]] revived the Doom Patrol in 2004, Elasti-Girl was among the team members reintroduced, as if none of the events in prior Doom Patrol continuity had ever happened.

This situation was explained as an after-effect of [[Superboy-Prime]]'s pounding on the barrier to reality, which created ripples that changed reality for several characters, including the original Doom Patrol. 

The Patrol members retain no memories of their previous lives &mdash;until Superboy-Prime breaks the Phantom Zone barrier during his battle with the Teen Titans and their allies.  At that moment their minds discern visions of the previous Doom Patrols, and Rita remembers everything &mdash; her husband, her son, and her own death.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}

Following the [[One Year Later]] jump, the Doom Patrol changes considerably, losing several members and gaining [[Beast Boy]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] and [[Mal Duncan|Vox]]. (''Teen Titans'' #36)

The explanation for Rita's resurrection: the [[Chief (comics)|Chief]] salvaged a piece of Elasti-Girl's skull and used his technology to regrow her entire body due to its malleable form.  Consequently, Elasti-Girl is very docile, and is reluctant to question the Chief.  The Chief hints that her malleable form hampers her thinking abilities, leading to her lack of personal initiative which makes her dependent upon Caulder. As he observes her interaction with the Chief, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] suspects that the Chief has brainwashed Rita and the other Patrol members.  Rita's husband, Mento, is under the control of his Mento-helmet, and believes that his wife would never love him without it.

Following their battle against the Brotherhood, the Titans and the Doom Patrol witness the Chief working to convince [[Kid Devil]] that he is a freak and that the Titans actually dislike him. This pushes the teams to confront the Chief: Mento finally removes his helmet and pointedly tells the Chief that he is no longer leader of the Patrol and if he ever again insults his wife and son, he will use his powers to destroy the Chief's intellect. Rita firmly stands behind her husband, breaking out of the Chief's control.

==Powers and abilities==

Rita has the ability to expand and [[shrink]] her body. Her powers of expansion allow her to become as large as a skyscraper. She has the ability to shrink to microscopic size. (During one adventure, she was exposed to a gas that allowed her to enter a sub-atomic universe; that experience has not been repeated.)  Rita can selectively shrink or expand parts of her body.
[[John Byrne]]'s Elasti-Girl could change the size of objects and people by touching them; when she releases them they revert to their normal size.

==Other media==
Elasti-Girl has appeared as a member of the Doom Patrol in Season Five (the two-part "Homecoming" episode) of the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series. Her shrinking ability is absent from the series.

She is voiced by [[Tara Strong]], who also has provided voices for other animated superheroes, such as [[Batgirl]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]].
