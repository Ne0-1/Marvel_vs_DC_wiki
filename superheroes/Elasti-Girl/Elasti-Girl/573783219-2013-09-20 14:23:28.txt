==Fictional character biography==
'''Rita Farr''' is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] swimming gold medalist turned Hollywood [[actress]]<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Arnold Drake|Drake, Arnold]] | Artist = [[Bruno Premiani|Premiani, Bruno]] | Story = The Doom Patrol | Title = [[My Greatest Adventure]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 80 | Date = June, 1963 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 3 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref> who is exposed to unusual volcanic gases while shooting a [[film]] in [[Africa]]. When Farr recovers, she discovers that she can expand or shrink her body at will &mdash; from hundreds of feet tall to mere inches in height. When she gains greater control of her powers, she discovers that she can enlarge one limb at a time.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Although not physically disfigured, Rita initially has no control over her size changes, is considered a freak and a menace, and becomes a recluse, leaving her Hollywood career in ruins.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Drake, Arnold | Artist = Premiani, Bruno | Story = The Doom Patrol | Title = My Greatest Adventure | Volume = 1 | Issue = 80 | Date = June, 1963 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 5 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref> However, Rita is approached by Dr. Niles Caulder (also known as The [[Chief (comics)|Chief]]) who offers her a place among fellow "freaks" attempting to use their powers for good. As Elasti-Girl, she joins Caulder's team, the [[Doom Patrol]].<ref name="dc-doom">{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Doom Patrol | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 109  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Rita falls in love with, and marries, Steve Dayton, the hero [[Mento (comics)|Mento]]. Later on, the couple adopts young Gar Logan, who would become the Teen Titans' [[Beast Boy]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In the ''JLA: Year One'' storyline, the [[Martian Manhunter]] tells Rita that he was something of a fan of her "chiller pictures" and that he was disappointed that she did not continue making films.  Flattered, she kisses him on the cheek and later tells him that she has met ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' actress [[Sigourney Weaver]] and that she is sure he would approve of her. 

Tragedy strikes when the Doom Patrol's enemies, the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], threaten a small New England fishing village. The Patrol members elect to sacrifice themselves to save the innocents, and are killed in an explosion. It is later revealed that several members of the team actually cheated death (to appear in [[Doom Patrol]] revivals), although Elasti-Girl would remain "dead" until [[Infinite Crisis]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Infinite Crisis===
{{see also|Infinite Crisis}}
''"I remember the explosion on the island. And then nothing but darkness. Am I supposed to be dead?"''
&mdash; Elasti-Girl, ''[[Teen Titans#Teen Titans (vol. 3, 2003 - present)|Teen Titans]]'' #32, March 2006.

When writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] revived the Doom Patrol in 2004, Elasti-Girl was among the team members reintroduced, as if none of the events in prior [[Doom Patrol]] continuity had ever happened.

This situation was explained as an after-effect of [[Superboy-Prime]]'s pounding on the barrier to reality, which created ripples that changed reality for several characters, including the original [[Doom Patrol]]. 

The Patrol members retain no memories of their previous lives &mdash;until [[Superboy-Prime]] breaks the Phantom Zone barrier during his battle with the [[Teen Titans]] and their allies.  At that moment their minds discern visions of the previous [[Doom Patrol]]s, and Rita remembers everything &mdash; her husband, her son, and her own death.

Rita is seen in issue #7 of ''Infinite Crisis'' as one of the many heroes defending the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] from the army calling themselves the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. She personally battles the giant villain [[Giganta]].

Rita makes a cameo in issue #50 of the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' maxi-series. She is seen on a monitoring screen; she is fighting [[Black Adam]] next to the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].

''Infinite Crisis'' ultimately retconned Byrne's reboot out of continuity.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}

Following the [[One Year Later]] jump, the Doom Patrol changes considerably, losing several members and gaining [[Beast Boy]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] and [[Mal Duncan|Vox]].<ref>''[[Teen Titans#Teen Titans (vol. 3, 2003 - present)|Teen Titans]]'' (Vol. 3) #36 (July 2006)</ref>

The explanation for Rita's resurrection: The [[Chief (comics)|Chief]] salvaged a piece of Elasti-Girl's skull and used his technology to regrow her entire body due to its malleable form.  Consequently, Elasti-Girl is very docile, and is reluctant to question the Chief.  The Chief hints that her malleable form hampers her thinking abilities, leading to her lack of personal initiative which makes her dependent upon Caulder (a.k.a. The Chief). As he observes her interaction with the Chief, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] suspects that the Chief has brainwashed Rita and the other Patrol members.  Rita's husband, [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], is under the control of his Mento-helmet, and believes that his wife would never love him without it.

Following their battle against the Brotherhood, the Titans and the Doom Patrol witness the Chief working to convince [[Kid Devil]] that he is a freak and that the Titans actually dislike him. This pushes the teams to confront the Chief: Mento finally removes his helmet and pointedly tells the Chief that he is no longer leader of the Patrol and if he ever again insults his wife and son, he will use his powers to destroy the Chief's intellect. Rita firmly stands behind her husband, breaking out of the Chief's control.


In the most recent Doom Patrol series, Rita changed her codename to "Elasti-Woman".<ref>''Doom Patrol'' (Vol. 5) #1 (October 2009)</ref> It was revealed that that when the Chief regrew her he did so using protoplasm to eliminate 'weaknesses' such as bones and internal organs and therefore Rita is no longer human. When she sleeps Rita loses her human shape and reverts to a puddle of goo, having to reshape herself when she wakes up every morning.

==Powers and abilities==
Rita has the ability to expand and shrink her body. Her powers of expansion allow her to become as large as a skyscraper. She has the ability to shrink to mere inches. (During one adventure, she was exposed to a gas that caused her to reduce to a microscopic scale and enter a sub-atomic universe; that experience has not been repeated.)  Rita can selectively shrink or expand parts of her body.
As depicted in [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s ''[[Doom Patrol#John Byrne's Doom Patrol|Doom Patrol]]'' ([[retcon]]ned out of existence), Elasti-Girl could change the size of objects and people by touching them; when she'd release them, they'd revert to their normal size.
Because of her protoplasmic physiology, Rita can regenerate any part of her body. She can reconstruct a half-blown face or a torn leg and regrow severed limbs.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Elasti-Girl has appeared as a member of the Doom Patrol in Season Five (the two-part "Homecoming" episode) of the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series. Her shrinking ability is not demonstrated in the series, except when she returns from her enlarged state to her normal size. She is voiced by [[Tara Strong]], who also has provided voices for other animated superheroes, such as [[Batgirl]], [[List of Ben 10 characters#Ben Tennyson|Ben 10]], and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]].

* Elasti-Girl (alongside Doom Patrol members [[Chief (comics)|Chief]], [[Negative Man]], and [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]]) appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Last Patrol" voiced by [[Olivia d'Abo]]. In this version, she has become very fat and is wallowing in self-pity due to the accident in Paris that broke up the Doom Patrol. She was even shown doing that at a party she held at her sea-side mansion when the Mutant Master and his minions attacked. When Batman and Chief arrived, they manage to convince Elasti-Girl to rejoin and fend off Mutant Master. She rapidly loses weight before doing so. In a recreation of the original ''Doom Patrol'' series' finale, she and her team mates later sacrifice their lives to stop General Zahl from detonating explosives planted on the island of a small fishing village.

* Rita Farr appears very briefly in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Image." Her name was seen in the credits for a fictional television sitcom called "Hello Megan" that starred a teenage Marie Logan (mother of [[Beast Boy|Garfield Logan]]).

* Elasti-Girl appeared in the "Doom Patrol" segments of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'' voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].

===Name use===
* In the 2004 film ''[[The Incredibles]]'', [[Elastigirl (The Incredibles)|Helen Parr]]'s hero name is "Elastigirl" (voiced by [[Holly Hunter]]). [[Pixar]] received permission from [[DC Comics]] to use the name in the film as long as it wasn't used in the merchandising. In the merchandising (and almost twice in the film) she's referred to as "Mrs. Incredible". Additionally, in what appears to be an homage to the original character from the comics, Helen's costume during her heroine career as a young woman, is white and red and includes a headband, just like Rita's original costume from the Silver Age, as well as the same hairstyle.
