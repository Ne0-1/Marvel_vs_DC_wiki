'''Gnaark''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[caveman]] who has been a member of various versions of the ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' in the comic books in the early 1980s.

==Fictional character biography==

Gnarrk's story began thousands of years ago. Gnarrk was a 19 year old Cro-Magnon who was fascinated by the lights in the skies. One night, a comet crashed before him, imbedding a chunk of crystal into his chest. Somehow, this caused a transformation in him - it expanded his mind, and his understanding. Soon, a volcanic disturbance threatened Gnarrk. The jewel in his chest protected him, though, encasing him in ice. Centuries passed, and Gnarrk remained in his ice tomb.

During that time, his mind still worked, and Gnarrk dreamed of a better world. He had the ability to cure disease and control the forces of nature to benefit mankind. 

Based on psychic flashes from [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]], the Teen Titans traveled to Southeast Asia, where they eventually found Gnarrk, still encased in ice. He was psychically calling out to Lilith - who responded. He told her his name: Gnarrk. Although Lilith was dating Don Hall (Dove) at the time, she nonetheless found herself attracted to the gentle soul. The Titans brought Gnarrk back to S.T.A.R. Labs. It was established that he was dying; the S.T.A.R. scientists wanted to dissect him, but the Titans prevented them from doing so.

Lilith used her powers to establish a mental rapport with Gnarrk. During that time, she found out his true origins and his noble intentions. Gnarrk sensed Lilith's presence and called out to her while he was still encased in ice. During the rapport, Lilith and Gnarrk fell in love. Although their psychic romance only lasted a short time, the two forged an unspeakable bond.

Gnarrk remained on life support for almost a year, with Lilith by his side. Gnarrk's light in his chest eventually faded, and he died. When S.T.A.R. scientists performed an autopsy, they found the stone no longer had any special abilities. Whatever abilities the stone possessed vanished upon Gnarrk's death.

===Pre-crisis===
* Prior to Crisis, Gnarrk was a time displaced Neanderthal stranded in the present. Through love and telepathic communication Lilith teaches him human language and customs and later both retire from the Teen Titans to live together, apparently as a couple. Around the time of Teen Titans vol 1 final issues both joint the short lived Teen Titans West branch. Much later, in Tales of The Teen Titans #50 Lilith attends Donna Troy's wedding alone and mentions Gnaark's "terrible fate" but nobody goes into details about it.

===Post-crisis===
Gnarrk's only post-Crisis appearance was nothing more than a mention. At [[Donna Troy]]'s wedding Lilith (later Omen) revealed that Gnarrk had died due to the complications that came about from the coma he was in. (pre-Crisis)

==Powers==
Being a Cro-Magnon, Gnarrk possesses greater strength, dexterity and endurance. When a comet imbedded a chunk of crystal into his chest, it caused a transformation in Gnarrk - it expanded his mind, and his understanding. The full range of his expanded mental abilities were uncatalogued.

==In the ''Teen Titans'' animated series==
Gnarrk appeared in the fifth season episode of the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, entitled "Kole". He lives in the Arctic circle with his best friend, [[Kole]], in a vast series of underground caverns that are inhabitated by prehistoric creatures. All Gnarrk could say was, "gnarrk", yet Kole could understand him and communicate with him quite well. He also seems to have a crush on her as he was seen blushing around her on few occasions. He helped the Titans stop [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] when he attempted to kidnapp Kole. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] was never able to pronouce his name right (but did in "Calling all Titans"), and always had to be corrected by Kole or his teammates. This was obviously a satire on readers of the old comic book being unsure as to whether the 'g' in Gnarrk's name was silent or hard.

Gnarrk and Kole were overpowered by [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Billy Numerous|Billy Numerous]] in "Calling All Titans", but some quick thinking by Kole ended up saving the day. They were part of a group of reinforcements that come to rescue [[Beast Boy]], [[Pantha]], [[Más Y Menos|Más]], [[Herald (comics)|the Herald]] and [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] from the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. The first villain they take out is the [[Ding Dong Daddy]]. They end up helping to defeat the villains and save the day.

Gnarrk is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].

Aside from [[Beast Boy]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], [[Herald (comics)|Herald]], and Gnaark were all Titans West members in the comic books.

''Appears in:''
* "Kole"
* "Calling All Titans"
* "Titans Together"

In his first appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', Gnaark was apparently kidnapped from his home, and along with several other kidnapped Titans, was forced to fight [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]], for the entertainment of spectators and villains, but was saved by Kole and several other Titans who came to rescue them.
