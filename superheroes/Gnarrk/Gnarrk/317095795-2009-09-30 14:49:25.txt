'''Gnarrk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[caveman]] who has been a member of various versions of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' in the comic books in the early 1970s.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
Prior to the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Gnarrk was a time displaced [[Neanderthal]] stranded in the present. Through love and telepathic communication, [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]] teaches him human language and customs. Later, both retire from the Teen Titans to live together, apparently as a couple. Later, Gnarrk and Lilith briefly joined [[List of Teen Titans members#Titans West|Teen Titans West]] before it disbanded. Several years later at [[Donna Troy]]'s wedding, Lilith mentioned Gnarrk's "terrible fate", but didn't elaborate on it.

===Post-Crisis===
Gnarrk's story began thousands of years ago. Gnarrk was a nineteen year old [[Cro-Magnon]] who was fascinated by the lights in the skies. One night, a [[comet]] crashed before him, embedding a chunk of crystal into his chest. Somehow, this caused a transformation in him - it expanded his mind and his understanding. Soon, a volcanic disturbance threatened Gnarrk. The jewel in his chest protected him, though, encasing him in ice. Centuries passed, and Gnarrk remained in his ice tomb. During that time, his mind still worked, and Gnarrk dreamed of a better world. He had the ability to cure disease and control the forces of nature to benefit mankind. 

Based on psychic flashes from [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]], the Teen Titans traveled to [[Southeast Asia]], where they eventually found Gnarrk, still encased in ice. He was psychically calling out to Lilith, who responded. He told her his name: Gnarrk. Although Lilith was dating Don Hall ([[Hawk and Dove|Dove]]) at the time, she nonetheless found herself attracted to the gentle soul. The Titans brought Gnarrk back to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. It was established that he was dying; the S.T.A.R. scientists wanted to dissect him, but the Titans prevented them from doing so.

Lilith used her powers to establish a mental rapport with Gnarrk. During that time, she found out his true origins and his noble intentions. Gnarrk sensed Lilith's presence and called out to her while he was still encased in ice. During the rapport, Lilith and Gnarrk fell in love. Although their psychic romance only lasted a short time, the two forged an unspeakable bond.

Gnarrk remained on life support for almost a year, with Lilith by his side. Gnarrk's light in his chest eventually faded, and he died. When S.T.A.R. scientists performed an autopsy, they found the stone no longer had any special abilities. Whatever abilities the stone possessed vanished upon Gnarrk's death. <ref>The Official Teen Titans Index (published by ICG in 1985)</ref>,<ref>The New Titans Sourcebook (Mayfair Games, 1990)]</ref>.

==Powers==
Being a Cro-Magnon, Gnarrk possesses greater strength, dexterity, and endurance. When a comet embedded a chunk of crystal into his chest, it caused a transformation in Gnarrk - it expanded his mind, and his understanding. The full range of his expanded mental abilities were uncatalogued.

==Other Media==
===Television===

* Gnarrk appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Kole" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. He lives in the Arctic Circle with his best friend, [[Kole]], in a vast series of underground caverns that are inhabited by prehistoric creatures. All Gnarrk could say was "gnarrk", yet Kole could understand him and communicate with him quite well; he also seems to have a crush on her. Stemming from bad experiences with the modern world, Gnarrk suffers from a major [[technophobia]].<br>Gnarrk helped the Titans stop [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] when he attempted to kidnap Kole. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] was never able to pronounce his name right (but did in "Calling all Titans"), and always had to be corrected by Kole or his teammates. This may have been a satire on readers of the old comic book being unsure as to whether the 'g' in Gnarrk's name was silent or difficult. Gnarrk and Kole are nearly overpowered by [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] and Billy Numerous in "Calling All Titans", but some quick thinking by Kole ends with them prevailing. Later they are part of a group of reinforcements that come to rescue [[Beast Boy]], [[Pantha]], [[Más y Menos|Más]], [[Mal Duncan|Herald]], and [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] from the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. The first villain they take out is the [[Ding Dong Daddy]]. They end up helping to defeat the villains and save the day.

===Miscellaneous===
* In his first appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', Gnarrk was apparently kidnapped from his home, and along with several other kidnapped Titans, was forced to fight Private H.I.V.E., for the entertainment of spectators and villains, but was saved by Kole and several other Titans who came to rescue them.
