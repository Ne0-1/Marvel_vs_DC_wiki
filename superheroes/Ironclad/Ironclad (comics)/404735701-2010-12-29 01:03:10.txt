==Fictional character biography==
Mike Steel was an engineer, scientist, and pilot before gaining his superhuman powers. With his teammates, he attempted to duplicate the original rocket flight of the Fantastic Four through a cosmic ray belt, and gained superhuman powers just as the Fantastic Four did. His team then first battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], although during the battle Ironclad lost control of his powers and sank into the ground.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #254</ref> Later, he rescued his teammate [[X-Ray (comics)|X-Ray]] and was reunited with the [[U-Foes]]. They again battled the Hulk and this time defeated him.  In triumph, they exhibited the captive Bruce Banner on national television.  However, Banner was freed by [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], and the alien [[Bereet]], and Banner transformed into the Hulk and defeated the U-Foes.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #275-277</ref> With the U-Foes, Ironclad later escaped a special government prison, but was accidentally "deflected" by team leader [[Vector (comics)|Vector]] into the "Crossroads" dimension. There, he battled the Hulk and defeated him with the help of the alien "[[Puffball Collective]]," though he became trapped in a dimension of quicksand.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #304-305</ref> Ironclad later escaped back to the "Crossroads" dimension, and with the U-Foes he escaped back to Earth through a dimensional warp unintentionally opened by the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Portal (comics)|Charles Little Sky]]. The U-Foes battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], and Ironclad was defeated by [[Captain America]] and [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]].<ref>''Avengers'' #304</ref>

Some time later, alongside other superhuman criminals, Ironclad attempted to escape from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], and battled the Avengers and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. Alongside [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Ironclad sided with [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]] against [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] for leadership of the convicts.<ref>''The Vault Graphic Novel''</ref> Ironclad was later freed from the Vault, and with teammates [[Vapor (comics)|Vapor]] and X-Ray, Ironclad attacked the [[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]], mistakenly believing they had killed Vector. Vector then reappeared alive and well, and led his teammates in a strategic retreat.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #53; ''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> With the U-Foes, Ironclad later attacked a New York hospital in search of Charles Little Sky (who was now known as [[Portal (comics)|Portal]]), where they battled [[Darkhawk]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and Captain America.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #6</ref>

Ironclad, along with the other U-Foes were imprisoned in [[the Raft (comics)|the Raft]] when [[Electro]] broke the inmates out. Ironclad was seen fighting Captain America and even threw him up through a hole in the roof, only for Captain America to be rescued by [[Iron Man]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #02</ref>

On the cover of ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1, Mike was identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear to have registered as part of the Super-Human Registration Act.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

Ironclad is later seen as part of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s criminal organization who plan to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Ironclad and the U-Foes are revealed as members of the Initiative's North Carolina team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Exposure to cosmic radiation gave Mike Steel a shiny silver metal form which gives him tremendous durability and resistance to most forms of injury, and also incredible superhuman strength. He can also increase or decrease his own weight, to hover in the air,<ref name="Hulk397">''The Incredible Hulk'' #397 (October 1992)</ref> or crush like a mountain. An influx of cosmic radiation can cause a temporary loss of his control of his density, causing Ironclad to increase in density until he sinks into the ground. Ironclad cannot resume his normal human form at will.

Ironclad is a good hand-to-hand combatant. He is also an experienced pilot and rocketry expert.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ironclad (alongside the other U-Foes members) appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. In the episode "Hulk Vs. The World," a blood-containing red vial labeled with the name Ironclad is featured. In the episode "Gamma World" Pt. 1, he alongside the U-Foes attack the Avengers in the Cube, and attacks Thor. He is defeated by a combined strike from Mjolnir and Captain America's shield.

===Video games===
* Ironclad is a boss and recurring enemy in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' video game voiced by [[Mitch Lewis]]. However, the character acts almost exactly like the Hulk, but is programed to constantly use a shield, and is only open for attack when dazed. The similarities allow Players to dress Hulk as him as an extra. Ironclad, like the rest of the U-Foes, sometimes appear randomly in between missions to cause panic. However, in at least some experiences, the U-Foes seem more interested in attacking the area, and will only attack Hulk if he approaches. Ironclad can be unlocked by having one of the U-Foes members attack him by accident.
