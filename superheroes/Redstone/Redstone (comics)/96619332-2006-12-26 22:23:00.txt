'''Redstone''' is the name of two characters from [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Various incarnations of Redstone==
The first '''Redstone''' is a [[superhero]] who is a native to the alternate universe of the original [[Squadron Supreme]].  Unlike most of the characters created for the original ''Squadron Supreme'' series, Redstone, a later creation, has no [[DC Comics]] counterpart.

The second '''Redstone''' is a super-powered [[serial killer]] from the reality of the ''[[Supreme Power]]'' series. Though he shares the same name as the first, his powers in this universe are derived from elements of Hyperion's alien DNA and mimic most - but not all - of his alien abilities.  

=== Squadron Supreme ===
{{Spoiler}}
An [[Apache]] named Redstone was a part of ''[[Nighthawk (comics)|Nighthawk]]'s Redeemers'' in the Squadron Supreme of [[Earth-712]]. Like the [[Greek gods|Greek god]] [[Antaeus]], he drew his power from the Earth, and lost much of his super-strength when not in contact with the ground. Redstone died in ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' after leaving Earth.

=== Supreme Power ===
The first [[supervillain]] to appear in the ''[[Supreme Power]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]], Redstone is what the US government has dubbed a "Power." In essence, he is on par with the likes of Hyperion and Power Princess, but he does not yet exhibit the degree of control over his powers Hyperion possesses, though it can be inferred that this is Redstone's personal choice.

Michael Redstone was in military prison introduced as a renegade soldier and [[serial killer]] who murdered six women, five primarily, though not exclusively, black [[prostitutes]] and one ''Sergeant Alicia James''. The murder of the female sergeant, who outranked him, was said to demonstrate "a [[psychology]] that loathes women who have any amount of power over him." A secret government group had been grafting a retro-virus based on [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]]'s DNA to military convicts who volunteered as human [[guinea pig]]s. Redstone had been one such volunteer.

After getting his powers (super strength, invulnerability, and "[[heat vision|Flash vision]]"; notably, he does not gain Hyperion's ability to fly), he and an unknown number of other test subjects escaped. Redstone resumed killing prostitutes, again mostly black women, but this time in greater numbers, attracting [[Nighthawk (Supreme Power)|Nighthawk]]'s attention. Due to the detective work of Nighthawk and the assistance of Hyperion and Blur, Redstone was apprehended again. The team used a substance that blocked Redstone's nose and mouth, showing Redstone that he still needs oxygen to survive. 

Dr. Spectrum arrived at the scene after the fighting, to take Redstone into custody and to a prison originally made for Hyperion. General Richard Alexander makes a deal with Redstone, and has him dropped into an unknown country whose government is being what the United States considers ''difficult''. Redstone's mission is simple: kill as many people he can, in order to cause mass panic and governmental instability.

Since then, he has seemingly escaped government control and was last seen hiring out his services to the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], whose intent is to counterbalance the superhuman weapons threat presented by the Squadron Supreme; subsequently, he tracked down Hyperion himself, and confronted him in [[Los Angeles]].

{{spoiler-about|Squadron Supreme Vol.II: Turnabout (#7-12)}} 

In the latest issue of Squadron Supreme, Redstone and Hyperion fight resulting in the deaths of many innocent bystanders. Hyperion attempts to hurl Redstone into orbit but Redstone has prepared a nuclear weapon stolen from a submarine that had sunk in the [[Norwegian Sea]]. The bomb will explode if it does not recive a signal from him every 5 minutes. Redstone insists Hyperion let himself be beaten to death or the device will be triggered. Hyperion is blinded by Redstone's Flash vision and Redstone's rampage takes the lives of many citizens. [[Zarda]] arrives to save Hyperion but he insists she dispose of the bomb (which she does, possibly at the cost of her own life). Finally [[Blur (comics)|Blur]] forcibly recruits Nighthawk to aid in the battle and the three heroes confront Redstone. The story is to be continued.
