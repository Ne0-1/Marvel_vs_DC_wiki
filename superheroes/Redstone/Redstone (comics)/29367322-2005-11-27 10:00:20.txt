'''Redstone''' is a [[superhero]] in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]].  He is possibly based on [[DC Comics]] [[Geo-Force]].

== Squadron Supreme ==
Part of ''Nighthawk's Redeemers'' in the Squadron
== Supreme Power ==
Real Name: Michael Redstone

Alias(es): General Richard Alexander

He is the first [[supervillian]] to appear in the ''[[Supreme Power]]'' universe that does have any [[super-human]] abilities, like Super-strength, invunerability, eye-lasers and weaknesses like Pathological serial killer, needs to breath.

Michael Redstone is a [[super-human]] [[serial killer]] who preys on black [[prostitutes]]. Created using a retro virus based on [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]]'s DNA. A section within the government had been grafting the virus to military convicts who volunteered as human guinea pigs. Redstone was in military prison introduced as a renegade killer soldier who murdered six women, five prostitutes and one ''Sergeant Alicia James''. The murder of the female sergeant, who outranked him, showed a psychology that loathed women who had any amount of power over him.

After getting his powers (super strength, invunerability and eye-emitted radiation beams), he and unknown amount of other experiments escaped. Redstone restarted his penchant for killing prostitutes but this time in greater numbers. He is caught due to detective work of Nighthawk and the assistance of Hyperion and Blur. The team used a substance that blocked Redstone's nose and mouth meaning Redstone needs oxygen to survive (a similar plot device was used by Straczyski in "Rising Stars" to explain how one can kill an invunerable super person). 

Dr. Spectrum comes to the scene and takes him into custody and to a prison originally made for Hyperion. General Richard Alexander makes a deal with Redstone, has him dropped into an unknown country whose government is being ''difficult''. Redstone's mission is to kill as many people he can and making the government fall or at least unstable.
