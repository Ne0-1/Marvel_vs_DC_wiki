'''Percival "Pinky" Pinkerton''' is a [[fictional character]], a soldier in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]]. The character's first appearance was in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' vol. 1 #8, in which he replaced Jonathan [[Junior Juniper]] who was killed in issue #4.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Pinky Pinkerton''' was an English member of the original [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] who fought alongside the team during [[World War II]].  [[Percival Pinkerton]] was a [[British Army]] [[commando]] and [[gentleman ranker]] who used an [[umbrella]] as a weapon along with his [[Thompson submachine gun]].  Pinkerton had served alongside the unit commander Captain Samuel [[Happy Sam Sawyer]] prior to Pearl Harbor when both were with the British Commandos. Pinkerton wore [[Essex Regiment]] shoulder flashes. 

Though never explained in the series, Pinkerton wore a [[Carlist]] [[Requetés]] type red [[beret]] with a yellow [[tassel]] with his [[Battle Dress]] that may have involved service in the [[Spanish Civil War]].  Pinkerton also wore his battle dress with an open collar with scarf rather than having the buttoned collar of a British other rank. Along with Cpl Timothy [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and [[Dino Manelli]], he helped organize the ''Deadly Dozen (comics)''.  

In issue #23 ("The Man Who Failed") of ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'', Percy’s older brother, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Pinkerton appeared.  The story, set in [[Burma]] revealed that Pinkerton came from an English family with a long tradition of service as officers to the Crown.  Why Pinkerton never accepted a commission was explained as his living a [[playboy]] womanising life style during his initial military training that led him to be unable to catch up with his studies and resigining.<ref>Lee, Stan ''The Man Who Failed'' #23 ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos''</ref> 

In the first ''Sgt Fury'' Annual taking place with the Howlers (Howling Commandos) being called back to service in the [[Korean War]], Pinkerton was a [[sergeant]] as were all the other former private soldiers of the unit.  At the time of their [[1966]] [[Vietnam War]] mission (''Annual #3'', ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'') Pinkerton was managing a [[Playboy Club]] in [[London]].  

As with several other of the Howling Commandos, Pinkerton joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

==Pinkerton and the Essex Regiment==
The [[battalion]] that Lt. Colonel Pinkerton led was referred to as the "Burma Dragons".  During the [[Burma Campaign]] the [[Essex Regiment]] were part of the [[Chindits]].  A famous member of the regiment was [[Arthur Ernest Percival]] who was commissioned into the regiment in 1916 and achieved fame as the Regimental [[Intelligence Officer]] where the [[Irish Republican Army]] put a price on his head.  He later commanded the Imperial Garrison at [[Singapore]], surrendering his command to the Japanese in 1942.

==Ancestry==
Three ancestors of Percy were mentioned in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.  These include:
*'''Pinkerton''' who fought in the battle of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815.
*A Pinkerton who survived the winter at [[Valley Forge]] in 1777-1778
*An ancestor who fought during [[World War I]].

==Character basis==

In a 2002 interview with the [[Traditional Values Coalition]]'s executive director [[Andrea Sheldon Lafferty]] about the latest incarnation of the comic book character of the [[Rawhide Kid]] who was now homosexual, [[Stan Lee]] said, "years ago [a comic book] that I did, ''Sgt Fury'', ...had a gay character.  One member of the [[platoon]] was called, I think, Percy Pinkerton.  He was gay. We didn't make a big issue of it.  In this comic book that I read, the word gay wasn't even used.  He's just a colorful character who follows his own different drummer.  He follows a different beat.  But we're not proselytizing for gayness".<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/13/cf.opinion.rawhide.kid/ CNN.com - Marvel Comics unveils gay gunslinger - Dec. 13, 2002<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

This contradicted the Sgt Fury [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] with Pinkerton as a [[playboy]] in issue #23.  Artist [[Dick Ayers]] said in an interview that [[Stan Lee]] told him to base Pinkerton on [[David Niven]]<ref>[http://home.gate.net/~images/ww2a1. Page Not Found<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.  This idea seems logical as one of the Howling Commandos, [[Dino Manelli]] was based on [[Dean Martin]] who not only had a movie and later television career, but had a former [[sidekick]] named [[Jerry Larkin]] based on [[Jerry Lewis]] who was killed in issue #63. Martin had attracted praise for his performance in the [[war film]] ''[[The Young Lions]]''. Niven was familiar from his role in ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' where he played a [[gentleman ranker]] who refused to take responsibility.  Another influence may have been [[John Steed]] of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' who always carried and frequently used an [[umbrella]] in fight scenes.  The time of Pinkerton's appearance in the comic was during the [[British invasion]] that hit the United States in [[1964]], and Marvel may have been trying to appeal to British readers of its comics.

Sgt Fury also had an Australian soldier character in a few issues named "Rolfe Harrison" though he resembled the actor [[Rod Taylor]] more than the singer [[Rolf Harris]].  Harrison appeared in both "Sgt Fury" and ''[[Leatherneck Raiders|Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders]]''; he never joined any of the teams as a regular character.
