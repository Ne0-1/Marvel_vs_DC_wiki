'''Gizmo''' (also known as '''Mikron O’Jeneus''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] from [[DC Comics]].  He was created by [[George Perez]] and [[Marv Wolfman]], and he first appeared in ''[[Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'' #3 (January 1981) as a founding member of the [[Fearsome Five]], a supervillain team that frequently fought the Teen Titans and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].

A bald [[dwarf]] who flies around on a jet pack, Gizmo is a [[genius]] inventor who can turn seemingly innocuous objects like [[vacuum cleaner]]s into dangerous [[weapon]]s.  (His given name, Mikron, has the same origin as ''microchip'', and Jeneus is a purposeful misspelling of ''genius''.) Gizmo created a corporation, Gizmos, Inc., which supplied technology to various persons, including criminals.  Hoping to increase his wealth, Gizmo joined the Fearsome Five through an [[advertisement|ad]] placed in the ''Underworld Star'', a criminal underground [[newspaper|paper]], by the [[psychopathic]] criminal [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Doctor Light]].

After a number of unsuccessful conflicts with the Teen Titans, (and [[Superman]] in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #430) Gizmo went straight for a while, and took a job at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], until his former Fearsome Five teammate [[Psimon]], after having been seemingly killed by his teammates, resurfaced looking for revenge, and shrank Gizmo to microscopic size.  Years later, Gizmo found a way to revert to his normal size, and took up a life of crime once again, partnering with his former teammate, [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]].

In a storyline in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Dr. Sivana]] gathered Gizmo and the others, and put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short selling|short sell]] [[Lexcorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building, and destroying two other Lexcorp properties.  At the latter of the two, a [[microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].  After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] facility near [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[California]].  When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again.  Sivana used the money he made from the scheme to purchase a [[tropical]] island off the coast of [[Thailand]] to use as his lair, and the remaining members of the Five were defeated in their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at [[Canada]]. 

Whether the remaining members will take on a new member, find a way to revive Gizmo (as had been done with his teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]]), or change their name to the Fearsome Four (as Sivana sarcastically suggested after killing Gizmo) remains to be seen.

Gizmo appeared in undead form, summoned by [[Brother Blood]] to prevent the Teen Titans from freeing [[Kid Eternity]], in ''Teen Titans'' #31 (2006).

==In other media==
In the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]], Gizmo is a [[recurring character|recurring]] villain from the [[H.I.V.E.|H.I.V.E Academy]]. He is voiced by [[Lauren Tom]] (He was voiced by Tara Strong in "Revved Up" and in "Titans Together"). Gizmo was redesigned into a probably pre-teen kid (as opposed to being a middle-aged dwarf as he was in his comic book form). He works with [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]] and [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] most of the time, although in the episodes "Car Trouble", "Revved Up", "Crash", and "Winner Take All", they were not present. 

Gizmo's main gadget is a harness that can deploy wings, large mechanical spider legs, a device that creates [[holograph]]ic copies of himself, and a technological suit of armor. His knowledge of computers and incredible hacking skills make him a formidable foe for the Titans. He also has a short temper and swears in [[pseudo profanity]]. He hates [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and was able to tell that something was wrong with him when Cyborg went undercover as "Stone" at the H.I.V.E Academy. He later forms The H.I.V.E. Five with the two above, [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]], and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] He was sent with [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Billy Numerous|Billy Numerous]] to capture [[Kole]] and [[Gnarrk]], but failed when Kole turned into a boomerang and severed his spider legs. 

During the final battle of "Titans Together", he was knocked unconscious by a giant hex from the reformed Jinx while trying to escape. [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] placed him in the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]'s freezing machine, taking him out for the rest of the battle.

Gizmo is the only villain (apart from [[Deathstroke|Slade]]) to appear in all five seasons of Teen Titans.

Gizmo has also made several appearances in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]''.  He is the main villain in issue #9.

He is also a [[boss (videogames)|boss]] in both ''[[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]]'' video games.
