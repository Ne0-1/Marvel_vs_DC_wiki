'''Gizmo''' (also known as '''Mikron O’Jeneus''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] from [[DC Comics]].  He was created by [[George Pérez]] and [[Marv Wolfman]], and he first appeared in ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' #3 (January 1981) as a founding member of the [[Fearsome Five]], a supervillain team that frequently fought the Teen Titans and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Gizmo | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 138 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Mikron O'Jeneus===
A bald [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] who flies around on a jet pack, Gizmo is a [[genius]] inventor who can turn seemingly innocuous objects like [[vacuum cleaner]]s into dangerous [[weapon]]s.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Gizmo created a corporation which supplied technology to various persons, including criminals. Hoping to increase his wealth, Gizmo joined the Fearsome Five through an [[advertisement|ad]] placed in the ''Underworld Star'', a criminal underground newsletter, by the [[psychopathic]] criminal [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Doctor Light]].<ref name="dc-fear">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Fearsome Five | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 120  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

After a number of unsuccessful conflicts with the Teen Titans, (and [[Superman]] in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #430) Gizmo went straight for a while, and took a job at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]],<ref name="dc-ency"/> until his former Fearsome Five teammate [[Psimon]], after having been seemingly killed by his teammates, resurfaced looking for revenge, and shrank Gizmo to microscopic size. Years later, Gizmo found a way to revert to his normal size, and took up a life of crime once again, partnering with his former teammate, [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]].

In a storyline in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Dr. Sivana]] gathered Gizmo and the others, and put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short selling|short sell]] [[Lexcorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building, and destroying two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] facility near [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[California]]. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head,<ref name="dc-ency"/> and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. Sivana used the money he made from the scheme to purchase a [[tropical]] island off the coast of [[Thailand]] to use as his lair, and the remaining members of the Five were defeated in their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at [[Canada]].

Whether the remaining members will take on a new member, find a way to revive Gizmo (as had been done with his teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]]), or change their name to the Fearsome Four (as Sivana sarcastically suggested after killing Gizmo) remains to be seen.

Gizmo appeared in undead form, summoned by [[Brother Blood]] to prevent the Teen Titans from freeing [[Kid Eternity]], in ''Teen Titans'' #31 (2006). In ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'' #120-121 (2008), Gizmo was reanimated by the geniuses at [[Manitech Research & Development]], a technology company located in [[Platinum Flats]]. He disposed of their C.E.O and earned his seat on the [[Silicon Syndicate]], a sinister group of high-tech criminals. Gizmo retained most of his brain function, but is still missing his eye and is partially decomposed.

===O'Jeneus===
In ''DC Special: Cyborg'' issue 5 a new Gizmo debuted, the son of the first Gizmo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He is based visually on the animated Gizmo. After graduating from the villainous [[H.I.V.E.|H.I.V.E Academy]], the diminutive teen followed in his father's footsteps and became the second Gizmo, a high-tech super-thief. He battles [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] as a member of [[Mr. Orr]]'s "Cyborg Revenge Squad."

==Powers and abilities==
Gizmo is capable of creating unbelievable weaponry by transforming one machine into another. In his tiny hands, using state-of-the-art technology, an ordinary vacuum cleaner, for example, can easily be converted into a deadly, unstoppable tank.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]], Gizmo (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]] in earlier appearances and by [[Tara Strong]] in "Revved Up" and in "Titans Together") is a [[recurring character|recurring]] villain from the [[H.I.V.E.|H.I.V.E Academy]]. Gizmo was redesigned into a probably pre-teen kid (as opposed to being a middle-aged dwarf as he was in his comic book form which was later adapted in the comics as the son of the original Gizmo). He works with [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]] and [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] most of the time, although in the episodes "Car Trouble", "Revved Up", "Crash", and "Winner Take All", he is seen conducting solo acts. Gizmo's main gadget is a harness that can deploy wings, large mechanical spider legs, a device that creates [[holograph]]ic copies of himself, and a technological suit of armor. His knowledge of computers and incredible hacking skills make him a formidable foe for the Titans (though constructing a Level 4 Containment Field is hard, even for him). He also has a short temper and swears in [[pseudo profanity]] ("crud" and "snot" are his most frequently used terms). He has a special enmity with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and was able to tell that something was wrong with him when Cyborg went undercover as "Stone" at the H.I.V.E. Academy. He later forms The H.I.V.E. Five with Jinx, Mammoth, [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]], and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] He was sent with [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Billy Numerous|Billy Numerous]] to capture [[Kole]] and [[Gnarrk]], but failed when Kole turned into a boomerang and severed his spider legs. During the final battle of "Titans Together", he was knocked unconscious by a giant hex from the reformed Jinx while trying to escape. [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] placed him in the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]'s freezing machine, taking him out for the rest of the battle. Gizmo is the only villain to appear in all five seasons of Teen Titans (as opposed to [[Deathstroke|Slade]], who is seen only once in the third season as an illusion and as a Slade-bot in the last season). Gizmo has also made several appearances in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]''.  He is the main villain in issue #9.

===Video games===
* Gizmo is a [[boss (videogames)|boss]] in both ''[[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]]'' video games.
