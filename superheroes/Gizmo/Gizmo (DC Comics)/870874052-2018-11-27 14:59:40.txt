A bald [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] who flies around on a jet pack, Gizmo is a [[genius]] inventor who can turn seemingly innocuous objects like [[vacuum cleaner]]s into dangerous weapons.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Gizmo created a corporation which supplied technology to various people, including criminals. Hoping to increase his wealth, Gizmo joined the Fearsome Five through an [[advertisement|ad]] placed in the ''Underworld Star'', a criminal underground newsletter, by the psychopathic criminal [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]].<ref name="dc-fear">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Fearsome Five | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 120  | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

After a number of unsuccessful conflicts with the Teen Titans, (and [[Superman]] in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #430) Gizmo went straight for a while, and took a job at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]],<ref name="dc-ency"/> until his former Fearsome Five teammate [[Psimon]], after having been seemingly killed by his teammates, resurfaced looking for revenge, and shrank Gizmo to microscopic size. Years later, Gizmo found a way to revert to his normal size, and took up a life of crime once again, partnering with his former teammate, [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]].

In a storyline in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Doctor Sivana]] gathered Gizmo and the others, and put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short (finance)|short sell]] [[LexCorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building, and destroying two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's nuclear missile facility near [[Joshua Tree, California]]. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head,<ref name="dc-ency"/> and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. Sivana used the money he made from the scheme to purchase a tropical island off the coast of [[Thailand]] to use as his lair, and the remaining members of the Five were defeated in their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at Canada.

Whether the remaining members will take on a new member, find a way to revive Gizmo (as had been done with his teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]]), or change their name to the Fearsome Four (as Sivana sarcastically suggested after killing Gizmo) remains to be seen.

Gizmo appeared in undead form, summoned by [[Brother Blood]] to prevent the Teen Titans from freeing [[Kid Eternity]], in ''Teen Titans'' #31 (2006). In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #120-121 (2008), Gizmo was reanimated by the geniuses at Macintech Research & Development, a technology company located in [[Platinum Flats]]. He disposed of their C.E.O and earned his seat on the Silicon Syndicate, a sinister group of high-tech criminals. Gizmo retained most of his brain function, but is still missing his eye and is partially decomposed.

===O'Jeneus===
In ''DC Special: Cyborg'' issue 5 a new Gizmo debuted where he is the son of the first Gizmo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He is based visually on the animated Gizmo. After graduating from the villainous [[H.I.V.E.|H.I.V.E Academy]], the diminutive teen followed in his father's footsteps and became the second Gizmo, a high-tech super-thief. He battles [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] as a member of [[Mr. Orr]]'s "Cyborg Revenge Squad."

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a version of Gizmo first appears a member of the [[Fearsome Five]]. The group appears with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], which is allied with the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]].<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #29. DC Comics.</ref> He is sent with the other members of the Fearsome Five, along with [[Doctor Psycho]] and [[Hector Hammond]], on a mission in which he is defeated by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the [[Metal Men]].
===DC Rebirth===
In ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Gizmo appeared as part of the Fearsome Five. <ref>Titans #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gizmo is capable of creating unbelievable weaponry by transforming one machine into another. In his tiny hands using state-of-the-art technology, something like an ordinary vacuum cleaner can easily be converted into a deadly, unstoppable tank.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==In other media==
===Television===
* In [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'']], Gizmo is a [[recurring character|recurring]] villain from the [[H.I.V.E.|H.I.V.E Academy]]. He was voiced by [[Lauren Tom]] in earlier appearances and by [[Tara Strong]] in the episodes "Revved Up" and "Titans Together". This version of Gizmo, while still short and bald, is a child with a trouble making ego. He considers himself Cyborg's rival due to their shared knowledge in technology. 
* Gizmo appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', with Lauren Tom reprising her voice role. A running gag in the series is that many characters describe him as being much younger than he really is due to his diminutive stature and youthful appearance, much to his chagrin.

===Video games===
* Gizmo appears as a [[boss (videogames)|boss]] in the 2005 video game ''[[Teen Titans (2005 video game)|Teen Titans]]'' and the 2006 video game ''[[Teen Titans (2006 video game)|Teen Titans]]'', voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].
* Gizmo appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' as part of the "Sons of Trigon" [[downloadable content]], voiced by Michael Wollner.
* Gizmo appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced again by Lauren Tom.
