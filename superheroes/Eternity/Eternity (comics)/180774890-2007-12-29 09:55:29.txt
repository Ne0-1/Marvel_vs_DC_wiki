'''Eternity''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A [[cosmic entity]] created by scripter-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], Eternity is first mentioned in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #134 (July 1965) and [[first appearance|first appears]] in #138 (Nov. 1965).

==Fictional character biography==
Eternity is an abstract entity representing the totality of all existence in the universe. The entity is part of a small cosmic pantheon that represents the three essential forces in the [[Marvel Universe]]: equity, necessity, and vengeance. In turn, these three essential forces are the trinity that comprise the [[Living Tribunal]], a singular being with three faces that governs the [[multiverse]], or sum of all universes.<ref name="silversurfer31">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989)</ref> 

In the [[Earth-616|main continuity]] of the [[Marvel Universe]], Eternity is one of the three beings represented on one of the faces of the Living Tribunal, with each face representing one of the essential forces.<ref name="silversurfer31" />

* Equity - [[Galactus]]
* Necessity - Eternity
* Vengeance - [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]

Eternity and the other cosmic beings are surpassed by the Living Tribunal.

Eternity has also spawned several "children", or concepts that became separate, independent entities. These are Empathy, Eulogy, Expediency, Entropy, Epiphany, Enmity and [[Eon (comics)|Eon]] - although the last was eventually killed and replaced in turn by the concept [[Epoch (comics)|Epoch]].<ref>''Quasar'' #23 (June 1991)</ref>

Eternity typically only manifests when there is an imminent threat to the universe, such as the mystical, otherdimensional dictator [[Dormammu]],<ref>''Strange Tales''#130-146 (March 1965 - July 1966)</ref> or the highly powerful, death-obsessed megalomaniac [[Thanos]].<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991)</ref><ref>''Thanos'' #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April 2004)</ref>

During the cosmic trial of [[Reed Richards]] (also known as [[Mr. Fantastic]] of the [[superhero]] team the [[Fantastic Four]] ), Eternity allows a vast number of [[extraterrestrial]] onlookers to momentarily become one with the universe.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #262 (Jan. 1984)</ref>

[[Dr. Strange]], this universe's Sorcerer Supreme, is the first of Earth's superheroes to have contact with Eternity.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966)</ref> 

==Powers and abilities==
Being an abstract entity, Eternity has no physical body, but can warp surrounding space and matter into a humanoid form that can be perceived by lesser beings. Eternity can also form bodies from living fractuals from another plane of existence known as the Dimension of Manifestations.<ref>''Quasar''  #37 (Aug. 1992)</ref>

Eternity seems to be able to appear whenever and wherever he wishes, regardless of circumstances and always on his own terms. As the embodiment of the complete physical cosmos, there is little that can personally endanger him below the scale of a threat to the entire universe or multiverse. He can bestow universal enlightenment on vast crowds. He can be aware of any events that attract his interests regardless of location (omniscience). His interventions in the Marvel universes are fewer than his cosmic brethren, as his duties are concerned with in the affairs of mortals, but they are alway total and absolute. The only limits of his capabilities would appear to be volition, deciding where to act and when to let free will take its course. Thus, he only acts when anything less than his involvement would endanger the multiverse. The exception to this is when he acts out of justice in matters involving his brethren entities.

==In other media==
Eternity makes a cameo appearance while observing [[Dark Phoenix]] in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated TV series]].  Eternity appears semi-regularly in the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' animated TV series.
