'''Eternity''' is one of the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was mentioned in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #134 and first appeared in issue #138 (1965), where his existence was determined by [[Doctor Strange]].

==History==
Eternity came into existence when the universe was formed - he has been described as both the embodiment of all life in the universe, and also the embodiment of all time, while his sister and counterpart, [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]], represents all space. They have three other siblings: [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]], and [[Galactus]]. His children are [[Empathy]], [[Eulogy]], [[wikt:expedient|Expediency]], [[Entropy]], Epiphany, and [[Enmity]]. Collectively they are known as the seven Friendless (commonly believed to be a reference to [[The Endless (comics)|the Endless]], a set of characters created by [[Neil Gaiman]] in the [[DC Universe]] and used throughout his works). It has been speculated that the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] are also the children of Eternity, as was the former entity [[Eon (comics)|Eon]]. Through Eon, Eternity has one grandchild, [[Epoch (comics)|Epoch]].  Another child named Era appeared in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] series, but since this series was set in the future and Era has not appeared in present times Marvel Comics nor any mention of Epoch having other siblings, Era doesn't yet exist in the current Marvel Universe. As one of the forces of reality, Eternity remains one of the most powerful and nigh-[[omnipotent]] characters in the Marvel Universe.

Although the complete activities of Eternity are unknown, it is known to appear when threatened, such as for example when [[Thanos]] assembled the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].

At one point, Eternity battled Dormammu when Dormammu attempted to conquer the universe.  Eternity typically involves himself in great cosmic threats to its existence.  However, due to its omniscience it does not intervene in a direct way since it already knows the outcome.

He is, along with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and [[Galactus]], one of three fundamental entities in the Marvel Comics Universe (the [[Living Tribunal]] is further above them all and maintains the cosmic balance of power). The absence of Galactus would allow the emergence of the antithesis of Eternity, [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], the universal embodiment of destruction, and also create an imbalance between Eternity and Death that would result in the eventual collapse of the entire universe.  

Also, he and each of his counterparts across the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] are guarded by the  [[Captain Universe]] of their respective realities.

==Powers and abilities==
Eternity is one of the most powerful beings within the [[Marvel Universe]].  As the living embodiment of the universe and an abstract force, Eternity's power surpasses that of all known physical beings including the [[Elders of the Universe]], mystical entities who rule over or embody their own lesser realms or dimensions (e.g. [[Agamotto]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Dormammu]], [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]) and the most powerful of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].  Eternity's power is beyond that of even most other known abstract entities including [[Master Order]], [[Lord Chaos]], Mistress Love, Sire Hate and [[Galactus]].  The only known beings who can potentially match Eternity's power are  his fellow abstracts who, along with Eternity himself, form the cosmic compass: [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]], and [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]]. The only exception to this fact is a fully satiated and charged Galactus, a state in which--as admitted by Eternity--Galactus is Eternity's equal. The only object known to have matched Eternity's power is the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]. The only known beings who wield power surpassing that of Eternity are the Living Tribunal and the unknown entity he represents who is presumably the creator of the Marvel Universe.  Also, any object willed by the one above the Living Tribunal such as the [[Heart of the Universe]] used once by [[Thanos|Thanos of Titan]] can surpass him.

Eternity possesses the ability to control matter and energy for any purpose on a level beyond that of most other known beings.  As the living embodiment of the universe he knows all that has happened, is happening, or can happen and is wherever life and time exist, although wielders of [[Infinity Gems]] are beyond his sight. Eternity will often act indirectly to manipulate events to his favor.  Eternity will usually only act directly if the entire universe is threatened.

Being an abstract being Eternity has no actual physical body.  To interact on a physical level Eternity can form bodies by warping the space and matter around he is manifesting to form a body or use the living fractuals from the Dimension of Manifestations, a dimension where living fractals can form bodies for beings of sufficient power to ease communication.  These bodies when used represent an aspect of the totality of Eternity.  It is debated whether or not these "m-bodies" have access to all of Eternity's power or only a limited portion Eternity bestows upon it.  There is no definitive evidence that clearly proves or disproves either view.

==Appearances In Other Media==
Eternity made a cameo in [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]] adaption of The [[Dark Phoenix]] Saga.  He was shown reacting to energy given off by Phoenix.

His major animated appearance would be in The [[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]].  He and his sister Infinity first appeared in episode 4 '''The Planet Of Doctor Moreau'''.  From that episode, they would observe the actions of The Silver Surfer as they wanted to recruit him for a mission.  Sometimes they would feel confident in their choice, and sometimes they would feel doubt.

[[Watchers (comics)|The Watcher]] would introduce The Silver Surfer to them in the Season 1 finale '''The End Of Eternity, Part 1'''.  [[Thanos]] created the means to reverse time and space, which would allow him to destroy the universe in order to please [[Lady Chaos]].  The Surfer is chosen as he was immune to the changes of the cosmos (Due to the power cosmic).  The episode ends with the destruction of the universe.
*Eight more episodes were written, unproduced (including '''The End Of Eternity, Part 2''').  Only Thanos, Lady Chaos and The Silver Surfer survived the destruction of the universe.  During the battle, the Surfer uses his power to restore the universe as well as recreating it.

As a result, some of the people and places have changed (Such as Thanos seeking peace rather than destruction).  Only Eternity, Infinity and The Silver Surfer remember the former history of the universe.

They would appear one more time in the 8th scripted episode '''Down To Earth, Part 3'''.  During the three parter, The Surfer tries to enforce peace to the citizens of Earth.  Part 3 has Galactus returning to devour Earth (Led there by his new herald, [[Terrax]]).  Only when the Silver Surfer repents, does Eternity and Infinity aid him (and The [[Fantastic Four]]) in ending Galactus' threat over the planet.
