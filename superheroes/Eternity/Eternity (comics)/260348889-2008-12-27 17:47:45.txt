'''Eternity''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by scripter-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], the character is first mentioned in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #134 (July 1965) and [[first appearance|first appears]] in issue #138 (Nov. 1965). 

==Fictional character biography==
Eternity is an abstract entity representing the totality of life while his sister [[Infinity (comics)|Infinity]] represents existence, together they represent the space-time continuum and the living force of the universe.<ref>Revealed in ''Quasar'' #19-25 (1991)</ref>  The entity is also part of a small cosmic pantheon that represents the trinity of essential forces in the [[Marvel Universe]], being Equity, Necessity, and Vengeance. These forces are represented by [[Galactus]], Eternity and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], respectively, in the [[Marvel 616|primary Marvel universe]]. In turn, Equity, Necessity, and Vengeance comprise the three faces of the [[Living Tribunal]], a singular being that governs the entire [[multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel multiverse]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #31 (vol. 3, Dec. 1989)</ref> Eternity is surpassed in power and authority only by the Living Tribunal. 

Eternity has also spawned several "children", or concepts that became separate, independent entities. These are Empathy, Eulogy, Expediency, Entropy, Epiphany, Enmity and [[Eon (comics)|Eon]] - although the last was eventually killed and replaced in turn by the concept [[Epoch (Marvel Comics)|Epoch]].<ref>''Quasar'' #23 (June 1991)</ref>

Eternity typically only manifests when there is an imminent threat to the universe, such as the mystical, otherdimensional dictator [[Dormammu]],<ref>''Strange Tales''#130-146 (March 1965 - July 1966)</ref> or the Titan [[Thanos]].<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991)</ref><ref>''Thanos'' #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April 2004)</ref> Eternity has been threatened by the entity [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] on two occasions, but in both instances was aided by [[Dr. Strange]] and his mentor, the [[Ancient One]]. <ref>''Doctor Strange'' #180 - 182 (vol. 1, May - Jul (bi-monthly) 1969) and ''Doctor Strange'' #10 - 13 (vol. 2, Oct - Apr (bi-monthly) 1974 - 1975)</ref>

During the cosmic trial of [[Reed Richards]] (also known as [[Mr. Fantastic]] of the [[superhero]] team the [[Fantastic Four]] ), Eternity allows a vast number of [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] onlookers to momentarily become one with the universe, thus allowing them to understand that Reed Richards was right to save [[Galactus]] as the Devourer of Worlds is a vital part of the grand scheme.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #262 (Jan. 1984)</ref>

During [[JLA/Avengers]] he met [[Kismet (DC Comics)|Kismet]] and the two fell in love.  They were then kidnapped by Kronas who used their connections to their universes to destroy both.  After the Crisis was averted the two sadly parted ways.

==Powers and abilities==
Eternity is a cosmic concept, as such he has no physical body, but can warp surrounding space and matter into a manifestation that can be perceived by lesser beings, and possesses the ability to manipulate the universe and that within it to achieve virtually any effect he desires, he also exists everywhere within the universe simultaneously.  Eternity can also form bodies from living fractuals from another plane of existence known as the Dimension of Manifestations.<ref>''Quasar''  #37 (Aug. 1992)</ref>

* Eternity makes a [[cameo appearance]] in an episode of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]].
