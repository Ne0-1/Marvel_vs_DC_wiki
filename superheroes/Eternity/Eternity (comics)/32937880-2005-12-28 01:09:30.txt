'''Eternity''' is one of the [[fictional character|fictional]] cosmic entities in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was mentioned in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #134 and first appeared in issue #138 (1965), where his existence was determined by [[Doctor Strange]].

Eternity came into existence when the universe was formed and spontaneously assumed the collective consciousness of all things living in the universe.  He is the incarnation of time as his sister [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]] represents space. They have two other siblings: [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. His children are Empathy, Eulogy, Expediency, Entropy, Epiphany and Enmity. Collectively they are known as the seven Friendless (Commonly believed to be a reference to [[the Endless]], a set of characters created by [[Neil Gaiman]] in the [[DC Universe]] and used throughout his works). It has been speculated that the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] are also the children of Eternity, as was the former entity Eon. Through Eon, Eternity has one grandchild, Epoch.  Another child named Era appeared in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] series, but since this series was set in the future and Era has not appeared in present times Marvel Comics nor has there been a mention of Epoch having other silbings Era does not exist in the current Marvel Universe. As one of the forces of reality, he remains one of the most powerful and nigh-[[omnipotent]] characters in the Marvel Universe.

Although the complete activities of Eternity are unknown, it is known to appear when threatened, such as for example when [[Thanos]] assembled the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].

He is, along with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and [[Galactus]], one of three fundamental entities in the Marvel Comics Universe (the [[Living Tribunal]] is further above them all and maintains the cosmic balance of power). The absence of Galactus would allow the emergence of the antithesis of Eternity, [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]].
