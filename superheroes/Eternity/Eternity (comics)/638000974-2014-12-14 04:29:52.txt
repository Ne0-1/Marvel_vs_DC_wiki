'''Eternity''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the ''de facto'' leader of the abstract entities collectively known as the [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|Cosmic Powers of the Marvel Universe]].

Created by scripter-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], the character is first mentioned in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #134 (July 1965) and [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (Nov. 1965). 

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character has appeared in four decades of Marvel continuity and appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[trading cards]] and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==
Eternity debuted in an epic 17-issue storyline in the ongoing feature "[[Doctor Strange]]" in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #130-146 (March 1965 - July 1966).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/20192/ ''Strange Tales'' #146] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]: "Indexer Notes: Part 17 of 17"</ref> The character was first mentioned in the 10-page story "Earth Be My Battleground" in ''Strange Tales'' #134 (July 1965), and first seen in the 10-page story "If Eternity Should Fail" in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (Nov. 1965).<ref name=st134>[http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/ ''Strange Tales'' #134] at the Grand Comics Database: "Indexer Notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in STRANGE TALES #138 (November 1965)"</ref> 

Following the publication's retitling as ''Doctor Strange'', the character returned in issues #180-182 (May-July 1969), and thereafter continued to appear in stories that were [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic]] in scope, including in ''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #10-13 (Oct. 1974 - April 1975); ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #92 (Feb. 1981); and a story by writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #262 (Jan. 1984) that attracted controversy. At the conclusion of that story, Eternity validated the existence of another cosmic character, [[Galactus]]. [[Howard University]] Professor of Literature Marc Singer stated Byrne used the character Eternity as a means to "justify planetary-scale genocide."<ref>[http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005911.html "Byrne's Fantastic Four"]</ref> 

Eternity guest starred in ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #6-7 (Dec. 1984 - Jan. 1985); ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #6 & 10 (Dec. 1987, April 1988) and with Marvel's cosmic hierarchy in the limited series ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991), and in its sequel, ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1992). The character played a pivotal role in limited series ''[[Avengers Infinity]]'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2000). Major revelations about the character appeared in a storyline in ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #19-25 (Feb.-Aug. 1991). Other appearances, again in storylines that featured a cosmic theme, included ''[[Infinity Abyss]]'' #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002); and ''Defenders'' vol. 3, #1-5 (Sept. 2005 - Jan. 2006). 

Eternity has also appeared in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] titles ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #32 (April 1982); ''[[Marvel: The End]]'' #1-6 (May 2003 - Aug. 2003); and  ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #1-4 (Sept. 2003 - May 2004).

==Fictional character biography==
Eternity is first encountered by [[Doctor Strange]], who seeks the entity out when his master the [[Ancient One]] is attacked by former pupil [[Baron Mordo]]. After a series of battles with Mordo and his minions, and discovering that arch-foe [[Dormammu]] is secretly backing Mordo, Strange finds and speaks with Eternity. The entity advises Strange that he is capable of defeating his foes without aid, and Strange wins a duel with Dormammu (who is ultimately defeated by Eternity) and thwarts an attempt at [[sabotage]] in his [[Sanctum Sanctorum]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #130-146 (March 1965 - July 1966)</ref>

On [[New Year's Eve]], the entity is [[kidnap]]ped by Doctor Strange's foe [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], who after causing time distortions that allow beings such as [[dinosaur]]s and [[barbarian]]s to appear in [[New York City]], appears before Strange and his aide and sometime lover [[Clea]]. Nightmare challenges the mystic to attempt to rescue Eternity, and after accepting, Strange enters Nightmare's Dream World. After an extended series of battles and a temporary defeat, Strange successfully recruits the [[X-Men]] foe the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] to stop Nightmare from merging his realm with Earth, and together they free Eternity. The entity then banishes Nightmare while [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] restore reality.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #180 - 182 (May - July 1969)</ref>

The entity is aided by superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], who locate three missing fragments of its being and convincing them to rejoin with Eternity.<ref>''Defenders'' #92 (Feb. 1981)</ref> 

Eternity is also summoned to the trial of [[Fantastic Four]] member [[Mister Fantastic]], who is accused of saving the life of fellow [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]]. Eternity allows all present to momentarily possess "[[Omniscience|cosmic awareness]]", thereby allowing them to understand that Galactus is a vital part of the universe, despite the continued extinction of entire species.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #262 (Jan. 1984)</ref>

During a series of extended battles between cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] and the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] (the [[Incarnation|avatar]] of the entity [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]), Eternity is revealed to have a "twin" entity - [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]], with the pair representing the space-time continuum and the living force of the universe.<ref>''Quasar'' #19 - 25 (Feb. - Aug. 1991)</ref>

The character appears with the entire cosmic hierarchy (eventually revealed to be "[[retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into an [[Incarnation|avatar]] of the entity<ref name="Quasar #37 Aug. 1992">''Quasar'' #37 (Aug. 1992)</ref>) during an encounter with the entity the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder]];<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6-7 (Dec.-Jan. 1985)</ref> consults with fellow entity [[Galactus]] when the [[Elders of the Universe]] plan to destroy the latter (to initiate a new [[Big Bang]] and restart the universe).<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #6 (Dec. 1987) & #10 (Apr. 1988)</ref> 

[[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]] was imprisoned inside Eternity and was released when Galactus died.

Together with the cosmic hierarchy Eternity opposes the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] [[Thanos]] when the villain wields the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]], although they are all eventually defeated.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 - 6 (July - Dec. 1991)</ref> Once Thanos is eventually dispatched (courtesy of his own carelessness), Eternity unsuccessfully advises fellow cosmic entity the [[Living Tribunal]] against allowing the [[Infinity Gems]] to be used in conjunction.<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #1 (Feb. 1992)</ref> Eternity develops animosity towards the artificial being [[Adam Warlock]], who the entity encounters on several occasions.<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch''  #9 (Oct. 1992); #11 (Dec. 1992); #14 - 15 (March-April  1993); #19 - 20 (Aug.-Sept. 1993)</ref> 

Eternity also "spawned" several "children", or concepts that became separate, independent entities: Empathy; Eulogy; Expediency; [[Entropy (comics)|Entropy]]; Epiphany; Enmity and [[Eon (comics)|Eon]] (Eon is eventually killed and replaced in turn by the concept [[Epoch (Marvel Comics)|Epoch]]<ref>''Quasar'' #38 (Sep. 1992)</ref>).

Eternity is imprisoned by the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] (the evil [[alter ego]] of Adam Warlock) who attempts to reunite the Infinity Gems for his own use. The villain is eventually defeated when Eternity merges with Infinity and together they strip the Magus of his newfound power.<ref>''Infinity War'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1992)</ref>

Eternity  is also summoned by a contingent of superhero team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' to reason with the cosmic entities the Infinites,<ref>''Avengers Infinity'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2000)</ref> and observes the attempts of Thanos and several of Earth's heroes to defeat several of his [[cloning|clone]]s, who are dedicated to destroying the universe, and in turn Eternity itself.<ref>''Infinity Abyss'' #1 - 2 (Aug. 2002); #3 - 4 (Sep. 2002); #5 - 6 (Oct. 2002)</ref>

Eternity is one of the last beings (together with the [[Living Tribunal]] and Infinity) to be overcome by Thanos when he uses the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Heart of the Universe]] to undo the universe and then remake it minus a fatal flaw.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1-2 (May 2003); #3-4 (June 2003) & #5 (July 2003) & #6 (Aug. 2003)</ref> The character is also affected by the machinations of the villain [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] when the latter engineers a merging of the [[Marvel Universe]] and the [[DC Universe]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers #1 (Sept. 2003) & 3 (Dec. 2003); ''Avengers/JLA'' #2 (Oct. 2003) & 4 (May 2004)</ref> 

The entity's power is stolen by Dormammu and his sister [[Umar (comics)|Umar]] to remake the universe in their image. The pair are opposed by a reuniting of three of the original Defenders (Strange; the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]), with Umar betraying Dormammu and then being defeated in turn. Eternity's power returns to him and reality is restored.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 3, #1 - 5 (Sep. 2005 - Jan. 2006)</ref>

When an alien race's experiments in eternal universal observation cause damage to Eternity, he is narrowly saved by the actions of the [[Fantastic Four]], Doctor Strange, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] and the Silver Surfer. Strange uses Gravity as a 'scalpel' based on his gravity-wielding powers to cut out the damaged portions while Storm serves as a temporary host to Eternity's consciousness as the other heroes hold back the universe's 'antibodies' as they try to attack the perceived cause of the damage.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #550 (2007)</ref>

In the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Eternity grants [[Henry Pym]] the title of Scientist Supreme, a scientific counterpart to the mystical title [[Sorcerer Supreme]], as he is able to create science with effects similar to magic.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #30 (Dec. 2009)</ref> However, Loki later claims to have been posing as Eternity in order to trick Pym.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #34</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Eternity is summoned by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to deal with [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]. However, Eternity tells Hercules that fighting the Chaos God will be like fighting an aspect of Eternity himself. Eternity remains confident that Hercules and his comrades will find a way to win.<ref>''Chaos War'' #2 (Oct. 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a tremendously powerful [[abstract entity]], Eternity has no physical body but exists everywhere simultaneously. The entity can manipulate the universe to achieve essentially any desired effect, and as its name suggests, it is immortal and unaffected by the passage of time. Eternity can warp space and matter into a manifestation that can be perceived by lesser beings, or form [[Incarnation|avatar]]s from another plane of existence known as the Dimension of Manifestations.<ref name="Quasar #37 Aug. 1992"/> On occasion it manifests by possessing the body of exceptionally spiritually strong mortal beings (e.g. Doctor Strange, Thor, Storm).

[[Thanos]] wielding the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] ranked Eternity's scale of power as above that of [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]], and [[Master Order]], but below that of the [[Living Tribunal]].<ref>''Thanos Annual'' #1 (2014)</ref>
