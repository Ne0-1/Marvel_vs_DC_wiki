'''Eternity''' is one of the [[fictional character|fictional]] cosmic entities in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in the ''Strange Tales'' #138, where his existence was determined by [[Doctor Strange]].

Eternity came into existence when the universe was formed and spontaneously assumed the collective consciousness of all things living in the universe.  He is the incarnation of physical and temporal existence; he is the sibling of Infinity, who represents infinite existence and time.  Their siblings and counterparts are [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and [[Oblivion (Marvel Comics)|Oblivion]]. His children are Empathy, Eulogy, Expediency, Entropy, Epiphany and Enmity. Collectively they are known as the seven Friendless. As one of the forces of reality, he remains one of the most powerful and nigh-[[omnipotent]] characters in the Marvel Universe.

Although the complete activities of Eternity are unknown, it is known to appear when things that threaten its existence--such as the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], which would allow human-scale entities to surpass Eternity in power--come to exist.
