'''Ringmaster''' is the name of two characters in [[Marvel Comics]]. The best known Ringmaster in the Marvel Universe is '''Maynard Tiboldt''' who debuted in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'' #3.

==Publication History==
The second Ringmaster is '''Maynard Tiboldt'''. Since his first appearance in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'' #3, he has turned up as a somewhat pathetic and luckless opponent for virtually every hero in the Marvel universe, ranging from [[Spider-Man]] to [[Howard the Duck]]. He is a tall thin man who sports a [[Fu Manchu moustache]] and dresses in a green variation on the traditional circus [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] costume. Having acquired a hypnosis-wave generator originally created by the [[Red Skull]] and mounted said device in his costume's [[top hat]], the Ringmaster's usual scheme is to lead the self-titled "[[Circus of Crime]]" into a community and rob the local citizenry as they attend his circus. Nearly every appearance of the Ringmaster ends with him being thrown back into jail, having been defeated by his current foe.

Maynard Tiboldt was born in [[Vienna, Austria]] to the original Ringmaster of Death Fritz Tiboldt, and his wife Lola. He inheriting the Circus when his parents were murdered.

The Ringmaster is a powerless man with a unique hat which is designed to hypnotize people, thus allowing him to take complete control over their actions. He originally traveled across America as the manager, director, and ringmaster of his small traveling circus, which was actually a front for his "[[Circus of Crime]]"; The [[Human Cannonball (Marvel Comics)|Human Cannonball]], The [[Clown (comics)|Clown]], [[Strongman (comics)|Bruto the Strongman]], The [[Great Gambonnos]] (acrobats and gymnasts) and [[Princess Python]], the Snake Charmer. During their show, he would hypnotize the crowd and send his lackeys out to steal any valuables on the victim's person. Once, while engaging in this activity, he managed to enslave the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], although he was then defeated by the Hulk under the control of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1 #3</ref> Bringing this act to New York, he fought [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], whose blindness prevents Ringmaster from hypnotizing him, for the first time, though he was briefly able to place Spider-Man under his control.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #16</ref> After this failure, he briefly abandoned the Circus of Crime, who became the Masters of Menace (a name Princess Python thought up) led by the Clown. He came back to steal their loot after their capture by Spider-Man, but was captured by the police instead along with the rest.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #22</ref>

The Ringmaster next attempted to enlist recent [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] inductees [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and [[Scarlet Witch]] as circus performers, but instead wound up defeated by them, though he claimed they tried to rob him making them wanted by the Police, though it is later claimed the DA got the truth out of Princess Python.<ref>''Avengers'' #20</ref> He later schemed to blow up [[Avengers Mansion]] during the wedding of [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and defeated Jarvis, but fought and was defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #60</ref> He later enlisted a mind-controlled [[Ulik]] as an accomplice, but was defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' #173</ref> With [[Blackwing]], he battled Daredevil once again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #118</ref> He also battled [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]].<ref>''Power Man'' #24-25</ref> Ringmaster later helped [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] secretly enter [[Latveria]].<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #8-9</ref> He later captured the sea-nymph Meriam, and fought the Hulk again.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #217</ref>

The Ringmaster later enlisted [[Howard the Duck]] as an unwilling accomplice, but was defeated by Howard and Iris Raritan.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #25-27</ref> Ringmaster battled the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76</ref> Ringmaster next pitted a mind-controlled Hulk against the [[Dragon Man]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #292</ref> The Ringmaster was later hired by the [[Headmen]] to test [[She-Hulk]]'s strength and invulnerability.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #1</ref> He later attempted to reform, but helped the Circus of Crime escape from the police after battling [[Power Pack]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #59</ref> He was released from prison in [[Doc Samson]]'s custody, and assists in the therapy that creates the [[Hulk (comics)#Merged Hulk/The Professor|Merged Hulk]] personality for Bruce Banner when his MPD was causing him serious psychological damage.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #377</ref>

The Ringmaster later gets a surgical-upgrade of his eyes, allowing him to use them to hypnotize people, from surgeons working for Devlin DeAngelo, which he used to hypnotize Bruce Banner.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #249, written by Joe Casey</ref> As "Martin Thraller", the Ringmaster used his hypnotic eyes while running for president of the United States (and manages to hypnotize [[Nick Fury]] into forgetting his own identity) until stopped by the [[Deathlok#Jack Truman/Larry Young|Jack Truman]] incarnation of [[Deathlok]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 3, written by Joe Casey</ref>

The Ringmaster traveled to Tibet and stole a ring that had once been created for the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] shortly before his apparent demise. Made from a piece of a shattered [[Cosmic Cube]], the ring allows him to manipulate reality within a fifteen foot radius. Attacking New York for 'practice', he clashes with various superheroes, including [[Spider-Man]] and [[Moon Knight]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The action comes to a head in "Marvel Team-Up" #10 (Sept. 2005). Moon Knight and Spider-Man are both given heart attacks, but then Daredevil joins the scene. Moments before the Ringmaster is about to fire them out of cannons, at the ground about one foot below, the [[Punisher]] shoots off his finger. <ref>"Marvel Team-Up" #10 (Sept. 2005).</ref>

The Cosmic Ring is confiscated by [[Captain America]], who encourages the grouping of heroes to get the shot-off finger to the ambulance personnel for reattachment. Curtis Doyle later uses the ring as the hero [[Freedom Ring]] until his death at the hands of [[Iron Maniac]].<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 3 #24</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Ringmaster (alongside [[Clown (comics)|Clown]] and [[Great Gambonnos]]) was visible among an army of super-villains organized by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] that was captured by [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Ringmaster originally had no inherent superhuman powers. 

The Ringmaster's principal weapon is the powerful portable mind-control device which he carried concealed in his unique top hat. This device is a portable version of the nullatron, which was originally designed by scientists in Nazi-occupied lands during World War II and used by the Red Skull against the Invaders in 1942. The version in the Ringmaster's hat has been specially modified by him for his own uses. The hat has a swirling disk in the front which can send out a hypnotic beam and give him control of the minds of others, amplifying his natural hypnotic talent. Tiboldt eventually had special hypnotic disks surgically grafted into his eyes. These implants allow him to mentally dominate individuals, but he still requires his hat to mesmerize large crowds of people simultaneously. Sufficiently strong-willed individuals are able to resist the Ringmaster's hypnotism if they cannot see the whirling pattern on his hat and the reflective stars on his costume.  Others like [[Doc Samson]] have access to special glasses designed to neutralize the Ringmaster's technology.

With the Cosmic Ring, Tiboldt gained the ability to alter reality in a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} radius around him.
