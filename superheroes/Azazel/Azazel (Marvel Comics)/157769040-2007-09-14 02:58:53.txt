'''Azazel''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] and is the biological father of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. His first appearance was in Uncanny [[X-Men]] #428, during      [[The Draco]] storyline, written by [[Chuck Austen]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Azazel claims that many years ago an ancient horde of  demonic [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]]s from [[biblical]] times called the [[Neyaphem]] were in an epic battle with a group of [[angel|angelic]] over-zealous mutants, named the [[Cheyarafim]]. They were victorious in the battle and vanquished the "evil" mutants to an alternate dimension for all eternity. The Neyaphem's leader, Azazel, was the only one who was able to breach the dimensional void for brief periods of time due to his [[teleportation]] powers. His only hope to return to earth was by impregnating ladies because his children are linked to his dimension.

About twenty years ago, Azazel began mating with women who had strange appearances, at least with looks and abilities other women didn't have. He met [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in [[Germany]], when she was married to a rich castle lord named Baron Christian Wagner. With Christian unable to give her children, Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner. Mystique had an instant attraction to him, and although she was hesitant to betray Christian, she gave in to Azazel and they made love. Not much later, Mystique was pregnant with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. While Raven had actually fallen in love with Azazel, he seemed only to be interested in impregnating her. When the “mission” was accomplished, he told her to raise their child as Wagner’s and left her.

Soon afterwards, she killed Christian because he suspected her betrayal. Mystique killed him and buried the body. A few months later, Mystique gave birth to a child. Due to the shock and the strain of the boy’s difficult delivery, Mystique lost concentration and accidentally revealed her true form. Considered a demon, Mystique was chased away by an angry mob. Barely escaping, she tossed the baby down a ravine. The child was teleported away, apparently by Azazel, and given into Margali Szardos’ care. Azazel had past relations with women before, resulting in the births of [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] and [[Kiwi Black]].

Azazel sired several dozen other children, who were all mysteriously called to gather and sacrifice themselves on the island known as the '''Isla Des Demonas''' to open a [[portal (fiction)|portal]] and bring his army to earth to destroy the Cheyarafim and find a way for the demonic looking mutants to live in the world and find their place in it. In addition to Nightcrawler, another son of Azazel's, was the [[Genosha|Genoshan]] called [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]]. They all joined each other in their zombie-like state and opened a portal to Azazel's dimension. A group of [[X-Men]] had followed Kurt to see where he was going and jumped into the portal. Once inside, Azazel took great pleasure in toying with the team, having them believe that he was actually [[Satan]]. 

Azazel was not able to free the Neyaphem because the portal was to be in no area where Cheyarafim blood ran. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] was present at the time and as such the portal was destroyed. Azazel vanished in grief and has not been seen as of yet.

==Powers and abilities==
Azazel has the ability to [[teleport]] across interdimensional distances, generate bolts and streams of paralyzing energy, as well as destructive energy which causes a form of disintegration, and can disguise his appearance. In addition to this, he and all other Neyaphem are negatively affected by the healing blood of the Cheyarafim which causes their body to begin to break down. Azazel also has the ability to mentally control the reptilian creatures that inhabit the brimstone dimension called Firedancers and has a great knowledge of ancient magicks.
