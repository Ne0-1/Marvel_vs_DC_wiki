'''Azazel''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] and is the biological father of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #428, during "The Draco" storyline, written by [[Chuck Austen]]. Azazel was featured in the film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' as a member of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], the main antagonist group.

==Fictional character biography==
Azazel claims that many years ago an ancient horde of demonic humanoid [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]]s from [[biblical]] times called the [[Neyaphem]] were in an epic battle with a group of [[angel]]ic xenophobic mutants, named the [[Cheyarafim]]. The Cheyarafim were victorious in the battle and banished the "demons" to an alternate dimension for all eternity. The Neyaphem's leader, Azazel, was the only one who was able to breach the dimensional void for brief periods of time due to his [[teleportation]] powers. His only hope to return to earth was by impregnating women because his children are linked to his dimension.

Azazel began mating with women who had unusual characteristics, at least with looks and abilities other women did not have, as successfully birthing a Neyaphem takes a great physical strain. He met [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in [[Germany]], at the time she was married to a rich baron named Christian Wagner, who was unable to give her children. When Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner, she had an instant attraction to him. Although she was hesitant to betray Christian, she gave in to Azazel and had sex with him. Not much later, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] was expecting [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. While Mystique had actually fallen in love with Azazel, he seemed only to be interested in impregnating her, but, in truth, Azazel found himself actually loving Mystique, making her the only woman he ever truly loved. Shortly after his "mission" was complete Azazel left Mystique because the Cheyarafim had learned of his current location in Germany, thus would attempt to kill Azazel, Mystique, and their unborn child. Knowing that Mystique would be safe - having her resources and being the woman she was - Azazel left her to protect her and their child. Mystique, however, would never know of Azazel's true intentions and hated him for leaving her.

Soon afterward, Mystique killed Christian and buried his body because he suspected her betrayal. A few months later, Mystique gave birth to a child. Due to the shock and the strain of the boy’s difficult delivery, Mystique lost concentration and accidentally revealed her true form. Considered a demon, Mystique was chased away by an angry mob. Barely escaping, she tossed the baby down a ravine. The child was teleported away, apparently by Azazel, and given into Margali Szardos’ care. Azazel had past relations with women before, resulting in the births of [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] and [[Kiwi Black]].

Azazel sired several dozen other children, who were all mysteriously called to gather and sacrifice themselves on the island known as the '''Isla Des Demonas'''. Doing this would open a [[portal (fiction)|portal]] and bring his army to earth to destroy the Cheyarafim, allowing the demonic mutants to live in the world and find their place in it. The mutant children worked together in a zombie-like state and opened the portal to Azazel's dimension, but the [[X-Men]] had followed Kurt ([[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]) to see where he was going and jumped into the portal. Once inside, Azazel took great pleasure in toying with the team, having them believe that he was actually [[Satan]].

In the end, Azazel was not able to free the Neyaphem because the portal had to be opened in an area where Cheyarafim blood could not be found. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] was present at the time and as such the portal was destroyed. Azazel vanished in grief and has not been seen since.

In recent times it has been rumored that Azazel is actually a demon, or at least holds the blood of one. Many mystical beings such as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Blackheart]] have made slight references to the leader of the Neyaphem to be much more than he seemed and had a strange set of 'ties' to mortals.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Azazel will make an appearance in the new series of Age of Apocalypse as he can be seen next to Weapon X in the preview art[http://www.comicvine.com/news/marvel-to-launch-age-of-apocalypse-ongoing-in-march/144000/].

==Powers & Abilities==
Azazel has the ability to generate bolts and streams of paralyzing energy, as well as destructive energy which causes a form of disintegration, and can disguise his appearance. In addition to this, he and all other Neyaphem are negatively affected by the healing blood of the Cheyarafim which causes their body to begin to break down. Azazel also has the ability to mentally communicate with and control individuals of inferior mental capacity that originate from the brimstone dimension.
Azazel possesses all of his son Nightcrawler's powers, but to a much greater degree; has unparalleled teleportation powers and does not suffer from the limits of needing to see or know where he is going. 
Azazel also seems to be immortal as he has lived since biblical times. His long lifespan has also allowed him to study swordsmanship to such a degree that he has become a near unparalleled master with bladed weapons. Azazel has also studied black sorcery, though he prefers to use swords rather than magic.

==In other media==
===Film===
Actor [[Jason Flemyng]] plays Azazel in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = Mortimer | first = Ben | title = Jason Flemyng Joining X-Men: First Class | publisher = [[Superhero Hype!]] | date = 2010-08-15 | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/105761-jason-flemyng-joining-x-men-first-class | accessdate = 2010-08-15}}</ref> In the film, Azazel is a member of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], alongside [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Emma Frost]], and [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]]. He is the assistant of Sebastian Shaw and works alongside his other allies Riptide and Emma Frost. In the film, he displays incredible teleporting abilities, similar to that displayed by Nightcrawler in the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', and hand-to-hand combat skills, assisted by a short sword and a sharp tail on which he impales his victims. Unlike the comic book, this version of Azazel seems to be of a Russian origin, speaking in a Russian accent and at times using Russian phrases, such as "nyet" and "comrade". At the film's climax, he engages Beast in a brutal fight until Beast finally knocks him out, and following the death of Shaw and paralysis of Xavier, Azazel joins [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s Brotherhood of Mutants.
