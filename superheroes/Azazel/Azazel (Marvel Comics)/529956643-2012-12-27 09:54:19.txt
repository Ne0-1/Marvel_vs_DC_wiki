'''Azazel''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] and is the biological father of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #428, during "The Draco" storyline, written by [[Chuck Austen]]. The character's name comes from [[Azazel]], a demonic creature in the [[Bible]].

==Character biography==
Azazel claims that many years ago an ancient horde of demonic humanoid [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s from [[biblical]] times called the [[Neyaphem]] were in an epic battle with a group of [[angel]]ic xenophobic mutants, named the [[Cheyarafim]]. The Cheyarafim were victorious in the battle and banished the "demons" to an alternate dimension for all eternity. The Neyaphem's leader, Azazel, was the only one who was able to breach the dimensional void for brief periods of time due to his [[teleportation]] powers. His only hope to return to earth was by impregnating women because his children are linked to his dimension.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #433</ref>

Azazel began mating with women who had unusual characteristics, at least with looks and abilities other women did not have, as successfully birthing a Neyaphem takes a great physical strain. He met [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in [[Germany]], at the time she was married to a rich baron named Christian Wagner, who was unable to give her children. When Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner, she had an instant attraction to him. Although she was hesitant to betray Christian, she gave in to Azazel and had sex with him. Not much later, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] was expecting [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. While Mystique had actually fallen in love with Azazel, he seemed only to be interested in impregnating her, but, in truth, Azazel found himself actually loving Mystique, making her the only woman he ever truly loved. Shortly after his "mission" was complete Azazel left Mystique because the Cheyarafim had learned of his current location in Germany, thus would attempt to kill Azazel, Mystique, and their unborn child. Knowing that Mystique would be safe - having her resources and being the woman she was - Azazel left her to protect her and their child. Mystique, however, would never know of Azazel's true intentions and hated him for leaving her.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}

Soon afterward, Mystique killed Christian and buried  him because he suspected her betrayal. A few months later, Mystique gave birth to Nightcrawler. Due to the shock and the strain of the boy’s difficult delivery, Mystique lost concentration and accidentally revealed her true form. Considered a demon, Mystique was chased away by an angry mob. Barely escaping, she took the form of a townsperson and, acquiescing to the mob, tossed the baby down a ravine.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #4</ref> The child was teleported away, apparently by Azazel, and given into Margali Szardos’ care.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #428</ref> Azazel had past relations with women before, resulting in the births of [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] and [[Kiwi Black]].{{Issue|date=March 2012}}

Azazel sired several dozen other children, who were all mysteriously called together to sacrifice themselves on the island known as the '''Isla Des Demonas'''. Doing this would open a [[portal (fiction)|portal]] and bring his army to earth to destroy the Cheyarafim, allowing the demonic mutants to live in the world and find their place in it. The mutant children worked together in a zombie-like state and opened the portal to Azazel's dimension, but the [[X-Men]] had followed Kurt ([[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]) to see where he was going and jumped into the portal. Once inside, Azazel took great pleasure in toying with the team, having them believe that he was actually [[Satan]].{{Issue|date=March 2012}}

In the end, Azazel was not able to free the Neyaphem because the portal had to be opened in an area where Cheyarafim blood could not be found. [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] was present at the time and as such the portal was destroyed. Azazel vanished in grief and has not been seen since.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}

In recent times it has been rumored that Azazel is actually a demon, or at least holds the blood of one. Many mystical beings such as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Blackheart]] have made slight references to the leader of the Neyaphem to be much more than he seemed and had a strange set of 'ties' to mortals.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
He first appears as a member of the Clan Akkaba.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Azazel possesses all of his son Nightcrawler's powers, but to a much greater degree; has unparalleled teleportation powers and does not suffer from the limits of needing to see or know where he is going.

Azazel also seems to have studied swordsmanship to such a degree that he has become a near unparalleled master with bladed weapons as well as many other academic studies.

Azazel displays a number of super-human abilities during his appearances; these include:

Immortal: his aging process is greatly enhanced and he can apparently regenerate injured or missing cells from even near-fatal injuries:

Teleportation: able to transport himself, his clothing, and additional mass across inter-dimensional distances.

Paralyzation: ability to generate bolts of paralyzing energy.

Metamorph: can disguise his appearance through unknown means.

Will Bending: ability to manipulate minds giving him influence over others.

==Weaknesses==

Azazel can only spend limited time on Earth without the assistance of his children. He and all other Neyaphem are negatively affected by the healing blood of the Cheyarafim which causes their body to begin to breakdown.

He is the assistant of Sebastian Shaw and works alongside his other allies Riptide and Emma Frost. In the film, he displays incredible teleporting abilities, similar to that displayed by Nightcrawler in the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', and hand-to-hand combat skills, assisted by a short sword and a sharp tail on which he impales his victims.
