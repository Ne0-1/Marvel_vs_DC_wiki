'''Azazel''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] and is the biological father of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. His first appearance was in Uncanny [[X-Men]] #428, during      [[The Draco]] storyline, written by [[Chuck Austen]]. 

==Ficitional character history==
Many years ago an ancient demonic [[mutant]] from [[biblical]] times and his horde called the [[Neyaphem]] were in an epic battle with a group of [[angel|angelic]] over-zealous mutants, named the [[Cheyarafim]]. The Cheyarafim are detached from humanity and see the world in only black and white in the sorts of good and evil, this is why they see the Neyaphem as actual demons. They are so zealous they kill whoever stands in their way indiscriminately. They are blinded completely in their goals to the extent that they have no feelings if any innocent people are killed in their mission. They were victorious in the battle and vanquished the "evil" mutants to an alternate dimension for all eternity. The Neyaphem's leader, Azazel, was the only one who was able to breach the dimensional void for brief periods of time due to his [[teleportation]] powers. His only hope to return to earth was by impregnating ladies because his children are linked to his dimension.

About twenty years ago, Azazel began mating with women who had strange appearances, at least with looks and abilities other women didn't have. He met [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in [[Germany]], when she was married to a rich castle lord named Baron Christian Wagner. With Christian unable to give her children, Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner. Mystique fell in love with him, and although she was hesitant to betray Christian as she still loved him, she gave in to Azazel and they made love. Not much later, Mystique was pregnant with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. Soon afterwards, she killed Christian because he suspected her betrayal. She had gone looking for Azazel but he was nowhere to be found. It is later known that Azazel had to leave Mystique, knowing that if the Cheyarafim knew of her, and his love for her then they would stop at nothing to hunt down and kill her along with the unborn Nightcrawler. He also knew in the future he had to act as though he cared nothing for them to keep them safe. The choice was hard for Azazel but knowing that Mystique was a smart and resourceful woman he counted on her to keep safe. However, she didn't have much time to formulate a plan, as the angry villagers soon found out about Christian's murder and came after her and the demonic looking baby. In order to save her own life, she [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into one of the villagers and dropped Nightcrawler over the cliff, saying she pushed the woman off too. With her own life saved, she ran away. Azazel had past relations with women before, resulting in the births of [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] and [[Kiwi Black]], but Mystique was the only woman that he had truly loved.

Later thinking Mystique was dead, Azazel sired several dozen other children, who were all mysteriously called to gather and sacrifice themselves on the island known as the '''Isla Des Demonas''' to open a [[portal (fiction)|portal]] and bring his army to earth to destroy the Cheyarafim and find a way for the demonic looking mutants to live in the world and find their place in it. In addition to Nightcrawler, another son of Azazel's, was the [[Genosha|Genoshan]] called [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]]. They all joined each other in their zombie-like state and opened a portal to Azazel's dimension. A group of [[X-Men]] had followed Kurt to see where he was going and jumped into the portal. Once inside, Azazel took great pleasure in toying with the team, having them believe that he was actually [[Satan]]. 

Azazel was not able to free the Neyaphem because the portal was to be in no area where Cheyarafim blood ran. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] was present at the time and as such the portal was destroyed. Azazel vanished in grief and has not been seen as of yet.

==Powers==
Azazel has the ability to [[teleport]] across interdimensional distances, generate bolts and streams of paralyzing energy, and disguise his appearance. In addition to this, he and all other Neyaphem are negatively affected by the healing blood of the Cheyarafim which causes their body to begin to break down. He has also, being an immortal and gained the experience, become the world's greatest swordsman. Azazel also has the ability to mentally control the reptilian creatures that inhabit the brimstone dimension called Firedancers and a great knowledge of dark magics.
