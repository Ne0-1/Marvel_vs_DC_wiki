An unnamed Cuban scientist in South America has created a formula that would make the President of his country the "master of the world." The President didn't trust him and had him test it on himself by injecting it (which is what the scientist anticipated). The formula caused the scientist to grow in size and strength in front of the President's eyes. Thus, the scientist became Crusher, a giant, rock-hard, immensely heavy menace. None of the President's weapons could pierce the Crusher. The President knew he would made a great asset to his army and told Crusher to kill [[Iron Man]] as a way of becoming a general in his army. Crusher went to America and attacked Stark Industries. This attracted Iron Man and both of them fought in battle. Iron Man used the Centrifugal Ray on Crusher causing him to fall through the floor and fell underground somewhere.

Crusher eventually landed in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]] where the formula that gave him his powers wore off. While exploring Subterranea, he stumbled upon [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]]' abandoned base and used the materials there to recreate the Crusher formula. After it was complete, Crusher began to dig his way up to the surface to get revenge on Iron Man.

After making his way to the surface, Crusher found the men that smuggled him into America and forced them to help him to Stark Industries. He fought Iron Man and took Whitney Frost hostage so Iron Man can hand over the Centrifugal Ray to him. Crusher's fingers were too big for him to operate the controls in his revenge against Iron Man causing it to accidentally overload. Iron Man then took the opportunity to tackle Crusher and carried the Crusher where he threw him into the ocean. Crusher was too heavy, so he sank and drowned.<ref>Iron Man #6</ref>

A coroner named Dr. Jakkelburr received the Crusher's body and studied it in hopes to recreate the formula.

Dr. Jakkelburr's formula recreation was a success when he gave it to a bantomweight boxer named Juan Aponte (who wanted to become a heavyweight boxer). Juan began to take the formula, but it had a side-effect that gave him mood swings and violent fits of temper.

Former boxer Father Gawaine and Coach Pop Fenton both wanted to help Juan and enlisted the help of Matt Murdock. However, Dr. Jakkelburr sent men to rough up the three of them. Murdock managed to slip away to become [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].

The effects of the formula finally overwhelmed Juan causing him to transform into a mindless version of the Crusher. Crusher fought Daredevil and tore up Fogwell's gym in the fight. When he accidentally caused a wall to topple toward Father Gawaine and Pop Fenton, Crusher dove to their rescue and was crushed by the falling wall. Juan reverted back to normal and died in his coach's arms.
