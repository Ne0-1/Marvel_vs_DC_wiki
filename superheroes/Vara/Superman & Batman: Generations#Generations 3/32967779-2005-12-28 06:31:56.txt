'''Superman & Batman: Generations''' is the umbrella title of several [[Elseworlds]] [[comic book]] [[miniseries]] written and illustrated by [[John Byrne]].

==General overview of Generations==
===Generations I===
''Generations'' deals with the question of 'What would happen if people in comic books actually aged?' and takes place in its own [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].  The story consisted of chapters in the lives of both characters, taking place in different decades, and paying homage to the creators and storylines of those times. 

The 1930s chapter, for instance, dealt with Superman and Batman as they were portrayed at that time (as [[vigilante|vigilantes]]), while the 1950s chapter deal with [[Mort Weisinger]]-themed storylines.  The storyline took place in "real time" as well, with the characters aging and offspring taking over their parents' roles.  This project was generally well received.

Each issue of Generations I had two stories, each in a different decade. Starting off in issue #1 in the year of 1939, each issue covered two decades, ending in #4 with the year 1999. The last issue's second story however starts in 2919, where Superman and Batman look back upon their first meeting in 1929.

===Generations II===
'''Generations II''', like its predecessor, was a 4-issue prestige format series; it dealt with other DC heroes in chapters in-between the stories of the first series. It was also collected as a trade paperback (ISBN 1563899906) in 2001.

The series, rather than dealing with a decade jump between stories like the original, took jumps of 11 years. Starting in 1942, each issue again tells two stories, ending in the year 2019 at the end of the fourth issue.

===Generations III===
'''Generations III''' was a 12-part miniseries, published in 2003-2004 in standard comics format. It is a time-travel story that started in the year 1925, with each following issue taking another century jump except issues #7 and #8, who both partially dealt with the 26th century as well the 19th century. The story ended in the 30th century.
