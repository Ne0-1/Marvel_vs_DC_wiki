'''''Superman & Batman: Generations''''' is the umbrella title of three [[Elseworlds]] [[comic book]] [[limited series]] published by [[DC Comics]] in the [[United States]], written and illustrated by [[John Byrne]].

The original was published as a four-issue limited series in prestige format; it was later collected as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] (ISBN 1-56389-605-2) in 1999.

==General overview of Generations==
Each of the main articles devoted to the series holds in-depth summaries of the issues.

===Generations I===

''Generations'' deals with the question of 'What would happen if people in comic books actually aged?' and takes place in its own [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].  The story consisted of chapters in the lives of both characters, taking place in different decades, and paying homage to the creators and storylines of those times. 

The 1930s chapter, for instance, dealt with Superman and Batman as they were portrayed at that time (as [[vigilante]]s), while the 1950s chapter deal with [[Mort Weisinger]]-themed storylines.  The storyline took place in "real time" as well, with the characters aging and offspring taking over their parents' roles.  This project was generally well received.

Each issue of Generations I had two stories, each in a different decade. Starting off in issue #1 in the year of 1939, each issue covered two decades, ending in #4 with the year 1999. The last issue's second story however starts in 2919, where Superman and Batman look back upon their first meeting in 1929.

===Generations II===

'''''Generations II''''', like its predecessor, was a 4-issue prestige format limited series; it dealt with other DC heroes in chapters in-between the stories of the first series. It was also collected as a trade paperback (ISBN 1-56389-990-6) in 2001.

The series, rather than dealing with a decade jump between stories like the original, took jumps of 11 years. Starting in 1942, each issue again told two stories, ending in the year 2019 at the end of the fourth issue. While the first series focused on the Batman and Superman families, the second featured other characters from the [[DC Universe]], especially from the [[Justice Society]] and [[Justice League]].

===Generations III===
'''''Generations III''''' was a 12-part [[limited series]], published in 2003-2004 in standard comics format. It is a time-travel story that started in the year 1925, with each following issue taking another century jump except issues #7 and #8, who both partially dealt with the 26th century as well the 19th century. The story ended in the 30th century.

==Wayne/Kent family tree==

Over the course of the third series, ''Generations III'', an impressive dynasty is created that spans many centuries. Most of this is undone by the story's end.
