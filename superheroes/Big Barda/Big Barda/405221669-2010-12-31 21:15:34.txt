'''Big Barda''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. She first appeared in ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' vol. 1 #4 (October, 1971), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = | contribution = Big Barda | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 47 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In a reversal of the stereotype associated with female characters at the time of her creation, Barda is physically more powerful than her husband and very protective of him.

Jack Kirby based Barda's physical appearance on [[Lainie Kazan]], who had recently appeared topless in ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref name="Ronin">Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution'' (Bloomsbury, 2004)</ref> [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby's assistant during the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] comics, has stated, "Jack based some of his characters (not all) on people in his life or in the news ... the characterization between Scott '[[Mister Miracle]]' Free and Barda was based largely — though with tongue in cheek — on the interplay betwixt Jack and his wife Roz."<ref>[http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq1.htm The JACK F.A.Q. - Page 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Barda was born of the race of [[New Gods]] about 250 years ago, on [[Apokolips]]. Her mother was named Big Breeda, but Barda was taken away from her at an early age to be trained as a warrior. She was a product of [[Granny Goodness]]' Home for Orphaned Youth. Granny's motto is "Die for [[Darkseid]]" (the planet's evil ruler). Granny groomed Barda to one day lead the [[Female Furies|Female Fury Battalion]], a ferocious pack of warrior women.<ref name="dc-fema">{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Female Furies | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 120 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->}}</ref> However, during a raid Barda meets [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]], Darkseid's adopted son, and, sensing a peace about him, fell in love.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Barda risked her own safety to work with the rebel cell lead by the New God [[Himon]]. Both of them helped Scott escape from Apokolips. Eventually, Barda turned her back on Granny, and came to Earth herself. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 1 #4, 1971) Scott had become an escape artist called Mister Miracle, and is teamed with [[Oberon (comics)|Oberon]], his diminutive manager. Scott and Barda were married by Scott's father, the Highfather of New Genesis. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 1 #18)

For a number of years, Barda followed Scott and Oberon on tour. Eventually they retired as superheroes and move to Bailey, New Hampshire. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 2 #1) However, despite their best attempts, a normal life eluded them. Disasters plagued them; Barda, Scott, and Oberon left Bailey and moved to a loft in Greenwich Village, New York City. Barda formed a defense-training program for women called the New Female Furies.

===Justice League===
Though naive regarding Earth customs, Barda relished her roles of wife and housekeeper. However, when duty called she never hesitated to assume the posture of a warrior, and when Scott joined the Justice League, Barda participated in several missions. (''Justice League America'' #7, 28) In one instance, while training [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], her weapon, the Mega-Rod is stolen from her car. With the assistance of her husband and the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]], she gets it back but not before many innocent people were killed by its wielder who was unable to resist the corrupting influence of the Apokoliptian technology. Barda also lead a JLA mission to rescue her husband after he was lost in space. The mission was a result of [[Manga Khan]] selling Scott to [[Granny Goodness]]. Her teammates included [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]], and [[G'nort]]. In an attempt to dissuade their successful pursuit, Manga Khan hired [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], paying him in dolphin feed, to kill them. He almost does, before Barda teleported him to a random location, that being ten feet behind [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]'s skull. The repercussions of that literal meeting of the minds would last for years.

After their time with the JLI, the two left Earth for [[New Genesis]]. (''Mr. Miracle'', v.2 #28) However, they soon return to Earth (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3 #1-2) and took up temporary residence aboard the Justice League Refuge. During this period, the couple separated briefly due to Scott's lack of consideration for her feelings. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3 #4-5)

Barda has served as a member of the JLA in her own right: at [[Takion]]'s order, she and fellow New God [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] are sent as agents of New Genesis to serve on the team. Takion predicted that the Earth faced a grave threat. (''JLA'' #17) Their mission is to help mobilize Earth's heroes against the omnipotent [[Mageddon]]. Over time, they become involved with several other JLA missions. [[Adam Strange]], needing help with an alien invasion, enslaved the JLA as part of a bluff. The League worked for days, turning the planet into a giant teleportation beam. The aliens were sent off to the prison planet of [[Takron-Galtos]], which Barda had mentioned several times during the ordeal. In another instance, Barda was badly wounded fighting the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], a member of the newly reformed [[Injustice League]]. Once Mageddon was defeated, Barda and Orion resigned from the JLA.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''JLA'' #41</ref>

===After the League===
Barda and Scott then resided in the suburbs of [[Connecticut]] and were active adventurers. (''Orion'' #25) Barda never hesitated to lend a hand to her friends when her power and expertise were needed.

Barda accompanied [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]] to Apokolips to rescue [[Supergirl]] from [[Darkseid]]'s clutches (''Superman/Batman'' #11, 12), and accepted an invitation from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to become the heavy-hitter on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. (''Birds of Prey'' #100)

A similar-looking character named [[Little Barda]] appeared as a member of the [[Teen Titans]] in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #21; the character leaves the group in the same issue. Her relationship to Big Barda is unknown, though she escaped from Apokolips with [[Power Boy]].

In a confrontation with the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], she engaged [[Knockout (comics)|Knockout]], another ex-Fury, in hand-to-hand combat. Although the fight was long and continued in the midst of other larger concerns for her team, it ended in a draw.

Big Barda was killed in the first issue of ''[[Death of the New Gods]]''; her funeral occurred in the second issue of the series. [[Infinity-Man]] was later revealed as the killer.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

''[[Final Crisis]]'' #7 depicts Barda standing alongside Lightray and Highfather in front of a [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] New Genesis.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Barda has superhuman strength and endurance; being an Apokoliptian, she is also [[Immortality|immortal]]. She is skilled in all forms of warfare and weaponry.<ref name="jla">JLA: The Ultimate Guide to the Justice League of America</ref> She is one of the deadliest hand-to-hand combatants alive.<ref name="dcce">The DC Comics Encyclopedia</ref> Barda's level of power puts her on a par with the most powerful heroines of the DC Universe, such as Wonder Woman, Donna Troy, Power Girl, Mary Marvel, and Supergirl. Her skill and strength is such that she has fought [[Wonder Woman]] to a draw.<ref name="dcce" />

She wields a high tech weapon called a '''Mega-rod''', which produces extremely powerful concussive energy bolts and can also increase gravitational forces.<ref name="jla" /> She can also summon and uses ''Aero-disks'' which allow her to fly, and Apokaliptian armor which augments her already superhuman strength.
