'''Big Barda''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]ine created by [[Jack Kirby]], originally for [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|The Fourth World]] series of titles.

She is the wife of fellow superhero [[Mister Miracle]]. The two escaped from the planet [[Apokolips]] to Earth in order to find a peaceful life together.

In a reversal of the stereotyped female character then common at that time of her creation, Barda is physically more powerful than her husband and is more than willing to use that power in battle.  For instance, Barda was originally the leader of a ferocious pack of female warriors called the [[Female Furies]].  As such, she possesses the great strength and endurance befitting a warrior for [[Darkseid]]. Although she came to share her husband's values of peace and justice, fighting is still her preferred response in the face of evil.
