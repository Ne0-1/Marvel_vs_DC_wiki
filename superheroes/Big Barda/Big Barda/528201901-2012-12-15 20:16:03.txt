'''Big Barda''' is a [[fiction]]al comic book [[superheroine]] appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' #4 (October 1971), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | contribution=Big Barda | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=47 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

In a reversal of the stereotype associated with female characters at the time of her creation, Barda is physically more powerful than her husband and very protective of him.

Jack Kirby based Barda's physical appearance on [[Lainie Kazan]], who had recently appeared topless in ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref name="Ronin">{{Cite book | last=Ro | first=Ronin | title=Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=July 2004 | isbn=1-58234-345-4}}</ref> [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby's assistant during the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] comics, has stated, "Jack based some of his characters (not all) on people in his life or in the news... the characterization between Scott '[[Mister Miracle]]' Free and Barda was based largely—though with tongue in cheek—on the interplay betwixt Jack and his wife Roz."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq1.htm | title=The Jack F.A.Q. | work=Povonline.com | accessdate=2011-01-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101217041205/http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq1.htm| archivedate= 17 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Big Barda was ranked 75th  in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 49| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Barda was born of the race of [[New Gods]], female character, about 250 years ago, on [[Apokolips]]. Her mother was named Big Breeda, but Barda was taken away from her at an early age to be trained as a warrior. She was a product of [[Granny Goodness]]'s Home for Orphaned Youth. Granny's motto is "Die for [[Darkseid]]" (the planet's evil ruler). Granny groomed Barda to one day lead the [[Female Furies|Female Fury Battalion]], a ferocious pack of warrior women.<ref name="dc-fema">{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Female Furies | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=120 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> However, during a raid, Barda meets [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]], Darkseid's adopted son, and, sensing a peace about him, fell in love.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Barda risked her own safety to work with the rebel cell led by the New God [[Himon]]. Barda, Himon and Metron assist Scott in escaping Apokolips. She doesn't leave at that point for gravity manipulation had disabled her and she didn't wish to slow Scott down in his flight.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #9 (September 1972)</ref> Eventually, Barda completely turns her back on Granny and came to Earth herself.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #4 (September/October 1971)</ref> Scott had become an escape artist called Mister Miracle, and is teamed with [[Oberon (comics)|Oberon]], his diminutive manager. For a while, Barda's Furies assist Scott in his showmanship efforts <ref>''Mister Miracle'' #14 (July 1, 1973)</ref> but they return to Apokolips by themselves. Scott and Barda are married by Scott's father, the [[Highfather]] of [[New Genesis]].<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #18 (February/March 1974)</ref>

For a number of years, Barda followed Scott and Oberon on tour. Eventually they retired as superheroes and moved to Bailey, New Hampshire.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 2, #1 (January 1989)</ref> However, despite their best attempts, a normal life eluded them. Disasters plagued them; Barda, Scott, and Oberon left Bailey and moved to a loft in Greenwich Village, New York City. Barda formed a defense-training program for women called the New Female Furies.

===Justice League===
Though naïve regarding Earth customs, Barda relished her roles of wife and housekeeper. However, when duty called she never hesitated to assume the posture of a warrior; and when Scott joined the [[Justice League]], Barda participated in several missions.<ref>''Justice League International'' #7 (November 1987); ''Justice League America'' #28 (July 1989)</ref> In one instance, while training [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], her weapon, the Mega-Rod is stolen from her car. With the assistance of her husband and the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]], she gets it back, but not before many innocent people were killed by its wielder who was unable to resist the corrupting influence of the Apokoliptian technology. Barda also led a JLA mission to rescue her husband after he was lost in space. The mission was a result of [[Manga Khan]] selling Scott to [[Granny Goodness]]. Her teammates included [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]], and [[G'nort]]. In an attempt to dissuade their successful pursuit, Manga Khan hired [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], paying him in dolphin feed, to kill them. He almost does, before Barda teleported him to a random location, that being ten feet behind [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]'s skull. The repercussions of that literal meeting of the minds would last for years.

For a time, Barda mourned Scott, believing him slain in a battle with [[Despero]]. It had been a robot double destroyed, this was part of a plan by Manga Khan.<ref>''Justice League America'' vol. 2, #37-40 (April–July 1990)</ref>

After their time with the JLI, the two left Earth for [[New Genesis]].<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 2, #28 (June 1991)</ref> However, they soon returned to Earth<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3, #1-2 (April–May 1996)</ref> and took up temporary residence aboard the Justice League Refuge. During this period, the couple separated briefly due to Scott's lack of consideration for her feelings.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3, #4-5 (June–July 1996)</ref>

Barda has served as a member of the JLA in her own right as well. At [[Takion]]'s order, she and fellow New God [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] were sent as agents of New Genesis to serve on the team. Takion predicted that the Earth faced a grave threat.<ref>''JLA'' #17 (April 1998)</ref> Their mission is to help mobilize Earth's heroes against the omnipotent [[Mageddon]]. Over time, they become involved with several other JLA missions. [[Adam Strange]], needing help with an alien invasion, enslaved the JLA as part of a bluff. The League worked for days, turning the planet into a giant teleportation beam. The aliens were sent off to the prison planet of [[Takron-Galtos]], which Barda had mentioned several times during the ordeal. In another instance, Barda was badly wounded fighting the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], a member of the newly reformed [[Injustice League]]. Once Mageddon was defeated, Barda and Orion resigned from the JLA.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''JLA'' #41 (May 2000)</ref>

===After the League===
Barda and Scott then resided in the suburbs of [[Connecticut]] and were active adventurers.<ref>''Orion'' #25 (June 2002)</ref> Barda never hesitated to lend a hand to her friends when her power and expertise were needed.

Barda accompanied [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]] to Apokolips to rescue [[Supergirl]] from [[Darkseid]]'s clutches,<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #11-12 (August–September 2004)</ref> and accepted an invitation from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to become the heavy-hitter on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #100 (January 2007)</ref>

A similar-looking character named [[Little Barda]] appeared as a member of the [[Teen Titans]] in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #21; the character leaves the group in the same issue. Her relationship to Big Barda is unknown, though she escaped from Apokolips with [[Power Boy]].

In a confrontation with the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], she engaged [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]], another ex-Fury, in hand-to-hand combat. Although the fight was long and continued in the midst of other larger concerns for her team, it ended in a draw.

Big Barda was killed in the first issue of ''[[Death of the New Gods]]''; her funeral occurred in the second issue of the series. [[Infinity-Man]] was later revealed as the killer. He had been slaughtering all the 'New Gods' in the name of restarting a new age of deities.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

''[[Final Crisis]]'' #7 depicts Barda standing alongside [[Lightray]] and Highfather in front of a [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] New Genesis.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Barda has superhuman strength and endurance; being an Apokoliptian, she is also [[Immortality|immortal]]. She is a master combatant, having been trained in all forms of Apokiliptian warfare.<ref name="jla">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | title=JLA: The Ultimate Guide to the Justice League of America | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | date=November 2002 | isbn=0-7513-4798-1}}</ref> She is one of the deadliest hand-to-hand combatants alive.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Barda's level of power puts her on a par with the most powerful heroines of the DC Universe, such as Wonder Woman, [[Donna Troy]], [[Power Girl]], [[Mary Marvel]], and [[Supergirl]]. Her skill and strength is such that she has fought Wonder Woman to a draw.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

She wields a high tech weapon called a "Mega-rod", which produces extremely powerful concussive energy bolts capable of felling even Superman, teleport herself and others extremely long distance, increase gravitational forces, and works as a powerful melee weapon.<ref name="jla"/> She can also summon and use "Aero-disks", which allow her to fly, and Apokoliptian armor, which augments her already superhuman strength.

Additionally, Barda also possesses a [[Mother Box]], a sentient, handheld supercomputer that has a vast multitude of functions, such as opening Boom Tubes, energy manipulation, healing its owner, take control over non-sentient machines and evolve them, sustain its user in hostile environments, as well as other uses.
