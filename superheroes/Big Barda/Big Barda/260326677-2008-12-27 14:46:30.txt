'''Big Barda''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] and [[New Gods|New God]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. She first appeared in ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' vol. 1 #4 (October, 1971), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger  | first = Robert | author-link =  | contribution = Big Barda | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 47  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

In a reversal of the stereotype associated with female characters at the time of her creation, Barda is physically more powerful than her husband and very protective of him.

Jack Kirby based Barda's physical appearance on [[Lainie Kazan]], "who had recently appeared topless in ''[[Playboy]]''."<ref name="Ronin">Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution'' (Bloomsbury, 2004)</ref> [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby's assistant during the [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World| Fourth World]] comics, has stated: "Jack based some of his characters (not all) on people in his life or in the news ... the characterization between Scott '[[Mister Miracle]]' Free and Barda was based largely — though with tongue in cheek — on the interplay  Jack and his wife Roz." <ref>[http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq1.htm The JACK F.A.Q. - Page 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Barda was born of the race of [[New Gods]] about 250 years ago, on [[Apokolips]]. Her mother was named Big Breeda, but Barda was taken away from her at an early age to be trained as a warrior.  She is a product of [[Granny Goodness]]' Home for Orphaned Youth.  Granny's motto is "Die for [[Darkseid]]" (the planet's evil ruler).  Granny grooms Barda to one day lead the [[Female Furies|Female Fury Battalion]], a ferocious pack of warrior women.<ref name="dc-fema">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Female Furies | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 120  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>  However, during a raid Barda meets [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]], Darkseid's adopted son, and, sensing a peace about him, falls in love.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Barda risks her own safety to work with the rebel cell lead by the New God [[Himon]]. Both of them help Scott escape from Apokolips. Eventually, Barda turns her back on Granny, and comes to Earth herself. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 1 #4, 1971)  Scott has become an escape artist called Mister Miracle, and is teamed with [[Oberon (comics)|Oberon]], his diminutive manager.  Scott and Barda are married by Scott's father, the Highfather of New Genesis. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 1 #18)

For a number of years, Barda follows Scott and Oberon on tour. Eventually they retire as superheroes and move to Bailey, New Hampshire. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 2 #1) However, despite their best attempts, a normal life eludes them. Disasters plague them; Barda, Scott, and Oberon leave Bailey and move to a loft in Greenwich Village, New York City. Barda forms a defense-training program for women called the New Female Furies.

===Justice League===
Though naive regarding Earth customs, Barda relishes her roles of wife and housekeeper. However, when duty calls she never hesitates to assume the posture of a warrior, and when Scott joins the Justice League, Barda participates in several missions. (''Justice League America'' #7, 28) In one instance, while training [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], her weapon, the Mega-Rod is stolen from her car. With the assistance of other League members, she gets it back but not before many innocent people are killed by its wielder who was unable to resist the corrupting influence of the Apokoliptian technology. Barda also leads a JLA mission to rescue her husband after he is lost in space. The mission is a result of [[Manga Khan]] selling Scott to [[Granny Goodness]]. Her teammates include [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]], and [[G'nort]]. In an attempt to dissuade their successful pursuit, Manga Khan hires [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], paying him in dolphin feed, to kill them. He almost does, before Barda teleports him to a random location, that being ten feet behind [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]'s skull. The repercussions of that literal meeting of the minds would last for years.

After their time with the JLI, the two leave Earth for [[New Genesis]]. (''Mr. Miracle'', v.2 #28) However, they soon return to Earth (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3 #1-2) and take up temporary residence aboard the Justice League Refuge.  During this period, the couple separate briefly due to Scott's lack of consideration for her feelings. (''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3 #4-5)  

Barda has served as a member of the JLA in her own right:  at [[Takion]]'s order, she and fellow New God [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] are sent as agents of New Genesis to serve on the team. Takion predicts that the Earth faces a grave threat. (''JLA'' #17) Their mission is to help mobilize Earth's heroes against the omnipotent [[Mageddon]]. Over time, they become involved with several other JLA missions. [[Adam Strange]], needing help with an alien invasion, enslaves the JLA as part of a bluff. The League works for days, turning the planet into a giant teleportation beam. The aliens are sent off to the prison planet of [[Takron-Galtos]], which Barda had mentioned several times during the ordeal. In another instance, Barda is badly wounded fighting the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], a member of the newly reformed [[Injustice League]]. Once Mageddon is defeated, Barda and Orion resign from the JLA.<ref>''JLA''  #41</ref><ref name="dc-ency"/>

===After the League===
Barda and Scott currently reside in the suburbs of Connecticut and are active adventurers. (''Orion'' #25) Barda never hesitates to lend a hand to her friends when her power and expertise are needed. 

Barda accompanies Batman, Superman, and [[Wonder Woman]] to Apokolips to rescue [[Supergirl]] from Darkseid's clutches (''Superman/Batman'' #11, 12), and accepts an invitation from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to become the heavy-hitter on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. (''Birds of Prey'' #100)

A similar-looking character named [[Little Barda]] appeared as a member of the [[Teen Titans]] in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''  #21; the character leaves the group in the same issue.  Her relationship to Big Barda is unknown, though she escaped from Apokolips with [[Power Boy]].

In a confrontation with the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], she engages [[Knockout (comics)|Knockout]], another ex-Fury, in hand-to-hand combat. Although the fight is long and continues in the midst of other larger concerns for her team, it ends in a draw.

Big Barda is killed in the first issue of ''[[Death of the New Gods]]''; her funeral occurs in the second issue of the series.  [[Infinity-Man]] is later revealed as the killer.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Barda has superhuman strength, endurance, and is virtually indestructible.  She can project cosmic energy for destructive blasts, perceive matter and energy on a sub-atomic level, form and manipulate energy constructs, and discharge most forms of energy.  

She wields a high tech weapon called a '''Mega-rod''', which produces extremely powerful concussive bursts. She can also summon and uses ''Aero-disks'' which allow her to fly, and Apokaliptian armor which augments her already superhuman strength.

==Other versions==
* Barda appears in the limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], which is set in an alternate future timeline  of DC continuity. [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] has overthrown [[Darkseid]] and is the reluctant ruler of [[Apokolips]]. Barda (now sporting an eye-patch) and [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]] work to teach the "lowlies" to think for themselves, with Orion's approval. The two have a daughter, Avia, who deploys a mega-rod and wears an outfit that combines elements of those of her parents.
* In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', as America decends into anarchy and chaos, a former [[Pornographic actor|porn star]] called Hot Gates takes up the mantle of "Big Barda" in order to declare herself [[dictator]] of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]].
* ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #24 depicts '''Big Bard''', the male version of Big Barda from a reverse gender universe, who is married to Miss Miracle.
* In ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Barda becomes a [[Green Lantern Corps]] member, although her [[power ring (weapon)|power ring]] having fused to her [[Mother box]] has made her a rather unusual [[Green Lantern]].
