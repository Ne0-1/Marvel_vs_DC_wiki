'''Big Barda''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]ine created by [[Jack Kirby]], originally for [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|The Fourth World]] series of titles.

She is the wife of fellow superhero [[Mister Miracle]]. The two escaped from the planet [[Apokolips]] to Earth in order to find a peaceful life together.

In a reversal of the stereotyped female character then common at that time of her creation, Barda is physically more powerful than her husband and is more than willing to use that power in battle.  For instance, Barda was originally the leader of a ferocious pack of female warriors called the [[Female Furies]].  As such, she possesses the great strength and endurance befitting a warrior for [[Darkseid]]. Although she came to share her husband's values of peace and justice, fighting is still her preferred response in the face of evil. She is very protective of Scott Free. 

Big Barda is one of the tallest heroines in the DC comics universe, towering over the power house [[Wonder Woman]] and other heroes, both male and female, at 7-feet tall.  [[Grace (comics)|Grace Choi]] of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] also stands 7 feet tall. Barda is surpassed in height only by heroines such as [[Elasti-Girl]] who are capable of changing their size.

A similar-looking character named [[Little Barda]] appears in the 21st issue of the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series as a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], although she leaves the group in that same issue; a picture of her with former members of the Titans has also been seen in the [[One Year Later]] storyline.  Any relationship with Big Barda is unknown at this time.  She is also rumoured to be joining the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] in the coming months; she makes an appearance along with Manhunter in Birds of Prey #100.

Jack Kirby reportedly based Barda's physical appearance on [[Lainie Kazan]] as she appeared in an issue of ''[[Playboy]]''.{{fn|1}}

She is not to be confused with Marvel Comic's [[Big Bertha (comics)|Big Bertha]] of the [[Great Lakes Avengers|Great Lakes Champions]].

Big Barda has appeared in both ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Farrah Forke]]. In ''Batman Beyond'', she was a member of the [[Justice League]] of the future. In ''Justice League Unlimited,'' [[Granny Goodness]] kidnapped [[Oberon (comics)|Oberon]] and blackmailed both her and Mister Miracle to rescue [[Kalibak]] from the clutches of [[Virman Vunderbarr]] in return for his safety. With the help of [[Wally West|Flash]], they managed to rescue Kalibak and trick Granny Goodness into revealing Oberon's whereabouts. After Oberon was safe, they left Apokolips, but not before Barda gave Granny Goodness a punch in the face.

==Footnotes==
* {{fnb|1}} '''[[Mark Evanier]]''' (Screenwriter, [[Jack Kirby]] biographer, and Kirby's assistant during the [[Fourth World]] comics): "Jack based some of his characters (not all) on people in his life or in the news.... [[Big Barda]]'s roots are not in doubt.  The visual came about shortly after songstress [[Lainie Kazan]] posed for ''[[Playboy]]''...and the characterization between Scott '[[Mister Miracle|Mr. Miracle]]' Free and Barda was based largely — though with tongue in cheek — on the interplay [[:wikt:betwixt|betwixt]] Jack and his wife Roz.  Of course, the whole '[[escape artist]]' theme was inspired by an earlier career of writer-artist [[Jim Steranko]]." [http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq1.htm]
