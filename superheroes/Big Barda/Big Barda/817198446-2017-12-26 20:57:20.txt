'''Big Barda''' is a [[fiction]]al comic book [[superheroine]] (although sometimes portrayed as a villain) appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' #4 (October 1971), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | contribution=Big Barda | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=47 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

In a reversal of the stereotype associated with female characters at the time of her creation, Barda is physically more powerful than her husband, [[Mister Miracle]], and very protective of him.

Jack Kirby based Barda's physical appearance on [[Lainie Kazan]], who had recently appeared topless in ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref name="Ronin">{{Cite book | last=Ro | first=Ronin | title=Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=July 2004 | isbn=1-58234-345-4}}</ref> [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby's assistant on the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] comics, has stated, "Jack based some of his characters (not all) on people in his life or in the news... the characterization between Scott 'Mister Miracle' Free and Barda was based largely—though with tongue in cheek—on the interplay between Kirby and his wife Roz."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq1.htm | title=The Jack F.A.Q. | work=Povonline.com | accessdate=2011-01-15 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217041205/http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq1.htm | archivedate=17 December 2010 | deadurl=yes | df= }}</ref>  Big Barda was ranked 75th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 49| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Barda is a member of the race known as the [[New Gods]]. She was born about 250 years ago, on [[Apokolips]]. Her mother was named Big Breeda, but Barda was taken away from her at an early age to be trained as a warrior. She was a product of [[Granny Goodness]]' Home for Orphaned Youth. Granny's motto is "Die for [[Darkseid]]" (the planet's evil ruler). Granny groomed Barda to one day lead the [[Female Furies|Female Fury Battalion]], a ferocious pack of warrior women.<ref name="dc-fema">{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Female Furies | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=120 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> However, during a raid, Barda meets [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]], Darkseid's adopted son, and, sensing a peace about him, fell in love.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Barda risks her own safety to work with the rebel cell led by the New God [[Himon]]. This comes directly after the murder of most of Himon's cell by the local authority, Wonderful Williki. This includes one of Barda's people, Auralie, who was tortured to death for the 'crime' of dancing. Moments later, Himon kills Willik with a bomb. Barda, her Furies, Himon and Metron assist Scott in escaping Apokolips. Darkseid himself calls for Scott to return but doesn't actually stop him, as he wishes Scott to leave so a war with New Genesis can start. Barda doesn't leave at that point because she is not emotionally ready.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #9 (September 1972)</ref> Eventually, Barda completely turns her back on Granny Goodness and came to Earth herself.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #4 (September/October 1971)</ref> Scott has become an escape artist called Mister Miracle, and is teamed with [[Oberon (comics)|Oberon]], his diminutive manager. Oberon and Barda become close friends. For a while, Barda's Furies assist Scott in his showmanship efforts<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #14 (July 1, 1973)</ref> but they return to Apokolips by themselves. Scott and Barda are married by Scott's father, the [[Highfather]] of [[New Genesis]].<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #18 (February/March 1974)</ref>

For a number of years Barda follows Scott and Oberon on tour. Eventually they retire as superheroes and move to Bailey, New Hampshire.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 2, #1 (January 1989)</ref> However, despite their best attempts, a normal life eludes them. Disasters plague them; Barda, Scott, and Oberon leave Bailey and move to a loft in [[Greenwich Village]]. Barda forms a defense-training program for women called the New Female Furies.

===Justice League===
Though naïve regarding Earth customs, Barda relishes her roles of wife and housekeeper. However, when duty calls she never hesitates to assume the posture of a warrior; and when Scott joins the [[Justice League]], Barda participates in several missions.<ref>''Justice League International'' #7 (November 1987); ''Justice League America'' #28 (July 1989)</ref> In one instance, while training [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], her weapon, the Mega-Rod, is stolen from her car. With the assistance of her husband and the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]], she gets it back, but not before many innocent people are killed by its wielder, who was unable to resist the corrupting influence of the Apokoliptian technology. Barda also led a JLA mission to rescue her husband after he was lost in space. The mission was a result of [[Manga Khan]] selling Scott to [[Granny Goodness]]. Her teammates included [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]], and [[G'nort]]. In an attempt to dissuade their successful pursuit, Manga Khan hired [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], paying him in [[dolphin]] feed, to kill them. He almost does, before Barda teleports him to a random location, that being ten feet behind [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]'s skull. The repercussions of that literal meeting of the minds would last for years.

For a time, Barda mourns Scott, believing him slain in a battle with [[Despero]]. But it was a robot double that was destroyed, as part of a plan by Manga Khan.<ref>''Justice League America'' vol. 2, #37-40 (April–July 1990)</ref>

After their time with the JLI, the two leave Earth for [[New Genesis]].<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 2, #28 (June 1991)</ref> However, they soon return<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3, #1-2 (April–May 1996)</ref> and take up temporary residence aboard the Justice League Refuge. During this period, the couple separate briefly due to Scott's lack of consideration for her feelings. Barda perishes, but is reborn via Scott's temporary access to great cosmic power.<ref>''Mister Miracle'' vol. 3, #4-5 (June–July 1996)</ref>

Barda has served as a member of the JLA in her own right as well. At [[Takion]]'s order, she and fellow New God [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] were sent as agents of New Genesis to serve on the team. Takion predicted that the Earth faced a grave threat.<ref>''JLA'' #17 (April 1998)</ref> Their mission is to help mobilize Earth's heroes against the omnipotent [[Mageddon]]. Over time, they become involved with several other JLA missions. [[Adam Strange]], needing help with an alien invasion, enslaves the JLA as part of a bluff. The League works for days, turning the planet into a giant teleportation beam. The aliens are sent off to the prison planet of [[Takron-Galtos]], which Barda had mentioned several times during the ordeal. In another instance, Barda is badly wounded fighting the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], a member of the newly reformed [[Injustice League]]. Once Mageddon is defeated, Barda and Orion resign from the JLA.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''JLA'' #41 (May 2000)</ref>

===After the League===
Barda and Scott then reside in the suburbs of [[Connecticut]] and are active adventurers.<ref>''Orion'' #25 (June 2002)</ref> Barda never hesitates to lend a hand to her friends when her power and expertise are needed.

Barda accompanies [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]] to Apokolips to rescue [[Supergirl]] from [[Darkseid]]'s clutches,<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #11-12 (August–September 2004)</ref> and accepts an invitation from [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to become the heavy-hitter on the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #100 (January 2007)</ref>

A similar-looking character named [[Little Barda]] appeared as a member of the [[Teen Titans]] in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #21; the character leaves the group in the same issue. Her relationship to Big Barda is unknown, though she escaped from Apokolips with [[Power Boy]].

In a confrontation with the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], she engaged [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]], another ex-Fury, in hand-to-hand combat. Although the fight is long and continues in the midst of other larger concerns for her team, it ends in a draw.

Big Barda is killed in the first issue of ''[[Death of the New Gods]]''; her funeral occurs in the second issue of the series. [[Infinity-Man]] is later revealed as the killer. He had been slaughtering all the 'New Gods' in the name of restarting a new age of deities.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

''[[Final Crisis]]'' #7 depicts Barda standing alongside [[Lightray]] and Highfather in front of a [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] New Genesis.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)</ref>

===The New 52===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Universe), Big Barda and Scott are seen on [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]].<ref>''Earth 2'' #11</ref> They are later seen with many of the comrades in Supertown.<ref>"The Multiversity Guidebook" (Jan. 2015)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Barda is a New God, a race of people who evolved into genetically advanced beings thanks to their proximity to the Source. As such, she possesses immense superhuman strength that puts her into the same strength class as Superman and Wonder Woman. She is also highly resistant to blunt force trauma, temperature and pressure extremes, and is partially bulletproof. Her Apokoliptan physiology prevents her from aging and makes her immune to disease.  She is a master combatant, having been trained in all forms of Apokiliptian warfare.<ref name="jla">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | title=JLA: The Ultimate Guide to the Justice League of America | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | date=November 2002 | isbn=0-7513-4798-1}}</ref> Her skill and strength is such that she has fought Wonder Woman to a draw.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Barda also wields a high tech weapon of Apokoliptan origins called a "Mega-Rod." The rod is capable of producing extremely powerful concussive bolts capable of felling beings as durable as Superman, allows Barda to teleport herself and others long distances, can increase gravitational forces, and can be used as an indestructible club in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name="jla"/> Barda also has access to other forms of Fourth World technology, including Aero-Discs that allow her to defy gravity and fly, Apokoliptan battle armor that augments her already impressive durability, and a Mother Box, which she can use to create Boom Tubes for transportation over long distances and between dimensions.

==Other versions==
Barda appears in the limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], which is set in an alternate future timeline of DC continuity. [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] has overthrown [[Darkseid]] and is the reluctant ruler of [[Apokolips]]. Barda (now sporting an eye-patch) and [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]] work to teach the "lowlies" to think for themselves, with Orion's approval. The two have a daughter, Avia, who deploys a mega-rod and wears an outfit that combines elements of those of her parents.

In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', as America descends into anarchy and chaos, a former [[Pornographic actor|porn star]] called [[Thermopylae|Hot Gates]] (a reference to Miller's ''[[300 (comics)|300]]'' comic) takes up the mantle of "Big Barda" in order to declare herself [[dictator]] of [[Columbus, Ohio]].

''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #24 depicts "Big Bard", the male version of Big Barda from a reverse gender universe, who is married to Miss Miracle.

In ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Barda becomes a [[Green Lantern Corps]] member, although her [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] having fused to her [[Mother Box]] has made her a rather unusual [[Green Lantern]]. Mister Miracle's consciousness also inhabits the ring and he can project himself as a spectral green figure.

Barda appears in two graphic novels that DC loosely based on the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', ''Justice League Beyond'' and ''Superman Beyond: Man of Tomorrow'', where, as in the animated series, she belongs to the Justice League during the tenure of [[Terry McGinnis]] as Batman. Justice League Beyond contains a separate section at the end titled "Beyond: Origins" that briefly summarized the origins of [[Warhawk (Batman Beyond)|Warhawk]] (Chapter 1), [[Aquagirl]] (Chapter 2), and Barda (Chapter 3). Chapter 3 gives an origin story for Barda similar to her [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] mainstream comic book [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] storyline, but sets the events later so that in the Beyond universe she was born later and didn't join the Justice League until Superman had already visibly aged and begun wearing the black and white costume he sports in the Beyond stories.

In the ''DC Comics Bombshells'' continuity, "Big" Barda Free is a member of [[Amanda Waller]]'s Bombshells project. She is also in a romantic relationship with [[Kimiyo Hoshi]].<ref>''DC Comics Bombshells'' #32</ref>

Barda also appears alongside a genderbent version of Mr.Miracle in the comic book series Ame-Comi Girls.
