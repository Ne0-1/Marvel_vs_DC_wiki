'''Congorilla''', originally a human character known as '''Congo Bill''', is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]] and [[Vertigo Comics]]. Originally co-created by writer [[Whitney Ellsworth]] and artist [[George Papp]], he was later transformed into Congorilla by [[Robert Bernstein (comics writer)|Robert Bernstein]] and Howard Sherman. The character first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #56 (June [[1940 in comics|1940]]).

==Publication history==
Congo Bill encountered the legendary golden gorilla in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #224 (January 1957). He also encountered the similarly named '''Kongorilla''' in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #228 (May 1957).

''Congo Bill'' was a long-running DC Comics adventure [[comic strip]], running in various DC Comics titles from 1940 until ''[[Action Comics]]'' #248 (January [[1959 in comics|1959]]), when Congo Bill was transformed into Congorilla (the title of the strip was likewise changed). The ''Congo Bill'' strip was a standard adventure strip, often reminiscent of [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' [[newspaper]] strip.

''Action Comics'' #191 (April 1954) saw the introduction of [[Janu the Jungle Boy]], a young boy brought up in the jungle after his father had been killed by a tiger. The strip was a moderate success and moved from ''More Fun Comics'' to ''Action Comics'' with issue #37, where it stayed until issue #248, when it was transformed into ''Congorilla''. In 1954, DC awarded Congo Bill his own title, which lasted for seven issues (August/September 1954 – August/September 1955).

The ''Congorilla'' series ran in ''Action Comics'' until issue #259, after which it was transferred to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'', where it ran until issue #283. Since the demise of its own series, Congorilla has mainly been seen as a guest star in other titles, including as part of the [[Forgotten Heroes]]. The character finally received a [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] of his own in [[1992 in comics|1992]], where Congo Bill is betrayed by his (now corrupt) ward Janu, who usurps the Congorilla identity and Bill is forced to fight his adopted son to the death. Congo Bill became blind in his left eye, making it hard for him to see after fighting his son to the end. In [[1999 in comics|1999]], DC Comics once again brought Congo Bill back for another four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] under the company's mature readership Vertigo Comics imprint. Congorilla returned in the 2009 series ''[[Cry for Justice]]'', joining a proactive splinter faction of the [[Justice League]]. Following that series, Congorilla  briefly became a full-time member of the Justice League.

Congo Bill next appeared in the Rebirth continuity as the warden of Monster Rock, where he trained the hero [[Damage (DC comics)#Ethan Avery|Damage]] on how to control the giant monster one turns into.

==Fictional character biography==
William "Congo Bill" Glenmorgan<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #47 (September 2010)</ref> was born in 1898, the son of a Scottish gamekeeper. At one point he was a member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25567 | title=WC10: Spotlight on James Robinson | last=Evans | first=Chris | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=April 5, 2010 | accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> and during [[World War I]] he served as soldier in the [[Battle of the Somme]] in France 1916 and also Battle of Flanders Field in Passendale, Belgium. He worked his way up a spy in [[Austria]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #44 (June 2010)</ref> He later became a globe-trotting adventurer, and for a time worked for the Worldwide Insurance Company, protecting policies they had written and saving the company from fraudulent payouts.

Bill grew content to live in his adopted [[Africa]]n home, swearing to protect it from harm. There he befriended a witch-doctor known as Chief Kawolo. When Kawolo was mortally injured in a fall, he summoned Bill to his bedside, and offered him a magic ring. Kawolo told the skeptical Congo Bill that, by rubbing the ring, he could transfer his consciousness into the body of the legendary Golden Gorilla. He accepted the ring to humor his friend's dying wish. Several weeks later, an earthquake trapped Bill in a deep cave. With no possible escape, Congo Bill hopelessly rubbed the magic ring. Instantly, his mind was transported into the body of the Golden Gorilla. Racing to the cave-in, he used his massive strength to clear the blocked entrance and wondering what had become of his body without him being "home". He realized that when his consciousness entered the body of the Golden Gorilla, the creature's consciousness entered his own body. Bill decides to use his new powers to fight crime in the jungle. He is later assisted by Janu, a young boy raised in the jungle.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Congorilla | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=87 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York City|New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>

===Justice League===
Years later, Bill (now known as Congorilla) is trapped in his gorilla form upon the death of his human body. He becomes the protector of a band of gorillas, and friend of the [[South African]] hero [[Freedom Beast]]. When the gorillas and Freedom Beast are slaughtered by hunters, Congorilla decides to seek justice.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #1</ref> After the trail leads to the villain [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], Congorilla teams up with [[Mikaal Tomas|Starman]], and eventually a splinter faction of the Justice League. After Prometheus's death, Congorilla becomes a full-time member of the Justice League.

During his time with the League, Bill faces off against such foes as the rogue [[Alan Scott|Starheart]]<ref>"Justice Society of America" (vol. 3) #41 (September 2010)</ref> and [[Eclipso]], and becomes close friends with Starman and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. He is also part of a much larger makeshift Justice League squad when the return of Batman from a seeming death threatens to destroy time and space.<ref>"Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne" #1-6 (May – November 2010)</ref> After [[Batman Inc.]] appoints the vigilante [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Batwing]] as the official Batman of Africa, Congorilla realizes that the continent is too big for one hero to handle. He ultimately chooses to resign from the JLA in order to help organize the superheroes of Africa into a more efficient team, as well as to find a worthy successor to carry on Freedom Beast's legacy.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #60</ref>

==Powers==
Before becoming Congorilla, Bill was a skilled hunter and aviator. As Congorilla, Bill's simian body grants him super-gorilla strength, endurance, agility, durability, and senses,  a regenerative healing process, and the ability to increase his height to tremendous levels.<ref>http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Congorilla_(Prime_Earth)</ref> To become Congorilla, Bill had to rub the magic ring he wore, which would swap his consciousness  with that of the Golden Gorilla, and vice versa.

==Other versions==
In the [[Elseworlds]] story ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Congo Bill (in his Congorilla form) makes an appearance in [[Professor Hamilton]]'s [[Cadmus Labs]].<ref>[[Davis, Alan]] (w, p), Farmer, Mark (i). ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>

In the alternate timeline of the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, Congorilla is killed by [[Gorilla Grodd]] in [[Gorilla City]]'s arena.<ref>''Flashpoint: Grodd of War'' one-shot (June 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

A future version of Congorilla appears in [[Alan Moore]]'s rejected proposal for the limited series ''[[Twilight of the Superheroes]]''. Now a crime boss in the superhero ghetto that hosts most of the retired or aged [[Golden Age]] crime fighters, Congorilla has remained in the body of the Golden Gorilla for decades, since his aging human body became too fragile. However, the body of Congo Bill refuses to die, is still inhabited by the spirit of the Golden Gorilla, and is now hidden away in Congorilla's apartment.
