'''Congorilla''', originally a human character known as '''Congo Bill''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]] and [[Vertigo Comics]]. Originally co-created by writer [[Whitney Ellsworth]] and artist [[George Papp]], he was later transformed into Congorilla by [[Robert Bernstein (comics writer)|Robert Bernstein]] and Howard Sherman. The character first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #56 (June [[1940 in comics|1940]]).

==Publication history==
''Congo Bill'' was a long running DC Comics adventure [[comic strip]], running in various DC Comics titles until ''[[Action Comics]]'' #248 (January [[1959 in comics|1959]]), when Congo Bill was transformed into Congorilla (the title of the strip was likewise changed). The ''Congo Bill'' strip was a standard adventure strip, often reminiscent of [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' [[newspaper]] strip.

''Action Comics'' #191 (April 1954) saw the introduction of [[Janu the Jungle Boy]], a young boy brought up in the jungle after his father had been killed by a tiger. The strip was a moderate success and moved from ''More Fun Comics'' to ''Action Comics'' with issue #37, where it stayed until issue #248 when it was transformed into ''Congorilla''. In 1954, DC awarded Congo Bill his own title, which lasted for seven issues (August/September 1954 â€“ August/September 1955).

The ''Congorilla'' series ran in ''Action Comics'' until issue #262, after which it was transferred to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'', where it ran until issue #283. Since the demise of its own series, Congorilla has mainly been seen as a guest star in other titles, including as part of the [[Forgotten Heroes]]. The character finally received a [[limited series|mini-series]] of his own in [[1994 in comics|1994]], where Congo Bill is betrayed by his (now corrupt) ward Janu, who usurps the Congorilla identity and Bill is forced to fight his adopted son to the death. In [[1999 in comics|1999]], DC Comics once again brought Congo Bill back for another four-issue [[limited series]] under the company's mature readership Vertigo Comics imprint. Congorilla returned in the 2009 series ''[[Cry for Justice]]'', joining a proactive splinter faction of the [[Justice League]]. Following that series, Congorilla became a full time member of the Justice League.

==Fictional character biography==
William "Congo Bill" Glenmorgan<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #47 (September 2010)</ref> was born in 1898, the son of a Scottish gamekeeper. At one point he was a member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25567 | title=WC10: Spotlight on James Robinson | last=Evans | first=Chris | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=April 5, 2010 | accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> and during [[World War I]] he worked as a spy in [[Austria]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #44 (June 2010)</ref> He later became a globe-trotting adventurer, and for a time worked for the Worldwide Insurance Company, protecting policies they had written and saving the company from fraudulent payouts.

Bill grew content to live in his adopted [[Africa]]n home, swearing to protect it from harm. There he befriended a witch doctor known as Chief Kawolo. When Kawolo was mortally injured in a fall, he summoned Bill to his bedside, and offered him a magic ring. Kawolo told the skeptical Congo Bill that, by rubbing the ring, he could transfer his consciousness into the body of the legendary Golden Gorilla. He accepted the ring to humor his friend's dying wish. Several weeks later, an earthquake trapped Bill in a deep cave. With no possible escape, Congo Bill hopelessly rubbed the magic ring. Instantly, his mind was transported into the body of the Golden Gorilla. Racing to the cave-in, he used his massive strength to clear the blocked entrance and wondering what had become of his body without him being "home". He realized that when his consciousness entered the body of the Gorilla, the creature's consciousness entered his own body. Bill decides to use his new powers to fight crime in the jungle. He is later assisted by Janu, a young boy raised in the jungle.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Congorilla | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=87 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>
