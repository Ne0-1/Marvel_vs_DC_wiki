'''Machine Teen''' was a [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], loosely based on [[Machine Man]] and created by [[Marc Sumerak]] and [[Mike Hawthorne]]. It was published as a five-issue [[limited series|mini-series]] and carried the [[Marvel Next]] logo.

The main character of Machine Teen is '''Adam Aaronson''', a high school student. He has a good life: he is captain of the all-star football team, a straight 'A' student and is liked by everyone. However, he discovers that he is really a [[robot]] created by the man he thought was his father, Isaac Aaronson.

== Character history ==
===Early life===
Some years ago, Aaron Isaacs, a pioneering programmer and engineer in the field of [[robotics]], made a breakthrough in [[Artificial intelligence]] making the ''Autonomosly Decislve Automated Meachanism''. But when he discovered his employer Holden Radcliffe had destroyed his work, Isaacs went on the run. He changed his name to Isaac Aaronson and built Adam, a [[Beta version]] of his A.I. project. Adam was programmed with false memories of a normal childhood and dead mother. Adam has a series of debilitating [[seizure]]s caused by a logic loop in his program and suffers memory loss, systems overload and, finally, a total shutdown. Adam, having no idea what he is, acts like a normal teenager, and starts dating schoolmate Carly Whitmere. Adam's best friend, J.T. Hunt, knows he is a robot.

===History 101001===
The story begins with a brief prologue. It shows Dr. Aaron Isaacs running from armed guards. After getting shot in the leg, he quickly jumps on board a train, showing relief and holding a computer core.

Some time later, Dr. Isaacs, having changed his name to Aaronson, is watching a [[American football|football]] game his son, Adam is playing in. Adam wins the game by throwing a touchdown pass to another teammate; however, the football knocks into the player and sends him flying into the goal post to win the game. Everyone, especially Adam, is very surprised but cheer that they won the game and rush to Adam. Not sure what is going on, Adam has a seizure and passes out. 

The next day, Adam goes to his classes as normal and meets with his best friend J.T and his girlfriend Carly. After one class, Officer Michaels, the school security guard, comes and brings Adam to the viceo-principal's office. The vice-principal thinks Adam is taking [[steroids]] or [[illegal drugs]], a notion started by Adam's high school rival, Ricky Sims. At football practice Ricky revealed he started the rumor Adam was taking drugs. They have a brief fight, and Adam has a seizure and suffers a memory blackout. Adam does not remember the seizure at all, and forgets all the information he studied for a test that day. After school he looks for J.T., but finds Ricky fighting him in an alley behind the school. Adam comes to J.T.'s defense and gets in another fight with Ricky. During the fight, Ricky accidentally shoves a piece of metal through Adam's hand and breaks it. Adam sees the broken wires in his hand and, not sure what he is, has another seizure and passes out. Ricky goes to Officer Michaels (who turns out works for Aaronson's former employer Holden Radcliffe) and tells him Adam is a robot. Michaels, in turn, tells Radcliffe. 

Back at home, Isaac Aaronson fixes Adam's hand, and later tells him the truth. Adam initially believes his "father" is lying to him, and says his memories, specifically about him falling off his bike when he was younger and being with his mom when she died, could not be fake. Aaronson shows Adam his blueprints, showing Adam that he was not lying. Confronted with this information, Adam becomes enraged and runs away. Seeing that Aaronson is alone, Michaels captures him and attacks Adam. Adam then goes to J.T. Hunt, who knows he is a robot, seeking help. J.T reveals that Before Adam was "born", J.T. worked for Aaronson as a lab assistant. One day he came across Adam's robotic body, and since then was forced to keep the truth about Adam a secret. After the Holden Radcliffe agents take Adam's "father" away, Adam and J.T.  start looking for him. The Holden Radcliffe Corporation is bent on getting their "stolen property" (Adam) back. Carly Whitmere, (Adam's girlfriend) unknowingly helped Radcliffe agents capture Adam. Radcliffe tries to hack into Adam and take control of him, however, he cannot. Adam manages to escape from Radcliffe, along with his father and friends, by tricking him, making Radcliffe believe that he has control over Adam. During the escape, Adam is nearly destroyed, and has to delay Radcliffe to let his father and friends escape. Dr. Aaronson escapes with Adam's computer core, which sets off a self-destruct sequence. Adam explodes, and Radcliffe and Michaels are caught in the explosion. One year later, Adam is rebuilt, entering a new high school, Edison High School, and starts a new life.

===The Initiative===
Adam is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.

==Powers and abilities==
As a humanoid robot, Adam has all the basic powers of an [[android]]. He has super strength, as seen when he easily rips open a steal door, freeing his friends from their captors. He also has limited durability, with bullets having little effect on him and being able to shrug off other physical attacks. Additionally, he has enhanced agility, as seen when he dodges opponents attacks and early on during the football game when he avoids the opponent players. As a robot, Adam has the ability to remember and easily memorize a lot of information. 

Despite these strengths, Adam also has several weaknesses. One weakness is any [[electromagnetic]] pulse can disable, or possibly kill, him. This is evidenced when he threatens to kill himself with an electromagnetic device, that his dad had made, in order to stop Radcliffe from hurting his father and friends. Another weakness is there is the possibility Adam can be hacked and reprogrammed. However, his father stated that he heavily encrypted Adam's files, as even Radcliffe was not able to take control of him. 

Before discovering his was a robot, Adam would suffer from seizures, which would cause him to pass out. These seizures were due to his mind not being able to understand why he could perform incredible feats of strength. When his seizures occur, Dr. Aaronson has to reboot him and wipe his memory. Since realizing why he had his abilities, Adam has not had this problem. While Adam is resistance to physical attacks, he can not resist high powered attacks. While trying to escape Radcliffe, Adam is shot with a high powered machine gun, which nearly destroys him. Parts of him are blown away and he's left barely able to move. 

Adam's chest cavity houses his central computer core, which stores all his information. If the core is removed, his father installed a fail safe which would cause Adam to self-destruct, in order to prevent anyone from recreating him for other purposes. Adam is still able to function even without the data core, but it is unknown for how long, and it is unknown how long the self-destruct sequence is. Once the core is removed, the sequence is irreversible. While this destroys Adam's body, it also kills anyone in the vicinity, with the blast having a wide area of effect. 

During the House of M event, Adam has several new features. While he is disassembled and experimented on, he is still able to talk and function properly. He is also able to reconnect his body parts with little issue, being able to draw his parts back to him. It is not explained what mechanism allows him to do so. Additionally, Adam can transform himself his arms into weapons, giving him an edge over his opponents.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
During the [[House of M]] event, Adam and his father joined up with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] after their lab was destroyed in an explosion by reactionary mutants. He gets captured and is for a while experimented on. When the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and A.I.M. attack, Adam helps cause a distraction, allowing the Hulk to win and conquer [[Australia]]. After this, he is called in by Bruce Banner to help with some paperwork. Adam, along with the rest of A.I.M., is ordered out of the country by the Hulk.
