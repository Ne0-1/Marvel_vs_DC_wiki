'''Jessan Hoan''' is a [[fictional character]] most often appearing in [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] stories in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She is a former banker turned crimelord who goes by the alias Tiger Tyger (or sometimes simply Tyger).

==Character biography==
Jessan Hoan worked at her family's bank, Hoan International Bank, when the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] robbed the bank. The Reavers kidnapped Jessan and killed several members of her family at the bank. While Jessan was a prisoner at the Reavers' Australian base, the Reaver named Pretty Boy tried to alter Jessan's mind so that she would join their criminal band as a financial expert. The [[X-Men]] interrupted the process, freed Jessan, and defeated the Reavers. The supernatural being [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] teleported Jessan back to her family's bank.

Jessan was ostracized by her family because she mysteriously survived the attacked that killed several other members of the Hoan family. In addition, Jessan found that she had lost some of her inhibitions as a result of the partial brainwashing by Pretty Boy. However, she was not wholely evil, either as she still retained most of her morality.

Jessan discovered that the Reavers had been hired to attack Hoan International bank by Roche, the crimelord of [[Madripoor]]. She moved to the island of Madripoor, where she became embroiled with the criminal element and adopted the alias Tiger Tyger. Wolverine later joined Jessan's efforts against Roche. Jessan decapitated Roche after he shot Wolverine.

As Tiger Tyger, Jessan became the new crimelord of Madripoor, but she refused to deal in either drugs or slavery. Wolverine allowed Tiger Tyger to operate, but decided to act as an ethical check on her enterprises.

==Skills and abilities==
Jessan Hoan's partial mental reprogramming granted her a high degree of martial art skill.

==Notes==
Jessan, as Tyger Tiger, briefly wore a highly resistant suit of armour that later came into the possession of the X-Man [[Psylocke]].
