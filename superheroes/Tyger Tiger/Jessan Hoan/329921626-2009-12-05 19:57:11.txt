==Fictional character biography==
Jessan Hoan was born in [[Singapore]]. She worked at her family's bank, Hoan International Bank, when the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] robbed the bank. The Reavers kidnap Jessan and kill several members of her family at the bank. While Jessan is a prisoner at the Reavers' Australian base, the Reaver named [[Pretty Boy (comics)|Pretty Boy]] tries to alter Jessan's mind so that she would join their criminal band as a financial expert. The [[X-Men]] interrupt the process, freed Jessan, and defeat the Reavers. The supernatural being [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] teleports Jessan back to her family's bank.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229</ref>

Jessan is ostracized by her family because she mysteriously survives the attack that killed several of her relatives. In addition, Jessan found that she had lost some of her inhibitions as a result of the partial brainwashing by Pretty Boy. However, she is not wholly evil, as she still retains most of her morality.<ref name=MCP6>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #6 (Early November 1988).</ref>

Jessan discovers that the Reavers had been hired to attack Hoan International bank by Roche, the crime lord of [[Madripoor]]. She moves to the island of Madripoor, where she became embroiled with the criminal element and adopted the alias "Tyger Tiger", after the [[William Blake]] poem "[[The Tyger]]".<ref name=MCP6></ref>  Wolverine later joins Jessan's efforts against Roche. Jessan decapitates Roche after he shoots Wolverine.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #10 (Early January 1989).</ref>

As Tyger Tiger, Jessan becomes the new crime lord of Madripoor, but she refuses to deal in either drugs or slavery. For a time she briefly wore a highly resistant suit of armor, a duplicate of the armor used by the X-Man [[Psylocke]].<ref>''Wolverine'' #6-7 (April-May 1989).</ref> 

Wolverine allows Tyger Tiger to operate, but decides to act as an ethical check on her enterprises. Later, when Tony Stark manages to overthrow [[Madame Hydra]]'s government of the region, control is given to Tyger Tiger, now turned into a [[Robin Hood]]-esque figure.

==Powers and abilities==
Jessan Hoan's partial mental reprogramming granted her a high degree of martial art skill. She is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and proficient at using fire-arms and hand-held weapons.
