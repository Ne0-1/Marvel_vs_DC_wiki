'''Man Mountain Marko''' ('''Michael Marko''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain.  Marko was and remains an affiliate of numerous [[List of criminal organizations in comics#Marvel Comics|organized-crime entities]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] universe, including the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].  He was originally introduced as the right hand man of [[Silvermane]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #73 and created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]].

He was allied with [[Silvermane]], Caesar Cicero, [[Eel (comics)#Eel I|the Eel]], and [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]].  His most frequent enemies were [[Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Thunderbolt (Marvel Comics)|Thunderbolt]], and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]].

==Fictional character biography==
Marko is first seen as Silvermane's loyal lieutenant in an incident dealing with an ancient tablet. He is quickly defeated by Spider-Man.

Marko, along with the villains Eel, [[Discus (comics)|Discus]] and [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]] rob the Debutante Ball of Millie Hogarth. Unfortunately, for them, Millie's father is the agent for Power Man and Iron Fist, who were called in to defeat the villains. 

During a trip to gather protection money, Marko has some sort of breakdown and trashes an entire bar, with Spider-Man inside of it. Investigative reported [[Ben Urich]] tells Spider-Man that Marko has apparently also kidnapped a child. Ben knows of a facillity where Marko is known to work out. Spider-Man finds steroids in Marko's locker. The owner of the gym tells him that the Maggia genetically altered Marko in order to make him stronger. Spider-Man steals information from the Maggia and confronts Marko at his home. Eventually Marko is subdued and it turns out the kid he 'kidnapped' simply had a twisted sense of hero worship, admiring Marko's size and strength.

Man Mountain Marko is later seen as a sexually threatening hitman sent after private investigator [[Jessica Jones]]<ref>''Alias'' #4</ref><ref>''Alias'' #5</ref>. This was part of a conspiracy by a powerful business magnate who wished to use Jones and [[Captain America]] as a way to humiliate the current President of the United States. Jones severely beats Marko, then literally throws him at the feet of the businessman, who was in the middle of a golf game. Marko and his bosses are soon arrested by [[Clay Quartermain]] and the forces of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]

Marko is then in the employ of an albino mafia don, who under his orders physically assaults Luke Cage before being defeated<ref>''Cage'' #???</ref>. 

===Civil War===
He was recently visible among an army of super-villains organized by [[Hammerhead]] that was captured by [[Iron Man]] and SHIELD agents<ref>''[[Civil War: War Crimes]]'' #1</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Marko has been shown to have superhuman strength and endurance, roughly comparable to if not slightly exceeding that of [[Spider-Man]]. It has been said this is a result of steroids and genetic manipulation.
