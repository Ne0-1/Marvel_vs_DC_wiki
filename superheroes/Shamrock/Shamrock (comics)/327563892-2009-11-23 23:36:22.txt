==Fictional character biography==
'''Molly Fitzgerald''' was born in [[Dunshaughlin]], Ireland, and was the daughter of a militant member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]].  As Shamrock, she serves as a vessel for displaced poltergeists and souls that have died as innocent victims of war; these spirits manifest themselves for fractions of seconds to cause good luck for her and bad luck for those who oppose her.

She was teleported away by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], along with hundreds of other heroes of Earth, so that the Grandmaster and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] could choose champions from among them. Shamrock was chosen for Death's team, fighting alongside fellow heroes [[Peregrine (comics)|Le Peregrine]], [[Iron Man]], [[Vanguard (comics)|Vanguard]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Arabian Knight (comics)#Abdul Qamar|Arabian Knight]], [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], and the [[Collective Man]].  When the Grandmaster's team won the contest, the heroes were returned to Earth. 

Later, her father drugged her to allow [[Arnim Zola]] to attempt to duplicate her powers.

She later retired from superhero activity and became a hairdresser.
