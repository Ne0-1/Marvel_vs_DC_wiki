'''Fusion''' is a name of two [[Fictional character|fictional]], [[supervillain]]s owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who exist in that company's [[Marvel Universe]]. Both characters are enemies of [[Spider-Man]].

==Fusion I (Twin Terror)==
===Fictional character biography===

'''Hubert and Pinky Fusser''' are twins. Both born with dwarfism, one becomes a nuclear scientist, and one becomes janitor at the same privately-owned research corporation where his brother works.

When an accident strikes Hubert (the scientist), his brother Pinky rushes to assist. The resulting radiation causes them to become one, a Fusion - a twin-headed radioactive being which contains both of their personalities.

As Fusion, Hubert wishes to pursue plans for extraordinary research which are not in the best interests of humanity. Pinky, however, wants to end the madness. 

Eventually, they are separated by [[Spider-Man]].

==Fusion II (Markley)==
===Fictional character biography===

A [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] capable of persuading people and manipulating their senses, '''Fusion''' is a millionaire who can get anything he wants. After Fusion's son, Francis, dies as a result of trying to imitate Spider-Man, Fusion attempts to take revenge on him. He attacks and brutally beats Spider-Man by morphing his body parts into those of various heroes. Capturing and brutally torturing Spider-Man in an abandoned warehouse, Fusion is defeated when Spider-Man, realizing the nature of Fusion's powers, manages to pummel him into submission. When he next appears, Fusion, having teamed-up with Doctor Octopus, through a bizarre plot of dismembering and mind-controlling people, manages to get a device which allows him to track Spider-Man. Soon after gaining the device, Fusion is beaten horribly by the traitorous [[Dr. Octopus]] and is left for dead, but yet he survives.

==Powers and abilities==

The Twin Terror brothers have Superhuman strength, and they can Glow and emit radiation.

Markley can persuade people to do what he wants, to see what he wants, and to hear what he wants. Basically, he controls peoples' perceptions. This renders the Spider-Sense useless. He also has a lot of hi-tech equipment, including a small wand that can detonate at a given voice code, and that he throws persuading everybody else that it's [[Captain America's shield]], or Thor's [[Mjolnir]], or other famous weapons.
