'''Fusion''' is a name of two [[Fictional character|fictional]], [[supervillain]]s owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who exist in that company's [[Marvel Universe]]. Both characters are enemies of [[Spider-Man]].

==Fusion I (Twin Terror)==
===Fictional character biography===
'''Hubert and Pinky Fusser''' are twins. Both born with dwarfism, one becomes a nuclear scientist, and one becomes janitor at the same privately-owned research corporation where his brother works.

When an accident strikes Hubert (the scientist), his brother Pinky rushes to assist. The resulting radiation causes them to become one, a Fusion - a twin-headed radioactive being which contains both of their personalities.

As Fusion, Hubert wishes to pursue plans for extraordinary research which are not in the best interests of humanity. Pinky, however, wants to end the madness. 

Eventually, they are separated by [[Spider-Man]].

==Fusion II (Markley)==
===Fictional character biography===
When he was a child, Markley discovered he had the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to persuade people into doing whatever he wanted, simultaneously manipulating their senses. Using his power, he made millions, using his money to develop systems to enhance his abilities even further, to the point where he became- in his own words- a "more-than-perfect killing machine". 
After his son, Jeremy, dies as a result of trying to imitate Spider-Man, Fusion, unable to accept the fact that there was something his powers couldn't accomplish, decided to take revenge on Spider-Man. He attacks and brutally beats Spider-Man by morphing his body parts into those of various heroes, his apparent abilities ranging between the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Mr Fantastic]]. Capturing and brutally torturing Spider-Man in an abandoned warehouse, Fusion is defeated when Spider-Man, realizing the nature of Fusion's powers, manages to pummel him into submission by denying the reality of Fusion's illusions. 

When he next appears, Fusion had apparently forcibly recruited [[Doctor Octopus]] as his lackey, having discovered Octavius working in one of his factories under an assumed name and then "forcing" him to work for him, Ock apparently convinced that he possessed genuine powers. Having forced Octavius to create detailed cybernetic limbs that are capable of influencing the thoughts of their wearers, Fusion arranged for various military officials to lose their limbs in accidents with the aid of a corrupt senator, allowing him to gain control of the radiation-tracking satellite "John Hancock"- one used by [[John Ryker|General Ryker]] to track the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]- with the intention of using it to track Spider-Man's unique radiation signature and then kill him. However, having acquired the device, Octavius revealed that he had simply pretended to be weak in order to acquire the "John Hancock" device to sell it to the highest bidder, subsequently beating Fusion half to death. After finding Fusion's mangled body, Spider-Man called an ambulance and subsequently tracked Octavius to a construction site, defeating his old foe (While simultaneosuly destroying the John Hancock device to prevent it being used to track heroes such as himself and the Hulk in the future).

==Powers and abilities==
The Twin Terror brothers have Superhuman strength, and they can Glow and emit radiation.

Markley can persuade people to do what he wants, to see what he wants, and to hear what he wants. Basically, he controls peoples' perceptions. This renders the Spider-Sense useless. He also has a lot of hi-tech equipment, including a small wand that can detonate at a given voice code, and that he throws persuading everybody else that it's [[Captain America's shield]], or Thor's [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]], or other famous weapons. However, this power can be thrown off once the person knows what Fusion really is, rendering them relatively useless in a fight once he has lost the initial advantage.
