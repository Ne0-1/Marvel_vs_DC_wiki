'''Kismet''', also known as '''Paragon''' and  '''Her''' is a fictional [[superhero]]ine featured in [[comics]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] and set in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Biography==
Originally known as '''Paragon''', Kismet was created artificially  by the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]], their second attempt (the first being Him, later known as [[Adam Warlock]]) to create a superpowerful being under their control. "Born" before she was fully formed, Paragon appeared as a muscular man who battled the Hulk until she overrode the Enclave's control and sunk their Beehive headquarters before incubating herself in a cocoon much like Warlock often would.

When she emerged from the cocoon in her more familiar gold-skinned form, a female replicant of Warlock, she took the name '''Her''' (a reference to Warlock's original name of "Him") and sought Warlock out to mate with him. However Warlock had died some years earlier, travelling a short time into the future to steal his own soul with his [[Soul Gem]] in a twisted suicide. Confident she would be able to revive him, she managed to restore and reanimate his body, but with his mind and soul missing, she was forced to sadly return him to his grave.

Some time after this, she discovered that he had been resurrected body and soul - but caring nothing for her, he rejected her, leaving her sobbing on the ground. After this, she held a "competition" among some of the most powerful men on Earth, attaching pods to their necks to see how they would react. As [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] was the only one who did not destroy his pod, she turned her attentions to him for a time, until his girlfriend Kayla Ballantine (in possession of the [[Star Brand (comics)|Star Brand]]) severely beat her and forced her to return to cocoon form to heal.  During her adventures with Quasar she took the name '''Kismet''', after the Arabic for [[destiny|fate]].
