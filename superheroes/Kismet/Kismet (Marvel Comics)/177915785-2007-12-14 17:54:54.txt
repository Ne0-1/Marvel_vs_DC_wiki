'''Kismet''', also known as '''Paragon''' and  '''Her''' is a fictional [[superhero]]ine featured in [[comics]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] and set in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Originally known as '''Paragon''', Kismet was created artificially  by the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]], their second attempt (the first being Him, later known as [[Adam Warlock]]) to create a superpowerful being under their control. "Born" before she was fully formed, Paragon appeared as a muscular man who battled the Hulk until she overrode the Enclave's control and sunk their Beehive headquarters before incubating herself in a cocoon much like Warlock often would.  

When she emerged from the cocoon in her more familiar [[blonde]]-haired, golden-skinned form she was dressed scantily-clad only in a red [[swimsuit]]. As a female replicant of Warlock, she took the name of '''Her''' (a reference to Warlock's original name of "Him") and sought Warlock out to mate with him. However, Warlock had died some years earlier, travelling a short time into the future to steal his own soul with his [[Soul Gem]] in a twisted suicide. Confident she would be able to revive him, she manages to restore and reanimate his body, but with his mind and soul missing, she was forced to sadly return him to his grave.

Some time after this, she discovered that he had been resurrected body and soul - but caring nothing for her, he rejects her, leaving her sobbing on the ground. After this, she held a "competition" among some of the most powerful men on Earth, attaching pods to their necks to see how they would react. As [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] was the only one who did not destroy his pod, she turns her attentions to him for a time, until his girlfriend Kayla Ballantine (in possession of the [[Star Brand (comics)|Star Brand]]) severely beat her and forced her to return to cocoon form to heal. 

Around this time, she examines the other heroes of Earth, judging them on mating status. For example, she rejects the men of the X-Men, as their genetic structure makes them too unstable. She also helps Quasar out in '''Operation: Galactic Storm''', willingly guarding the Star Gates that, by their very operation, threaten Earth's existence. This does not go well, as she becomes involved in a fight with Binary. 

During her adventures with Quasar she took the name '''Kismet''', after the Arabic for [[destiny|fate]].

Later still, she changed her name again, this time to '''Ayesha'''. During this time, she was under the control of '''Crucible''' on Genosha.<ref>''http://www.marvel.com/universe/OHOTMU:Bibliography-AZ6#Kismet''</ref>

==Other version==
===Earth X===
In Earth X, Mar-Vell is reincarnated as the child of the synthetic Adam Warlock  and Kismet.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
Stakar Vaughn, [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]], was born to the superheroes Quasar and Kismet in the Guardians of the Galaxy alternate timeline (Earth-691) around the year 2002. Stakar is instantly stolen by Era, the evil child of Eon, and raised by friendly aliens. Kismet retreats to a monastery for hundreds of years, where she vows to not use her powers. Stakar, a grown adult, finds her and together they visit Quasar's grave. It is learned, through Era and the Hawk-God Stakar worships, that Quasar had been purposely sent to his death and Eon himself had been entrapped. Kismet and Stakar dedicate themselves to hunting down Era.

===Fantastic Four: The End===
In the limited series, Fantastic Four: The End, Kismet (under the name of Ayesha) has apparently taken over the Captain Marvel mantle in the not-too-distant future.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four: The End]]'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref>
