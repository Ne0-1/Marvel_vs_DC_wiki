'''The Fiddler''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and a reoccurring foe of the first [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Jay Garrick]]). He first appeared in ''All-Flash #32'' (December 1947- January 1948).

== Character History ==
The son of [[British]] aristocrats, Isaac Bowin had a talent with music, but had an impulse to travel. Running out of money, he resorted to theft and robbery to make ends meet until he was arrested in [[India]] and sent to jail. While in prison, he met a [[fakir]], charming a snake in his cell. Bowin asked him to teach him the "mystic art" of Indian music, to which he complied. For the next five years, he learned the fakir's secret and made a crude [[violin]] made of material he can scrounge in the prison. He developed the ability to use his violin to play sounds that could either  hypnotize others, shatter objects, or create barriers. After Bowin had learned enough, he used the instrument to hypnotize the guards to open their cells and he and the fakir escape. He, then, murders the fakir and the merchant who had him arrested in the first place.

Returning to [[United States|America]], the Fiddler, as he calls himself now, made his first stop at [[Keystone City]]. There, his twin brother, who was a renouned violinist, was holding a concert, and the Fiddler wanted to ruin his brother's good name. While the Fiddler managed to humiliate Flash the first time they met, Flash was able to foil his plan. Since then, he continues to plague Flash I again and again. He even joined the [[Injustice Society]] at one point.

Disappointed by the Fiddler's performance during their first mission, [[Mockingbird (comics)|Mockingbird]] deemed him "incompetent" and was ordered killed. [[Deadshot]] carried out the execution and he was replaced by [[Catman (comics)|Catman]].
