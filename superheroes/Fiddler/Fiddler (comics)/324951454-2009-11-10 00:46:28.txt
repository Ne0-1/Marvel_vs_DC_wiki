'''The Fiddler''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and a recurring foe of the first [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]). He first appeared in ''All-Flash #32'' (December 1947- January 1948).

==Fictional character biography==
The Fiddler's history was changed somewhat in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

===Pre-Crisis===
The Fiddler started out as a thief who was arrested in [[India]] and sent to jail. While in prison, he met a [[fakir]], [[snake charming|charming a snake]] in his cell, who taught him the "mystic art" of Indian music. For the next five years, he learned the fakir's secret and made a crude [[violin]] made of material he can scrounge in the prison. He developed the ability to use his violin to play sounds that could either hypnotize others, shatter objects, or create barriers.<ref name="dc-ency-aw">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Crazy Creations | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 92  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> After the fakir declared his student had surpassed him, he used the instrument to hypnotize the guards to open their cells and he and the fakir escaped. He then murdered the fakir and the merchant who had him arrested in the first place.

Returning to [[United States|America]], the Fiddler, as he called himself, made his first stop at [[Keystone City]]. While the Fiddler managed to humiliate the Flash ([[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]) the first time they met, Flash was able to foil his plan, which involved replacing Maestro Bowin, a violin virtuoso, who was actually the Fiddler's twin brother. The physical similarity between the brothers (who had been separated at birth) also led to Bowin briefly being suspected of the Fiddler's crimes.

Since then, he continued to plague Flash I again and again. He was a member of the original [[Injustice Society]].

Later, the Fiddler was part of a trio of criminals that caused the original Flash to come out of retirement. The Fiddler, along with [[The Shade]] and [[Thinker (DC Comics)|The Thinker]] were stopped by the first of many team ups of [[DC Multiverse|Earth One and Earth Two]] heroes in the classic "Flash of Two Worlds" story from ''Flash'' (volume I) #123 (September 1961). [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], the Earth-1 Flash, visited Earth-2 accidentally and looked up his comic book hero, the original Flash. Together, the two Flashes stopped the villains. This issue led to many other team ups between Earth-1 and Earth-2 heroes and villains. 

The Fiddler uses a fiddle to control those around him. He travels around in his Fiddle Car, which Jay Garrick recognizes by sight.

===Post Crisis===
The son of [[United Kingdom|British]] aristocrats, '''Isaac Bowin''' had a talent with music, and an impulse to travel. Running out of money, he resorted to theft and robbery to make ends meet until he was arrested in [[India]] and sent to jail. He then met a fakir, much as in the pre-Crisis version.

Returning to [[United States|America]] and taking on a new identity, that of the Fiddler, Bowen made his first stop at [[Keystone City]]. The main difference between this new origin and the original story is that he was aware Maestro Bowin was his twin and wanted to ruin his brother's good name. He continued to plague Jay Garrick for many years, eventually joining with the Thinker and the Shade to remove Keystone City from the world's vision and memory. Barry Allen inadvertently crossed the vibrational barrier the Fiddler created in [[Grant Morrison]]'s post-Crisis version of the first Jay/Barry team-up, "Flash of Two Cities" in ''Secret Origins'' #50 (Aug 1990). As in the original story, the two Flashes defeated the villains together.

During the 1986 DC mini-series ''Legends'', the people of America are turned against heroes, and a law was made that no one could operate legally wearing a costume. 
 
For the Fiddler this period proved an opportune time to join with his old comrade the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] in his new [[Injustice Society]], now called ''Injustice Unlimited''.  They overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in Calgary, Canada, namely [[Infinity, Inc.]] and a contingent of the [[Global Guardians]]. They forced the heroes to help in some mayhem.  The Fiddler took [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]] and the [[Green Flame]] to London and, with their help, stole a very prized Stradivarius violin.  They then returned to Calgary to share in the stolen wealth being gathered by the Wizard but the plan went haywire when [[Hourman]] (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself, as well as when [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] was brought in from the Arctic Circle.  It was Hourman who incapacitates the Fiddler by destroying the Stradivarius, and after the confusion he was taken into custody by Canadian law enforcement.  (Infinity Inc 35-37 1987)

In [[John Ostrander]]'s ''[[Hawkworld]]'' series, it was revealed that the fakir who taught Bowen his hypnotic skills was actually a [[demon]]. The Fiddler apparently dies in that story, but has resurfaced since. The same demon would turn a heavy-metal guitarist into a 1990s version of the Fiddler called the '''Thrasher'''. The Thrasher was defeated by [[Hawkman]], and has not reappeared. It is not clear if this version of the Fiddler's origin is still in continuity.

An '''Iowa Bowin''', claiming to be the Fiddler's great-grandson, appeared in ''Flash 80-Page Giant'' #2, in a story set in the future. Although his guitar-based version of his great-grandfather's powers initially caused chaos, he wished to be a hero, working alongside [[Kid Flash (Iris West)]].

===Death===

In the first issue of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries ''[[Villains United]]'', the Fiddler has joined the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. Disappointed by the Fiddler's performance against H.I.V.E. agents during their first mission, [[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]] deems him "incompetent" and orders him killed. [[Deadshot]] carries out the execution, and the Fiddler was replaced by [[Catman (comics)|Catman]].  The Fiddler's violin is later found to be in the possession of [[Virtuoso (comics)|Virtuoso]], a woman allied with the Secret Society. Most recently though, a man resembling the Fiddler makes a cameo in Green Arrow/[[Black Canary]] shown upset in  room filled with violins destroyed by a recent fight between Green Arrow, Black Canary, and a mugger outside

Fiddler has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. In ''Blackest Night'' #4 he is one of many dead super-villains revived as members of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].

==Powers and abilities==
The Fiddler possesses magical abilities that he channels through his violins. The musical vibrations he creates can shatter solid objects, create force-fields and hypnotize others.

He uses violins gimmicked with weapons such as blades and guns.

==Other versions==
*Fiddler has appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book in issue #8.
