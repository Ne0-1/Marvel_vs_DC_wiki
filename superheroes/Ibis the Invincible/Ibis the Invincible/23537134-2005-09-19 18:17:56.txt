'''Ibis the Invincible''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]], created by [[Bill Parker]] and [[Bob Kingett]] for ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2. He was originally published by [[Fawcett Comics]], and is now owned by [[DC Comics]].

Ibis began his life as '''Amentep''', who ruled [[ancient Egypt]] with his queen '''Taia''' by his side. One night many centuries later, in an [[United States|American]] [[museum]], the mummy of Amentep comes back to life. As a young man, Amentep had been given the '''Ibis-stick''', a [[talisman]] of incredible power, by the Egyptian god [[Thoth]], who empowers the talisman. The revived Amentep, now called "Ibis", can do almost anything with the power of the Ibis-stick: build force-fields around cities, transport himself and others, and even make objects appear out of thin air.

Ibis was reintroduced in the modern [[DC Universe]] in ''The Power of Shazam!'' #11, in which he is resurrected by [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Uncle Marvel|"Uncle" Dudley]] in order to save the wizard [[Shazam (comics character)|Shazam]] from being held captive in [[Hell]] by the demoness [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]].
