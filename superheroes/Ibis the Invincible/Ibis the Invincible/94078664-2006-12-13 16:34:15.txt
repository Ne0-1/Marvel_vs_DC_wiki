'''Ibis the Invincible''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]], created by [[Bill Parker]] and [[Bob Kingett]] for ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2. He was originally published by [[Fawcett Comics]], and is now owned by [[DC Comics]]. Like many magician superheroes of the era, Ibis owes much to the popular comic strip character [[Mandrake the Magician]].

==History==
Ibis began his life as '''Amentep''', a prince of [[ancient Egypt]] who was in love with the beautiful '''Princess Taia''' of Thebes. As a young man, Amentep had been given the '''Ibis-stick''', a [[talisman]] of incredible power, by the Egyptian god [[Thoth]], who empowers the talisman. Amentep's throne was eventually usurped by a cruel magician known as the Black Pharaoh, who shot Taia with a poisoned arrow. Using his Ibis-stick, Amentep placed his beloved in suspended animation to allow her to heal. He soon cast a similar spell upon himself, hoping to be present when Taia revived.

Centuries later, the mummy of Amentep returned to life in an [[United States|American]] [[museum]] in 1940 (this was later revealed to be the work of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]]). Now called "Ibis," Amentep set out in search of his beloved, eventually finding her at another museum. Seeking to adjust to this new world, Ibis used his vast powers to become a crimefighter, operating primarily in Fawcett City.

Ibis could do almost anything with the power of the Ibis-stick: build force-fields around cities, transport himself and others, and even make objects appear out of thin air. Without the wand however, he was powerless and this weakness was frequently exploited by his enemies.

When superheroes declined in popularity in the early 1950s, Ibis and the other Fawcett characters ceased publication. They were later licensed and eventually bought outright by [[DC Comics]] in the 1970s. Ibis and Taia appeared in one of the company's [[Justice League]]/[[Justice Society]] crossovers as members of a team referred to as Shazam's Squadron of Justice. At this time, DC established the Fawcett heroes as existing on a world called Earth-S.

After the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' series consolidated the multiple Earths, Ibis and Taia were established as part of the Golden Age era of the [[DC Universe]] with Ibis serving alongside other war-time heroes in the [[All-Star Squadron]].

==Current status==
Ibis was reintroduced in the modern [[DC Universe]] in ''The Power of Shazam!'' #11, in which he is resurrected by [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Uncle Marvel|"Uncle" Dudley]] in order to save the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] from being held captive in [[Hell]] by the demoness [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]].  Recently, it was revealed in [[Zatanna]] #1, part of the ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' miniseries, that Ibis and Taia presumably perished along with [[Doctor Thirteen]] and [[Swamp Thing]] supporting character Timothy Ravenwind at the hands of the shapeless creature known as Gwydion during a seance conducted by Zatanna.

In an odd post-death appearance, Ibis had a cameo in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', after winding up back on Earth-S with the other Fawcett superheroes. Also, a modernised version of Ibis recently appeared in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #10 as the [[Egypt|Egyptian]] representative in [[Black Adam]]'s coalition. It has not been shown whether this Ibis is the same character as the previous one.

A character called Ibis will also appear in his own one-shot in January. It's unclear which version of the character it will be.
