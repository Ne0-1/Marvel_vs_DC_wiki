==Fictional character biography==
{{tense|date=September 2011}}
Dennis Dunphy was born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. Dennis becomes an aspiring athlete who receives the strength augmentation treatments offered by [[Power Broker]], Inc. Finding himself too strong now for normal sports, he becomes a professional wrestler and member of the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] (UCWF) along with other superheroes and supervillains such as the [[Beyonder]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]]. He refuses to throw a fight with the Thing, and was defeated.<ref>''Thing'' #28 (October 1985).</ref> He was later mentally compelled by the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]] to attack the Thing.<ref>''Thing'' #34 (April 1986).</ref> Dunphy refuses the Power Broker's order to help kill [[Sharon Ventura|Ms. Marvel]]. He revealed his addiction to the Power Broker's drug to the Thing, and went through a painful withdrawal when the Power Broker cut off his drug supply.<ref>''Thing'' #35 (May 1986).</ref>

After the fall of the UCWF, Dunphy becomes the Demolition Man and teams up with [[Captain America]] to investigate Power Broker, Inc. His costume is intentionally designed so the body of it is a duplicate of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'s first costume, and the hood is a knock-off of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s. He is successful in rescuing Captain America from [[Karl Malus]] and helping Captain America catch him.<ref>''Captain America'' #328 (April 1987).</ref> Dunphy is captured by the Power Broker and subjected to further treatments which augment his strength further but damage his heart. While under the influence of the stimulant, he goes mad and attacks Captain America. Dunphy suffers a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and his second augmentation is reversed and he is hospitalized.<ref>''Captain America'' #330-331 (June–July 1987).</ref> Dunphy takes a step back from superhero activity to take over Captain America's hotline.

Soon after this, Steve Rogers is stripped of his Captain America costume by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] (CSA) and goes missing. Demolition Man joins [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], and [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] in searching for Rogers. They discover Rogers, who had renamed himself simply "The Captain", and they all become a short-lived informal team. They defeat the [[Serpent Squad]] in their first outing.<ref>''Captain America'' #336-337 (Dec. 1987–Jan. 1988).</ref> D-Man aids the Captain, Falcon, and Nomad against [[Famine (comics)|Famine]].<ref>''Captain America'' #339 (March 1988).</ref> D-Man is nearly killed in battle by [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]].<ref>''Captain America'' #340 (April 1988).</ref> He begins teaching Vagabond hand-to-hand combat, but is attacked by a jealous Nomad. He fights [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] and [[Slither (comics)|Slither]] of the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #342 (June 1988).</ref> He is attacked and poisoned by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], and mistakenly fights [[Battlestar (comics)|Battle Star]]. Dunphy is arrested by the CSA and held for questioning about the Captain's activities.<ref>''Captain America'' #344 (August 1988).</ref>

When Dennis is finally released by the CSA, he seeks out the Captain, discovering that not only has his team disbanded, but that the East Coast [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] team have also just disbanded and that the Captain is seeking new members. The Captain inducts Demolition Man as the first of his new Avengers and they almost immediately leave on a mission at the request of Battlestar. Battlestar's partner is [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]], Captain America's replacement, who has been captured by [[Flag-Smasher]] and his group [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]]. While Battlestar and the Captain investigate ULTIMATUM's Arctic base, Demolition Man is left with their plane. During the fight, the Captain discovers that Flag-Smasher's base contains a [[doomsday weapon]] (an electromagnetic pulse generator), and he orders Dunphy to set the plane on course to crash into the base and then bail out. Dennis sets course, but then sees an enemy agent land on the plane. Dunphy elects to stay on the plane to ensure that it connects. The plane explodes apparently with Dunphy in it, and Captain America is unable to find any trace of him.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Mark Gruenwald | Penciler = Kieron Dwyer | Inker = Al Milgrom | Story = Icecap | Title = '''Captain America''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 349 | Date = January 1989 | Publisher = '''[[Marvel Comics]]''' | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

In a later adventure with [[Jack Frost (Marvel Comics)#Jack Frost (Golden Age)|Jack Frost]], Cap sees what he believes to be Dunphy's body frozen in [[suspended animation]] in ice near the North Magnetic Pole in the Arctic. However, he is unable to free him at that time.<ref>''Captain America'' #384</ref> Demolition Man had survived the explosion, but suffered wounds that rendered him mute and in a stupor, and is discovered living among Eskimos. During a backup story to "[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]", he is rescued by [[U.S. Agent]] and the Falcon and recovers under Avengers' care.<ref>''Captain America'' #400-401 (May–June 1992).</ref> In time he becomes a hero of a subterranean group of [[homeless people]] called the [[Zero People]]. Dennis appears when the Avengers are attacked by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan LeFay]]'s forces. His inattention to hygiene causes many to sit far away from him.<ref>''Avengers'' Volume 3, #1 (Feb 1998).</ref>

It is later established that Dunphy has become delusional and mentally unstable.<ref>''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'' #13 (March 2006).</ref> His intentions remain pure, but he has begun to believe that a "Cosmic Gamemaster" has asked him to retrieve the seven [[Infinity Gems]], which D-Man carries out by stealing common jewelry. At [[Ben Urich]]'s request, D-Man's hero Daredevil comes into the sewers and persuades Dennis to get some help.<ref>''The Pulse'' #15</ref>

===Civil War/The Initiative===
In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: War Crimes]]'', an unnamed newspaper carries the headline "D-Parted: D-Man On The Run After Whereabouts Revealed By Anonymous Tip."

===Dark Reign===
{{See also|Dark Reign (comics)}}
D-Man has been shown to be serving in the U.S. military in his civilian identity and covertly in his Demolition Man costume. For a while, he inspires several of his fellow soldiers to operate covertly in costumes as well, but he put a stop to that out of concern for their military careers. He continues operating by himself. How he recovered from the brain damage/mental instability he had been suffering from is unknown at this point.<ref>"Marvel Assistant Size Spectacular" #2 (March 2009).</ref>

===Age of Heroes===
In a one-page strip in ''I Am An Avenger'' #2, D-man attends a picnic at Avengers Mansion and competes in a pie-eating contest, besting The Thing, Protector, and Valkyrie.<ref>''I Am An Avenger'' #2</ref>

D-Man makes an appearance in ''New Avengers'' #7, while various heroes are being interviewed to be a nanny for Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. He appears to be spontaneously weeping and his only lines are "I am so lonely...", "I think I came off desperate before--" and "Does Captain America ever talk about me?". When Jessica Jones says her mind is made up on a nanny, Cage quips "D-Man it is." to which she responds "Cute."<ref>''New Avengers'' #7</ref>

===Revengers===
D-Man is set to join [[Wonder Man]]'s team  of [[Revengers#Earth-616 Revengers|Revengers]] in the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] [[2011 in comics|2011]] Annual.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' 2011</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Augmentation of Dennis Dunphy's physical attributes by Dr. [[Karl Malus]] on behalf of the [[Power Broker]] increased his physical strength, stamina, and durability to superhuman levels. Dunphy possesses superhuman strength sufficient to enable him to lift at least 15 tons. He was addicted to a drug supplied by the Power Broker, but after his drug supply was cut off, his superhuman strength decreased to its current level.<ref>''Thing'' vol. 1 #35-36</ref>

He has a heart condition, increasing his vulnerability to excessive exertion.

Dennis is a skilled aircraft pilot. He is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, especially in wrestling, and received further training from Captain America.

==Other versions==
===Queen's Vengeance===
When [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] usurps the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s powers and remakes the world in ''Avengers'' vol. 3, all of the Avengers members are remade into [[medieval]] versions possessing the same powers. In this reality, Demolition Man is renamed '''Serf'''.
