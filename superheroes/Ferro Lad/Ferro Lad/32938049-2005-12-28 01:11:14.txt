'''Ferro Lad''' is a [[fictional character]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the thirtieth century of the [[DC Universe]]. He is Andrew Nolan of [[Earth]]. He has the power to transform himself to living [[iron]]. He has a twin brother named Douglas who has the same power. Both twins have deformed faces as a side effect of the [[mutation]] that gave them their powers and so both wear iron masks.
