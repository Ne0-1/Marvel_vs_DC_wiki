'''Ferro Lad''' is a [[fictional character]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the thirtieth century of the [[DC Universe]]. He is Andrew Nolan of [[Earth]]. He has the power to transform himself to living [[iron]]. He has a twin brother named Douglas who has the same power. Both twins have deformed faces as a side effect of the [[mutation]] that gave them their powers and so both wear iron masks. He first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #346 (July 1966), he joined at the same time as [[Princess Projectra]], [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] and [[Nemesis Kid]].

Ferro Lad was only a Legionnaire for a short time when he was killed destroying the [[Sun-Eater]] with a bomb in ''Adventure Comics'' #353. His self-sacrifice to save the galaxy made him legendary, despite his short tenure as a Legionnaire.

In post-Zero Hour continuity he is known as Ferro and comes from 20th century Earth. For more details, see [[Ferro (comics)|Ferro]].

It was incorrectly believed that Ferro Lad was one of the primary inspirations for [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[X-Men]].[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/05/18/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-51/]
*To note, #2 of [[Unlimited Access]] has The Legionaire ending up in '''The Days Of Future Past''' era.  During a team up between them and the X-Men, Colossus and Ferro double team against a Sentinel.
