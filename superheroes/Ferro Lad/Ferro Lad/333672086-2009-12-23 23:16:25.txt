==Publication history==

When Jim Shooter first created the character, he intended Ferro Lad to be [[Black people|black]], but editor [[Mort Weisinger]] vetoed the idea<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/12/22/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-30/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #30!]</ref>, saying "we'll lose our distribution in the South."<ref>Glen Cadigan, ''The Legion Companion'', TwoMorrows Publishing, 2003; p. 53.</ref> 

This was in fact why Shooter chose Ferro Lad to be the one to die in the Sun Eater story.  "Ferro Lad, I killed because my plan was that he was a black guy, and Mort said no.  Then I said, "Well, let's see.  I've got this idea for a story, and someone needs to die...Ah-ha!  Him!"  So basically, I killed him off because it annoyed me that I couldn't do with him what I wanted."<ref>Cadigan, p. 54.</ref>

In 2009, ''The Life and Death of Ferro Lad'' (ISBN 1401221939), a hardcover [[trade paperback]] collecting the Silver Age appearances of Ferro Lad, will be released.

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===
Andrew Nolan is a [[mutant]] with the power to transform himself into living [[iron]]. He has a twin brother named Douglas who has the same power. Both twins have deformed faces as a side effect of the [[mutation]] that gave them their powers, so both wear iron masks. He first appears in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #346 (July 1966); he joined at the same time as [[Princess Projectra]], [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] and [[Nemesis Kid]].

Ferro Lad was only a Legionnaire for a short time when he was killed destroying the [[Sun-Eater]] with a bomb in ''Adventure Comics'' #353. His self-sacrifice to save the galaxy made him legendary, despite his short tenure as a Legionnaire.

Many years later—during the [[Legion of Super-Heroes#"Five Years Later"|"Five Year Gap"]] following the Magic Wars—Earth fell under the covert control of the [[Dominators]], and withdrew from the [[United Planets]]. Some time thereafter, the members of the Dominators' highly classified "Batch SW6" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] over a millennium earlier,<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (Vol. 4) #38, Late December 1992.</ref> a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires remained, and their version of Ferro Lad shortened his code name to Ferro.

===Post-''Zero Hour''===
In post-''[[Zero Hour]]'' continuity he is known as Ferro and comes from 20th century Earth.

Born in the 20th century, Andrew Nolan and his twin, Douglas, were the sons of a famous actress, Nancy Nolan, who abandoned them because of their grotesque facial deformities.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Left in the care of an unscrupulous scientist called "Doc 30", he escaped while Douglas remained behind. When the Earth was dying due to the extinguishing of the sun in the so-called the [[Final Night]], he first helps [[Perry White]], who was determined the [[Daily Planet]] would not miss one day of delivery. Then he becomes involved with the Legion of Super-Heroes, who had become stranded in the present day. This team joins with dozens of other superheroes to help try to save the Earth. Ferro comes close to heroically sacrificing his life in an effort to stop the Sun-Eater At the last instant, he is saved by [[Hal Jordan]], who was maintaining the power and identity of [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Jordan seemingly sacrifices his own life and the sun is restored. Ferro remains with the team, although it was some time before they informed him they were from the 31st Century.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

When the Legion were able to return to their home time, Ferro went with them and served with them for some time until several of the team were [[Legion Lost|lost]] in a rift, and the remainder ordered to disband. After this he went with [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] to a [[monastery]] on the planet Steeple, a planet only accessible for short periods every ten years before a [[black hole]] prevented access once more. While there, he finally learned to deal with his deformity, but he was savagely beaten by an escaped convict and, while the monks were able to save his life, he was trapped in iron form with the helmet he wore fused to his face. Moreover, he and Karate Kid, who had refused to leave his friend behind, were now trapped on the planet for ten years.

Or so it seemed. [[Brainiac 5]] was able to use the threshold technology he had learned of during his time lost to open a path to Steeple, but before anyone could use it, he, along with all of the Legion (bar [[Sensor (comics)|Sensor]] and [[Shikari (comics)|Shikari]]) and several whole planets were entranced by [[Universo]]. Sensor and Shikari were forced to use the unstable link to Steeple to escape, and the four of them were able to free [[Saturn Girl]] who, with aid from [[Apparition (comics)|Apparition]] and [[Ultra Boy]]'s child, Cub, was able to defeat Universo, while Ferro and Karate Kid rejoined the team.

===The Lightning Saga===
The events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Legion to continuity, as seen in "[[The Lightning Saga]]" story arc in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', and in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes (comics)|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''.  Andrew is depicted as a member of this version of the team in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #5 (June 2007), and ''Action Comics'' #858 (Late December 2007).  However, this incarnation of the Legion shares roughly the same history as the original Legion up to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref>[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/828/828574p1.html IGN: Superman/Green Lantern interview]</ref>  Therefore, this version of Andrew is presumably deceased. But this raises the question of how both versions of Andrew and Douglas Nolan could exist on the same Earth.

== Alternate versions ==
In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 2) #300, an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] is glimpsed by Andrew Nolan's brother, Douglas. Here, it is shown that shortly after Andrew's death against the Sun Eater, Douglas became the second Ferro Lad.

== Other media ==
Ferro Lad first appeared in the [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|''Legion of Super Heroes'']] episode "Chain of Command", voiced by [[Dave Wittenberg]]. In that episode, he assists [[Cosmic Boy]] (who recently returned to the Legion) to help save [[Garth Ranzz|Lightning Lad]]'s planet. True to the original story, he sacrifices himself destroying the Sun-Eater shortly after his joining of the Legion. At the end of the season one finale title "Sundown" a piece of floating rock, following the destruction of the Sun-Eater, shows the body of Ferro Lad curled into a ball. This was shown during Ferro Lad's funeral. It seems that in sacrificing himself Ferro Lad became a rock like corpse.
