'''Jack O'Lantern''' is the name of two [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]es and one [[supervillain]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Daniel Cormack===
The first Jack O'Lantern is '''Daniel Cormack''' of [[Ireland]], who was born to a poor farmer who was granted a magic lantern by an Irish fairy. Cormack is a member of the [[Global Guardians]], the international group of superheroes.  His first recorded mission in ''Super Friends'' #9 is to help [[Green Lantern]] dismantle a bomb in Ireland. He appears in three solo back up stories in ''Super Friends'' #s 37, 40 and 44. 

Cormack's first appearance in the mainstream DC Comics universe is ''DC Comics Presents'' #46, helping [[Superman]] find an ancient ruin in Ireland. He is later seen as part of a group of  heroes from Ireland and England trying to save the world in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''  

When the [[United Nations]] decide to fund the Justice League International, the Global Guardians find themselves without financial support, and disband. Cormack subsequently joins Rumaan Harjavti's army in [[Bialya]].<ref>''Justice League International'' #s 8, 9, 16, 17 and 27.</ref>  After Harjavti is killed by the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], Jack voluntarily joins forces with the villainess in taking over the world. He is left dying in a sewer after a battle with the Justice League.<ref>''Captain Atom Annual'' #2, ''Justice League Europe'' #2-4.</ref>  He is found alive by his girlfriend [[Owlwoman]] in ''Justice League Quarterly'' #s 6 - 8 when the two heroes are found by [[Doctor Mist]]. They take a major part in reuniting the Global Guardians and fight with [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]] against the Justice League in ''Justice League Europe'' #s 49 and 50. Afterwards, Jack dies of natural causes.<ref>Revealed in ''Primal Force'' #0.</ref> 

===Marvin Noronsa===
'''Marvin Noronsa''' is a native of Bailya who takes over the Jack O'Lantern identity at Queen Bee's behest. Noronsa is able to use Cormack's mystical lantern only after Queen Bee modifies it).<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #29-30; ''Justice League'' #53 - 55.</ref>  Noronsa is killed in an explosion caused by Sumaan Harjavti in ''Justice League America'' #55 (October 1991).

===Liam McHugh===
More recently, Cormack's cousin '''Liam McHugh''' takes up the mantle of Jack O'Lantern.  McHugh is a former Irish freedom fighter who uses his powers to defend Irish sovereignty.  He appears in three solo stories in ''Justice League Quarterly'' #14, 15 and 17.  He becomes a member of Dr Mist's [[Leymen]] in ''[[Primal Force]]'' #0, appearing in every issue until the book was cancelled with issue 14. Liam is last seen as a member of the [[Ultramarine Corps]] in ''JLA'' #26 and ''JLA Classified'' #1-3.

==Powers and abilities==
Daniel Cormack and Marvin Noronsa have a mystical lantern that gives them the power of flight, flame projection, teleportation, illusion casting, enhanced strength, and the ability to create fogs.  The power of the lantern is at its weakest at noon, and gradually increases to its peak at midnight.  

Liam McHugh has found a way to internalize the powers of the mystical lantern, and no longer needs to carry it.
