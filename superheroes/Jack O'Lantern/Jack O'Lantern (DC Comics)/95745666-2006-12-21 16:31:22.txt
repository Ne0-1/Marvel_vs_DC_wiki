'''Jack O'Lantern''' is the name of two [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]es and one [[supervillain]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Daniel Cormack''' of [[Ireland]] was born to a poor farmer who was granted a magic lantern by an Irish fairy. His first recorded mission was to help [[Green Lantern]] dismantle a bomb in Ireland (Super Friends 9). He appeared in three solo back up stories ion Super Friends 37, 40  and 44. He also helped [[Superman]] find an ancient ruin in Ireland (DC Comics Presents 46). He helped heroes from Ireland and England save the world in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths 12]]'' cross-over and in JLA (Year 1)12. While the Justice League became the world's greatest heroes, Jack left the Global Guardians and joined Rumaan Harjavti's army in [[Bialya]]. This story is told in Justice League International 8, 9, 16, 17 and 27.

After Harjavti was killed by the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]] of Bialya, Jack voluntarily joined forces with the villainess in taking over the world. He was left dying in a sewer after a battle with the Justice League. This story is told in Captain Atom Annual 2, Justice League Europe 2-4. However, he was found alive by his girlfriend [[Owlwoman]] in Justice League Quarterly 6 - 8 when the two heroes were found by [[Doctor Mist]]. They took a major part in reuniting the Global Guardians and fought with Sonar against the Justice League in Justice League Europe 49 and 50. Afterwards, Jack died of natural causes. 

A Bailyan named '''Marvin Noronsa''' subsequently took the Jack O'Lanterm identity at Queen Bee's behest. The imposter Jack O'Lantern was killed by Owlwoman after she learned the truth.  This story is told in the Breakdowns story line in Justce League Europe 29/30 and Justice League 53 - 55. 

More recently, Cormack's cousin '''Liam McHugh''' took the mantle of Jack O'Lantern.  he appeared in three solo stories in Justice League Quarterly 14, 15 and 17.  He became a member of Dr Mist's [[Leymen]] in [[Primal Force]] 0, appearing in every issue until the book was cancelled with issue 14. Liam was last seen as a member of the [[Ultramarine Corps]] in JLA 26 and JLA Classified 1-3.  He is currently in comics limbo with the rest of the Ultramarine Corps in "a doomed micro-earth, with no such thing as super-heroes....."
