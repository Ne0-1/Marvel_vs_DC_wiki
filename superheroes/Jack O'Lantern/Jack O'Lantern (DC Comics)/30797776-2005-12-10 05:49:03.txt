'''Jack O'Lantern''' is the name of a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]].

==History==
Daniel Cormack of Ireland was born to a poor farmer who was granted a magic lantern by an Irish fairy. His first recorded mission was to help [[Green Lantern]] dismantle a bomb in Ireland. He also helped [[Superman]] find an ancient ruin in Ireland. He helped heroes from Ireland and England save the world in <i>[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]</i> cross-over. While the Justice League became the world's greatest heroes, Jack left the Global Guardians and joined Rumaan Harjavti's army in Bialya. After Harjavti was killed by the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]] of Bialya, Jack voluntarily joined forces with the villainess in taking over the world. He was left dying in a sewer after a battle with the Justice League. However, he was found alive by his girlfriend [[Owlwoman]] and the two heroes found [[Doctor Mist]]. They took a major part in reuniting the Global Guardians. Afterwards, Jack died of natural causes. Therefore, his cousin Liam McHugh took the mantle of Jack O'Lantern, the third in a series (there was a second Jack O'Lantern named Marvin Nirosa from Bialya. The imposter Jack O'Lantern was killed by Owlwoman after she learned his truth).
