'''Jack O'Lantern''' is the name of four incarnations of a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. Later incarnations of the character were also referred to as "Mad Jack".

==Jason Macendale==
{{main|Jason Macendale}}

==Steven Levins==
Steven Levins was a mercenary who fought [[Captain America]] and [[Spider-Man]] as Jack O'Lantern.  His identity was never revealed in a comic book, but in ''New Avengers Most Wanted'', a character compendium, his name was revealed to be Steven Mark Levins. Ghost Rider vol. 5 #10 (2007) confirms the Levins identity for the first time in a comic book.

This incarnation of Jack O'Lantern was a member of the loosely-knit band of [[Red Skull]] minions called the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]].  He was also a partner of [[Blackwing]] prior to joining the Skull's group.

He also worked as an enforcer of the gangster The [[Golem (comics)|Golem]] and in this capacity, fought the villain [[The Hood]] when he interfered in Golem's machinations.

===Civil War===
Levins resurfaced just before the [[Civil War (comics)|Stamford]] incident. He was hired by the terrorist organization [[R.A.I.D.]], and, along with [[Jackhammer (comics)|Jackhammer]] and [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]], was ordered to flood the Thames Tunnel, but their plans were foiled by [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]]'s intervention. All the villains were arrested and Jack O'Lantern was most likely deported back to U.S.A. and then recruited into the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] hero-hunting squad.

While pursuring Spider-Man through Manhattan sewers alongside the [[Jester (comics)|Jester]] in  ''Civil War'' #5, Jack O'Lantern was shot through the head and killed by the [[Punisher]]. <ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Penciller =  [[Steve McNiven]] | Inker = [[Dexter Vines]] | Story = War | Title = Civil War | Issue = 5 | Date = November 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, he reappeared in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 5, #8, possessed by a fragment of [[Lucifer]]'s soul, and now exhibits the ability to detach, levitate, and explode his head, among other powers. However, the Ghost Rider is able to [[exorcism|exorcise]] him by ripping his heart from his chest, setting it aflame, and putting it back in his chest causing it to explode inside.

==Mad Jack(s)== <!--This section is linked from [[J. Jonah Jameson]]-->
Daniel Berkhart and Maguire Beck, operating as a team, shared the Jack O'Lantern identity as well as both going by the name of Mad Jack. Berkhart, a friend and student of [[Mysterio]], tended to impersonate Mysterio, and Beck was the original Mysterio's female cousin. Alternating with the costume, the two sometimes also used androids. 

After the [[Green Goblin]] returned, the Berkhart Jack O'Lantern was assigned to make [[J. Jonah Jameson]] sell Osborn the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. After Mysterio killed himself, Berkhart became the new Mysterio, and Beck became the only Mad Jack. The two teamed against Spider-Man, who allied himself with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. Beck was imprisoned at the end of the storyline.

In the miniseries ''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'', Francis Klum purchased Mysterio's weapons and gimmick in order to become yet another new Mysterio. The seller, [[The Kingpin]], said he had acquired the arsenal "from Jack O'Lantern".
