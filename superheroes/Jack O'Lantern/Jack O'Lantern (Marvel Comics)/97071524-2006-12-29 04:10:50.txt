'''Jack O'Lantern''' is the name of four incarnations of a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. Later incarnations of the character were also referred to as "Mad Jack".

==Jack O'Lantern I==
Jack O'Lantern was the original alter ego of Jason Macendale. He wore a flaming pumpkin mask and flew on a disc glider. His first appearance was in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19.  He battled the aforementioned hero and was soundly defeated.

He later moved to make a permanent home in the family of [[Spider-Man villains]], beginning with ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56. He had no super powers, hurling explosive grenades and hopping about on a "pogo platform".  

He was a minor villain in Spidey's rogues gallery until he formed an emnity with one of [[The Hobgoblin]]'s mind-controlled "stand-ins", [[Ned Leeds]].  Macendale wished to increase his underworld status and fearing the Leeds/Hobgoblin, hired assasins to kill the Goblin and took his arsenal for himself.  As a Hobgoblin, Macendale failed to make any greater mark upon the Underworld.  He made various bizarre efforts to increase his threat-level, including pacts with demons, ingesting weird alchemies stolen from [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s lineage, and cybernetic implants provided by [[Norman Osborn]].  During this time, he would on least one occasion, attempt to rob a bank wearing his Jack O'Lantern armor, during which effort he was jailed and questioned by [[SHIELD]] as related in the [[Secret War]] miniseries.

Macendale was later killed by Roderick Kingsley, the true Hobgoblin, who had allowed Macendale his claim on the goblin "franchise" to further hide his identity as the power behind the various incarnations of the Hobgoblin.

As the "second" Hobgoblin, Macendale was a member of several collections of Spider-Man's enemies, including the [[Sinister Six]].

==Jack O'Lantern II==
The second Jack O'Lantern was a mercenary who fought [[Captain America]] and [[Spider-Man]].  His identity was never revealed in a comicbook, but in ''New Avengers Most Wanted'', a character compendium, his name was revealed to be Steven Mark Levins.

This incarnation of Jack O'Lantern was a member of the loosely-knit band of [[Red Skull]] minions called '''The Skeleton Crew'''.  He was also a partner of [[Blackwing]] prior to joining the Skull's group.

He also worked as an enforcer of the gangster The [[Golem (comics)|Golem]] and in this capacity, fought the villain [[The Hood]] when he interfered in Golem's machinations.

He was a member of the new [[Thunderbolts]], until the [[Punisher]] shot him in the head. His shattered helment oozed out pumpkins guts despite the long-standing assumption Levins was just a man in a pumpkin mask.

Solicitations for upcoming comic book releases suggest that he will return as one of the numerous vessels for [[Satan]] in the new [[Ghost Rider]] series.

==Jack O'Lantern III and IV: Mad Jack==
[[Image:Jackolantern3.jpg|thumb|left|Jack O'Lantern in his third incarnation, 1997]]
The third and fourth Jack-O-Lanterns are Daniel Berkhart and Maguire Beck, who went by the name of Mad Jack. Danny, Mysterio's friend and student, tended to impersonate [[Mysterio]] quite often, and Beck was the original [[Mysterio]]'s female cousin and supposedly a fashion designer. Alternating with the costume, the two sometimes used androids also. The two used radio contact most often, and they also worked with a cat, also named Maguire, which they spoke to. Curiously, it reacted intelligently, as though it knew what they were saying.

After the [[Green Goblin]] returned, Jack was to make [[J. Jonah Jameson]] sell Osborn the [[Daily Bugle]]. Berkhart wanted revenge against Jameson, but Spider-Man saved his life. After Mysterio killed himself, Berkhart became Mysterio II, and Maguire became the only Mad Jack. The two teamed up against Spider-Man, who allied himself with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. Beck was imprisoned at the end of the storyline.

At the time of the release of ''The Mysterio Manifesto'', the miniseries which revealed the Identities of the Mad Jacks, there was some fan outcry that the reveal was a poorly-conceived retcon, as in Mad Jack's inital appearances, he seemed to be Scottish or Irish, and was seeking a personal measure of revenge against J. Jonah Jameson's wife Marla. Jack did quite a bit of talking to himself/his cat, and the course of such dialogue, seemed to imply facts of his background that were in no way satisfied by the Mysterio connection.

When [[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do|Francis Klum]] purchased the weaponry and gimmickry of [[Mysterio]] that he might become the new master of illusion, the seller of the Mysterio stable, [[The Kingpin]], said he had accquired the arsenal "from Jack O'Lantern". This Jack O'Lantern would presumably be Maguire Beck, as Berkhart has since claimed his own right to the Mysterio legacy in battle with the Klum-Mysterio.

== Civil War ==
The second Jack O'Lantern is seen in the pages of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.  The Lantern is one of the members of a [[Thunderbolts]] hero-hunting squad, forced into government service alongside [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], [[Taskmaster]], [[Lady Deathstrike]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].

As of Civil War #5, he has been killed by the [[Punisher]]. <ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Penciller =  [[Steve McNiven]] | Inker = [[Dexter Vines]] | Story = War | Title = Civil War | Issue = 5 | Date = November 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>
