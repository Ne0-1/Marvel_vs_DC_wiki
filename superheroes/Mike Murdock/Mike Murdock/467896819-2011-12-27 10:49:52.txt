On January 28, 2011, Trey Smith, a student of Mike Murdock's, released a book entitled "Thieves", in which he claims to expose a dark side to Murdock's [[Christian ministry|ministry]]. Smith's claim is that he was a childhood friend of Murdock's son Jason and saw Murdock's secured mansion estate many times from the inside. Among other claims, Smith alleges that Mike Murdock concealed pornography and items of extreme value in a personal closet. Smith claims to have stolen a safe from that closet in March 1999. Murdock reported his losses to police to be $125,000.00, but gave conflictingly higher amounts (claims from hundreds of thousands to millions) to supporters for presumed fundraising purposes. Mike Murdock initially listed his own son, Jason Murdock, as the primary suspect of the burglary. However, the [[Denton County]] Sheriffs Department ultimately dropped the safe robbery / [[burglary]] investigation citing that Murdock would not cooperate with detectives after a white powder was discovered in Murdock's personal closet. Murdock's attorney later stated that police investigators had planted the white powder. It was during this time that Trey Smith claims to have been on the run from the TV minister in Mexico and a variety of other places, which is the primary focus of Smith's book. In detail Smith describes the allegedly callous response that Mike Murdock had for people who came to him for help during the years leading to the safe robbery. Additionally, Smith claims that Mike Murdock had a concerning note in the safe that Smith felt was intended for Murdock's son, Jason. Trey Smith has appeared on "[[Bob Enyart]] Live," Bruce Collins w/ [[Jesse Ventura]], as well as many other news / talk shows to discuss the police report, his experiences, his allegations of Mike Murdock's excessive lifestyle, sexual affairs and the details of the [http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2011/July/Why_I_Stole_Televangelist_Mike_Murdocks_Safe.aspx Mike Murdock safe robbery], commonly called the, "TV Pastor Safe Robbery."

In July 2011, [[D Magazine]], a large [[North Texas]] ([[Dallas]] based) news and entertainment publication, ran all of chapter one of Trey Smith's book Thieves as a headlining article. The article included a full page artist rendering of Smith running from televangelist Mike Murdock. D Magazine cited that they had "courted Smith's story" after investigation. This is the same publication that assisted [[Ole Anthony]] and the [[Trinity Foundation]] during the scandal surrounding televangelist [[Robert Tilton]].<ref>{{cite web
