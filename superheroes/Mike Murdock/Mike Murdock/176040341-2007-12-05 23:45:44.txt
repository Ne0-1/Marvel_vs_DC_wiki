==Preaching style==

===Prosperity doctrine===
Mike Murdock places a great emphasis on [[Prosperity Doctrine]]. This has drawn criticism from many. Mike Murdock's message focuses almost exclusively on viewers giving money, usually in precise dollar amounts, to his ministry (which he euphemistically calls "sowing seed"). He then explicitly claims that this giving of cash to his ministry will result in financial prosperity to those who give. In fact, he teaches that there is something special about giving at least $1,000 to him. He makes statements about the "thousand dollar seed" repeatedly during his program. He refers to these donations as "giving money to God." He makes very few direct references to scripture, preferring instead to make statements about what Jesus wants believers to do. One passage of scripture that he constantly refers to is [[Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] 6:38, often used by Prosperity Doctrine preachers to back up their belief system.{{Citations missing|date=November 2007}}

===Prophetic claims===
Mike Murdock frequently claims to be directly speaking the words of God during his preaching. He frequently "decrees" things, claiming that this decree will certainly come true because the Spirit is speaking through him.

==Written works==
Mike Murdock is the author of dozens of books and pamphlets, many self-published. The most recent is ''The Uncommon Leader'', a book which he says reveals the keys to success in life.
