==Teachings==
===Faith Seed Program===

"...broke the back of poverty... You can't bribe God or buy a miracle, that's crazy.  What you can do is plant.  See what you let go something from your hand, then God will let go something from his hand.  What I think, it's the act of obedience that pleases God.  When what you have in your hand is not enough to be your harvest, you can turn it into a seed.  You can plant that seed to get your harvest."   

--Mike Murdock on the 58 Blessings guest program with Daystar.

===Seeds of Wisdom===

Mike Murdock developed many concepts from listening to the Holy Spirit in the "secret place", and has written dozens of books on wisdom.  These books contain ways on approaching life's problems, and ways of dealing with reality.  Murdock instructs his followers on how to hear the Holy Spirit, and understand and use wisdom.

===The Broken===

Mike Murdock is involved charity and he does missionary work around the world.  Murdock is well known for fundraising for many foreign missonaries, esepcially in [[South Africa]], where Murdock works with people in several war-torn nations.
