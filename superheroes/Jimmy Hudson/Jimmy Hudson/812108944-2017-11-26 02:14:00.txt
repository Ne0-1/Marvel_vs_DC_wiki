==Fictional character biography==
Jimmy Hudson is the son of [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine/James Howlett]] and Magda. Wolverine fought alongside [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]] in the [[Iraq war]] and entrusted James with his newborn son. James later becomes a [[sheriff]] in [[Florida]] and with his wife [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather]] raised Jimmy in [[Port St Lucie, Florida]]. While drag racing, Jimmy's car flipped off the road. He survived, but his body was severely and fatally injured, but he rapidly began to heal as his X-Gene activated. The following day, Jimmy met [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Marvel|Kitty Pryde]] and she handed him a box of Wolverine's possessions. In a holographic message Wolverine appeared before Jimmy. Wolverine told Jimmy he was his son and to forget about asking who his birth mother is, not to think about the past and focus on the future, respect the Hudsons for raising him on his behalf, and learn to live with the choices he had made. Wolverine's final message was that he never regretted having Jimmy as a son. Kitty theorized that Jimmy inherited Wolverine's abilities and encouraged him to try. After focusing hard, his bone claws painfully sheathed through his knuckles for the first time. Jimmy formed a metallic coating over his claws. After this, he mastered control of his claws.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #1</ref>

Jimmy Hudson found [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey#Ultimate Marvel|Jean Grey]] who was using the alias of Karen Grant. Jean Grey decides to tag along with Jimmy on his mission to recruit the mutants Derek Morgan and [[Liz Allan#Ultimate Marvel|Liz Allan]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #2</ref>

When in Chicago, Jimmy Hudson and Karen Grant begin their look for Derek Morgan. Jimmy later rescues Derek while Karen makes his brother Joe forget his brother's vigilante activities.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #3</ref>

Jimmy Hudson and Karen Grant arrive at Liz Allan's school where the students have turned against her half-brother Theodore Allan (who was also fathered by [[Blob (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Blob]]) after his skin deflected the shooter's bullets. While Liz sides with Jimmy and Karen, Theodore escapes with [[Quicksilver (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Quicksilver]] (who told Theodore about his father) to join up with him and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Marvel|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #4</ref>

At [[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]], [[Sabretooth (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Sabretooth]] surprised Jimmy and attacked him where Sabretooth wanted to kill him as a substitute for Wolverine. Sabretooth nearly landed a fatal blow when Quicksilver pulled him out. For some inexplicable reason, Jimmy couldn't use his regeneration powers due to Sabretooth's attack. Jean did her best to patch Jimmy up and then looked for some help. When Jimmy woke up, his wounds finally healed. However, he was shocked and confused that the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Ultimate Marvel|Hulk]] was standing before him. Jean explained she made an arrangement with Hulk to become their enforcer and also give him some answers....specifically how he was found. Just then, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] appeared before them. Jean explained to everyone that their group was called the Tomorrow People. Inspired by Wolverine, they were "Plan B" in the event that the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] had fallen. Nick Fury would be their shadow-intel to help them be a step ahead of their pursuers. However, if they were to get caught, they were on their own.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #5</ref>

Following the restoration of the multiverse after the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Jimmy Hudson is revealed to have also leaped from Earth-1610 into Earth-616. However, he appears to have lost his memories in the process as he has no recollection of how he arrived there. He appears older and sports longer hair and a beard. The townspeople mistook him for a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] and shot him prior to the actual Wendigo attacking their village. After recovering from the gunshot wound, Jimmy brought out his claws and fought the Wendigo.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1</ref><ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #4</ref> After the [[X-Men Blue|time-displaced X-Men]] found him and saved him from being captured, they brought him back to their base in [[Madripoor]] and he became a member of their team. While exploring Madripoor during a festival on a night off, Jean, Beast and Jimmy confront a group of mutants who were buying a chemical from a local dealer. Upon seeing Jimmy's claws, the other team of mutants voluntarily end the fight, acknowledging the X-Men as allies due to everyone involved having a positive history with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #5-6</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, the team rebels against the government of New Tian following [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s takeover of the United States. While in their hideout, they're attacked by a group of mutants sent by [[Emma Frost]]. While Jean and Jimmy escape, the rest of the team is captured. Emma then talks to Cyclops in his cell.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #7</ref>As Jean and Jimmy regroup and plan their next move they are rescued by Danger, who stages a series of elaborate holograms to keep Emma's forces occupied. The rest of the team begins to lose hope as Emma begins telepathically tormenting Cyclops. Havok is about to intercept Jean and Jimmy when he is suddenly ambushed by Polaris. While Polaris fights Havok, Jean and Jimmy manage to rescue their teammates and Briar until they're caught by Emma, who has taken control of Cyclops and forces him to attack them. Jean manages to release Cyclops from Emma's mental control and the team successfully escapes. Meanwhile, Magneto talks with Steve Rogers about the team's recent actions and Emma and Havok meet with Miss Sinister and Bastion.

==Powers and abilities==
Jimmy has inherited similar mutant powers to those of his father, Wolverine. 

Jimmy possesses a healing factor that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue of his body, far beyond the limitations of a normal human. His mutant healing factor first manifested when he experienced a terrible car crash which left his body burned, broken and bleeding, but perfectly healed in an instant. While the full extent of his healing factor is unknown, it is possible for Jimmy to virtually withstand various wounds, diseases, drugs, and toxins. It also greatly extends his lifespan by slowly down the ageing process.   

Jimmy has inherited his father's retractable bone claws that are housed within his forearms. Although he lacks his father's Adamantium-Laced skeleton and claws, Jimmy has the ability to coat his claws, especially his skeleton, in organic steel, similar to Colossus' mutant ability. While the durability of his claws is yet to be estimated, they proven to be strong enough to seriously damage the savagely-powerful Wendigo and withstand Time-Displaced  Cyclops' optic blasts.

Jimmy is gifted with superhumanly acute senses that are comparable to those of certain animals.  He can see perfectly and further than an ordinary human, even in near total darkness. His hearing is also greatly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds that no normal human being could hear, especially at greater distances. His sense of smell is enhanced to the point which easily recognizes people or objects by scent alone, even if they are extremely hidden. He can even track a target by scent, even if the scent has been greatly eroded by time and weather factors, with an extraordinary degree of success. 

Jimmy's mind has proven to be extremely immune to telepathic assault and probing, result of a powerful mutant telepath, like Time-Displaced Jean Grey, fail to enters his mind.

==Other versions==
===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, [[Old Man Logan]] ended up in the [[Battleworld]] domain of the Kingdom of Manhattan where its domain's versions of Jean Grey and Emma Frost took him to the X-Mansion where he met the rest of the X-Men and this domain's version of Jimmy Hudson.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #5</ref>
