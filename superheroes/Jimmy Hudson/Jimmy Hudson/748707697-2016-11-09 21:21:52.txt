==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
Jimmy Hudson is the son of Wolverine/James Howlett and Magda. Wolverine fought alongside [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]] in the [[Iraq war]] and entrusted James with his newborn son. James later becomes a [[sheriff]] in [[Florida]] and with his wife [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather]] raised Jimmy in [[Port St Lucie, Florida]]. While drag racing, Jimmy's car flipped off the road. He survived, but his body was in pain yet rapidly healing. The following day, Jimmy met [[Kitty Pryde]] and handed him a box of Wolverine's possessions. In a holographic message Wolverine appeared before Jimmy. Wolverine told Jimmy he was his son and to forget asking who his birth mother, not to think about the past and focus on the future, respect the Hudsons for raising him on his behalf, and learn to live with the choices he had made. Wolverine's final message was that he never regretted having Jimmy as a son. Kitty theorized that Jimmy inherited Wolverine's abilities and encouraged him to try. After focusing hard, his bone claws painfully sheathed through his knuckles for the first time. Jimmy formed a metallic coating over his claws. After this, he mastered control of his claws.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #1</ref>

Jimmy Hudson found Jean Grey who was using the alias of Karen Grant. Jean Grey decides to tag along with Jimmy on his mission to recruit the mutants Derek Morgan and [[Liz Allan]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #2</ref>

When in Chicago, Jimmy Hudson and Karen Grant begin their look for Derek Morgan. Jimmy later rescues Derek while Karen makes his brother Joe forget his brother's vigilante activities.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #3</ref>

Jimmy Hudson and Karen Grant arrive at Liz Allan's school where the students have turned against her half-brother Theodore Allan (who was also fathered by [[Blob (comics)|Blob]]) after his skin deflected the shooter's bullets. While Liz sides with Jimmy and Karen, Theodore escapes with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (who told Theodore about his father) to join up with him and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #4</ref>

At [[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] surprised Jimmy and attacked him where Sabretooth wanted to kill him as a substitute for Wolverine. Sabertooth nearly landed a fatal blow when Quicksilver pulled him out. For some inexplicable reason, Jimmy couldn't use his regeneration powers due to Sabertooth's attack. Jean did her best to patch Jimmy up and then looked for some help. When Jimmy woke up, his wounds finally healed. However, he was shocked and confused that the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] was standing before him. Jean explained she made an arrangement with Hulk to become their enforcer and also give him some answers....specifically how he was found. Just then, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] appeared before them. Jean explained to everyone that their group was called the Tomorrow People. Inspired by Wolverine, they were "Plan B" in the event that the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] had fallen. Nick Fury would be their shadow-intel to help them be a step ahead of their pursuers. However, if they were to get caught, they were on their own.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X'' #5</ref> 

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, [[Old Man Logan]] ended up in the [[Battleworld]] domain of the Kingdom of Manhattan where its domain's Jean Grey and Emma Frost took him to the X-Mansion where he met the rest of the X-Men and Jimmy Hudson.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like Wolverine, Jimmy possesses a regenerative healing factor, the signature three claws, and a somewhat unexplained ability to coat them in an [[organic metal]].
