'''Catseye''' ('''Sharon Smith''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Sal Buscema]] in ''New Mutants'' (first series) #16 ([[1984]]). 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Sharon Smith''' was a member of the original [[Hellions]] recruited by [[Emma Frost]] to be a competitive team to the [[New Mutants]] and a tool for the [[Hellfire Club]]. Her character was the antithesis of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] who could transform into a wolf. She engaged in several battles with the New Mutants—mostly petty competition—but occasionally got along with the students, sometimes having dances for socialization. Her personality was that of a free spirit. Catseye's youth and comparative lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence. She was capable of total recall from her photographic memory, and instinctively knew when she was being lied to. Under Frost's tutelage, Smith progressed from total illiteracy to upper grade school reading levels in less than a year. She still retained several feline qualities whilst in human form, having been forced to provide for herself since earliest infancy. Catseye more resembled a carefree child in tune with the environment around her. Upon her first meeting with Wolfsbane, rather than attack out of an animalistic nature, she smelled Rahne and said that the two of them shared a kindred spirit and that they should be friends—this in spite of the obviously played feline/canine feuding roles.

When the New Mutants were in a state of emotional turmoil over being killed and resurrected by the [[Beyonder]], Emma Frost saw it as her opportunity to sweep in and take control. She convinced [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]—the current leader of the team—to allow the New Mutants to come to the Massachusetts Academy for psychic counseling, where she promptly accepted them into the ranks of her Hellions. Catseye shared a room with Rahne and the two of them became close friends. The two teams became quite fond of one another but were separated when Magneto realized that his emotions had been manipulated by [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] to convince him to relinquish the students. 

Soon after, Emma threw another party which the Hellions as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team attended. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]—a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]—crashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group. The Hellions were mere formalities: some were killed in the crossfire and the rest, including Catseye, were drained of their life energies in order to fuel his [[teleportation|teleportation portal]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #281 ([[1991]]).

===Alternate version===
Catseye was still alive in the alternate reality called the Age of Apocalypse and was a Hellion. She and the others were hunted down and apprehended by the X-Men.

==Powers==
[[image:Catseye2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Catseye in her leonine form]]
Catseye's mutant power is [[Ailuranthrope|ailuranthropy]], the ability to become a cat. She can transform into either a [[housecat]] or a human-[[puma|panther]] hybrid (a [[werecat]]). In her panther form, she has superhuman strength, agility and reflexes, in addition to keen senses, razor-sharp claws and teeth, a [[prehensile tail]], and a slight [[healing factor]].

It was stated in earlier New Mutants stories that Catseye may in fact be a mutant cat with the power to assume human form, explaining why she found human speech difficult and appeared to be more "animalistic" in character.

==Notes==
*Catseye made a [[postmortem]] appearance in the [[1997]] Annual of ''Generation X''. However, this was just a trick played by the [[demon]] [[D'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.

*Also in the ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #55-56, the Generation X members become trapped in an illusion by [[Adrienne Frost]] where each of them is a different Hellions member (except for [[Jetstream (comics)|Jetstream]], reliving their last day. [[Jubilee]] was Catseye.
