'''Catseye''' ('''Sharon Smith''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
Catseye was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Sal Buscema]] in ''New Mutants'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #16-17 (June-July 1984).

The character subsequently appears in ''Firestar'' #2-4 (April-June 1986), ''The New Mutants'' #31 (September 1985), #39 (May 1986), #43 (September 1986), #53-54 (July-August 1987), #56 (October 1987), #62 (April 1988), ''The New Warriors'' #9-10 (March-April 1991), and died in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281 (October 1991). The character made a posthumous appearance in ''The New Warriors Annual'' #1 (1991) and 2 (1992).

Catseye appeared as part of the "Hellions" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #5.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Sharon Smith''' was a member of the original [[Hellions]] recruited by [[Emma Frost]] to be a competitive team to the [[New Mutants]] and a tool for the [[Hellfire Club]]. Her character was the antithesis of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] who could transform into a wolf. She engaged in several battles with the New Mutants—mostly petty competition—but occasionally got along with the students, sometimes having dances for socialization.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Her personality was that of a free spirit. Catseye's youth and comparative lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence. She was capable of total recall from her photographic memory, and instinctively knew when she was being lied to. Under Frost's tutelage, Smith progressed from total illiteracy to upper grade school reading levels in less than a year.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} She still retained several feline qualities whilst in human form, having been forced to provide for herself since earliest infancy. Notably, she kept her tail in many instances. Upon her first meeting with Wolfsbane, rather than attack out of an animalistic nature, she smelled Rahne and said that the two of them shared a kindred spirit and that they should be friends—this in spite of the obviously played feline/canine feuding roles.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Emma Frost took advantage of the New Mutants' emotional turmoil after an incident where a cosmic being called [[Beyonder]] had actually killed them and then brought them back to life. She persuaded the current headmaster of the school, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], to send the students to the Massachusetts Academy for psychic counseling. There, she  promptly accepted them into the ranks of her Hellions. Catseye shared a room with Rahne and the two of them became close friends. The two teams became quite fond of one another but were separated when Magneto realized that his mind had been manipulated by [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] and the decision to release the students had not been fully his.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Catseye and Wolfsbane would meet in a formal dress party sponsored by the Hellfire Club. The two sneaked off, left their dresses behind and romped in their animal forms.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Later, the two teams would clash high about Manhattan. Both had learned about the existence of [[Bird-Brain]] and neither team wanted the other to have him. The Hellions lose the encounter. Furthermore, an accident sends Catseye and [[Roulette (Marvel Comics)|Roulette]] plunging to the streets. Roulette's power saves them both, allowing them to land safely in a store canopy.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

The White Queen would later cause a confrontation between her team and the [[New Warriors]]. This was over the fate of [[Firestar]], a member of the Warriors who used to be a part of the Hellions. The battle, held in the New Warrior's penthouse, came down to a game of numbers and Catseye scored one for her team by viciously defeating [[Night Thrasher]], easily tearing through his reinforced armor. Ultimately, the Hellions lost by attrition, though nobody defeated Catseye in turn.<ref>''New Warriors'' #9-10 (March-April 1991)</ref>

Soon after, Emma threw another party which the Hellions as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team attended. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]—a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]—crashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group. Some of the Hellions died in the initial firefight. The rest, including Catseye, were killed in order to fuel Fitzroy's [[teleportation|teleportation portal]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281 (1991)</ref>

===Post Death Illusions===
Catseye makes a [[postmortem]] appearance in the 1997 Annual of ''Generation X''. However, this was just a trick played by the [[demon]] [[D'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Also in the ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #55-56, the Generation X members become trapped in an illusion by [[Adrienne Frost]] where each of them is a different Hellions member except for [[Jetstream (comics)|Jetstream]]. The afflicted heroes relive the Hellion's last day. Jubilee was Catseye.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

===Necrosha===
Catseye, along with all the other deceased Hellions is resurrected by Selene and Eli Bard. After breaking into Utopia with the help of Cypher, she and the other Hellions confront Emma Frost and taunt her for not saving them. She is subdued by Cyclops when she goes to attack Emma.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Catseye's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power is [[Ailuranthrope|ailuranthropy]], the ability to become a cat. She can transform into either a [[housecat]] or a human-[[cougar|panther]] hybrid (a [[werecat]]). In her panther form, she has superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance in addition to hyper-keen senses, razor-sharp claws and fangs, a [[prehensile tail]], and a slight [[healing factor]].

Even in her human form, she retained some catlike physical features such as slitted pupils and a tail.

It was stated in earlier New Mutants stories that Catseye may in fact be a mutant cat with the power to assume human form, explaining why she found human speech difficult and appeared to be more "animalistic" in character.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Catseye was still alive in the alternate reality called the [[Age of Apocalypse]] and was a Hellion. She and the others were hunted down and apprehended by the X-Men, after being knocked out by an enraged Wolfsbane while attempting to flee the beat-down of her fellow Hellions.

===What If===
In a reality where the second X-Men team is slain, Catseye is recruited to fill the ranks.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' Vol1 #60</ref>
