'''Bereet''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
Bereet first appeared in ''[[Rampaging Hulk]]'' #1-2 (January, April 1977), and was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Walt Simonson]]. She also appeared in ''Rampaging Hulk'' #9 (June 1978).

This version was subsequently revealed to be an alternate universe version.  The mainstream [[Earth-616]] version of Bereet first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #269 (March 1982), and continued to appear in the series in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #270-282 (April 1982-April 1983), #285 (July 1983), and #287 (September 1983).

Bereet received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk'' (2004).

==Fictional character biography==
Bereet was a female [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]] techno-artist who used her alien technology to produce films concerning fictional adventures of herself and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  Most of the population is obsessed with the escapist movie-like fantasies of techno-art films, leading to her popularity among her people.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Bereet later traveled to Earth and became involved with the Hulk while he had Bruce Banner's intelligence, befriending the Hulk and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. She also encountered the criminal [[Blackbird (Femizon)|Jackdaw]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Bereet used a number of devices such as the spatial distorter, Banshee Mask, Defendroids, her "pet" Sturky, and a variety of other advanced technological devices.

The planet Krylor and its population was destroyed by [[Ego the Living Planet]] during the onset of the [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]] crossover.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1 (2001)</ref> It is unknown if Bereet was counted among the casualties.

==Powers and abilities==
As a Krylorian, Bereet has a number of traits typical to their avian-mammalian semi-humanoid physique, including highly porous ("hollow") bones; a trilling, musical voice; two-fingers and a thumb on each hand; two toes on each foot; red irises; and a deep pink skin color. She uses a number of techno-art creations including her Spatial Distorter (which she always carries over her shoulder like a pocket book), Banshee Mask, Defendroids, Energy-Eaters, "Flitter," Insula-Sphere, Life Support Spider, "Spindrone," Star Eyes, and "Web-Spider." Bereet demonstrated a number of other techno-art creations in her movie, but it is unrevealed if she used any or all of these in the 616 reality.
