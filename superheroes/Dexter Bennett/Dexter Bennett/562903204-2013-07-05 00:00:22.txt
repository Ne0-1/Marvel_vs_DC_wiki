'''Dexter Bennett''' is a character in the ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' series of [[comic book]]s. The new owner of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', which he renames the ''DB'', he has a personal vendetta against both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, which leads Peter and [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] to leave the paper.

==Fictional character biography==
Dexter Bennett bought the shares of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' from Marla Jameson when [[J. Jonah Jameson|Jonah]] had a heart attack; he then renamed it ''The DB''. He turned it into a gossip magazine and gave [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] a job as a paparazzo. In time both Peter and [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] left the paper because of this, Robbie quitting in disgust at the paper's new approach and Peter resigning when Bennett expressed a greater interest in Peter's photos of an actor with his secret girlfriend - Peter pointing out that, while he had willingly exposed other celebrities in questionable situations, the actor had a right to his private life in this instance as he was harming nobody- than in Peter's photos of Spider-Man's fight with new villain [[Paper Doll (comics)|Paper Doll]].

===Secret Invasion===
Dexter appears in the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Amazing Spider-Man'' miniseries, where he is confronted by registered superhero [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]] for misspelling her identity as Crackpot. When the Skrulls began their invasion, Dexter Bennett and [[Betty Brant]], [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] and [[Vin Gonzales]] escape from the DB building after a Super-Skrull - in the form of Spider-Man and later taking on the appearance and powers of several of his foes - began attacking Jackpot and following the DB staff in order to find Spider-Man.

===Losing his business and his legs===
In ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt#Power to the People|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, in the wake of [[financial crisis of 2007-2008|financial crisis]], the supervillain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] begins rallying misfits and outcasts into a protest group known as "Power To The People". At first they antagonize the right-wing Bennett and the DB, but Electro ends up allying with him - along with the [[Mad Thinker]] - to find a way to regain control of his own powers. When Spider-Man interferes and causes Electro to go out of control and demolish the DB, Bennett is crushed by a huge chunk of falling debris. Betty Brant later mentions that he will never walk again, just as the DB will never stand again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614</ref>
