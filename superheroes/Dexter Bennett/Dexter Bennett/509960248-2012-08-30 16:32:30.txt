Dexter Bennett bought the shares of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' from Marla Jameson when [[J. Jonah Jameson|Jonah]] had a heart attack; he then renames it to ''The DB''. He turned it into a gossip magazine and gave [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] a job as a paparazzo. In time both Peter and [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] left the paper because of this, Robbie quitting in disgust at the paper's new approach and Peter resigning when Bennett expressed a greater interest in Peter's photos of an actor with his secret girlfriend- Peter pointing out that, while he had willingly exposed other celebrities in questionable situations, the actor had a right to his private life in this instance as he was harming nobody- than in Peter's photos of Spider-Man's fight with new villain [[Paper Doll (comics)|Paper Doll]].

===Secret Invasion===
Dexter appears in the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Amazing Spider-Man'' miniseries, where he is confronted by registered superhero [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]] for misspelling her identity as Crackpot.
