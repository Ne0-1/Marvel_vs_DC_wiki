'''Dexter Bennett''' is a character in the [[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|''Amazing Spider-Man'']] series of [[comic book]]s.  The new owner of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', which he renames the ''DB'', he has a personal vendetta against both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, which leads Peter and [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] to leave the paper.

==Fictional character biography==
Dexter Bennett bought the shares of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' from Marla Jameson when [[J. Jonah Jameson|Jonah]] had a heart attack; he then renames it to ''The DB''. He turned into a gossip magazine and gave [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] a job as a paparazzo. In time both Peter and [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] left the paper because of this.

===Secret Invasion===
Dexter appears in the ''[[Secret Invasion]]: Amazing Spider-Man'' miniseries, where he is confronted by registered superhero [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]] for misspelling her identity as Crackpot. When the Skrulls began their invasion, Dexter Bennett and [[Betty Brant]], [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Vin Gonzales]] escape from the DB building after a Super-Skrull, in the form of Spider-Man and later changed forms with the powers and abilities of Lizard, Rhino, Electro, Hydro-Man, Sandman, and Venom and begun attacking Jackpot and following the DB staff in order to find Spider-Man.

===Losing His Business and His Legs===
In the Gauntlet storyline (ASM 612-present) Electro and Spider-Man's battle ends up demolishing the DB and Bennett gets crushed by a huge chunk of falling debris. He is mentioned by Betty later that he will never walk again, just as the DB will never stand again.
