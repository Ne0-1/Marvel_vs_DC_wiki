'''Gorgolla''', or '''Gargolla the Living Gargoyle''' is a fictional monster character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Gorgolla first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #74 (April 1960) and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and [[Dick Ayers]].

==Fictional character biography==
Gorgolla is a Stonian and the son of [[Granitor]] who ruled the Stonians. He led an invasion to Earth centuries ago and arranged for the Stonians to hide out as gargoyles. He was seemingly killed by the Stonia army when they were revived as they had learned peace from humanity.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #74 (April 1960)</ref>

Upon hearing about what happened to Gorgolla, King Granitor sent his legion of assassins to kill the Stonians responsible.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #22</ref>

Gorgolla later turned up alive where he was actually taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody and placed in their [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force as seen in the director's cut of the first issue.<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #1 (December 2005)</ref>

At some point, Gorgolla relocated to [[Monster Isle]]. He was among the monsters that attacked [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] when they came for a mutant girl named Bo. Not wanting to keep fighting Gorgolla and the rest of Monster Isle's inhabitants, Magik teleported herself, Kitty Pryde, and Bo back to the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey Institute for Higher Learning]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 3 #33</ref>
