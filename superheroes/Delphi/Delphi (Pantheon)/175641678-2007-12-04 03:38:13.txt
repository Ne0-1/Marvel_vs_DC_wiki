'''Delphi''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Delphi is one of the members of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]]. Delphi can predict the future which she usually does in the nude while looking into her gazing pool. Her teammate, Walter Charles the second Pantheon member to use the codename [[Ulysses (Pantheon)|Ulysses]], has harbored feelings for Delphi for several years. Delphi often speaks in riddles. She was born the same day Ulysses officially joined the group.

Delphi has chosen to remain pure of body (ie a virgin) to retain her psychic gift. Her mother Andromeda had been the seer for the Pantheon until she became pregnant thus losing her gift. Delphi's father [[Jason (Pantheon)|Jason]] the Renegade left the Pantheon after Agamemnon ordered him to kill the original Ulysses. That task later fell to [[Achilles (Pantheon)|Achilles]]. 

Delphi left the group to live with her mother [[Andromeda (Pantheon)|Andromeda]] shortly before [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]]'s death.
