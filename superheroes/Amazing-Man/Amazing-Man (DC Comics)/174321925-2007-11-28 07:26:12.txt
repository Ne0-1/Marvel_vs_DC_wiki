==Publication history==
Although a [[1980s]] creation of writer [[Roy Thomas]], the Amazing Man published by [[DC Comics]] was placed in the [[1940s]] and made a contemporary of various [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] superheroes. The character was created by Roy Thomas as a tribute to [[Bill Everett]]'s [[Amazing Man (Golden Age)|Amazing Man]], a character he created for [[Centaur Publications]] during the so-called ''Golden Age'' of comics.

==Fictional character biography==
===Will Everett===
Will Everett is a promising young [[African-American]] [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] who had competed in the [[1936 Olympic Games]] in [[Berlin]] but whose post-Olympic career devolved into a janitorial profession at a laboratory owned by [[Cyclotron (comics)|Dr. Terry Curtis]]. During an accident involving the explosion of some equipment he was connected to (developed by the criminal mastermind the [[Ultra-Humanite]]), Everett quickly developed the ability to mimic whatever properties he touched (similar to [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Absorbing Man]]). For example, if he touched [[steel]], then his body became composed of steel.

At first, he was employed by the Ultra-Humanite as a henchman along with Curtis (as Cyclotron) and [[Deathbolt]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 23|Date = (Jul 1983)|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref> However, his sympathies soon swayed towards the side of good<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 25|Date = (Sept 1983)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> after repeated exposure to the [[All-Star Squadron]], a team comprised of both Golden Age characters and retroactive characters like himself, whom he joined and helped to defeat his former employer's machinations. He then served a lengthy stint as a member of this voluminous mystery man organization.

In February of 1942, the Squadron helped Everett defeat the bigoted villain in his home town of [[Detroit]], the Real American.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 38|Date = (Oct 1984)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> During the first great [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], Amazing Man was one of a group of heroes chosen by the Monitor to try and stop the Anti-Monitor's quest for destruction.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 53|Date = (Jan 1986)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Crisis on Infinite Earths|Issue = 5|Date = (Aug 1985)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> His exploits after WWII are unrecorded.

On a future case, Amazing Man's powers changed so that now he had mastery of [[magnetism]] while losing his ability to mimic matter. His post-[[World War II]] career has been unchronicled. However, it was later revealed that his grandson, Will Everett III (a.k.a. "Junior") also developed the same mimicry attributes. He was last seen in the hospital, visited by his grandson and was dying of [[cancer]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Justice League America|Issue = 86-87|Date = (Mar and Apr 1994)|Publisher = DC Comics}}, ''DC Comics Encyclopedia''</ref> The status of his son, the father of Amazing Man II, is currently unknown.

===Will Everett III===

Will Everett III carried on his grandfather's heroic tradition, joining the famed [[Justice League]] at [[Wonder Woman]]'s request.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Justice League America|Issue = 86|Date = (Mar 1994)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> As a member, he was instrumental in defeating the [[Overmaster]] alongside the other members of the League and reformed members of the [[Cadre (comics)#Cadre of the Immortal|Cadre of the Immortal]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Justice League International|Volume = 2|Issue = 66|Date = (Jul 1994)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Soon after this, [[Captain Atom]] formed a splinter group of the JLA nicknamed [[Extreme Justice]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Extreme Justice|Issue = 0|Date = (Jan 1995)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> He remained with the team until its end.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Extreme Justice|Issue = 0|Date = (Jul 1996)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> 

Later, Will joined the [[Crimson Fox]]'s unofficial re-grouping of Justice League Europe. In their single ill-fated adventure, Will was apparently killed by a supervillainess named the [[Mist (comics)|Mist]], along with the Fox and [[Blue Devil]]. In Amazing Man's case, Mist tricked him into mimicking glass and then shattered him. It is assumed that he is deceased, but given the nature of his transformational abilities, it is possible that he could have been revived. The status of his father Will Everett II, and the whereabouts of his family and whether or not he had siblings, is unknown.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Starman|Volume=2|Issue = 38|Date = (Jan 1998)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> An early solicitation for [[Justice Society of America]] #12 (December 2007) mentions the debut of a new Amazing Man, whether or not it is Will Everett III remains to be seen.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Dec07/solicitations.html ''"Thy Kingdom Come" explodes as Jakeem Thunder returns! The Justice Society reaches out to the next wave of legacy heroes: the new Mr. America, Judomaster, Amazing Man and more!...''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*Will Everett was originally capable of transforming himself into a living, breathing facsimile of any material that he touched. 
*Later Will Everett's powers were altered, and he was instead able to magnetically attract or repel objects with his hands. 
*Will Everett III could cause his body to duplicate the properties of any inorganic material he touched from stone to glass. If he touched the pavement, for example, he became a sentient being made of living stone, with all its commensurate strengths and weaknesses.
*Will Everett III could also absorb and duplicate vast amounts of energy, as when he defeated the Overmaster by draining and duplicating its powers.
