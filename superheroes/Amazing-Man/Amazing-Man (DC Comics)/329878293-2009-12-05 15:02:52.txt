'''Amazing-Man''' is the name used by three [[fictional]] [[African-American]] [[superheroes]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The first Amazing-Man debuted in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #23 (July 1983), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jerry Ordway]]. The second Amazing-Man debuted in ''[[Justice League]]'' #86 (March 1994), and was created by Dan Vado and Marc Campos. The third Amazing-Man debuted in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 3) #12 (March 2008), and was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dale Eaglesham]].

==Publication history==
Although a 1980s creation of writer [[Roy Thomas]], the Amazing-Man published by [[DC Comics]] was placed in the 1940s and made a contemporary of various [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] superheroes. The character was created by Roy Thomas as a tribute to [[Bill Everett]]'s [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|Amazing-Man]], a character he created for [[Centaur Publications]] during the so-called ''Golden Age'' of comics.

==Fictional character biography==
===Will Everett===
Will Everett was a promising young [[African-American]] [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] who had competed in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], but his post-Olympic career devolved into a janitorial profession at a laboratory owned by [[Cyclotron (comics)|Dr. Terry Curtis]]. During an accident involving the explosion of some equipment to which he was (developed by the criminal mastermind the [[Ultra-Humanite]]), Everett quickly developed the ability to mimic whatever properties he touched (similar to [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Absorbing Man]]). For example, if he touched [[steel]], then his body became composed of steel.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Jimenez  | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Amazing Man I | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 12  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

====All-Star Squadron====
{{main|All-Star Squadron}}
At first, he was employed by the Ultra-Humanite as a henchman along with Curtis (as Cyclotron) and [[Deathbolt]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 23|Date = (Jul 1983)|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref> However, his sympathies soon swayed towards the side of good<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 25|Date = (Sept 1983)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> after repeated exposure to the [[All-Star Squadron]], a team of both Golden Age characters and retroactive characters like himself, with whom he joined to defeat his former employer's machinations. He then served a lengthy stint as a member of this voluminous mystery man organization.

In February 1942, the Squadron helped Everett defeat the bigoted villain in his home town of [[Detroit]], the Real American.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 38|Date = (Oct 1984)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> During the first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], Amazing-Man was one of a group of heroes chosen by the Monitor to stop the Anti-Monitor's quest for destruction.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = All-Star Squadron|Issue = 53|Date = (Jan 1986)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Crisis on Infinite Earths|Issue = 5|Date = (Aug 1985)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>On a future case, Amazing-Man's powers changed so that now he had mastery of [[magnetism]] while losing his ability to mimic matter.

====Civil Rights Activist====
In the 1950s, his secret identity was revealed to the general public by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. This act endangered the lives of Everett's wife and family. During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s, the murder of his nephew alongside two other civil rights activists spurred his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement of the time. He led marches against [[Racial segregation|segregation]] across the [[United States|United States of America]], and also helped to quell riots in [[Detroit]]. Everett was also responsible for the capture of [[Martin Luther King]]'s murderer [[James Earl Ray]]. In the DC Comics Universe, he is considered the third most important advocate for [[African American]] civil rights, behind acclaimed activists Martin Luther King and [[Malcolm X]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' #12 (vol. 3) (March 2008)</ref>

It was later revealed that his grandson, Will Everett III (a.k.a. "Junior") also developed mimicry abilities. Will Everett Senior was last seen in the hospital, visited by his grandson Will Everett III. The senior Everett was dying of [[cancer]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Justice League America|Issue = 86-87|Date = (Mar and Apr 1994)|Publisher = DC Comics}}, ''DC Comics Encyclopedia''</ref> The status of his son, the father of Amazing-Man III, is currently unknown. For a brief time, his grandson carried on the legacy of Amazing-Man before dying tragically. Later, another grandson named Markus Clay would take up the mantle of Amazing-Man.

===Will Everett III===
Will Everett III carried on his grandfather's heroic tradition, joining the [[Justice League]] at [[Wonder Woman]]'s request.<ref name="dc-ency2">{{Citation  | last = Jimenez  | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Amazing Man II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 12  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Justice League America|Issue = 86|Date = (Mar 1994)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> As a member, he was instrumental in defeating the [[Overmaster]] alongside the other members of the League and reformed members of the [[Cadre (comics)#Cadre of the Immortal|Cadre of the Immortal]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Justice League International|Volume = 2|Issue = 66|Date = (Jul 1994)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Soon after this, [[Captain Atom]] formed a splinter group of the JLA nicknamed [[Extreme Justice]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Extreme Justice|Issue = 0|Date = (Jan 1995)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> He remained with the team until its end.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Extreme Justice|Issue = 0|Date = (Jul 1996)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 117  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Later, Will joined the [[Crimson Fox]]'s unofficial re-grouping of Justice League Europe. In their single ill-fated adventure, Will was apparently killed by a supervillainess named the [[Mist (comics)|Mist]], along with the Crimson Fox and [[Blue Devil]]. In Amazing-Man's case, Mist tricked him into mimicking glass and then shattered him. The status of his father Will Everett II is unknown, but his cousin Markus Clay is the new Amazing-Man.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Starman|Volume=2|Issue = 38|Date = (Jan 1998)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Jan08/solicitations.html Newsarama.com: DC COMICS SOLICITATIONS FOR JANUARY 2008]</ref>

Years later during ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', Will is memorialized by [[Martian Manhunter]] with a statue in [[Happy Harbor]] alongside other fallen Justice League members.

===Markus Clay===

The third Amazing-Man is a man named Markus Clay, who operates out of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He is Will Everett's other grandson, and the cousin of Will Everett III. Markus is currently helping survivors of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>As seen in ''Justice Society of America'' #12 vol. 3 (March 2008)</ref> A recent recruit of the [[Justice Society of America]], he has helped the team communicate with [[Gog (comics)|Gog]]. After Gog's defeat, Markus returns to New Orleans, considering forming a team of his own.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #23</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*Will Everett was originally capable of transforming himself into a living, breathing facsimile of any material that he touched. 
*Later Will Everett's powers were altered, and he was instead able to magnetically attract or repel objects with his hands. 
*Will Everett III could cause his body to duplicate the properties of any inorganic material he touched from stone to glass. If he touched the pavement, for example, he became a sentient being made of living stone, with all its commensurate strengths and weaknesses.
*Will Everett III could also absorb and duplicate vast amounts of energy, as when he defeated the Overmaster by draining and duplicating its powers.
*Markus Clay appears to possess the same abilities as the first two Amazing-Men.
