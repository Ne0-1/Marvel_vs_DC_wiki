==Biography==
{{spoilers}}
He was originally a [[Sweden|Swedish]] scientist named Sven Larsen.  Dr. Larsen was a former student of [[Niles Caulder]], but they had a falling out after Larsen accused Caulder of stealing his idea for the anti-decay ray.  Larsen gained his superpowers after falling into a vat of [[amino acids]].  He used his powers to get revenge on Caulder and Doom Patrol.  The Doom Patrol defeated him and were able to remove his power.  He later regained them (in ''Doom Patrol'' Vol. 1, #95, May 1965) and fought the Doom Patrol again.

Larsen returned to fight the second incarnation of the Doom Patrol in ''Doom Patrol'' Vol. 2 #15 (December 1988) and #16 (Winter 1988), in partnership with [[General Immortus]].  He was defeated after [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]] encased him in ice.  His current whereabouts are unknown.
