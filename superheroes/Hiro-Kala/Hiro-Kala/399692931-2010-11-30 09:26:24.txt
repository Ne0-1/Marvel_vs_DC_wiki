==Fictional character biography==
===Shadow Tales===
During the explosion that devastated Sakaar, [[Caiera]] used her Old Power to protect her womb, saving Skaar and Hiro-Kala from the blast, but landing them in fire. Skaar survives the lava effortlessly, having been born with Hulk's physiology,  Hiro-Kala, however only managed to survive by inadvertently using his Old Power to protect him.<ref name="IH612">''Incredible Hulks'' # 612</ref> Soon after his birth, he is enslaved. He was pushed, mocked, even laughed at, until an old man tells him about the story of Hulk, and discovers his goal, to get the Old Power. He sneaked out of the Fillian borders, and was stranded on a desert, where two men were pushing on him, he remained silent until a monster helps him and kills the men. He was calmed by a woman who was kind enough to give Hiro an apple, but Hiro refuses and continues his journey. He saw Hiro-Amin chained and hopeless across an arc, Hiro Kala used a rock to break the chain, Hiro Amin knew what the boy was looking for, and asked him to reach in his pocket. Hiro Kala thought it was a rock, but it was just an eye of a man who sought the Old Power, and went crazy. Hiro Amin said that to get the Old Power, he or she must kill someone with the Old Power, Axeman from behind grabs Hiro Kala and gives him his axe. As Hiro Kala raises the axe and finishes Hiro Amin, a blue beam circled over the sky. He knew it was the Old Power but it never came to him, it just flew away. Axeman grabs Hiro by the neck and breaks his slave collar, Axeman granted Hiro Kala freedom and became his honor guard. A few days later, Hiro Kala and the Axeman's army went to Okini to hunt Skaar.

===Free at Last===
After some time, the Silver Surfer shows up to warn the people of Galactus's coming. Yenrag and Old Sam joined forces to free the slaves. Hiro Kala lead Old Sam and Yenrag and the rest of the slaves to the battle grounds of Fillian borders. Hiro Kala helped Surfer rescue the shadow slaves, while Yenrag was fighting guards of Axeman. After the fight, Hiro Kala takes notice of Caiera's return. Hiro Kala and the rest were watching Surfer and Skaar fight until they saw nothing. The surfer had sent Skaar to see the might of Galactus up close. Skaar's pride caused him to waste time and ignore the urging of his mother to evacuate the people of Sakaar. He chose instead to face Galactus, thinking he could fend him off - against the better judgment of both Caiera and the Silver Surfer. Galactus destroyed Sakaar, absorbing its Old Power, and sating his hunger for an estimated 10,000 years. Seeing the futility of reasoning with her son, Caiera cast her son through the wormhole and toward Earth. In a final spiteful attack, Skaar blasted Galactus with a surge of Old Power, waking him and causing Galactus's hunger for Old Power to surge beyond his control. Now Hiro Kala leads the remaining Sakaar people to find a new planet.

===Beyond Sakaar===
Hiro Kala and the remainder of the Sakaarian people escaped in the last stone ship, though no one knew how it was to be piloted with no Old Power remaining. Galactus had destroyed and devoured the Old Power of Sakaar. Hiro commandeers a stone drone and leaves the ship, to the amazement of those aboard the ship. Piloting the drone directly in front of Galactus, Hiro swears vengeance for the destruction of Sakaar. He also claims to be the son of Hulk the Green Scar and mother Caiera the Shadow Queen. While returning to the stone ship, Caiera reveals herself in a trail of Old Power, seemingly sorry for neglecting to care for Hiro in his time of need, instead reserving her council for Skaar. After returning to the stone ship, Hiro Kala kills one of Axeman Bone's soldiers for questioning his newest claim - he is the Sakaarson, the life bringer, and the World Breaker.

Hiro, commanding the stone ship, follows Galactus's energies and lands on the planet Giausar... the first and proudest of the ancient Shadow's worlds. Though he is warned of potential for death at the hands of the secretive and exclusive Giausarian people, he is unafraid - telling them he will come to be known as their new god. Hiro soon subjugates the land of Fractas on Giausar and convinces most of the people there of his deity status. His use of the Old Power on the planet has caused massive destruction and made the planet itself unstable. While the world crumbles upon itself, the other lands of Giausar attack Hiro Kala, and soon face his wrath, costing them their lives. With his unprecedented control of the Old Power Hiro backfires their own cannons against them.
  
Galactus' arrival shows Hiro-Kala's true intentions - while Galactus devours the planet's supply of the Old Power, Hiro unleashes a combination of the Old Power and the Power Cosmic, causing Galactus to be poisoned. This combination causes Galactus to feel the pain and anguish of every soul he has just consumed. His addiction to the Old Power will now only lead him to pain and death. Once again he flies to Galactus and cautions him - to be wary that Hiro Kala may have visited the next planet Galactus plans to consume, poisoning that world as well. Galactus vomits out a blast of souls that strikes Hiro, then retreats into the distance. Caiera appears once again, telling Hiro that she loves him, and though no one will ever know what he's done here, she would. Hiro tells Caiera to leave, as she is now only a construct of an artificial, dangerous power - the Old Power. She dissipates as Hiro cries out in pain and anguish. He has sacrificed the world of Giausar to save the universe that Skaar had sent Galactus upon devouring. Hiro returns to his ship with the right side of his face badly scarred, telling his crew to locate Skaar.
 
During their search, their ship falls into the [[Microverse]] and lands on the planet [[K'ai]]. Learning of his father's exploits there, Hiro-Kala attempts to conquer the planet, but ends up saving the dying world and pulls it out of the Microverse. Hiro-Kali then attempts to take control of K'ai's ''Worldmind''. The Worldmind, reaching into Hiro-Kala's mind, attempts to dissuade him from his path by showing him it's memories of the Hulk. The attempt fails, and Hiro-Kala takes control of the Worldmind's power, using it to turn the inhabitants of K'ai into mindless slaves. Hiro-Kala then sets his sights on Earth, planning to destroy it.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #612-613</ref>

===Dark Son===
As K'ai enters Earth's solar system, Hiro-Kala mentally connects with his brother Skaar, alerting him of his coming. With that knowledge, their father gathers his allies to stop Hiro-Kala.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #613-614</ref> After the Hulk's forces make it through the starships around K'ai, Hiro-Kala is confronted by his father, the two finally meeting face-to-face.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #615</ref> Hiro-Kala taunts his father by killing the remainder of the brainwashed children he sent to atttack him, and reveals that he will have K'ai collide with Earth, destroying it and it's old power. Outraged by his son's callousness, the Hulk attacks Hiro-Kala. During their battle, Skaar seemingly sacrifices himself to save a barge full of brainwashed slaves from a volcanic eruption. Hiro-Kala mocks his brother's sacrifice, calling him "weak". The Hulk, angrier then ever, beats Hiro-Kala into submission, but cannot bring himself to kill him, instead reverting back to Bruce Banner and stunning him with an old power taser. This releases Hiro-Kala's old power throughout the planet. Skaar, in oldstrong form, bursts out of the ground, intending to kill his brother himself.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #616</ref> Hiro-Kala and Skaar battle, with Skaar trying to calm his brother down. When K'ai's Worldmind reveals to Hiro-Kala that the image of Caiera he saw was merely a figment of his imagination, he loses his mind, lashing out with the old power. Skaar uses his own old power to seal Hiro-Kala in a sphere of stone, with only his face visible. At the same time, the rest of "Team Hulk" set off an explosion that knocks K'ai off course, saving Earth. K'ai's Worldmind then takes Hiro-Kala into the planet's core, so that his old power can heal what he almost destroyed.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #617</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Being born in a war torn planet, he is experienced at hand to hand combat and is also a good Swordsman, it also leads to his Freedom. Hiro Kala quickly matured to his teen years and mastered the Old Power. He has increased endurance, agility, reflexes and strength. His Old Power makes him stronger than normal and he can harden his body, making a layer of force fields that make him more durable. He can use the Old Power in tremendous blasts and can make it into a water-like substance, making it flexible enough to go inside a needle's eye. Even after the destruction of Sakaar he is shown to possess an amazing control over the Old Power, seemingly from his heritage (Caiera/Hulk). However he lacks his father's powers including a healing factor. 
 
Hiro-Kala has since forsaken the Old Power, as a new energy has grown within him. His current powers have been given to him from the planet K'ai.<ref name="IH612"/> He understands his father's transformations are a power within his mind and seems to be harnessing the hate and rage within his own mind.
