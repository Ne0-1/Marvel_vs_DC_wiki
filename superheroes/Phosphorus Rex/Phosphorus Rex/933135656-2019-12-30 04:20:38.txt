{{Plot|section|date=March 2018}}
Phosphorus Rex appears in the ''[[Beware the Batman]]'' episode "Allies", voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]. In this show, Phosphorus Rex's human identity is '''Milo Match''' who is [[Tobias Whale]]'s [[lawyer]] and can assume a fiery form. After Tobias Whale was apprehended by Batman and the Gotham City Police Department, Milo Match appeared where he demanded that Tobias Whale be cleared of all charges and released. James Gordon doesn't agree to the terms. This led to Milo Match having [[Barbara Gordon]] abducted and taken to "The Cauldron" (a former industrial park that fell to corruption during Gotham City's bankruptcy) upon Batman discovering this. Tobias Whale and Milo Match are shown to be in league with the "ghosts" of "The Cauldron". Lt. Gordon arrives with Tobias Whale at the warehouse where Barbara Gordon, Batman, [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and Milo Match are at as Tobias Whale has Milo Match show off his powers. As Milo transforms into Phosphorus Rex, Tobias Whale states that Milo is also his chief enforcer. Tobias Whale is accidentally pinned down by a shelf during Phosphorus Rex's fiery attack on Batman and Katana. Batman and Katana managed to defeat Tobias Whale and Phosphorus Rex who are then arrested by the police. In the episode "Reckoning", Tobias Whale and Phosphorus Rex are some of the [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] inmates rallied by [[Ra's al Ghul]] to capture and bring Batman to him.
