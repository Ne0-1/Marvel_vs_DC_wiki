The '''Hulk''' (also known as ''The Incredible Hulk'') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962). In 2008, the hobbyist magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' named the Hulk the seventh-greatest Marvel Comics character.<ref>''Wizard'' (June 2008)</ref> ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' named him the fourteenth greatest comic book character overall, and the fifth highest ranked in the Marvel stable.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=14 | title=The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters | work=Empire | date=December 5, 2006 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

The Hulk is cast as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and reserved [[physicist]] '''Dr. Bruce Banner'''. The Hulk appears shortly after Banner is accidentally exposed to the blast of a test detonation of a [[gamma ray|gamma]] bomb he invented. Subsequently, Banner will involuntarily transform into the Hulk, depicted as a giant, raging, humanoid monster, leading to extreme complications in Banner's life. Lee said the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein]]''.<ref name="HulkTIG">{{Cite book| last=DeFalco | first=Tom | title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide | publisher=[[DK Publishing]] | date=May 5, 2003 | location=[[London]] | page=200 | isbn=978-0789492609}}</ref> 

Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most consistent shade is green. As the Hulk, Banner is capable of significant feats of strength, which increases in direct proportion to the character's anger. As the character himself puts it, "The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets!" Strong emotions such as anger, terror and grief are also triggers for forcing Banner's transformation into the Hulk. A common storyline is the pursuit of both Banner and the Hulk by the U.S. authorities, due to the destruction he causes.

The character has since been depicted in [[Hulk in other media|various other media]], most notably by [[Lou Ferrigno]] in a live action [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|television series]], six television movies, and an [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|animated series]]; through the use of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008), as well as in three animated series and various video games.

==Publication history==
===Concept and creation===
The Hulk first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962), written by writer-editor Stan Lee, and [[penciller]] and co-plotter Jack Kirby, and [[inker|inked]] by [[Paul Reinman]]. Lee cites influence from ''Frankenstein''<ref name="OyVey"/> and ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' in the Hulk's creation:
{{blockquote|I combined ''Jekyll and Hyde'' with Frankenstein," he explains, "and I got myself the monster I wanted, who was really good, but nobody knew it. He was also somebody who could change from a normal man into a monster, and lo, a legend was born."<ref name="ffwdweekly.com"/>  Lee remembers, "I had always loved the old movie ''Frankenstein''. And it seemed to me that the monster, played by [[Boris Karloff]], wasn't really a bad guy. He was the good guy. He didn't want to hurt anybody. It's just those idiots with torches kept running up and down the mountains, chasing him and getting him angry. And I thought, 'Wouldn't it be fun to create a monster and make him the good guy?'<ref name="ffwdweekly.com">[http://www.ffwdweekly.com/listings/film/65183/]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>}}

Lee also compared Hulk to the [[Golem]] of Jewish myth.<ref name="OyVey"/> In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War<ref name=GreshWeinberg/> and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey]]''.<ref name="OyVey"/> Kaplan calls Hulk "[[schizophrenic]]."<ref name=Kaplan>{{Cite book| last=Kaplan | first=Arie | title=Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed! | publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]] | date=September 1, 2006 | location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] | isbn=978-1556526336}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}<!-- page=263 | page=58 -- Which is it...58 or 263?? --></ref> Jack Kirby has also commented upon his influences in drawing the character, recalling as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car.<ref>{{cite web| last=Hill | first=Dave | title=Green with anger | date=July 17, 2003 | work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WXHxoJ2k | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref>

===Debut and first series===
[[Image:Hulk1.jpg|thumb|left|''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]].]]
In the debut, Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group.<ref name="CBG">''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1617 (June 2006)</ref> Colorist [[Stan Goldberg]], however, had problems with the grey coloring, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green.<ref>''[[Starlog]]'' #213 (July 2003)</ref> Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #302 (December 1984) reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. Since then, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk's skin had initially been grey.

The original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and [[Steve Ditko]] penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in ''[[Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four]]'' #12<!--"The" part of cover logo through issue #15--> (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], appearing in the first two issues of the team's eponymous series (Sept. & Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issues #3 and #5 (Jan.–May 1964). He then guest-starred in ''Fantastic Four'' #25-26 (April–May 1964), which revealed his first name, Robert, and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964).

Around this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot.<ref name="OyVey"/> Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.

===''Tales to Astonish''===
[[Image:Talestoastonish60.jpg|''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #60 (Oct. 1964). Cover art by Jack Kirby and [[Sol Brodsky]].|thumb]]
A year and a half after the series was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', beginning in issue #60 (Oct. 1964). In the previous issue, he had appeared as an antagonist for [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]], whose feature under various superhero guises had run in the title since issue #35. This phase also introduced the concept of Banner's transformations being caused by extreme emotional stress, which would become central to the character's status as an iconic figure of runaway emotion. This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by writer-editor Lee and illustrated by the team of penciller [[Steve Ditko]] and [[inker]] [[George Roussos]]. Other artists later in this run included [[Jack Kirby]] from #68-84 (June 1965 – Oct. 1966), doing full pencils or, more often, layouts for other artists; [[Gil Kane]], credited as "Scott Edwards", in #76 (Feb. 1966), his first Marvel Comics work; [[Bill Everett]] inking Kirby in #78-84 (April–Oct. 1966); and [[John Buscema]]. [[Marie Severin]] finished out the Hulk's run in ''Tales to Astonish''. Beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled ''The Incredible Hulk'', and ran until March 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and restarted the title with a new issue #1. The ''Tales to Astonish'' run introduced the supervillains the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]],<ref name="HulkTIG"/> who would become the Hulk's archnemesis, and the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], another gamma-irradiated being.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> In issue #77 (March 1966), Bruce Banner's and the Hulk's dual identity became publicly known.

===1970s===
''The Incredible Hulk'' was published through the 1970s, and the character also made guest appearances in other titles. Writers introduced Banner’s cousin Jennifer Walters, the [[She-Hulk]], in a title of her own. In the first issue of the ''She-Hulk'' comic, Banner gave some of his blood to Walters in a transfusion, and the gamma radiation affected her, but she maintained most of her intellect. She later appeared in the ''Hulk'' comic proper, as well as other Marvel titles. Banner’s guilt about causing her change became another part of his character, although Jennifer grew to prefer her Hulk state.

Writers changed numerous times during the decade. At times, the creative staff included [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Chris Claremont]], and [[Tony Isabella]], Len Wein handled many of the stories through the 1970s, working first with [[Herb Trimpe]], then, in 1975, with [[Sal Buscema]], who was the regular artist for ten years. [[Harlan Ellison]] plotted a story, scripted by [[Roy Thomas]], for issue #140 (June 1971), "The Brute that Shouted Love at the Heart of the Atom". Issues #180-181 (Oct.-Nov. 1974) introduced the character [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics' most popular.

In 1977, Marvel (under it's [[Curtis Magazines]] imprint) launched a second title, ''[[Rampaging Hulk|The Rampaging Hulk]]'', a black-and-white comics magazine.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> Originally, the series was conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in ''Tales to Astonish''.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Warner, John | story=The Rampaging Editorial | title=The Rampaging Hulk | issue=1 |date = January 1977| pages=40–41 | publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> After nine issues, the magazine was retitled ''The Hulk!'' and printed in full color. Near the end of the magazine's run, it went back to black-and-white.<ref>{{gcdb series|id=2455|title=''The Hulk!''}}</ref> Back-up features included ''[[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]'', ''[[Man-Thing]]'', and ''[[Shanna the She-Devil]]'' during the ''Rampaging Hulk'' issues, and later ''[[Moon Knight]]'' and ''[[Dominic Fortune]]''. Ultimately, the stories from both incarnations of the magazine were quietly retconned as "movies" based upon the Hulk for alien audiences.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===1980s and 1990s===
Following [[Roger Stern]], [[Bill Mantlo]] took over the writing with issue #245 (March 1980). His "Crossroads of Eternity" stories, which ran through issues #300-313 (Oct. 1984 – Nov. 1985), explored the idea that Banner had suffered [[child abuse]]. [[Greg Pak]], a later writer on ''The Incredible Hulk''vol. 2), called Mantlo's "Crossroads" stories one of his biggest influences on approaching the character.<ref>{{cite web| last=Taylor | first=Robert | title=Greg Goes Wild on Planet Pak | work=Wizard Magazine | publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=August 3, 2006 | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm | accessdate=November 15, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070402044123/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm |archivedate = April 2, 2007}}</ref> After five years, Mantlo and artist [[Mike Mignola]] left the title for ''[[Alpha Flight]]'',<ref>{{cite web| last=Serwin | first=Andy | title=The Wizard Retrospective: Mike Mignola | work=Wizard Magazine | publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=July 23, 2007 | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm | accessdate=November 13, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080120105210/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm |archivedate = January 20, 2008}}</ref> and  ''Alpha Flight'' writer [[John Byrne]] took over the series, followed briefly by [[Al Milgrom]], before new regular writer [[Peter David]] took over.

David became the writer of the series with issue #331 (May 1987), marking the start of a 12-year tenure. David's run altered Banner's pre-Hulk characterization and the nature of the relationship between Banner and the Hulk. David returned to the Stern and Mantlo abuse storyline, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering [[dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity disorder (DID)]]. David's stories showed that Banner had serious mental problems long before he became the Hulk. David revamped the personality significantly, giving the grey Hulk the alias "Joe Fixit," and setting him up as a morally ambiguous [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Vegas]] enforcer and tough guy. David worked with numerous artists over his run on the series, including [[Dale Keown]], [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Sam Kieth]], [[Gary Frank]], [[Liam Sharp]], [[Terry Dodson]], [[Mike Deodato]], [[George Pérez]], and [[Adam Kubert]].<ref name="HulkTIG"/>

In issue #377 (Jan. 1991), David revamped the Hulk again, using a storyline involving hypnosis to have the splintered personalities of Banner and Hulk synthesize into a new Hulk, who has the vast power of the Savage Hulk, the cunning of the grey Hulk, and the intelligence of Bruce Banner.

In the 1993 ''Future Imperfect'' [[miniseries]], writer David and penciller George Pérez introduced readers to the Hulk of a [[dystopia]]n future. Calling himself the [[Maestro (Marvel Comics)|Maestro]], the Hulk rules over a world where most of the heroes have been killed, and only Rick Jones and a small band of rebels fight against the Maestro’s rule. Although the Maestro seemed to be destroyed by the end, he returned in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #460 (Jan. 1998), also written by David.

In 1998, David followed editor Bobbie Chase's suggestion to kill Betty Ross. In the introduction to the Hulk trade paperback ''Beauty and the Behemoth'', David said that his wife had recently left him, providing inspiration for the storyline. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to push the idea of bringing back the Savage Hulk. David disagreed, leading to his parting ways with Marvel.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Radford | first=Bill | page=L4 | date=February 21, 1999 | publisher=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] | title=Marvel's not-so-jolly green giant gets a fresh start and a new team}}</ref> His last issue of ''Hulk'' was #467 (Aug. 1998), his 137th.

Also in 1998, Marvel relaunched ''The Rampaging Hulk'' as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine.

===Relaunch===
Following David's departure, [[Joe Casey]] took over as writer though the series' relaunch after issue #474 (March 1999). ''Hulk'' vol. 2<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/HULK3.HTM#S40 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Hulk'' (II) (1999–2000)]</ref> began immediately the following month, scripted by John Byrne and penciled by [[Ron Garney]]. Byrne departed before the first year was over, citing creative differences.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=190 | title=John Byrne: The Hidden Answers | last=Thomas | first=Michael | date=August 22, 2000 | work=Comic Book Resources | accessdate=November 5, 2007}}</ref> [[Erik Larsen]] and [[Jerry Ordway]] briefly filled scripting duties in his place, and the title returned to ''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3)<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/HULK4.HTM#S42 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Incredible Hulk'' (III) (2000–2008)]</ref> with the arrival of [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] in issue #12 (March 2000).

Jenkins wrote a story arc in which Banner and the three Hulks (Savage Hulk, grey Hulk, and the Merged Hulk, now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor) are able to mentally interact with one another, each personality taking over the shared body. During this, the four personalities (including Banner) confront yet another submerged Hulk, a sadistic Hulk intent on attacking the world for revenge.<ref name="HV3:13">''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #13 (April 2000)</ref> Jenkins also created [[John Ryker]] in issue #14 (May 2000), a ruthless military general in charge of the original gamma bomb test responsible for the Hulk's creation, and who plans to create similar creatures. Ryker's actions briefly result in Banner becoming the sadistic Hulk before the four other personae subdue the beast.

[[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] followed as the series' writer, and his run features Banner using [[yoga]] to take control of the Hulk while he is pursued by a secret conspiracy and aided by the mysterious Mr. Blue. Jones appended his 43-issue ''Incredible Hulk'' run with the [[limited series]] ''Hulk/Thing: Hard Knocks'' #1-4 (Nov. 2004 – Feb. 2005), which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus.

Peter David, who had initially signed a contract for the six-issue ''Tempest Fugit'' limited series, returned as writer when it was decided to make the story, now only five parts, part of the ongoing series instead.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/2004_09.html | title=Slight change of plan with ''Hulk'' | date=September 30, 2004 | work=PeterDavid.net | accessdate=November 5, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025033916/http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/2004_09.html |archivedate = October 25, 2007}}</ref> David contracted to complete a year on the title. ''Tempest Fugit'' revealed that [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] has manipulated the Hulk for years, tormenting him in various ways for "inconveniences" that the Hulk had caused him, including the sadistic Hulk Jenkins had introduced.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #81 (July 2005)</ref> After a four-part tie-in to the ''[[House of M]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] and a one-issue [[epilogue]], David left the series once more, citing the need to do non-Hulk work for the sake of his career.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.comicboards.com/hulk/view.php?trd=050718024904 | title=My leaving ''Hulk'' | last=David | first=Peter | date=July 18, 2005 | work=The Incredible Hulk Message Board | accessdate=August 28, 2005}}</ref>

===Planet Hulk and World War Hulk===
{{Main|Planet Hulk}}
{{Main|World War Hulk}}
[[Image:Wwh.PNG|Promotional art for ''[[World War Hulk]]'' #1 by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].|thumb]]
In the 2006 crossover storyline ''Planet Hulk'' by writer Greg Pak, a secret group of superhero leaders, the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], consider the Hulk an unacceptable potential risk to Earth, and rocket him into space to live a peaceful existence on a planet uninhabited by intelligent life. After a trajectory malfunction, the Hulk crashes on the violent planet [[Sakaar]]. Weakened by his journey, he is captured and eventually becomes a [[gladiator]] who scars the face of Sakaar's [[tyrant|tyrannical]] emperor. The Hulk becomes a rebel leader and later usurps Sakaar's throne through combat with the Red King and his armies.

After Hulk's rise to emperor, the vessel used to send Hulk to Sakaar explodes, killing millions in Sakaar's capital, including his pregnant queen, [[Caiera]], and the damage to the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] nearly destroys the planet.

The Hulk, enraged, returns to Earth with the remnants of Sakaar's citizens, and his allies, the [[Warbound]], seeking retribution against the Illuminati. After laying siege to [[Manhattan]], the Hulk learns one of his allies allowed the explosion to happen when Red King troops planted the bomb. He reverts to his Bruce Banner form after a fight with the Sentry and is taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.

===Retitling and new ''Hulk'' series===
As of issue #113 (Feb. 2008), the series was retitled ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'', still written by Greg Pak but starring the [[mythology|mythological]] [[demigod]] [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and teenage genius [[Amadeus Cho]].

Marvel also launched a new volume of ''Hulk'', written by [[Jeph Loeb]] and drawn by [[Ed McGuinness]]. The series featured the debut of a new [[Red Hulk]], and Banner emerging from a coma and resuming his changes into the Green Hulk. After issue #12, ''The Incredible Hulk'' #600 was released, in which Red Hulk absorbs Hulk's radiation and claims Banner can never turn into the Hulk again. The series then continued with issue #13, with Banner questioning whether he should be glad that Hulk is gone or even if the Hulk is truly gone. ''The Incredible Hulk'' also continued with #601 onward, in which Banner seeks out his son [[Skaar]], offering to train him to kill the Hulk in the eventuality of the Hulk's return. Under the aegis of megalomaniac [[Norman Osborn]], Banner is re-exposed to gamma radiation, re-initiating the radiation in his body. Osborn explains he wants the Hulk to return, taking Banner out of the equation, and having him fight Skaar, hopefully killing each other.

In a multi-series crossover titled "Fall of the Hulks", beginning December 2009, Banner allies himself with the Red Hulk, revealed as a former agent of the supervillian group the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]],<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma''</ref> and, in fact, General [[Thunderbolt Ross]]; the one Banner had killed was a [[Life Model Decoy]]<ref name=HulkV2#22>{{Cite comic | writer=Loeb, Jeph | penciller=Ed McGuinness | inker=[[Mark Farmer]] | story=Dogs of War | title=Hulk | volume=2 | issue=23 |date = July 2010| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> In the concurrent "Hulked Out Heroes" arc, writer [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] has the Intelligencia irradiate several heroes, turning them into destructive Hulk versions of themselves until they are cured.

In ''The Incredible Hulk'' #612, Banner tries to rekindle his marriage with [[Betty Ross]], who is now the Red She-Hulk.

==Characterization==
===Bruce Banner===
The core of the Hulk, Bruce Banner has been portrayed differently by different writers, but common themes persist. Banner, a [[genius]], is emotionally withdrawn in most fashions.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes.<ref name="OyVey"/> Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: "Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he can’t form meaningful bonds with anyone."<ref name="Kaplan"/>

Throughout the Hulk's published history, writers have continued to frame Bruce Banner in these themes. Under different writers, his fractured personality led to transformations into different versions of the Hulk. These transformations are usually involuntary, and often writers have tied the transformation to emotional triggers, such as rage and fear. As the series has progressed, different writers have adapted the Hulk, changing Hulk's personality to reflect changes in Banner's physiology or psyche. Writers have also refined and changed some aspects of Banner's personality, showing him as emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed.

===The Hulk===
During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Bruce Banner rushes to save a teenager who has driven onto the testing field. Pushing the teen, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], into a trench, Banner himself is caught in the blast, absorbing massive amounts of radiation. He awakens later in an infirmary, seeming relatively unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form that breaks through the wall and escapes. A soldier in the ensuing search party dubs the otherwise unidentified creature a "hulk".<ref name=Hulk1>''Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962). p. 8.</ref>

The original version of the Hulk was often shown as simple and quick to anger. His first transformations were triggered by sundown, and his return to Banner by dawn. However, in ''Incredible Hulk'' #4, Banner started using a gamma-ray device to transform at will.<ref name=Hulk4>''Incredible Hulk'' #4 (November 1962)</ref> In more recent Hulk stories, emotions trigger the change. Although grey in his debut, difficulties for the printer led to a change in his color to green. In the original tale, the Hulk divorces his identity from Banner’s, decrying Banner as "that puny weakling in the picture."<ref name=Hulk1/> From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet,<ref name="OyVey"/> and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly. Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the "dark, primordial side of [Banner's] psyche."<ref name=GreshWeinberg>{{Cite book| last=Gresh | first=Lois | coauthors=Robert Weinberg | title=The Science of Superheroes | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | date=September 29, 2003 | location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | isbn=978-0471468820}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}<!-- page=200 | page=27 -- Again, which is it?? --></ref> Even in the earliest appearances, Hulk spoke in the third person. The Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences, and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities the Hulk has, when the Hulk says, "But these muscles ain't just for show! All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin'!" In ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'', Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements may cost us." Daniels continues, "The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the [[Atomic Age|atomic age]]."<ref name=DanielsMarvel>{{Cite book| last=Daniels | first=Les | title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics | publisher=[[Abrams Books]] | date=September 25, 1993 | location=[[New York]] | page=287 | isbn=978-0810925663}}</ref>

Though usually a loner, the Hulk helped to form both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]<ref>''Avengers'' #1-2</ref> and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #1-3 (December 1971 – June 1972)</ref> He was able to determine that the changes were now triggered by emotional stress.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #60</ref>

''The Fantastic Four'' #12<!--"The" part of cover logo through issue #15--> (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. Although many early Hulk stories involve [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often, like Hulk, a radiation based character, like the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]] or the Leader, along with other foes such as the [[Toad Men]], or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross' daughter, Betty, loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, [[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]], also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing the Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales.

In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played with the nature of his transformations,<ref name="Nation">{{Cite book| title=Comic Book Nation | last=Wright | first=Bradford | date=March 22, 2001 | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | location=Baltimore, Maryland | isbn=978-0801865145 | page=336}}</ref> briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form.

Hulk stories began to involve other dimensions, and in one, Hulk met the empress [[Jarella]]. Jarella used magic to bring Banner’s intelligence to Hulk, and came to love him, asking him to become her mate. Though Hulk returned to Earth before he could become her king, he would return to Jarella's kingdom of [[K'ai]] again.

When Bill Mantlo took on writing duties, he led the character into the arena of political commentary when Hulk traveled to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], encountering both the violence of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and the Jewish Israeli heroine [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]]. Soon after, Hulk encountered the [[Arabian Knight (comics)#Abdul Qamar|Arabian Knight]], a [[Bedouin]] superhero.<ref name="OyVey">{{Cite book| last=Weinstein | first=Simcha | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey! | publisher=Leviathan Press | date=June 19, 2006 | location=[[Baltimore, Maryland]] | pages=82–97 | isbn=978-1881927327}}</ref>

Under Mantlo's writing, a mindless Hulk was sent to the "Crossroads of Eternity", where Banner was revealed to have suffered childhood traumas which engendered Bruce's repressed rage.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #312</ref>

Having come to terms with his issues, at least for a time, Hulk and Banner physically separated under John Byrne's writing. Separated from the Hulk by [[Doc Samson]],<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #315</ref> Banner was recruited by the [[U.S. government]] to create the [[Hulkbusters]], a government team dedicated to catching Hulk. Banner and Ross married,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #319</ref> but Byrne's change in the character was reversed by Al Milgrom, who reunited the two personas,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #323</ref> and with issue #324, returned the Hulk to his grey coloration, with the changes occurring at night, regardless of Banner's emotional state. The Hulk appeared to perish in a gamma bomb explosion, but was instead sent to Jarella's home dimension of K'ai.

Shortly after returning to Earth, Hulk took on the identity of "Joe Fixit," a shadowy behind the scenes figure, working in Las Vegas on behalf of a casino owner, Michael Berengetti.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #347</ref> For months, Banner was repressed in Hulk’s mind, but slowly began to reappear. Hulk and Banner began to change back and forth again at dusk and dawn, as the character initially had, but this time, they worked together to advance both their goals, using written notes as communication as well as meeting on a mental plane to have conversations. In ''The Incredible Hulk'' #333, the Leader describes the grey Hulk persona as strongest during the night of the new moon and weakest during the full moon. Eventually, the Green Hulk began to reemerge.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #372</ref>

In issue #377, David revamped the Hulk again. [[Doctor Leonard Samson]] engages the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s services to hypnotize Bruce Banner and force him, the Savage Hulk (Green Hulk) and Mr. Fixit (grey Hulk) to confront Banner's past abuse at the hands of his father, [[Brian Banner]]. During the session, the three identities confront a "Guilt Hulk," which sadistically torments the three with the abuse of Banner’s father. Facing down this abuse, a new larger and smarter Hulk emerges and completely replaces the "human" Bruce Banner and Hulk personae. This Hulk is a culmination of the three aspects of Banner. He has the vast power of the Savage Hulk, the cunning of the grey Hulk, and the intelligence of Bruce Banner.

Peter David then introduces the Hulk to the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], a secretive organization built around an extended family of superpowered people.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #382</ref> The family members, mostly distant cousins to each other, had codenames based in the mythos of the [[Trojan War]], and were descendants of the founder of the group, [[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]]. When Agamemnon leaves, he puts the Hulk in charge of the organization. The storyline ends when it is revealed Agamemnon has traded his offspring to an alien race to gain power. The Hulk leads the Pantheon against the aliens, and then moves on. During his leadership of the Pantheon, Hulk encounters a depraved version of himself from the future called Maestro, who Delphi saw in a vision back in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #401 with part of the events occurring concurrently in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #415.

Thrown into the future, Hulk finds himself allied with Rick Jones, now an old man, in an effort to destroy the tyrant Maestro. Unable to stop him in any other manner, Hulk uses the time machine that brought him to the future to send the Maestro back into the heart of the very Gamma Bomb test that spawned the Hulk.

Artistically, the character has been depicted as progressively more muscular in the years since his debut.<ref>{{cite web| last=Randerson | first=James | title=Superman copycats 'risk health' | work=The Guardian | date=May 17, 2006 | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WXIXicrd | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref>

In the House of M crossover, it was revealed that Hulk cannot stand opera and hates giant cyborg things and Australia, but personal pronouns most of all.

==Powers and abilities==
The Hulk possesses the potential for limitless physical strength depending directly on his emotional state, particularly his anger.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #109-111 (Oct.-Dec. 2007)</ref> This has been reflected in the repeated comment, "The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets." After probing, the entity [[Beyonder]] once claimed that the Hulk's potential strength had "no finite element inside."<ref>''Secret Wars'' vol. 2, #8</ref> His durability, regeneration, and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #394 (June 1994)</ref> Greg Pak described the Hulk shown during ''World War Hulk'' as having a level of physical power where "Hulk was stronger than any mortal—and most immortals—who ever walked the Earth."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brokenfrontier.com/columns/p/detail/hulk-skaar-hercules | title=Hulk, Skaar & Hercules | work=Broken Frontier | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

The Hulk is resistant to most forms of injury or damage. The extent varies between interpretations, but he has withstood the equivalent of core solar temperatures,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #435 (2006); ''World War Hulk'' #2 (2007); ''Incredible Hulk'' Annual 1997</ref> nuclear explosions,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #440 (April 1996); ''Fantastic Four'' #433 (2006); ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #105 (June 2007)</ref> and planet-splitting impacts.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #52; ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2, #125; ''Iron Man'' vol. 2, #19 (2007)</ref> He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities, including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #77</ref> surviving unprotected in space for extended periods,<ref>''World War Hulk: Prelude'' (2007)</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hulk_%28Bruce_Banner%29 Hulk (Bruce Banner)] at Marvel.com</ref> and when injured, healing from most wounds within seconds.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #398 (Oct. 1992)</ref>

His powerful legs allow him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #33 (Dec. 2001); ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #254 (Dec. 1980)</ref> and he has displayed sufficient superhuman speed to match [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #440 (April 1996)</ref> or the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''World War Hulk'' #5 (2007)</ref> He also has less commonly described powers, including abilities allowing him to "home in" to his place of origin in New Mexico,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 1) #314</ref> resist [[Telepathy|psychic control]],<ref>''The Defenders''  #12 (Feb. 1974); ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #259 (May 1981); ''Cable'' #34 (1996); ''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #1 (2007)</ref> grow stronger from radiation<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #105 (June 2007); ''The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect'' #2; ''Fantastic Four'' #433; ''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #2</ref> or dark magic,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 3) #82; ''The Darkness/Hulk'' #1</ref> and to see and interact with astral forms.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #369; ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #82</ref>

In the early days of the first ''Hulk'' comic series, "massive" doses of gamma rays (such as from the explosion of a hand-held nuclear grenade) would cause the Hulk to transform back to Bruce Banner, though this ability was written out of the character by the 1970s.

As Bruce Banner, he is considered one of the greatest minds on Earth. He has developed expertise in the fields of biology, chemistry, engineering, and physiology, and holds a Ph.D. in nuclear physics. He possesses "a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test."<ref>{{cite web| last=Pisani | first=Joseph | title=The Smartest Superheroes | work=BusinessWeek | url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm | accessdate=December 9, 2007}}</ref> Bruce Banner also makes use of his intelligence to create highly advanced technology labelled as "Bannertech", which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom. The most common Bannertech Bruce uses is a [[force field]] able to shrug off blows from Hulk-level entities, which was also given to [[Amadeus Cho]].

In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk’s powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of [[gamma radiation]] Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with [[adrenal gland]]s and [[green fluorescent protein|GFP]].

Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even create matter from energy - a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. "Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known."<ref>{{cite web| last=Choi | first=Charles Q. | title=Gamma Rays: The Incredible, Hulking Reality | work=LiveScience | date=June 11, 2008 | url=http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080611-incredible-hulk.html | accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref>

Over the long publication history of the Hulk's adventures, many recurring characters have featured prominently, including his sidekick Rick Jones, love interest Betty Ross, and her father, the often adversarial General "Thunderbolt" Ross.

==Family==
Bruce had a stillborn child with his first wife, Betty Ross Banner who is now the [[Red She-Hulk]]. He has two sons with his deceased second wife [[Caiera]] Oldstrong on the planet Sakaar named [[Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]].<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Pepose |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Hulks-Dark-Son-100611.html |title=DARK SON Rising As The Other Son of HULK Hits Earth |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010 }}</ref>  Skaar was introduced in November 2007 and had his own comic series before joining Bruce in his series. Hiro-Kala was a former slave from planet Sakaar and is currently on his way to Earth to be reunited with his father and brother. Banner also has a daughter named [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] with [[Thundra]] who was first introduced in August 2008. Banner may also be [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Carmilla Black]]'s biological father. His cousin, Jennifer Walters, is She-Hulk, who has generally acted as his substitute sister since Bruce visited her family as a child.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3. #73-75</ref>

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternate versions of the Hulk}}
In addition to his [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation, Hulk has also been depicted in other [[fictional universes]], in which Bruce Banner's transformation, behavior, or circumstances vary from the mainstream setting. In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.

The Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of [[Cultural icon|iconic]] status by many within and outside the comic book industry. In 2003, ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' claimed the character had "stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-23626618_ITM | title=Smash! | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WXAG9bFn | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref>

The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war. As well as being a reaction to the [[Cold War]], the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the [[Vietnam War]] raised, and Ang Lee said that the [[Iraq War]] influenced his direction.<ref name=GreshWeinberg/><ref>{{Cite journal| title=Becoming the Hulk | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | location=New York | date=June 30, 2003 | last=Lahr | first=John | page=72}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=The Clash of Symbols | newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]] | location=Glasgow | date=December 23, 2007 | last=Phelan | first=Stephen | page=42}}</ref> In the [[Michael Nyman]] edited edition of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]]. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the comic book ''[[Heroes (comics)|Heroes]]'', claiming that his greater prominence, alongside [[Captain America]], aided in "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Diekmann | first=Stefanie | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/guesteditors/story/0,14481,1201733,00.html | title=Hero and superhero | date=April 24, 2004 | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WX1zzKKs | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref>

In ''Comic Book Nation'', Wright alludes to Hulk's counterculture status, referring to a 1965 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine poll amongst college students which "revealed that student radicals ranked [[Spider-Man]] and the Hulk alongside the likes of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Che Guevara]] as their favorite revolutionary icons." Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of these are "The Ballad of the Hulk" by [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover for September 30, 1971, a full color [[Herb Trimpe]] piece commissioned for the magazine.<ref name="Nation"/><ref>{{cite web| last=Goldberg | first=Jonah | url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMyYTQ4NTc5ZTU1Y2U0ZDc4ZjhmZmIwMmRhZjNjNDg= | title=Spin City | date=May 7, 2002 | work=National Review Online | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WX9jU6iE | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref> The Hulk has been caricatured in such [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] as ''[[The Simpsons]]''<ref name=IAmFuriousYellow>{{Cite episode | series=[[The Simpsons]] | title=[[I Am Furious Yellow]] | airdate=April 28, 2002 | season=13 | number=18}}</ref> ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and ''[[Family Guy]]'',<ref>{{Cite episode | title=[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]] | series=[[Family Guy]] | credits=Danny Smith (writer) | network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] | airdate=April 18, 1999 | season=1 | number=3}}</ref> and such [[comedy]] [[television program|TV series]] as ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode | series=[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]] | title=[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones episode)|Summer Holiday]] | seriesno=2 | number=6 | airdate=June 19, 1984}}</ref> The character is also used a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation. For example, in a 2008 ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' review of an ''[[EastEnders]]'' episode, a character is described as going "into Incredible Hulk mode, smashing up his flat."<ref>{{Cite news| title=We love telly: We love soaps | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | location=London | date=February 5, 2008 | last=Quigley | first=Maeve | page=1}}</ref> The Hulk, especially his alter-ego Bruce Banner, is also a common reference in rap music.

The Incredible Hulk was parodied as ''The Incredible Sulk'' in [[Jackpot (Fleetway comics)|Jackpot]]. Sulk was a normal boy until an upset triggered an 'incredible sulk', much to his teachers' consternation.
