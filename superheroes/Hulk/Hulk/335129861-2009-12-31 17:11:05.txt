The '''Hulk'''  is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962). In 2008, the hobbyist magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' named the Hulk the seventh-greatest Marvel Comics character.<ref>''Wizard'', June 2008</ref> ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' named him the fourteenth greatest comic book character overall, and the fifth highest ranked in the Marvel stable.<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=14 ''Empire'' | The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Hulk is cast as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and reserved [[physicist]] '''Dr. Bruce Banner'''. The Hulk appears shortly after Banner is accidentally exposed to the blast of a test detonation of a [[Gamma ray|gamma]] bomb he invented. Subsequently, Banner will involuntarily transform into the Hulk, depicted as a giant, raging, humanoid monster, leading to extreme complications in Banner's life. Lee said the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein]]''.<ref>DeFalco, Tom. ''Hulk: The Incredible Guide'' (DK Children, 2008) ISBN 0756641691, ISBN 978-0756641696, '''page number?'''</ref>

Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most consistent shade is green. As the Hulk, Banner is capable of significant feats of strength, which increases in direct proportion to the character's anger. Strong emotions such as anger, terror and grief are also triggers for forcing Banner's transformation into the Hulk. A common storyline is the pursuit of both Banner and the Hulk by the police or the armed forces, due to the destruction he causes.

The character has since been depicted in [[Hulk in other media|various other media]], most notably by [[Lou Ferrigno]] in a live action [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|television series]], six television movies, and an [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|animated series]]; through the use of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008), as well as in three animated series and various video games.

==Publication history==
===Concept and creation===
The Hulk was created in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962) by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciller]] and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], who was [[inker|inked]] by [[Paul Reinman]]. Lee cites influence from ''[[Frankenstein]]''<ref name="OyVey"/> and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' in the Hulk's creation:
<blockquote>
"I combined ''Jekyll and Hyde'' with Frankenstein," he explains, "and I got myself the monster I wanted, who was really good, but nobody knew it. He was also somebody who could change from a normal man into a monster, and lo, a legend was born."<ref name="ffwdweekly.com"/>  Lee remembers, "I had always loved the old movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. And it seemed to me that the monster, played by [[Boris Karloff]], wasn't really a bad guy. He was the good guy. He didn't want to hurt anybody. It's just those idiots with torches kept running up and down the mountains, chasing him and getting him angry. And I thought, 'Wouldn't it be fun to create a monster and make him the good guy?'"<ref name="ffwdweekly.com">http://www.ffwdweekly.com/listings/film/65183/</ref>
</blockquote>
Lee also compared Hulk to the [[Golem]] of Jewish myth.<ref name="OyVey"/> In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War <ref name=GreshWeinberg/> and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey]]''.<ref name="OyVey"/> Kaplan calls Hulk "schizophrenic".<ref name=Kaplan>{{cite book

===Debut and first series===
[[Image:Hulk1.jpg|thumb|left|''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]].]]
In his debut, the Hulk was grey because Lee wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group.<ref name="CBG">{{cite journal|title=|year=2006|month=June|journal=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]|issue=1617}}</ref> Colorist [[Stan Goldberg]], however, had problems with the grey coloring, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green.<ref>{{cite journal|title=|year=2003|month=July|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=213}}</ref> Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #302 (Dec. 1984) reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. Since then, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk's skin had initially been grey.

The original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and [[Steve Ditko]] penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #12 (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], appearing in the first two issues of that superhero team's eponymous series (Sept. & Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issues #3 and #5 (Jan. & May 1964). He then guest-starred in ''Fantastic Four'' #25–26 (April–May 1964) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964).

Around this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot.<ref name="OyVey"/> Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.

===''Tales to Astonish''===
[[Image:Talestoastonish60.jpg|''Tales to Astonish'' #60 (Oct. 1964). Cover art by Jack Kirby and [[Sol Brodsky]].|thumb]]
A year and a half after the series was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' in issue #60 (Oct. 1964). In the previous issue, he appeared as an antagonist for [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]], whose feature under various superhero guises had run in the title since issue #35.  This phase also introduced the concept of Banner's transformations being caused by extreme emotional stress, which would become central to the character's status as an iconic figure of runaway emotion.  This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by writer-editor Lee and illustrated by the team of penciller [[Steve Ditko]] and [[inker]] [[George Roussos]]. Other artists later in this run included [[Jack Kirby]] from #68-84 (June 1965 - Oct. 1966), doing full pencils or, more often, layouts for other artists; [[Gil Kane]], credited as "Scott Edwards", in #76 (Feb. 1966), his first Marvel Comics work; [[Bill Everett]] (inking Kirby in #78-84, April-Oct. 1966); and [[John Buscema]]. [[Marie Severin]] finished out the Hulk’s run in ''Tales to Astonish''; beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled ''The Incredible Hulk'', and ran until March 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and then restarted the title with a new issue #1. This run of stories introduced readers to the supervillains the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]],<ref name=HulkTIG>{{cite book

===1970s===
''The Incredible Hulk'' was published through the 1970s, and the character also made guest appearances in other titles. Writers introduced Banner’s cousin Jennifer Walters, the [[She-Hulk]], in a title of her own. In the first issue of the She-Hulk comic, Banner gave some of his blood to Walters in a transfusion, and the gamma radiation affected her, but she maintained most of her intellect. She later appeared in the Hulk comic proper, as well as other Marvel titles. Banner’s guilt about causing her change became another part of his character.

Writers changed numerous times during the decade. At times, the creative staff included [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Chris Claremont]], and [[Tony Isabella]], Len Wein handled many of the stories through the 1970s, working first with [[Herb Trimpe]], then, in 1975, with [[Sal Buscema]], who was the regular artist for ten years. [[Harlan Ellison]] plotted a story, scripted by [[Roy Thomas]], for issue #140 (Jun 1971), "The Brute that Shouted Love at the Heart of the Atom". Also of notability was Incredible Hulk #181, which featured the introduction of the character [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. 

In 1977, Marvel (under its [[Curtis Magazines]] imprint) launched a second title, ''[[Rampaging Hulk|The Rampaging Hulk]]'', a black-and-white comics magazine.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> Originally, the series was conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in ''Tales to Astonish''.<ref>Warner, John, "The Rampaging Editorial," ''The Rampaging Hulk'', #1, January 1977, pp. 40-41.</ref>  After nine issues, the magazine was retitled ''The Hulk!'' and printed in full color. Near the end of the magazine's run, it went back to black-and-white.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=2455 ''The Hulk!''] series at the [[Grand Comic-Book Database]]</ref> Back-up features included ''[[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]'' during the ''Rampaging Hulk'' issues, and later ''[[Moon Knight]]'' and ''[[Dominic Fortune]]''.
Ultimately, the stories from both incarnations of the magazine were quietly retconned as "movies" based upon the Hulk for alien audiences.

===1980s and 1990s===
Following [[Roger Stern]], [[Bill Mantlo]] took over the writing with issue #245 (March 1980). His [[Crossroads of Eternity]] stories, which ran from issue #300 (Oct. 1984) to #313 (Nov. 1985), explored the idea that Banner had suffered [[child abuse]]. [[Greg Pak]], a later writer on ''The Incredible Hulk'' volume 2, called Mantlo's Crossroads stories one of his biggest influences on approaching the character.<ref>{{cite web

David became the writer of the series with issue #331 (May 1987), marking the start of a 12-year tenure. David's run altered Banner's pre-Hulk characterization and the nature of the relationship between Banner and the Hulk. David returned to the Stern and Mantlo abuse storyline, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering [[dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity disorder (DID)]]. David's stories showed that Banner had serious mental problems long before he became the Hulk. David revamped the personality significantly, giving the grey Hulk the alias 'Joe Fixit', and setting him up as a morally ambiguous [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Vegas]] enforcer and tough guy. David worked with numerous artists over his run on the series, including [[Dale Keown]], [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Sam Kieth]], [[Gary Frank]], [[Liam Sharp]], [[Terry Dodson]], [[Mike Deodato]], [[George Pérez]], and [[Adam Kubert]].<ref name="HulkTIG"/>

In issue #377 (Jan 1991), David revamped the Hulk again, using a storyline involving hypnosis to have the splintered personalities of Banner and Hulk synthesize into a new Hulk, who has the vast power of the Savage Hulk, the cunning of the grey Hulk, and the intelligence of Bruce Banner.
 
In the 1993 ''Future Imperfect'' [[miniseries]], writer David and penciller [[George Pérez]] introduced readers to the Hulk of a [[dystopia]]n future. Calling himself the [[Maestro (Marvel Comics)|Maestro]], the Hulk rules over a world where most of the heroes have been killed, and only Rick Jones and a small band of rebels fight against The Maestro’s rule. Although The Maestro seemed to be destroyed by the end, he returned in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #460 (Jan 1998), also written by David.

In 1998, David followed editor Bobbie Chase's suggestion to kill Betty Ross. In the introduction to the Hulk trade paperback ''Beauty and the Behemoth'', David said that his wife had recently left him, providing inspiration for the storyline. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to push the idea of bringing back the Savage Hulk. David disagreed, leading to his parting ways with Marvel.<ref>{{cite news|author=Radford, Bill|page=L4|date=1999-02-21|publisher=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]|title=Marvel's not-so-jolly green giant gets a fresh start and a new team}}</ref> His last issue of ''Hulk'' was #467 (Aug 1998), his 137th.

Also in 1998, Marvel relaunched ''The Rampaging Hulk'', this time as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine.

===Relaunch===
Following David's departure, [[Joe Casey]] took over as writer though the series' relaunch after issue #474 (March 1999). ''Hulk'' vol. 2<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/HULK3.HTM#S40 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Hulk'' (II) (1999-2000)]</ref> began immediately the following month, scripted by [[John Byrne]] and penciled by [[Ron Garney]]. Byrne departed before the first year was over, citing creative differences.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=190 | title=John Byrne: The Hidden Answers | author= Michael Thomas | date= August 22, 2000 | publisher=Comic Book Resources |  accessdate= 2007-11-05}}</ref> [[Erik Larsen]] and [[Jerry Ordway]] briefly filled scripting duties in his place, and the title returned to ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/HULK4.HTM#S42 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Incredible Hulk'' (III) (2000-2008)]</ref> with the arrival of [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] in issue #12 (March 2000).

Jenkins wrote a story arc in which Banner and the three Hulks (Savage Hulk, grey Hulk, and the Merged Hulk, now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor) are able to mentally interact with one another, each personality taking over the shared body. During this, the four personalities (including Banner) confront yet another submerged Hulk, a sadistic Hulk intent on attacking the world for revenge.<ref name="HV3:13">''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #13 (April 2000)</ref> Jenkins also created [[John Ryker]] in issue #14 (May 2000), a ruthless military general in charge of the original gamma bomb test responsible for the Hulk's creation, and who plans to create similar creatures. Ryker's actions briefly result in Banner becoming the sadistic Hulk before the four other personae subdue the beast.

[[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] followed as the series' writer, and his run features Banner using [[yoga]] to take control of the Hulk while he is pursued by a secret conspiracy and aided by the mysterious Mr. Blue. Jones appended his 43-issue ''Incredible Hulk'' run with the [[limited series]] ''Hulk/Thing: Hard Knocks'' #1-4 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005) , which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus.

Peter David, who had initially signed a contract for the six-issue ''Tempest Fugit'' limited series, returned as writer when it was decided to make the story, now only five parts, part of the ongoing series instead.<ref>{{Cite web |  url= http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/2004_09.html | title= Slight change of plan with Hulk | date=September 30, 2004 | publisher=peterdavid.net | accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> David contracted to complete a year on the title.

=== Planet Hulk and World War Hulk ===
{{mainarticle|World War Hulk}}
[[Image:Wwh.PNG|Promotional art for ''[[World War Hulk]]'' #1 by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].|thumb]]
In the 2006 crossover storyline ''Planet Hulk'' by writer [[Greg Pak]], a secret group of superhero leaders, the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], consider the Hulk an unacceptable potential risk to Earth, and rocket him into space to live a peaceful existence on a planet uninhabited by intelligent life. After a trajectory malfunction, the Hulk crashes on the violent planet [[Sakaar]]. Weakened by his journey, he is captured and eventually becomes a [[gladiator]] who scars the face of Sakaar's [[tyrant|tyrannical]] emperor. The Hulk becomes a rebel leader and later usurps Sakaar's throne through combat with the [[Red King (Marvel comics)|Red King]] and his armies.

After Hulk's rise to emperor, the vessel used to send Hulk to Sakaar explodes, killing millions in Sakaar's capital, including his pregnant queen, [[Caiera]], and the damage to the [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] nearly destroys the planet.

The Hulk, enraged, returns to Earth with the remnants of Sakaar's citizens, and his allies, the [[Warbound]], seeking retribution against the Illuminati. After laying siege to [[Manhattan]], the Hulk learns one of his allies was responsible for the explosion. He reverts to his Bruce Banner form and is taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.

===Retitling and new ''Hulk'' series===
As of #113 (Feb. 2008), the series was retitled ''The Incredible Hercules'', still written by Greg Pak but starring the [[Mythology|mythological]] [[demigod]] [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and teenage genius [[Amadeus Cho]].

Marvel also launched a new volume of ''Hulk'', written by [[Jeph Loeb]] and drawn by [[Ed McGuinness]]. The series featured the debut appearance of a new, [[Red Hulk]], Banner coming out of a coma and resuming his changes into the Green Hulk, and appearances from a wide range of characters such as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], [[Terrax]], [[Tiger Shark]], and others. After issue #12, Incredible Hulk #600 was released, where Red Hulk absorbs Hulk's radiation and claims Banner can never turn to Hulk again. The Hulk book then continued with issue #13 with Banner questioning whether he should be glad that Hulk is gone or even if the Hulk is truly gone. The Incredible Hulk book also continued with #601 onwards where Banner is seen fighting alongside his son [[Skaar]].

While training Skaar for the eventuality of the Hulk's return, Banner encounters [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Norman Osborn|Norman Osborn's]] assistant, Victoria Hand, who he thinks are trying to cross the Hulk off of Osborn's "[[Dark Reign (comics)#The_List|List]]". They expose him to a gamma radiation facility, re-initiating the radiation in his body. Osborn explains that he wants the Hulk to return, taking the super-intelligent Banner out of the equation, and fight Skaar, hopefully killing each other. 

Solicits for December 2009 describe an upcoming event called '''Fall of the Hulks'''. Covers depict all of the "Hulks" (Banner, Skaar, Red Hulk, She-Hulk, Red She-Hulk, Lyra, A-Bomb, and Leonard Samson) defeated, as well as a series of super-intelligent villains ([[Dr. Doom]], the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], [[Red Ghost]], [[MODOK]], and the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]).

==Characterization==
===Bruce Banner===
The core of the Hulk, Bruce Banner has been portrayed differently by different writers, but common themes persist. Banner, a [[genius]], is emotionally withdrawn in most fashions.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes.<ref name="OyVey"/>  Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: “Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he can’t form meaningful bonds with anyone.”<ref name="Kaplan"/>

Throughout the Hulk's published history, writers have continued to frame Bruce Banner in these themes. Under different writers, his fractured personality led to transformations into different versions of the Hulk. These transformations are usually involuntary, and often writers have tied the transformation to emotional triggers, such as rage and fear. As the series has progressed, different writers have adapted the Hulk, changing Hulk's personality to reflect changes in Banner's physiology or psyche. Writers have also refined and changed some aspects of Banner's personality, showing him as emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning.

===The Hulk===
During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Bruce Banner rushes to save a teenager who has driven onto the testing field. Pushing the teen, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], into a trench, Banner himself is caught in the blast, absorbing massive amounts of radiation. He awakens later in an infirmary, seeming relatively unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form that breaks through the wall and escapes. A soldier in the ensuing search party dubs the otherwise unidentified creature a "hulk".<ref name=Hulk1>{{Cite book | title =Incredible Hulk #1 | publisher=Marvel Comics Group |month=May | year=1962}} Page=8</ref>

The original version of the Hulk was often shown as simple and quick to anger. His first transformations were triggered by sundown, and his return to Banner by dawn. However, in Incredible Hulk #4, Banner started using a Gamma ray device to transform at will.<ref name=Hulk4>{{Cite book | title =Incredible Hulk #4 | publisher=Marvel Comics Group |month=November | year=1962}}</ref> In more recent Hulk stories, emotions trigger the change. Although grey in his debut, difficulties for the printer led to a change in his color to green. In the original tale, the Hulk divorces his identity from Banner’s, decrying Banner as "that puny weakling in the picture".<ref name=Hulk1/> From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet,<ref name="OyVey"/> and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly.

All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin'!" In ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'', Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements may cost us."

Though usually a loner, the Hulk helped to form both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]<ref>''Avengers'' #1-2</ref> and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #1-3 (Dec. 1971 - June 1972)</ref>  He was able to determine that the changes were now triggered by emotional stress.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #60</ref>

''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #12 (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].  Although many early Hulk stories involve [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often, like Hulk, a radiation based character, like the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]] or the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], along with other foes such as the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#T|Toad Men]], or Asian warlord [[General Fang]]. Ross' daughter, [[Betty Ross|Betty]], loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, [[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]], also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing the Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales.

In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played with the nature of his transformations,<ref name="Nation">{{cite book|title=Comic Book Nation|last=Wright|first=Bradford|authorlink= |year=2001|publisher=John Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore MD|isbn=0-8018-6514-X|pages=336}}</ref> briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form.

Hulk stories began to involve other dimensions, and in one, Hulk met the empress [[Jarella]]. Jarella used magic to bring Banner’s intelligence to Hulk, and came to love him, asking him to become her mate. Though Hulk returned to Earth before he could become her king, he would return to Jarella's kingdom of [[K'ai]] again.

When Bill Mantlo took on writing duties, he led the character into the arena of political commentary when Hulk traveled to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], encountering both the violence of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and the Jewish Israeli heroine [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]].

Under Mantlo's writing, a mindless Hulk was sent to the "Crossroads of Eternity", where Banner was revealed to have suffered childhood traumas which engendered Bruce's repressed rage.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #312</ref>

Having come to terms with his issues, at least for a time, Hulk and Banner physically separated under John Byrne's writing. Separated from the Hulk by [[Doc Samson]],<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #315</ref> Banner was recruited by the U.S. government to create the [[Hulkbusters]], a government team dedicated to catching Hulk. Banner and Ross married,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #319</ref> but Byrne's change in the character was reversed by Al Milgrom, who reunited the two personas,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #323</ref> and with issue #324, returned the Hulk to his grey coloration, with the changes occurring at night, regardless of Banner's emotional state. The Hulk appeared to perish in a gamma bomb explosion, but was instead sent to Jarella's home dimension of [[K'ai]].

Shortly after returning to Earth, Hulk took on the identity of "Joe Fixit," a shadowy behind the scenes figure, working in Las Vegas on behalf of a casino owner, Michael Berengetti.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #347</ref>  For months, Banner was repressed in Hulk’s mind, but slowly began to reappear. Hulk and Banner began to change back and forth again at dusk and dawn, as the character initially had, but this time, they worked together to advance both their goals, using written notes as communication as well as meeting on a mental plane to have conversations. In ''The Incredible Hulk'' #333, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] describes the grey Hulk persona as strongest during the night of the new moon and weakest during the full moon. Eventually, the Green Hulk began to reemerge.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #372</ref>

In issue #377, David revamped the Hulk again. [[Doctor Leonard Samson]] engages the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s services to hypnotize Bruce Banner and force him, the Savage Hulk (Green Hulk) and Mr. Fixit (grey Hulk) to confront Banner's past abuse at the hands of his father, [[Brian Banner]]. During the session, the three identities confront a ‘Guilt Hulk’, which sadistically torments the three with the abuse of Banner’s father. Facing down this abuse, a new larger and smarter Hulk emerges and completely replaces the "human" Bruce Banner and Hulk personae.  This Hulk is a culmination of the three aspects of Banner. He has the vast power of the Savage Hulk, the cunning of the grey Hulk, and the intelligence of Bruce Banner.

Peter David then introduces the Hulk to the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], a secretive organization built around an extended family of superpowered people.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #382</ref> The family members, mostly distant cousins to each other, had codenames based in the mythos of the [[Trojan War]], and were descendants of the founder of the group, [[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]]. When Agamemnon leaves, he puts the Hulk in charge of the organization. The storyline ends when it is revealed Agamemnon has traded his offspring to an alien race to gain power. The Hulk leads the Pantheon against the aliens, and then moves on.

Shortly after, Hulk encounters a depraved version of himself from the future, called Maestro. Thrown into the future, Hulk finds himself allied with Rick Jones, now an old man, in an effort to destroy the tyrant Maestro.  Unable to stop him in any other manner, Hulk uses the time machine that brought him to the future to send the Maestro back into the heart of the very Gamma Bomb test that spawned the Hulk.

In 1998, David followed Editor Bobbie Chase's suggestion, and wrote a storyline centering on the death of Betty Ross. Betty has radiation poisoning, and desperate to save her, General Thunderbolt Ross worked with Banner, but they fail (later revealed to be due to interference by the Abomination), and Betty dies.  The story was used to close Volume 2 of the ''Incredible Hulk'' title.  Following the story, David left Marvel, following a conflict about the direction of the series.

In 2006 [[Greg Pak]] introduced the Planet Hulk story arc, which opened with a cabal of Earth’s superpowers, called [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], sending Hulk into deep space to protect the Earth from his destructive rampages after his involvement in the destruction of the [[Godseye Satellite]] orbiting Earth.  Hulk’s rocket, intended for a desolate, empty planet, instead crashed onto Sakaar. On Sakaar, Hulk rises from slave to king leading a rebellion, and finds love with a wife, Caiera.  Shortly after, the rocket that brought Hulk to Sakaar malfunctions and explodes, setting off the planet’s destruction.  Following the death of his wife, unborn child, and hundreds of millions of innocents, Hulk gathers some survivors and heads to Earth to exact revenge.

In [[World War Hulk]], Hulk along with an alien invasion force, confronts and defeats the members of the Illuminati and several of Marvel's major superhero teams, but he later surrenders and is captured. Bruce Banner is later seen in custody in a military facility where General Ross and Doc Samson seek out Bruce Banner's help with the emerging mystery of a new Red Hulk.<!--plot details of the World War Hulk events are included above, under publication history.

Artistically, the character has been depicted as progressively more muscular in the years since his debut.<ref>James Randerson, "Superman copycats 'risk health'" ''[[The Guardian]], Wednesday May 17, 2006. Accessed 2008-23-03. [http://www.webcitation.org/5WXIXicrd Archived] 2008-23-03.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
The Hulk possesses the potential for near-limitless physical strength depending directly on his emotional state, particularly his anger.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #109-#111 (Oct.-Dec. 2007)</ref> This has been reflected in the repeated comment "The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets." After probing, the entity [[Beyonder]] once claimed that the Hulk's potential strength had "no finite element inside".<ref>Secret Wars vol 2. #8</ref> His durability, healing, and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #394 (June 1994)</ref> [[Greg Pak]] described the Hulk shown during ''[[World War Hulk]]'' as having a level of physical power where "Hulk was stronger than any mortal --and most immortals-- who ever walked the Earth." 
<ref>[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/columns/p/detail/hulk-skaar-hercules]</ref> 

The Hulk is resistant to most forms of injury or damage. The extent varies between interpretations, but he has withstood the equivalent of core solar temperatures,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #435 (2006); ''World War Hulk'' #2 (2007); ''Incredible Hulk Annual 1997''</ref> nuclear explosions,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #440 (April 1996); ''Fantastic Four'' #433 (2006); ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #105 (June 2007)</ref> and planet-splitting impacts.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #52; ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 2, #125; ''Iron Man'' Vol.2 #19 (2007)</ref> He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities, including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #77</ref> surviving unprotected in space for extended periods (yet still eventually needing to breathe),<ref>''World War Hulk: Prelude'' (2007); http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hulk_%28Bruce_Banner%29</ref> and when injured, healing from most wounds within seconds.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1, #398 (Oct. 1992)</ref>

His powerful legs allow him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #33 (Dec. 2001); ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #254 (Dec. 1980)</ref> and he has displayed sufficient superhuman speed to match [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #440 (April 1996)</ref> or the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''World War Hulk'' #5 (2007)</ref> He also has less commonly described powers, including abilities allowing him to "home in" to his place of origin in New Mexico,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol.1 #314</ref> resist [[Telepathy|psychic control]],<ref>''Defenders'' Vol.1, #12 (February 1974); ''The Incredible Hulk '' vol. 2, #259 (May 1981); ''Cable'' Vol.1, #34 (1996); ''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #1 (2007)</ref> grow stronger from radiation<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #105 (June 2007); ''The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect'' #2; ''Fantastic Four'' #433; ''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #2</ref> or dark magic,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol.3 #82; ''The Darkness/Hulk'' #1</ref> and to see and interact with astral forms.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol.2 #369; ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #82</ref>

As Bruce Banner, he is considered one of the greatest minds on Earth. He has developed expertise in the fields of biology, chemistry, engineering, and physiology, and holds a Ph.D. in nuclear physics. He possesses "a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test".<ref>{{cite web

In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk’s powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of [[gamma radiation]] Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with [[adrenal gland]]s and [[green fluorescent protein|GFP]].

Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that unlike the Incredible Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even create matter- a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. "Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known."<ref>{{cite web

The Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of [[Cultural icon|iconic]] status by many within and outside the comic book industry. In 2003 the Official PlayStation magazine claimed the character had "stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]."<ref>"[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-23626618_ITM Smash!]" Accessed 2008-23-03.

The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war.  As well as being a reaction to the [[Cold War]], the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the [[Vietnam War]] raised, and Ang Lee said that the [[Iraq War]] influenced his direction.<ref name=GreshWeinberg/><ref>"Becoming The Hulk".

Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the comic book ''[[Heroes (comics)|Heroes]]'', claiming that his greater prominence, alongside [[Captain America]], aided in "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist."<ref>Stefanie Diekmann.

In ''Comic Book Nation'', Wright alludes to Hulk's counterculture status, referring to a 1965 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine poll amongst college students which "revealed that student radicals ranked [[Spider-Man]] and the Hulk alongside the likes of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Che Guevara]] as their favorite revolutionary icons." Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of the most notable are "The Ballad of the Hulk" by [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover for 30 September 1971, a full color [[Herb Trimpe]] piece commissioned for the magazine.<ref name="Nation"/><ref>Jonah Goldberg, "[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMyYTQ4NTc5ZTU1Y2U0ZDc4ZjhmZmIwMmRhZjNjNDg= Spin City]".
