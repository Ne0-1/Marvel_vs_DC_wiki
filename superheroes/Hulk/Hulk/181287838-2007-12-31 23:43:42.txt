'''The Hulk''' (Dr. Robert Bruce Banner) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[anti-hero]] appearing in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the Hulk first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1, #1 (May 1962). He has since become one of Marvel Comics' most recognized characters.

After [[physicist]] Dr. Robert Bruce Banner was caught in the blast of a gamma bomb he created, he was transformed into the Hulk, a raging monster. The character, both as Banner and the Hulk, is frequently pursued by the police or the armed forces, often as a result of the destruction he causes. While the coloration of the character's skin varies during the course of its publication history, the Hulk is most often depicted as green. In forty years, he has battled virtually every hero and villain in the Marvel Universe.
He has been featured in a number of [[List of animated television series|animated series]], a [[Hulk (film)|feature film]] directed by [[Ang Lee]], and a [[television program#seasons/series|television series]] with spin-off [[television movie]]s starring [[Bill Bixby]] as Banner and [[Lou Ferrigno]] as the Hulk.

==Publication history==
===Debut and first series===
The Hulk debuted in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962), by writer [[Stan Lee]], [[penciller]] and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] Paul Reinman. In the first issue, the Hulk was gray rather than green. Writer and Marvel editor-in-chief Lee had wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group.<ref name=”CBG”>''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1617 (June 2006)</ref> Colorist [[Stan Goldberg]], however, insisted to Lee that the coloring technology at the time could not present the color grey clearly or consistently, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. From issue #2 (July 1962) on, Goldberg colored the Hulk's skin green.<ref>''[[Starlog]]'' #213 (July 2003)</ref> Green was used in retellings of the origin, even to the point of reprints of the original story being re-colored, for the next two decades. The Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #302 (Dec. 1984), reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. This was reaffirmed in vol. 2, #318 (April 1986), which showed the Hulk was grey at the time of his creation. Since then, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring.
[[Image:Hulk1.jpg|thumb|left|''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1, #1 (May 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]].]]

The original series was canceled after six issues, with the finale cover-dated March 1963. Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and [[Steve Ditko]] penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in ''Fantastic Four'' #12 (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the  [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] appearing in the first two issues of that superhero team's eponymous series (Sept. & Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issues #3 and #5 (Jan. & May 1964). He then guest-starred in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964).

Around this time, co-creator Jack Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot.<ref name="OyVey"/> Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.

===''Tales to Astonish''===
[[Image:Talestoastonish60.jpg|''Tales to Astonish'' #60 (Oct. 1964). Cover art by Jack Kirby and [[Sol Brodsky]]. |thumb]]
A year and a half after his title was canceled, the Hulk became the backup feature in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' in issue #60 (Oct. 1964). In the previous issue, he appeared as the antagonist for [[Giant-Man]], star of the book. These new stories were initially scripted by Lee and illustrated by the team of penciller [[Steve Ditko]] and [[inker]] [[George Roussos]]. Other artists later in this run included [[Jack Kirby]] from #68-84 (June 1965 - Oct. 1966), doing full pencils or, more often, layouts for other artists; [[Gil Kane]], credited as "Scott Edwards", in #76 (Feb. 1966); [[Bill Everett]] (inking Kirby, #78-84 (Apr. - Oct. 1966)); and [[John Buscema]]. [[Marie Severin]] finished out the Hulk’s run in ''Tales to Astonish''; beginning with issue #102 (Apr. 1968) the book was retitled ''The Incredible Hulk'', and ran until March 1999, when Marvel canceled the series, and then restarted the title with a new issue #1.

This run of stories introduced readers to recurring villains such as the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], who would become the Hulk's arch-nemesis<Ref name=HulkTIG> </ref>, and the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], another gamma-irradiated being, but stronger than the Hulk.<Ref name=HulkTIG>page 40</ref> In issue #77 (Mar. 1966), the Hulk's identity became publicly known.

===1970s===
''The Incredible Hulk'' continued to be published through the 1970s and also made guest appearances in other titles.  In 1977, following the debut of the eponymous television series, Marvel launched a second title, ''The Rampaging Hulk'', a comics magazine targeted to the show's audience.<ref name=HulkTIG/>Writers also introduced Banner’s cousin Jennifer Walters, the [[She-Hulk]], who was featured in a title of her own. Banner gave some of his blood to Walters in a transfusion, and the gamma radiation affected her, but she maintained most of her intellect. Banner’s guilt about causing her change became another part of his character.

Writers changed numerous times during the decade. At times, the creative staff included [[Archie Goodwin]], [[Chris Claremont]], and [[Tony Isabella]], Len Wein handled many of the stories through the 1970s, working first with [[Herb Trimpe]], then in 1975, with [[Sal Buscema]], who was the regular artist for 10 ten years. [[Harlan Ellison]] plotted a story, scripted by [[Roy Thomas]], for issue #140 (Jun 1971), "The Brute that Shouted Love at the Heart of the Atom".

===1980s and 1990s===
Following [[Roger Stern]], [[Bill Mantlo]] took over the writing with issue #245 (Mar 1980). During his run, he established that Banner had suffered [[child abuse]], an idea explored in the Crossroads of Eternity stories, which ran from issue #300 (Oct. 1984) to #313 (Nov. 1985). Mantlo showed the readers that abuse fostered a great deal of repressed anger within Banner, in turn causing his fragmented personality. Shortly after, Mantlo and artist [[Mike Mignola]] left the title for [[Alpha Flight]]<ref>{{cite web

[[Greg Pak]], a later writer on ''The Incredible Hulk'' volume 2, called Mantlo's Crossroads stories one of his biggest influences on approaching the character.<ref>{{cite web

David became the writer of the series with issue #331 (May 1987), marking the start of a 12-year tenure. David's run altered Banner's pre-Hulk characterization and the nature of Banner and the Hulk's relationship. David returned to the Stern and Mantlo abuse storylines, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering [[dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity disorder (DID)]]. David's stories showed that Banner had serious mental problems long before he became the Hulk. David revamped his personality significantly, giving the grey Hulk the alias 'Joe Fixit', and setting him up as a morally ambiguous Vegas enforcer and tough guy. David worked with numerous artists over his run on the series, including [[Dale Keown]], [[Gary Frank]], [[Terry Dodson]], [[Mike Deodato, Jr.]], [[George Perez]], and [[Adam Kubert]]. <ref name=HulkTIG>page 86</ref>. 

In issue #377 (Jan 1991), David revamped the Hulk again, using a storyline involving hypnosis to have the splintered personalities of Banner and Hulk synthesize into a new Hulk who has the vast power of the Savage Hulk, the cunning of the gray Hulk, and the intelligence of Bruce Banner.
 
In the 1993 ''Future Imperfect'' [[miniseries]], writer David and penciler [[George Perez]] introduced readers to the Hulk of a [[dystopia]]n future. Calling himself the Maestro, the Hulk rules over a world where most of the heroes have been killed, and only Rick Jones and a small band of rebels fight against The Maestro’s rule. Although The Maestro seemed to be destroyed by the end, he returned in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #460 (Jan 1998), also written by David.

Later in 1998, David followed editor Bobbie Chase's suggestion to kill Betty Ross. In the introduction to the Hulk trade paperback ''Beauty and the Behemoth'', David said that his wife had recently left him, providing inspiration for the storyline. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to push the idea of bringing back the Savage Hulk. David disagreed, leading to his and Marvel's parting ways. His last issue of ''Hulk'' was #467 (Aug 1998), his 137th.

Also in 1998, Marvel relaunched ''The Rampaging Hulk'', this time in as standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine.

===Relaunch===
When David left the Hulk, Marvel hired [[Joe Casey]] as a temporary writer. Shortly after, Marvel canceled ''The Incredible Hulk''. 

Marvel hired [[John Byrne]] for a second volume of the series, re-titled ''Hulk'', with [[Ron Garney]] penciling. Byrne departed before the first year was over, citing creative differences.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=190 | title=John Byrne: The Hidden Answers | author= Michael Thomas | year= August 22 2000 | Publisher=comic Book resources |  accessdate= 2007-11-05}}</ref> [[Erik Larsen]] and [[Jerry Ordway]] briefly filled scripting duties in his place, and the title soon returned to ''The Incredible Hulk'' with the arrival of [[Paul Jenkins]] in issue #12.

Jenkins wrote a story arc in which Banner and the three Hulks (Savage Hulk, Grey Hulk, and the Merged Hulk, now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor) are able to mentally interact with one another, each personality taking over their shared body. During this, the four personalities confront yet another submerged Hulk, a sadistic Hulk intent on attacking the world for revenge.<ref name="HV3:13">''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #13</ref> Jenkins also created [[John Ryker]] in issue #14, a ruthless military general in charge of the original gamma bomb test responsible for the Hulk's creation and planning to create similar creatures. Ryker’s actions briefly result in Banner becoming the sadistic Hulk, but the four other personas beat it back.

[[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] followed as the series' writer, and his run features Banner using [[yoga]] to take control of the Hulk while he is pursued by a secret conspiracy and aided by the mysterious Mr. Blue. Jones focused on a horror theme with the Hulk as a fugitive. He appended his 43-issue ''Incredible Hulk'' run with the ''Hulk/Thing: Hard Knocks'' [[limited series]], which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus.

Peter David, who had initially signed a contract for a six-issue ''Tempest Fugit'' [[limited series]], returned as writer when it was decided to make the story, now only five parts, part of the ongoing series instead.<ref>{{Cite web |  url= http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/2004_09.html | title= Slight change of plan with Hulk | year=September 30 2004 | publisher=peterdavid.net | accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> David contracted to complete a year on the title.

=== Planet Hulk and World War Hulk ===
{{mainarticle|World War Hulk}}
[[Image:Wwh.PNG|Promotional art for ''[[World War Hulk]]'' #1 by [[David Finch]].|thumb]]
In the 2006 storyline "Planet Hulk" by [[Greg Pak]], a secret group of superhero leaders, the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]], consider the Hulk an unacceptable potential risk to Earth, and rocket him into space to live a peaceful existence on a planet uninhabited by intelligent life. After a trajectory malfunction, the Hulk crashes on the violent planet Sakaar. Weakened by his journey, he is captured and eventually becomes a [[gladiator]] who scars the face of Sakaar's [[tyrant|tyrannical]] emperor. The Hulk becomes a rebel leader and later usurps Sakaar's throne through combat with the red king and his armies.

After Hulk's rise to emperor, the vessel used to send Hulk to Sakaar explodes, killing millions in Sakaar's capital, including his queen, Caiera. The damage to the [[tectonic plate]]s destroys the planet and kills most of its population.

The Hulk, enraged, returns to Earth with the remnants of Sakaar's citizens, and his allies, the Warbound, seeking retribution against the Illuminati. After laying siege to [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], the Hulk learns one of his allies was responsible for the explosion. He reverts to his Bruce Banner form and is taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.

==Characterization==
===Bruce Banner===
The core of the Hulk, Bruce Banner has been portrayed differently by different writers, but common themes persist. Banner is a [[genius]] but emotionally withdrawn in most fashions.<Ref name=HulkTIG>{{cite book

Throughout the Hulk's published history, writers have continued to frame Bruce Banner in these themes. Under different writers, his fractured personality led to transformations into different versions of the Hulk. These transformations are usually involuntary, and often writers have tied the transformation to emotional triggers, such as rage and fear. As the series has progressed, different writers have adapted the Hulk, changing Hulk's personality to reflect changes in Banner's physiology or psyche.
Writers have also refined and changed some aspects Banner's personality, showing him as emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. When Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning.

===The Hulk===
During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Bruce Banner rushes to save a teenager who has driven onto the testing field. Pushing the teen, Rick Jones, into a trench, Banner himself is caught in the blast, absorbing massive amounts of radiation. He awakens later in an infirmary, seeming relatively unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form that breaks through the wall and escapes. A soldier in the ensuing search party dubs the otherwise unidentified creature a "hulk".<ref name=Hulk1>{{Cite book | title =The Science of Superheroes | Publisher=Marvel Comics Group | date = May 1962}} Page=8</ref>

The original version of the Hulk was often shown as simple and quick to anger. His first transformations were triggered by sundown, and his return to Banner by dawn; later, emotions triggered the change. Although grey in his debut, difficulties for the printer led to a change in his color to green. In the origin tale, the Hulk divorces his identity from Banner’s, decrying Banner as "that puny weakling in the picture"<ref name=Hulk1/>. From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet<ref name="OyVey"/>, and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly. Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the "...dark, primordial side of [Banner's] psyche."<ref name=GreshWeinberg>{{cite book

The Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences, and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities the Hulk has, when the Hulk says, “But these muscles ain't just for show! All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin'!" In ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'', Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements may cost us." Daniels continues " The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age." <ref name=DanielsMarvel>{{cite book

''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #12 (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]], as well as a new way for Banner to transform into Hulk, by using a gamma ray machine of his own design to trigger the change.  Although many early Hulk stories involve [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often, like Hulk, a radiation based character, like the Toad men, or General Fang. Ross' daughter, [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty]], loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, [[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]], also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing the Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales.

Stan Lee and others have compared The Hulk in these early tales to the misunderstood creature Frankenstein's Monster.<Ref name="OyVey"/>, a concept Lee had wanted to explore. Lee also compared Hulk to the [[Golem]] of Jewish myth. <Ref name="OyVey"/> In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War <Ref name=GreshWeinberg/> and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in ''Up, Up, and Oy Vey''<ref name="OyVey"/>. Kaplan calls Hulk ‘schizophrenic’. <ref name=Kaplan/>

In the 1970’s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played with the nature of his transformations, briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form.

Hulk stories began to involve other dimensions, and in one, Hulk met the empress Jarella. Jarella used magic to bring Banner’s intelligence to Hulk, and came to love him, asking him to become her mate. Though Hulk returned to Earth before he could become her king, he would return to Jarella’s kingdom of K’ai again. 

Mantlo took the character into the arena of political commentary when Hulk traveled to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], encountering both the violence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the Jewish Israeli heroine [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]]. Soon after, Hulk encountered the [[Arabian Knight (comics)]], a [[Bedouin]] superhero. <ref name="OyVey">{{cite book

Under Bill Mantlo’s writing, the Hulk was separated from a human mind inside to constrain his actions by the extra-dimensional villain, [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]. Unable to help him, [[Doctor Strange]] exiled the mindless Hulk to an extra-dimensional place called the Crossroads of Eternity, from which place he could journey to other worlds, in hopes of finding a place to reside. During the stories at the Crossroads, Banner’s childhood traumas were explored and Hulk/Banner forced to come to terms with them, and in so doing, reconnect to the human mind within. To tell this story, Mantlo employed three new characters, reflecting aspects of Banner’s fractured psyche: Glow, a gleaming floating gem, represented Banner’s intellect, Guardian, a children’s toy made live, was Bruce’s protector, and Goblin was Bruce’s repressed rage.

Having come to terms with his issues, at least for a time, Hulk and Banner physically separated under John Bryne’s writing. Separated from the Hulk, Banner was recruited by the U.S. government to create the Hulkbusters, a government team dedicated to catching Hulk. Banner and Ross married, but this change in the character was reversed by Al Milgrom, who reunited the two, and with issue #324, returned the Hulk to his grey coloration after a second visit to K’ai and his one time love, Jarella.

Shortly after returning to Earth, Hulk took on the identity of ‘Joe Fixit’, a shadowy behind the scenes figure, working in Las Vegas on behalf of a crooked casino owner, Michael Berengetti.  For months, Banner was repressed in Hulk’s mind, but slowly began to reappear. Hulk and Banner began to change back and forth again at dusk and dawn, as the character initially had, but this time, they worked together to advance both their goals, using written notes as communication. In ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #333, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] describes the Grey Hulk persona as strongest during the night of the new moon and weakest during the full moon.

In issue #377, David revamped the Hulk again. Doctor Leonard Samson engages the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s services to hypnotize Bruce Banner and force him, the Savage Hulk (Green Hulk) and Mr. Fixit (Grey Hulk) to confront Banner's past abuse at the hands of his father, Brian Banner. During the session, the four identities confront a ‘Guilt Hulk’, which sadistically torments the four with the abuse of Banner’s father. Facing down this abuse, a new, larger and smarter Hulk emerges and completely replaces the "human" Bruce Banner and Hulk personae.  This Hulk is a culmination of the three aspects of Banner. He has the vast power of the Savage Hulk, the cunning of the grey Hulk and the intelligence of Bruce Banner.

Peter David then introduces the Hulk to [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|The Pantheon]], a secretive organization built around an extended family of super-powered people. The family members, mostly distant cousins to each other, had codenames based in the mythos of the [[Trojan War]], and were descendants of the founder of the group, [[Agamemnon]]. When Agamemnon leaves, he puts the Hulk in charge of the organization. The storyline ends when it is revealed Agamemnon has traded his offspring to an alien race to gain power. The Hulk leads the Pantheon against the aliens, and then moves on.

Shortly after, Hulk encounters a depraved version of himself from the future, called Maestro. Thrown into the future, Hulk finds himself allied with Rick Jones, now an old man, in an effort to destroy the tyrant Maestro.  Unable to stop him in any other manner, Hulk uses the time machine that brought him to the future to send the Maestro back into the heart of the very Gamma Bomb test that spawned the Hulk.

In 1998, David followed Editor Bobbie Chase's suggestion, and wrote a storyline centering on the death of Betty Ross. Betty has radiation poisoning, and desperate to save her, General Thunderbolt Ross worked with Banner, hoping to save her, but they fail, and Betty dies. Following this, David left Marvel, following a conflict about the direction of the series.

[[Greg Pak]] introduced the [[Planet Hulk]] story arc, which opened with a cabal of Earth’s superpowers, called [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]], sending Hulk into deep space to protect the Earth from his destructive rampages after his involvement in the destruction of the Godseye Satellite orbiting Earth.  Hulk’s rocket, intended for a desolate, empty planet, instead crashed onto Sakaar.  On Sakaar, Hulk rises from slave to king leading a rebellion, and finds love with a wife, Caiera.  Shortly after, the rocket that brought Hulk to Sakaar malfunctions and explodes, setting of the planet’s destruction.  Following the death of his wife, unborn child, and hundreds of millions of innocents, Hulk gathers some survivors and heads to Earth to exact revenge.  Though he managed to succeed in capturing them and causing a great deal of destruction, a series of events resulted in his capture by SHIELD after Tony Stark used a military satellite to bombard Hulk with unknown rays in an effort to stop him. 

In [[World War Hulk]], Hulk confronts the members of the Illuminati, meeting them in personal combat, but he is later defeated and captured.
