The '''Hulk''' is a fictional [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962). Throughout his comic book appearances, the Hulk is portrayed as a large green humanoid that possesses near limitless superhuman strength and great invulnerability, attributes that grow more potent the angrier he becomes. Hulk is the alter ego of '''Bruce Banner''', a socially withdrawn and emotionally reserved physicist who physically transforms into the Hulk under emotional stress and other specific circumstances at will or against it; these involuntary transformations lead to many complications in Banner's life. When transformed, the Hulk often acts as a disassociated personality separate from Banner. Over the decades of Hulk stories, the Hulk has been represented with several personalities based on Hulk and Banner's fractured psyche, ranging from mindless savage to brilliant warrior, and Banner has taken control of the Hulk's form on occasion. Banner first transforms into the Hulk after being caught in the blast of the [[gamma ray|gamma]] bomb he invented while saving [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], a youth who had wandered onto the testing range.

Lee said that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of ''[[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.<ref name="HulkTIG">{{Cite book| last=DeFalco | first=Tom | title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]| date=May 5, 2003 | location=London| page=200 | isbn=978-0-7894-9260-9}}</ref> Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most usual color is green. As a child, Banner's father [[Brian Banner]] often got mad and [[domestic violence|physically abused]] his mother [[Rebecca Banner|Rebecca]], creating the [[complex (psychology)|psychological complex]] of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. A common storyline is the pursuit of both Banner and the Hulk by the U.S. armed forces, because of all the destruction that he causes. He has two main [[catchphrase]]s:  "Hulk is strongest one there is!" and the better-known "HULK SMASH!", which has founded the basis for a number of [[pop culture]] [[meme]]s.

The character has been depicted in [[Hulk in other media|various other media]] including [[Hulk (comics) in other media#Television|television series]] and [[Hulk (comics) in other media#Film|major film]] adaptations. Other depictions have appeared in [[Hulk (comics) in other media#Novels|novels]], [[Hulk (comics) in other media#Video games|video games]] and many other types of merchandise. In 2011, the Hulk placed No. 9 on IGN's list of Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.

===Concept and creation===
The Hulk first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1962), written by writer-editor Stan Lee, [[penciller|penciled]] and co-plotted by Jack Kirby,<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 85|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Based on their collaboration on ''The Fantastic Four'', [Stan] Lee worked with Jack Kirby. Instead of a team that fought traditional Marvel monsters however, Lee decided that this time he wanted to feature a monster as the hero.}}</ref> and [[inker|inked]] by [[Paul Reinman]]. Lee cites influence from ''[[Frankenstein]]''<ref name="OyVey"/> and ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' in the Hulk's creation:
{{quote|It was patently apparent that [the monstrous character the] [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] was the most popular character in [Marvel's recently created superhero team the] [[Fantastic Four]].... For a long time I'd been aware of the fact that people were more likely to favor someone who was less than perfect.... It's a safe bet that you remember [[Quasimodo]], but how easily can you name any of the heroic, handsomer, more glamorous characters in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''? And then there's Frankenstein... I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the Frankenstein monster. No one could ever convince me that he was the bad guy.... He never wanted to hurt anyone; he merely groped his torturous way through a second life trying to defend himself, trying to come to terms with those who sought to destroy him. ... I decided I might as well borrow from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well — our protagonist would constantly change from his normal identity to his superhuman alter ego and back again.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Stan Lee | last=Lee | first = Stan | title = Origins of Marvel Comics| publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books]]| year =  1974 | page = 75 | isbn = 0-671-21863-8}}</ref>}}

Lee also compared Hulk to the [[Golem]] of Jewish myth.<ref name="OyVey"/> In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War<ref name=GreshWeinberg/> and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey]]''.<ref name="OyVey"/> This interpretation corresponds well when taken into account alongside other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.<ref name="Poole">Poole, W. Scott. ''Monsters in America: Our Historical Obsession with the Hideous and the Haunting.'' Waco, Texas: Baylor University Press, 2011.

In the debut, Lee chose gray for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group.<ref name="CBG">''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1617 (June 2006)</ref> Colorist [[Stan Goldberg]], however, had problems with the gray coloring, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green.<ref>''[[Starlog]]'' #213 (July 2003)</ref> Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #302 (December 1984) reintroduced the gray Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. Since then, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original gray coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk's skin had initially been grey. An exception is the early trade paperback, ''Origins of Marvel Comics'', from 1974, which explains the difficulties in keeping the gray color consistent in a Stan Lee written prologue, and reprints the origin story keeping the gray coloration.

Lee gave the Hulk's alter ego the alliterative name Bruce Banner because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names. Despite this, in later stories he misremembered the character's name and referred to him as "Bob Banner", an error which readers quickly picked up on.<ref>{{cite news | last = Boatz | first = Darrel L. | date = December 1988 | title = Stan Lee | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 64 | page = 15 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name of Robert Bruce Banner.

The Hulk's original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and [[Steve Ditko]] penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in ''[[Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four]]'' #12<!-- "The" part of cover logo through issue #15 --> (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], appearing in the first two issues of the team's eponymous series (Sept. and Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issue #3 and as an ally in #5 (Jan.–May 1964). He then guest-starred in ''Fantastic Four'' #25–26 (April–May 1964), which revealed Banner's full name as Robert Bruce Banner, and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964).<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Another important character entered Spider-Man's life in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14.

Around this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot.<ref name="OyVey"/> Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.

A year and a half after ''The Incredible Hulk'' was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', beginning in issue #60 (Oct. 1964).<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 102: "''Tales to Astonish'' #60...introduced a new series – The Incredible Hulk – starring the famous character."</ref>

This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by Lee, with pencils by [[Steve Ditko]] and inks by [[George Roussos]]. Other artists later in this run included [[Jack Kirby]] (#68–87, June 1965 – Oct. 1966); [[Gil Kane]] (credited as "Scott Edwards", #76, (Feb. 1966)); [[Bill Everett]] (#78–84, April–Oct. 1966); [[John Buscema]] (#85–87); and [[Marie Severin]]. The ''Tales to Astonish'' run introduced the super-villains the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]],<ref name="HulkTIG"/> who would become the Hulk's nemesis, and the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], another gamma-irradiated being.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> [[Marie Severin]] finished out the Hulk's run in ''Tales to Astonish''. Beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2,<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles...''Tales to Astonish'' #101 [was followed] by ''The Incredible Hulk'' #102."</ref> and ran until 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and launched ''Hulk'' #1.

[[Len Wein]] wrote the series from 1974 through 1978, working first with [[Herb Trimpe]], then, as of issue #194 (December 1975), with [[Sal Buscema]], who was the regular artist for ten years.<ref>{{cite book|last = Amash|first = Jim|title = Sal Buscema: Comics' Fast & Furious Artist|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2010|page = 17|isbn = 978-1605490212}}</ref> Issues #180–181 (Oct.–Nov. 1974) introduced the character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as an antagonist,<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 167: "Len Wein wrote and Herb Trimpe drew Wolverine's cameo appearance in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180 and his premiere in issue #181."</ref> who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics' most popular. In 1977, Marvel launched a second title, ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'', a black-and-white comics magazine.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> This was originally conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in ''Tales to Astonish''.<ref>Sanderson, "1970s", in Gilbert (2008), p. 178: "This black-and-white magazine starred the Hulk in adventures set in Europe shortly after his original six-issue series."</ref> After nine issues, the magazine was retitled ''The Hulk!'' and printed in color.<ref>Sanderson, "1970s", in Gilbert (2008), p. 186: "To appeal to the audience of the popular new ''Incredible Hulk'' TV series, Marvel revamped ''The Rampaging Hulk'' magazine, calling it ''The Hulk!''."</ref>

In 1977 two Hulk [[television film]]s were aired to strong ratings, leading to an [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|''Incredible Hulk'' TV series]] which aired from 1978 to 1982. A huge ratings success, the series introduced the popular Hulk [[catchphrase]], "Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry," and broadened the character's popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Glenn|first= Greenberg|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg |date= February 2014|title = The Televised Hulk|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|pages= 19–26|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref>

[[Bill Mantlo]] became the series' writer for five years beginning with issue #245 (March 1980). Mantlo's "Crossroads of Eternity" stories (#300–313, Oct. 1984 – Nov. 1985) explored the idea that Banner had suffered [[child abuse]]. Later Hulk writers [[Peter David]] and [[Greg Pak]] have called these stories an influence on their approaches to the character.<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | page = 22 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Taylor | first=Robert | title=Greg Goes Wild on Planet Pak | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=August 3, 2006 | url = http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm | accessdate=November 15, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070402044123/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm |archivedate = April 2, 2007}}</ref> Mantlo left the series for ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' and that series' writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took over ''The Incredible Hulk''.<ref>{{cite web| last=Serwin | first=Andy | title=The Wizard Retrospective: Mike Mignola | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=July 23, 2007 | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm | accessdate=November 13, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080120105210/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm |archivedate = January 20, 2008}}</ref> The final issue of Byrne's six issue run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and [[Betty Ross]].<ref name="DeFalcos">DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 227: "Dr. Bruce Banner first met Betty Ross in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962) and finally married her in issue #319 by John Byrne."</ref> Writer Peter David began a twelve-year run with issue #331 (May 1987). He returned to the [[Roger Stern]] and Mantlo abuse storylines, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering [[dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity disorder (DID)]].<ref name="HulkTIG"/>

In 1998, David killed off Banner's long-time love Betty Ross. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to pursue the return of the Savage Hulk.

Jones appended his 43-issue ''Incredible Hulk'' run with the [[limited series]] ''Hulk/Thing: Hard Knocks'' #1–4 (Nov. 2004 – Feb. 2005), which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus.

Writer [[Greg Pak]] took over the series in 2006, leading the Hulk through several crossover storylines including "[[Planet Hulk]]" and "[[World War Hulk]]", which left the Hulk temporarily incapacitated and replaced as the series' title character by the demigod [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)]] in the retitled ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' (Feb. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist [[Bruce Banner]] rushes to save teenager [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] who has driven onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is himself hit with the blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later in an infirmary, seeming relatively unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form that breaks through the wall and escapes. A soldier in the ensuing search party dubs the otherwise unidentified creature a "hulk".<ref name="Hulk1">{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|inker= [[Paul Reinman|Reinman, Paul]]|story= The Hulk|title= The Incredible Hulk|issue= 1|date= May 1962|page = 8}}</ref> The original incarnation of Banner transformed into the Hulk at sunset and reverted at sunrise. Banner was cured in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #4, but chose to restore Hulk's powers with Banner's intelligence. The gamma-ray machine needed to affect the transformation-induced side effects that made Banner temporarily sick and weak when returned to his normal state.

In ''The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #1 (September 1963), the Hulk became a founding member of the title's eponymous superhero team. However, by ''The Avengers'' #3, overuse of the gamma ray machine rendered the Hulk as an uncontrollable, rampaging monster, subject to spontaneous changing. In ''Tales to Astonish'' #59 (September 1964) the Hulk appeared as an antagonist for [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]]. The series established stress as the trigger for Banner turning into the Hulk and vice versa.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= The Incredible Hulk|title= [[Tales to Astonish]]|issue= 60|date= October 1964}}</ref> It was during this time that the Hulk developed a more savage and childlike personality, shifting from the brutish figure who spoke in complete sentences and his memory, both long-term and short-term, was markedly impaired in his Hulk state. In ''Tales to Astonish'' #77 (March 1966), Banner's and the Hulk's dual identity became publicly known when Glenn Talbot, Banner's romantic rival for [[Betty Ross]], witnessed his transformation, turning Banner into a wanted fugitive.

The 1970s saw Banner and Betty nearly marry in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #124 (Feb. 1970).<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 144: "Bruce [Banner] and Betty Ross decided to get married, Banner having erased his brute side and gained control over the changes.

In 2000, Banner and the three Hulks (Savage Hulk, Grey Hulk, and the "Merged Hulk", now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor) become able to mentally interact with one another, each personality taking over the shared body as Banner began to weaken due to him suffering from [[ALS|Lou Gherig's disease]]. During this, the four personalities (including Banner) confronted yet another submerged personality, a sadistic "Devil" intent on attacking the world and attempting to break out of Banner's fracturing psyche, but the Devil was eventually locked away again when the Leader was able to devise a cure for the disease using genes taken from the corpse of [[Brian Banner]].<ref name="HV3:13" /> In 2005, it is revealed that the supernatural character [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] has manipulated the Hulk for years, and it is implied that some or all of the Hulk's adventures written by Bruce Jones may have been just illusion.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Lee Weeks|Weeks, Lee]]|inker= [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Palmer, Tom]]|story= Tempest Fugit Conclusion|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 3|issue= 81|date= July 2005}}</ref> In 2006, the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth and send him away by rocket ship which crashes on Planet Sakaar ushering in the ''[[Planet Hulk]]'' storyline that saw Hulk find allies in the [[Warbound]], and marry alien queen [[Caiera]], a relationship that was later revealed to have born him two sons: [[Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]].

In the wake of the conclusion of World War Hate as seen in the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, when a mistake made by the [[Scarlet Witch]] caused various heroes and villains to experience a moral inversion, Bruce Banner attended a meeting between Nick Fury Jr. and Maria Hill of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers who refused to turn over Red Skull. Later when he sided with Edwin Jarvis and tried to prevent his teammates from executing Red Skull, the Hulk was thrown aside by Luke Cage. Hulk's sorrow at his friends' betrayal awakened a new persona known as the bloodthirsty Kluh—described as the Hulk's Hulk, being the ruthless part of himself that even the Hulk repressed—with this new version easily defeating the Avengers, sneering that the Hulk they knew was nothing more than a "sad piece of 'Doc Green's' ID."

==Personality==

===Bruce Banner===
During his decades of publication, Banner has been portrayed differently, but common themes persist. Banner, a [[physicist]], is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in ''Incredible Hulk'' #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes.<ref name="OyVey">{{Cite book| last=Weinstein | first=Simcha | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey! | publisher=Leviathan Press | date=June 19, 2006 | location=Baltimore, Maryland| pages=82–97 | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}</ref> Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: "Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he can’t form meaningful bonds with anyone."<ref name="Kaplan"/> As a child, Banner's father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the [[complex (psychology)|psychological complex]] of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character.

His fractured personality led to transformations into different versions of the Hulk. These transformations are usually involuntary, and often writers have tied the transformation to emotional triggers, such as rage and fear. Writers have adapted the Hulk, changing Hulk's personality to reflect changes in Banner's physiology or psyche. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason|penciller= Palo, Jefte|inker= Palo, Jefte|story= Hulk: United Part 1|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 4|issue= 13|date= November 2012}}</ref>

==Supporting characters==
{{Main|List of Hulk supporting characters}}
Over the long publication history of the Hulk's adventures, many recurring characters have featured prominently, including his best friend and sidekick [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], love interest and wife [[Betty Ross]] and her father, the often adversarial [[Thunderbolt Ross|General "Thunderbolt" Ross]]. Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas. Banner is son to Brian, an abusive father who killed Banner's mother while she tried to protect her son from his father's delusional attacks, and cousin to Jennifer Walters, the [[She-Hulk]], who serves as his frequent ally.<ref name="DeFalco197">DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 197: "Stan Lee decided to introduce a female version of the Hulk...With the help of artist John Buscema, Lee created Jennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner."</ref> Banner had a stillborn child with Betty, while the Hulk has two sons with his deceased second wife [[Caiera]] Oldstrong, [[Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]], and his DNA was used to create a daughter named [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] with [[Thundra]] the warrior woman.<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Pepose |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Hulks-Dark-Son-100611.html |title=Dark Son Rising As The Other Son Of Hulk Hits Earth |publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=June 11, 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208023445/http://www.newsarama.com/5432-dark-son-rising-as-the-other-son-of-hulk-hits-earth.html|archivedate= December 7, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref>

''The Fantastic Four'' #12<!-- "The" part of cover logo through issue #15 --> (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. Although many early Hulk stories involve [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often a radiation-based character, like the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]] or the Leader, along with other foes such as the [[Toad Men]], or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross' daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, [[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]], also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales. The Hulk's archenemies are the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. The Abomination is more monstrous and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure. The Leader is a super-genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the world.

==Other characters named Hulk==
Prior to the debut of the Hulk in May 1962, Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name "Hulk", but had no direct relation.
* Debuting in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #75 (June 1960), was a huge robot built by Albert Poole called the Hulk, which was actually armor that Poole would wear. In modern day reprints the character's name was changed to ''Grutan''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/poolealbertst.htm|title= The Hulk (Albert Poole)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= September 11, 2010 |publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20121120171213/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/poolealbertst.htm|archivedate= January 23, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= February 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of the Hulk}}
In addition to his [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation, Hulk has also been depicted in other [[fictional universes]], in which Bruce Banner's transformation, behavior, or circumstances vary from the mainstream setting. In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.

==Cultural impact==
{{see also|Hulk in other media}}
The Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of [[Cultural icon|iconic]] status by many within and outside the comic book industry. In 2003, ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' claimed the character had "stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-23626618_ITM | title=Smash! | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WXAG9bFn | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref> In 2008, ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine named the Hulk as the seventh-greatest Marvel Comics character.<ref>''Wizard'' (June 2008)</ref> ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine named him as the 14th-greatest comic-book character and the fifth-greatest Marvel character.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=14 | title=The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters | work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=December 5, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014074050/http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=14|archivedate= October 14, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

===Analysis===
The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war. As well as being a reaction to the [[Cold War]], the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the [[Vietnam War]] raised, and Ang Lee said that the [[Iraq War]] influenced his direction.<ref name=GreshWeinberg/><ref>{{Cite journal| title=Becoming the Hulk | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | date=June 30, 2003 | last=Lahr | first=John | page=72 | url = http://archives.newyorker.com/?iid=15295&startpage=page0000080|deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=The Clash of Symbols | newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]] | location=Glasgow | date=December 23, 2007 | last=Phelan | first=Stephen | page=42}}</ref> In the [[Michael Nyman]] edited edition of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]]. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic ''[[Heroes (Marvel comic)|Heroes]]'', claiming that his greater prominence, alongside [[Captain America]], aided in "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Diekmann | first=Stefanie | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/guesteditors/story/0,14481,1201733,00.html | title=Hero and superhero | date=April 24, 2004 | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WX1zzKKs | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref> In ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'', [[Les Daniels]] addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity, there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements in science may cost us." Daniels continues, "The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the [[Atomic Age|atomic age]]."<ref name=DanielsMarvel>{{Cite book|last=Daniels|first=Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title= Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics |publisher= [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

In ''Comic Book Nation'', Bradford Wright alludes to Hulk's counterculture status, referring to a 1965 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine poll amongst college students which "revealed that student radicals ranked [[Spider-Man]] and the Hulk alongside the likes of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Che Guevara]] as their favorite revolutionary icons." Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of these are "The Ballad of the Hulk" by [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover for September 30, 1971, a full color [[Herb Trimpe]] piece commissioned for the magazine.<ref name="Nation"/><ref>{{cite web| last=Goldberg | first=Jonah | url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMyYTQ4NTc5ZTU1Y2U0ZDc4ZjhmZmIwMmRhZjNjNDg= | title=Spin City | date=May 7, 2002 | work=National Review Online | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WX9jU6iE | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref> The Hulk has been caricatured in such [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',<ref name=IAmFuriousYellow>{{Cite episode |series= [[The Simpsons]]|title=[[I Am Furious Yellow]] |airdate= April 28, 2002|season=13|number= 18|credits = [[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]] (writer); [[Chuck Sheetz|Sheetz, Chuck]] (director)|network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]}}</ref> ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and ''[[Family Guy]]'',<ref>{{Cite episode | title= [[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]|series= [[Family Guy]]|credits= [[Danny Smith (writer)|Smith, Danny]] (writer); [[Dominic Polcino|Polcino, Dominic]] (director)|network= Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate= April 18, 1999|season= 1|number=3}}</ref> and such [[comedy]] [[television program|TV series]] as ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]|credits= [[Ben Elton|Elton, Ben]], [[Rik Mayall|Mayall, Rik]], and [[Lise Mayer|Mayer, Lise]] (writers); Posner, Geoff (director)|title= [[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones episode)|Summer Holiday]]|seriesno= 2|number= 6| airdate= June 19, 1984}}</ref> The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation. For example, in a 2008 ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' review of an ''[[EastEnders]]'' episode, a character is described as going "into Incredible Hulk mode, smashing up his flat."<ref>{{Cite news| title=We love telly: We love soaps | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | location=London | date=February 5, 2008 | last=Quigley | first=Maeve | page=1}}</ref> The Hulk, especially his alter-ego Bruce Banner, is also a common reference in rap music. The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'',<ref>"[http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/14877/= Some L.A. Niggaz]" from ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]''.

[[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Ludacris]]. 2002.</ref>

The 2003 [[Ang Lee]] directed ''Hulk'' film saw discussion of the character's appeal to [[Asian American]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Marchetti | first=Gina | url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/68 | title=Hollywood Taiwan | journal=Film International | volume=2 | issue=6 |date = November 2004| pages=42–51 | issn=1651-6826 | doi=10.1386/fiin.2.6.42 | accessdate=March 23, 2008 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5WXGSuwQb | archivedate=March 23, 2008}}</ref> The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the "subcurrent of repression" that underscored the character of The Hulk, and how that mirrored his own experience: "Growing up, my artistic leanings were always repressed—there was always pressure to do something 'useful,' like being a doctor." Jeff Yang, writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', extended this self-identification to Asian American culture, arguing that "the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans—especially those who have entered creative careers, often against their parents' wishes."<ref>{{cite web| last=Yang | first=Jeff | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/gate/archive/2006/06/01/apop.DTL | title=Look...

There have been explorations about the real world possibility of Hulk's gamma-radiation based origin. In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk’s powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of [[gamma radiation]] Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with [[adrenal gland]]s and [[green fluorescent protein|GFP]]. Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even convert energy into matter – a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. "Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known."<ref>{{cite web| last=Choi | first=Charles Q. | title=Gamma Rays: The Incredible, Hulking Reality | publisher=LiveScience | date=June 11, 2008 | url=http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080611-incredible-hulk.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140409043518/http://www.livescience.com/2590-gamma-rays-incredible-hulking-reality.html|archivedate= April 9, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref>
