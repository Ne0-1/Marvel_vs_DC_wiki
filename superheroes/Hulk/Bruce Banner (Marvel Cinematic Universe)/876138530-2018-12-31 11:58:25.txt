Dr. '''Bruce Banner''' is a [[character (arts)|character]] portrayed first by [[Edward Norton]] and currently by [[Mark Ruffalo]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character of the same name and known commonly by his [[alter ego]], '''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'''. In the films, Dr. Banner, is a renowned [[physicist]] who subjected himself to a [[gamma radiation]] experiment designed to replicate a [[World War II]]-era "super soldier" program. The experiment failed, and now causes Banner to transform into a green, hulking beast whenever his [[heart rate]] goes above 200 bpm or if he is placed in mortal danger. The Hulk is incredibly strong and acts largely on the instinct of self-preservation, attacking anything that he perceives as a threat. Banner has demonstrated an increasing ability to control the transformation, calling the Hulk at will, but is generally not able to recall events during the time he is in that form. The Hulk, conversely, has become increasingly aware of Banner and able to stall the transformation back - one time staying in Hulk form for two years, becoming able to speak with others and control his destructive rage. {{As of|2018}}, the character is one of the central figures of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having appeared in five films of the series, one uncredited [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', and will appear in the upcoming film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
The Hulk first appeared as a comic book character in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1962), written by [[Stan Lee]], [[penciller|penciled]] and co-plotted by [[Jack Kirby]],<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 85|isbn =978-0756641238}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|title=Hulk makes a monster out of gamma rays|publisher=BBC|first= Quentin|last= Cooper|date=May 11, 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161013022820/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|archivedate= October 13, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and [[inker|inked]] by [[Paul Reinman]].

In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which now included Hulk. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |deadurl=no  }}</ref> [[Louis Leterrier]], who had expressed interest in directing ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', was brought onboard to direct, with a screenplay by [[Zak Penn]] intended to serve as a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|loose sequel]] to the 2003 film, but keeping the story closer to the comics and the 1978 television series.<ref name="PennNorton" /> [[David Duchovny]] was a front-runner for the film,<ref name="StocksSoar" /> and Leterrier's original choice for the role was [[Mark Ruffalo]].<ref name="HuffPost" /> In April 2007, [[Edward Norton]] was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and establish its own identity as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], although he would go uncredited for his writing. Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name="NYCC2008Int" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who had played Banner in the 1978 TV series.<ref name="NortonBixby" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton "has a similar physique [and a] similar personality".<ref name="LouCameo" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name="SDCC2007Panel" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name="PennNorton" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling "there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be", as he felt the previous film "strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project.<ref name="NortonTotalFilm" /> During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered [[Lou Ferrigno]] the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name="DarkHorizonsEditBay" /> Originally, the Hulk's only line was "Betty" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added "leave me alone" and "Hulk smash!" The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended.<ref name="IGNDirectorSpeaks" />

[[Mark Ruffalo]] began his role as Banner / Hulk in ''The Avengers'', after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.<ref name="NortonReplaced" /><ref name="DeadlineRuffalo" /> Norton has since asserted that it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he "wanted more diversity" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name="NortonTHR">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/edward-norton-talks-avengers-he-743265|title=Edward Norton Offers New Explanation for Not Playing Hulk in 'Avengers' Films|last=Gajewski|first=Ryan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 23, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Tdm9l7tl?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/edward-norton-talks-avengers-he-743265|archivedate=October 27, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> ''[[ScreenRant]]'' has noted that, in part due to the change in actors, "many forget that Incredible Hulk is even canon within the MCU".<ref name="ScreenRantHulkArc"/> In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to [[Collider (website)|Collider]] that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film.<ref name="April2012NoSequel" /> In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in ''The Avengers''.<ref name="SequelPossible" /> However, Universal retained the distribution rights for ''The Incredible Hulk'' as well as the [[right of first refusal]] to distribute future Hulk films.<ref name="HulkRights" /> In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the "[[Planet Hulk]]" and "[[World War Hulk]]" storylines, stated, "everything [in terms of stories from the comics] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it".<ref name="Sep2012Sequel" />

In June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be".<ref name="RuffaloSequelJune2014" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a "Planet Hulk" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, "After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see".<ref name="FeigeIGNJuly2014" />

In April 2015, Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name="RuffaloApril2015" /> and reiterated this in October 2015,<ref name="RuffaloUSAToday" /> and July 2017.<ref name="RuffaloJuly2017" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name="THRJulyl2015" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name="RuffaloYahooDec2015" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' , stating, "We've worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will â€“ when itâ€™s all added up â€“ will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie".<ref name="RuffaloYahooJan2016" />

===Characterization===
For ''The Incredible Hulk'', Louis Leterrier stated that Edward Norton's rewrite of the script "has given Bruce's story real gravitas", explaining that "just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]]".<ref name="April2008Empire" /> In taking up the character for ''The Avengers'', Mark Ruffalo said, "He's a guy struggling with two sides of himselfâ€”the dark and the lightâ€”and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities".<ref name="EW1" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, "He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!"<ref name="Kimmel" />

By ''Age of Ultron'', Ruffalo stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was "a bit more complex",<ref name="Ruffalo2" /> with a confrontation brewing between Banner and the Hulk: "There's a very cool thing happening: Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other."<ref name="Ruffalo3" /> While filming in [[London]], Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk's lines.<ref name="IGNHulkOct2014" /> Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, "What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. You want it vice versa... So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment."<ref name="WhedonDec2014" /> When the character next appears in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', two years have passed since ''Age of Ultron'', and Hulk has become a successful and popular gladiator on Sakaar,<ref name="EWMar2017Plot" /><ref name="RuffaloTR" /> having suppressed the Banner side in those years. He is forming the vocabulary "of a toddler",<ref name="EWSDCC2017" /> with the level of Hulk's speech being "a big conversation" between director Taika Waititi and Marvel since it was taking into account future appearances for the character:<ref name="WaititiHulk" /> ''Ragnarok'' begins an arc for the character that continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name="RuffaloHulkArc" /> Ruffalo felt Hulk had "a swagger" in the film, and was "much more of a character than the green rage machine" seen in the ''Avengers'' films.<ref name="EWMar2017Plot" />

The Hulk only appears briefly at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', with Bruce Banner spending the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and to "impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is".<ref name="ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018" /> Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that "Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass." Russo added that this was "really reflective of the journey from ''Ragnarok''... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control."<ref name="RussoHulkScared" /> The difference between Hulk and Banner is intended to be shown as "starting to blur a little bit". Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.<ref name="ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018" /> Despite the lack of further standalone films, "Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since ''The Avengers''", with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Infinity War'' highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest, expected to be resolved in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name="ScreenRantHulkArc"/>

===Appearance and special effects===
In filming ''The Incredible Hulk'', Leterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard for which he was aiming.<ref name="Keown" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's "thunder claps").<ref name="ProdNotes" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name="LATimesShade" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name="IGNRoth" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name="DVDBecomingHulk" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effect company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name="VancouverSun" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary "finesse [and] superhero quality".<ref name="SFXfinesse" />

[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name="Keown" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had "too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off". He explained, "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank."<ref name="Keown" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name="ProdNotes" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name="LATimesShade" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name="SFXfinesse" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name="SFXfinesse" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name="DVDBecomingHulk" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name="AICNEditingBay" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name="MTVEyes" /> 

''The Avengers'' was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, "I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''Avatar'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun".<ref name="NYMag" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name="CastRuffalo1" /> To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name="fxguide"/> [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, "We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue."<ref name="AWN"/>

For ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ILM had to add much more detail to the character's facial features, due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM "built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics."<ref name="FXGuidePart2" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name="ColliderSep2017Trivia" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stunt men would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name="FXGuidePart2" /> Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes.<ref name="WaititiColliderSep2017" />

With respect to Bruce Banner's regular appearance, his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that "in just about every appearance, he's wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>

He stated that on contrary Ruffalo's Hulk had "both dynamic action sequences and crowd pleasing moments of humor and dialogue". In order to achieve this, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] created a new motion capture and facial animation system. Hulk's face was generated from a life cast / scan of Ruffalo's face, which was then manipulated in the program ZBrush to become the Hulk, while making sure to retain Ruffalo's essence.<ref name="fxguide"/>

==Fictional character biography==
Bruce Banner is a renowned scientist with seven Ph.D.s and expertise in the field of gamma radiation. At Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment â€” part of a [[World War II]] era "super soldier" program that Ross hopes to recreate â€” fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures or kills the people inside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.

Five years later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed. The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).}} Banner works at a bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as "Mr. Blue", and to whom he is "Mr. Green". He is also learning [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team, led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.

Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blueâ€”cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]â€”has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its "limitless potential" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Banner is caught and Blonsky has Stern use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. A month later, in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]], Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner. Meanwhile, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him [[The Avengers (2012 film)|a team]] is being put together.

===The Avengers===
Several months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Nick Fury]] reactivates the "Avengers Initiative", and agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit Banner to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Loki is captured and placed in a cell on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]], but agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. When the Avengers regroup in New York City, Banner arrives to regroup with the team to battle a Chitauri invesion. Banner reveals he is always angry, and transforms into the Hulk, fights the Chitauri, beats Loki into submission, and saves Stark from crashing into the ground.

Some years later, the Avengers recover Loki's scepter, and Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. Ultron becomes sentient and recruits the Maximoffs, with [[Wanda Maximoff]] using haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor<!-- Please note the term "Hulkbuster" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}} The team then travels to a safehouse, where Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and persuades Romanoff and other team members to form a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. Banner finds here there, and she causes him to transform into the Hulk, in order to fight Ultron. After a final battle defeating Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]]. The Quinjet is pulled into a wormhole and lands on [[Sakaar]], where Hulk perpetually remains in that form, and competes in the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]] run by the planet's ruler, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].

===Ragnarok and Infinity War===
Two years later, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] crash-lands on Sakaar and is forced to fight Hulk in the Contest of Champions. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard, and then escapes the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of [[Natasha Romanoff]] makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia. Banner expresses fear that if he becomes the Hulk again, he will never be able to return to his human form. Escaping Sakaar, they travel to Asgard, where Banner becomes Hulk again to save the fleeing Asgardians from the giant wolf, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]], while Thor challenges his sister, Hela. As Asgard is destroyed, the Hulk, remaining in that form, accompanies Thor and the Asgardians on a ship bound for Earth. [[Thanos]] and his minions intercept the ship to extract the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Space Stone]] from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. Hulk fights Thanos, but is easily overpowered. [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] uses the [[BifrÃ¶st]] to send Hulk to Earth, and Hulk crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] of [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]] and his majordomo [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] in New York City, and reverts to Bruce Banner. Banner warns Strange about Thanos, and contacts the other Avengers. When minions of Thanos appear in New York to attack Doctor Strange in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but Hulk refuses to "come out", forcing Banner out of the action.

Banner travels to Wakanda, where he uses Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor|Hulkbuster]] armor to battle the invading army of Thanos, until Thanos himself arrives to retrieve the final Infinity Stone, battling the Avengers and trapping Banner, in Stark's armor, in rock. Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, as his plan comes to fruition: people begin disintegrating, while Banner remains on the Wakandan battlefield.

==Differences from the comic books==
Due to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk, the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books. In particular, the ''[[Planet Hulk]]'' storyline from the comic books is highly condensed and worked into ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''; the comic book storyline has the heroes of Earth intentionally sending the Hulk into space due to his excessively dangerous nature,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #88-91 (Dec 2005-Mar 2006)</ref> while the MCU Hulk leaves Earth of his own accord.

Another difference is Banner's involvement in the creation of [[Ultron]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as a counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym.<ref name="Rant-Browne">{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 |df= }}</ref>

==Reception==
Reviewing ''The Incredible Hulk'', Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way â€“ except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks".<ref name="RahnerReview" /> Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that "the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict".<ref name="LemireReview" />

Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in ''The Avengers'' was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano."<ref name="nydaily2012" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlightsâ€”alongside Downey.<ref name="newyorker2012" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself."<ref name="villagevoice" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a "scruffy warmth and humor" vibe,<ref name="rollz" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name="LATimes2" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses)".<ref name="EW-review" />
