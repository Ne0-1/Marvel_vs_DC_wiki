'''Ganthet''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe.  He first appeared in the 1992 [[graphic novel]] ''Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale'' (ISBN 1-56389-026-7), by [[Larry Niven]] and [[John Byrne]].

== Background ==
Ganthet is one of the [[Guardians of the Universe]]. However, where most of the Guardians are very stern 'by-the-book' characters, Ganthet has a personality that is more human-like, including displays of empathy and concern for an individual, instead of only thinking of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. In various DC crossover [[limited series]], Ganthet is shown as being part of the Quintessence, a group of near-omnipotent beings who oversee the results of what happens on Earth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Although he has been portrayed as looking like the other Guardians, Ganthet is often distinguished by tying his hair into a long ponytail, as the other male Guardians have shorter, unkempt hair.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Ganthet's Tale===<!-- This section is linked from [[Larry Niven]] -->
The graphic novel ''Ganthet's Tale'' by [[Larry Niven]] tells the story of [[Hal Jordan]]'s first encounters with Ganthet. Jordan is asked to help Ganthet battle a renegade Guardian, Dawlakispokpok (or Dawly, for short) who is trying to use a [[Time travel|time machine]] to change history. In the early era of the planet [[Oa]], a scientist named [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] attempted to use a time-machine to see the beginning of time. In using his time-machine, Krona somehow 'bled' the universe of a billion years of life. Dawly is going to use his own time machine to thrust Krona to the end of time, preventing him from following through on his plan. In battling Dawly, however, it turns out that Dawly is responsible for the mishap that caused the universe to be 'born old'. When Dawly's family is brought before the Guardians, Ganthet shields Jordan's mind, allowing him to retain his memory of one of the biggest secrets of the Guardians.

=== Emerald Twilight ===
{{Main|Emerald Twilight}}
After the destruction of [[Coast City]] (in the "[[Reign of the Supermen]]" storyline){{gl(vol.3) issue 46}}, the subsequent insanity of Hal Jordan, and the destruction of the Main Power Battery, the Guardians decide to focus all of their remaining power into Ganthet. As such, he becomes the last Guardian. Ganthet creates a new Green Lantern ring from Jordan's ring (which was crushed by the former Green Lantern after murdering [[Sinestro]]) and goes to Earth. He appears before [[Kyle Rayner]], hastily hands him the ring, muttering "You shall have to do".{{gl(vol.3) issue 50}}

It is later revealed{{gl secret files and origins issue 1-1998 }} that Ganthet first went to [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] but Gardner turned him down. During Rayner's first few months as [[Green Lantern]], Ganthet is less than satisfied with Rayner and attempts to take back the ring. Rayner eventually earns the respect of Ganthet by facing [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] without his ring.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

=== The Quintessence ===
Ganthet became part of the circle of cosmic beings, including (usually) [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], [[Zeus]], [[Highfather]], and [[Phantom Stranger]], committed to observing the universe and counseling one another.<ref>I don't know when Ganthet beccame a part of The Quintessence, but in ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)]]'' storyline, he was shown as one of the group observing the chaos on Earth.</ref>

=== Ion and the new Guardians ===
When Rayner briefly becomes the godlike [[Ion (comics)|Ion]], he possessed more power than Hal Jordan did as Parallax{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. Realizing that he can not continue as Ion without losing his humanity, Kyle travels to the recently restored Oa to recharge the Central Power Battery. By doing so, he creates a new set of Guardians, this time as small children (both male and female), with the intent that Ganthet will look after them and teach them as a father figure how to be better Guardians than their predecessors{{Issue|date=October 2009}}. After one of the children, [[Lianna (comics)|Lianna]], went missing and later revealed to have aged prematurely, Ganthet invited the [[Zamaron]]s to Oa to help raise them with him.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

=== The Wars of Light ===
Ganthet played a crucial role of resurrecting Hal Jordan, who was revealed to be possessed by the fear entity Parallax during ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]].'' Following the return of Hal Jordan, all the Guardians are aged to adulthood and are just as cold and manipulative as before.  The only change is that there are now female Guardians as well as male. Ganthet, of course still retains a sense of individuality amongst the Guardians, believing that they should retain their emotions, along with another Guardian, [[Sayd]], is the only one who shares his mindset.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

During the ''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'' he and Sayd are banished from the council for embracing emotions, along to have discovered that they have romantic feelings to each other.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #23 (September 2007)</ref>

Just as Parallax (freed from any hosts) attacks the Lanterns for freeing Kyle Rayner, Ganthet and Sayd, arrive and draw Parallax into four separate lanterns (Hal, Kyle, John, and Guy's, respectively). As Ganthet explains, he and Sayd were kicked out of the Guardians of the Universe. Ganthet's final act as Guardian is offering Kyle his power ring. He asks if Kyle is willing to downgrade himself to a normal Green Lantern, which Kyle quickly accepts. The four men then take their lanterns and hearing the Sinestro Corps oath, recite the Classic Green Lantern Oath, and depart to confront Sinestro's Corps.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #24 (October 2007)</ref>  

Ganthet and Sayd also explain to the four about the emotional energy spectrum created at the start of the universe that is separated into seven colors: green ([[Will (philosophy)|willpower]]), yellow ([[fear]]), violet ([[love]]), red ([[Rage (emotion)|rage]]), indigo ([[compassion]]), orange ([[greed]]), and blue ([[hope]]), each representing different forms of emotion, with green being the most center balanced of the energies. The further at one end an energy color is, the more wild its power is to control, leading to the energy corrupting its user. Ganthet also reveals that in the coming future, each color will have its own forces like the Lantern Corps, and these forces will fight against the others in a battle across the universe that will lead into the event known as "The Blackest Night", the worst of the hidden prophecies of the Book of Oa.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #25 (December 2007)</ref>

At the end of the ''Sinestro Corps War'', Ganthet and Sayd are currently living on the planet Odym, where they harness the blue energy of hope and make plans to create another intergalactic police force in order to aid the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps of their upcoming battle against "The Blackest Night" by creating blue power rings and batteries. The first of the Blue Lanterns is an alien named Saint Bro'Dee Walker or Saint Walker. The second is Warth, an elephant like alien from Sector Two. According to Saint Walker, Warth will select another candidate from a different sector of space and the process will continue from there.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #36 (February 2008)</ref>  Later, Ganthet reveals to the Blue Lantern Corps that he and Sayd are planning to create an alliance to those who wield the indigo power of compassion along with Oa.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #39 (March 2009)</ref> However, Ganthet, Sayd, and the Blue Lanterns find themselves being attacked by [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Agent Orange]] as the villain seeks the powers they possess.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #42 (June 2009)</ref> They were eventually rescued by Hal Jordan, accompanied with Sinestro, [[Carol Ferris]], and Indigo Tribe member [[Indigo Tribe#Prominent members|Indigo-1]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #47 (October 2009)</ref>

Ganthet and Sayd then seek Atroticus and Larfleeze's aid to recreate the "white light of creation"  with their saviors.   In order to get Larfleeze to cooperate with them, Sayd offers her servitude to the Agent Orange, who expresses desire of having his own Guardian. Ganthet protests of Sayd's decision.  Ganthet and Sayd later arrive at Coast City with the Lanterns to aid Earth's heroes and trying  to free the Guardians from the Black Central Battery.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #48 (January 2010)</ref><ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (January 2010)</ref>
