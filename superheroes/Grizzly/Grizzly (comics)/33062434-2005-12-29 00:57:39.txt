Grizzly was one of the members of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s mercenary group originally named the [[Wild Pack]]. Because of conflicts with [[Silver Sable]]'s group of the same name, they changed their name to the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] instead.  
He was killed in ''Cable'' #24 by his fellow mercenary [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], who was forced to kill him while she was under [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]]' mental control.

==Grizzly II==
Another version of Grizzly is seen in the ex-wrestler Maxwell Markham who happens to be one of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemies.

He was a professional wrestler who competed in the nom de guerre of the Grizzly. His violent actions brought the attention to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] who article got Maxwell expelled from wrestling. Ten years later, he met with the [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]] who gave him a grizzly bear suit and an exo-skeleton harness that not only amplifies his strength, but also makes a great girdle. He uses this to become Grizzly and take revenge on Jameson until Spider-Man defeated him. 

After his release, he takes his grizzly suit and exo-skeleton harness to the [[Tinkerer]] for them to be fixed so that Grizzly can take revenge on Spider-Man. Spider-Man faked defeat allowing Grizzly to think he defeated him.

He later joins up with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II to become the Legion of Losers. Planning only to get back at Spider-Man, Grizzly and Gibbon were shocked to see Kangaroo II and Spot robbing a bank. They do capture Spider-Man, but release him since he's an all-right guy. They team up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo II and Spot. Grizzly and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and help Spider-Man (disguised as the Bombastic Bag-Man) again to stop the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s bank robbery.

==Appearances in Other Media==
Grizzly I appeared as the first boss character in [[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]], claiming to work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] because he allowed him to go crazy and kill people.
