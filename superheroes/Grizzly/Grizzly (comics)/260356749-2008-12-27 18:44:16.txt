The '''Grizzly''' ('''Maxwell Markham''') is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is an ex-wrestler named '''Maxwell Markham''', who happens to be one of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemies.  He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #139 (December 1974) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Ross Andru]].

===Fictional character biography===
Markham is a professional wrestler who competed using the [[psuedonym#nom de guerre|nom de guerre]] of the Grizzly. His violent actions brought him to the attention of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] whose article got Maxwell expelled from wrestling. Ten years later, he met with the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] who gave him a grizzly bear suit and an exoskeleton harness that amplified his strength and durability. He used this harness to attack the [[Daily Bugle]] in an attempt on revenge against Jameson for ruining his wrestling career, but Spider-Man defeated him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #139</ref> The Grizzly then attempted to defeat Spider-Man alongside the Jackal, but was defeated again by Spider-Man and went to jail.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #140</ref>

After his release, Markham took his grizzly suit and exoskeleton harness to the [[Tinkerer]] for them to be fixed and upgraded.  The Grizzly demanded a rematch with Spider-Man so that he could take revenge on Spider-Man and save face among his peers. Spider-Man faked defeat, allowing Grizzly to think he defeated him.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #58</ref>

He later joined up with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Kangaroo (comics)#Brian Hibbs|Kangaroo]] to become the ''Legion of Losers''. Planning only to get back at Spider-Man, Grizzly and Gibbon were shocked to see Kangaroo and Spot robbing a bank. They did capture Spider-Man, but released him , claiming that "He's an all-right guy". Grizzly and Gibbon teamed up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo and Spot. Grizzly and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and help Spider-Man (disguised as the Bombastic Bag-Man) again to stop the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s bank robbery.

At one point, out on probation, he tries to turn his life around. His desire to keep wearing the suit, several accidents and the interference of his criminal friends make his life that much more miserable.

He was brought in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] at one point or another, and his interrogation yielded key information that would drive the events of the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''.

Later he is receiving legal services from the law offices that employ She-Hulk<ref>in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' #6, May 2006</ref>. He had been accused of a robbery at Madison Square Garden but his defense was to be that he had been seen fighting [[Power Pack]] in New Jersey at the same time. 

Grizzly meets [[Starfox (comic character)|Starfox]], moments later. Not understanding that Walter's employers have taken on villains for a client, he believes his old Avengers comrade is being menaced by supervillains. Grizzly is punched out by Starfox.

For a time, Maxwell works as an enforcer for the criminal [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. With a new costunme and fangs, he teams with a stylized [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]. At one point, he claims to have a child, that he used his kid's college fund to pay for super-human fangs. <ref>Underworld Limited series (2006)</ref>

Maxwell is a self-confessed loser at the wake of [[Stilt-Man]]<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' #4</ref>. Almost all of the supervillains at the wake were the victims of murder/attempted murder: the [[Punisher]] disguised himself as a barman, poisons the drinks, and then blew up the bar. Due to prompt medical attention, there were no actual fatalities.

[[Alyosha Kravinoff|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #13</ref>, including [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#Bushmaster (Quincy McIver)|Bushmaster]], [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)#Buford Lange|Leap-Frog]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. In the end, the Punisher managed to sabotage this zoo; though Kraven himself escaped to the [[Savage Land]].

[[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]]'s fear of bears is well known. So The Grizzly was the natural choice for a villian, when Colbert teamed up with Spider-Man<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #573</ref> as part of a storyline, where Stephen Colbert is [[Stephen Colbert presidential campaign, 2008|a major candidate for the presidency]] in the fictional Marvel Universe.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Markham wears an exoskeleton which grants him superhuman strength, designed by Professor [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]], and later modified by the [[Tinkerer]].  The Grizzly suit also has razor sharp claws.  As a former professional wrestler, he is adept in hand-to-hand combat.
