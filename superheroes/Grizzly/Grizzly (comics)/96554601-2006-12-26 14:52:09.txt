The Grizzly is an ex-wrestler named '''Maxwell Markham''', who happens to be one of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemies.

He was a professional wrestler who competed in the nom de guerre of the Grizzly. His violent actions brought him to the attention of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] whose article got Maxwell expelled from wrestling. Ten years later, he met with the [[Jackal (Marvel comics)|Jackal]] who gave him a grizzly bear suit and an exo-skeleton harness that not only amplified his strength, but also made a great girdle. He used this harness to take revenge on Jameson until Spider-Man defeated him. 

After his release, he took his grizzly suit and exo-skeleton harness to the [[Tinkerer]] for them to be fixed so that Grizzly could take revenge on Spider-Man. Spider-Man faked defeat, allowing Grizzly to think he defeated him.

He later joined up with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II to become the ''Legion of Losers''. Planning only to get back at Spider-Man, Grizzly and Gibbon were shocked to see Kangaroo II and Spot robbing a bank. They did capture Spider-Man, but released him , claiming that "He's an all-right guy". Grizzly and Gibbon teamed up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo II and Spot. Grizzly and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and help Spider-Man (disguised as the Bombastic Bag-Man) again to stop the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s bank robbery. He was brought in by SHIELD at one point or another, and his interrogation yielded key information that would drive the events of the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]].

''Grizzly'' II was a character in [[X-Force]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. He's an old friend of Cable, but was brainwashed by Cable's son [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] to become an enemy.

Grizzly was one of the members of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s mercenary group originally named the [[Wild Pack]]. Because of conflicts with [[Silver Sable]]'s group of the same name, they changed their name to the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] instead. During a mission for the arms dealer [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]], the Six Pack fell apart. (''Cable: Blood and Metal limited series'')

Years later, [[G. W. Bridge]], another Six Pack-member asked Grizzly to join [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]], a group created to capture Cable. Weapon P.R.I.M.E. failed and Grizzly left the team, teaming up with [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. Domino joined [[X-Force]], Cable's group shortly afterwards and Grizzly went home to lead a quiet life. (''X-Force #8, 12-14, 20-24, Cable vol 2 #4'')

Some time later, he became a [[serial killer]] while under mind control from [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]], Cable's son. Domino investigated the deaths and fought with Grizzly. She was forced to kill him, but promised the dying Grizzly not to tell Cable about his son's actions. (''Cable volume 2 #23-24'')

==Age of Apocalypse==
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Grizzly was a bestial mass murderer and one of Domino's minions. They worked for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Grizzly was killed by the Age of Apocalypse's [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and [[Siryn (comics)|Sonique]] after killing their friend [[Toad (comics)|Toad]].

==Appearances in other media==
Grizzly II appeared as the first boss character in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]],'' claiming to work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] because he allowed him to go crazy and kill people. He was voiced by [[Keith Ferguson]].
