As the Grizzly made off with a loot of money he robbed from the bank, he ran afoul of [[Two-Gun Kid]] and the [[Rawhide Kid]]. After his rifle ran out, he ran off with his steel-lined suit protecting him from their bullets.

When Rawhide Kid was suspected of robbing a train, Two-Gun Kid advised him to turn himself over. Ace Fenton himself began stirring up the people of Tombstone to turn against the Rawhide Kid claiming that he trained the Grizzly to rob a train.

On the day of the trial, Grizzly broke into the courtroom and abducted Rawhide Kid to make it look like they are partners in crime. He tried to kill Rawhide Kid, but this failed and his mask was removed. Rawhide Kid wasn't able to get a glimpse of the Grizzly's face when he ran off. Rawhide Kid and Two-Gun Kid found his empty costume and headed to a saloon that the Grizzly had made on mistake. When Ace Fenton revealed himself as the Grizzly, he and Rawhide Kid got into a gunfight. Rawhide Kid defeated Ace Fenton and handed him over to the authorities.

A.I.M. had sent Grizzly and Agent R-2 to capture an atomic scientist named Paul Fosgrave at Manning University. Posing as students, they persuaded Mart Baker to help them by using the Hypno-Ray to turn protests into hostile activities as a cover to capture Paul Fosgrave.

Mart Baker demanded that his committee be placed in control of the university and the student body divided against each other resulting in a massive fight. [[Captain America]] showed up at the scene and [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]] instructed Grizzly and Agent R-2 to capture Paul Fosgrave immediately. As they brought Paul Fosgrave to the roof where their portable copter was waiting, Captain America pursued them with the help of Mart Baker (who learned that he was duped by them). Grizzly tried to escape on the copter with Paul Fosgrave, but Captain America shot the copter down with Grizzly's gun. Fosgrave was brought to safety, Agent R-2 was defeated, and Mart Baker and his followers were granted amnesty by the University. Grizzly's fate after the copter crashed is unrevealed.

The '''Grizzly''' ('''Maxwell Markham''') is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is an ex-wrestler named '''Maxwell Markham''', who happens to be one of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemies. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #139 (December 1974) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Ross Andru]].

Markham is a professional wrestler who competed using the [[psuedonym#nom de guerre|nom de guerre]] of the Grizzly. His violent actions brought him to the attention of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] whose article got Maxwell expelled from wrestling. Ten years later, he met with the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] who gave him a grizzly bear suit and an exoskeleton harness that amplified his strength and durability. He used this harness to attack the [[Daily Bugle]] in an attempt on revenge against Jameson for ruining his wrestling career, but Spider-Man defeated him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #139</ref> The Grizzly then attempted to defeat Spider-Man alongside the Jackal, but was defeated again by Spider-Man and went to jail.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #140</ref>

After his release, Markham took his grizzly suit and exoskeleton harness to the [[Terrible Tinkerer|Tinkerer]] for them to be fixed and upgraded.  The Grizzly demanded a rematch with Spider-Man so that he could take revenge on Spider-Man and save face among his peers. Spider-Man faked defeat, allowing Grizzly to think he defeated him.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #58</ref>

He later joined up with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II to become the ''Legion of Losers''. Planning only to get back at Spider-Man, Grizzly and Gibbon were shocked to see Kangaroo and Spot robbing a bank. They did capture Spider-Man, but released him , claiming that "He's an all-right guy". Grizzly and Gibbon teamed up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo and Spot. Grizzly and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and help Spider-Man (disguised as the Bombastic Bag-Man) again to stop the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s bank robbery.

At one point, out on probation, he tries to turn his life around. His desire to keep wearing the suit, several accidents and the interference of his criminal friends make his life that much more miserable.

He was brought in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] at one point or another, and his interrogation yielded key information that would drive the events of the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''.

Later he is receiving legal services from the law offices that employ She-Hulk.<ref>in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' #6, May 2006</ref> He had been accused of a robbery at Madison Square Garden but his defense was to be that he had been seen fighting [[Power Pack]] in New Jersey at the same time. 

Grizzly meets [[Starfox (comic character)|Starfox]], moments later. Not understanding that Walter's employers have taken on villains for a client, he believes his old Avengers comrade is being menaced by supervillains. Grizzly is punched out by Starfox.

For a time, Maxwell works as an enforcer for the criminal [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. With a new costume and fangs, he teams with a stylized [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]. At one point, he claims to have a child, that he used his kid's college fund to pay for super-human fangs.<ref>Underworld Limited series (2006)</ref>

Maxwell is a self-confessed loser at the wake of [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' #4</ref> Almost all of the supervillains at the wake were the victims of murder/attempted murder: the [[Punisher]] disguised himself as a barman, poisons the drinks, and then blew up the bar. Due to prompt medical attention, there were no actual fatalities.

[[Alyosha Kravinoff|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #13</ref> including [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#Bushmaster (Quincy McIver)|Bushmaster]], [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)#Buford Lange|Leap-Frog]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. In the end, the Punisher managed to sabotage this zoo; though Kraven himself escaped to the [[Savage Land]].

[[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]]'s fear of bears is well known. So The Grizzly was the natural choice for a villain, when Colbert teamed up with Spider-Man<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573</ref> as part of a storyline, where Stephen Colbert is [[Stephen Colbert presidential campaign, 2008|a major candidate for the presidency]] in the fictional Marvel Universe.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573</ref> The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] later sent Grizzly to take out the Punisher. However, Grizzly walked into a trap, with nothing but explosives waiting for him, which the Punisher's assistant then detonated.<ref>''Punisher'' #4</ref> Grizzly somehow survived the explosion, and was one of the criminals who later confronted the Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' #5</ref>

[[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] then appoints Grizzy to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], sending him on a mission to aid them against the [[Agents of Atlas]].<ref>''Thunderbotls'' #139</ref>
