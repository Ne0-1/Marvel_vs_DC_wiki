The '''Grizzly''' ('''Maxwell Markham''') is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is an ex-wrestler named '''Maxwell Markham''', who happens to be one of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemies.  He first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #139 (December 1974) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Ross Andru]].

===Fictional character biography===

Markham is a professional wrestler who competed in the [[psuedonym#nom de guerre|nom de guerre]] of the Grizzly. His violent actions brought him to the attention of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] whose article got Maxwell expelled from wrestling. Ten years later, he met with the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] who gave him a grizzly bear suit and an exoskeleton harness that not only amplified his strength, but also made a great girdle. He used this harness to take revenge on Jameson until Spider-Man defeated him. 

After his release, he took his grizzly suit and exoskeleton harness to the [[Tinkerer]] for them to be fixed so that Grizzly could take revenge on Spider-Man. Spider-Man faked defeat, allowing Grizzly to think he defeated him.

He later joined up with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Kangaroo (comics)#Brian Hibbs|Kangaroo]] to become the ''Legion of Losers''. Planning only to get back at Spider-Man, Grizzly and Gibbon were shocked to see Kangaroo and Spot robbing a bank. They did capture Spider-Man, but released him , claiming that "He's an all-right guy". Grizzly and Gibbon teamed up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo and Spot. Grizzly and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and help Spider-Man (disguised as the Bombastic Bag-Man) again to stop the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s bank robbery.

At one point, out on probation, he tries to turn his life around. His desire to keep wearing the suit, several accidents and the interference of his criminal friends make his life that much more miserable.

He was brought in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] at one point or another, and his interrogation yielded key information that would drive the events of the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''.

====She-Hulk====

Later he is receiving legal services from the law offices that employ She-Hulk<ref>in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' #6, May 2006</ref>. He had been accused of a robbery at Madison Square Garden but his defense was to be that he had been seen fighting [[Power Pack]] in New Jersey at the same time. 

Grizzly meets [[Starfox (comic character)|Starfox]], moments later. Not understanding that Walter's employers have taken on villains for a client, he believes his old Avengers comrade is being menaced by supervillains. Grizzly is punched out by Starfox.

====Civil War====
Maxwell is a self-confessed loser at the wake of [[Stilt-Man]]<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' #4</ref>. Almost all of the supervillains at the wake were the victims of murder/attempted murder: the [[Punisher]] disguised himself as a barman, poisons the drinks, and then blew up the bar. Due to prompt medical attention, there were no actual fatalities.

===Powers and abilities===
Markham has an exoskeleton which grants him superhuman strength.  He also has razor sharp claws.  As an ex-wrestler, he is adept in hand-to-hand combat.

'''Grizzly''' ('''Theodore Winchester''') is a fictional character from the Marvel Comics Universe who is a  mutant and an old friend of Cable, but was brainwashed by Cable's son [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] to become an enemy.  He first appeared in ''X-Force'' #8 and was created by [[Rob Liefeld]].

===Fictional character biography===
Grizzly was one of the members of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s mercenary group originally named the Wild Pack. Because of conflicts with [[Silver Sable]]'s group of the same name, they changed their name to the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] instead. During a mission for the arms dealer [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]], the Six Pack fell apart<ref>''Cable: Blood and Metal limited series''</ref>

Years later, [[G. W. Bridge]], another Six Pack-member, asked Grizzly to join [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]], a group created to capture Cable. Weapon P.R.I.M.E. failed and Grizzly left the team, then teamed up with [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. Domino joined [[X-Force]], Cable's group, shortly afterwards and Grizzly went home to lead a quiet life<ref>''X-Force #8, 12-14, 20-24, Cable vol. 2 #4''</ref>

Some time later, he became a [[serial killer]] while under mind control from [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]], Cable's son. Domino investigated the deaths and fought with Grizzly. She was forced to kill him, but promised the dying Grizzly not to tell Cable about his son's actions<ref>''Cable volume 2 #23-24''</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Winchester is a mutant who was born with superhuman strength, resilience, stamina and reflexes.  His appearance is a furry red hide and he has razor sharp claws.

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Grizzly was a bestial mass murderer and one of Domino's minions. They worked for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. They attacked [[Forge (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Forge]]'s resistance group, the Outcasts. 

Grizzly was killed by Forge and [[Siryn|Sonique]] after killing their friend [[Toad (comics)|Toad]].

====Ultimate Grizzly====
Ultimate Grizzly was introduced in the second part of the "[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]" story arc, that can be found in [[Ultimate X-Men]] #76. This version, though he possesses the exact same powers, seems to resemble a taciturn Native American with long, dark hair when in human form and more literally resembles a grizzly bear after transforming for battle. His present day counterpart appears in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #81 as a student at the school.

===In other media===
