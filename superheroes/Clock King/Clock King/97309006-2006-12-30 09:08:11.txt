'''Clock King''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He was originally an enemy of [[Green Arrow]], but has become more identified by his appearances in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and [[Suicide Squad]]. He has no super-powers, but uses [[clock]]-themed gadgetry. He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it.

==Character biography==
Born '''William Tockman''', Clock King took dutiful care of his [[invalid]] sister, when one day he found out from a doctor's visit that he himself only had six months to live. Despairing for his sister's future, he watched the timing of a local bank's vault in order to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and was then caught by the Green Arrow.

While he was incarcerated, his sister died without him. In further hideous irony, Tockman discovered that he really wasn't ill and was not going to die in the next six months: his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escaped to futilely attempt revenge on the Green Arrow.

The Clock King later went on to join [[Major Disaster]]'s [[Injustice League]], which became [[Justice League Antarctica]] and was later assimilated into the [[Suicide Squad]]. The Clock King was seemingly killed on their Squad's first mission, alongside [[Big Sir]] . (Suicide Squad Vol.2 #1)

==Powers and Abilities==
The Clock King has no metahuman powers or abilities, although he is athletic and extraordinarily punctual.  He also has no special weapons, using only his clock gimmick and elaborate costume to stand out.
<!-- I'm commenting out below because I feel it has some use, but as it stands is NPOVish
Willian Tockman is one of the most criticized [[supervillains]] in [[DC Comics]] {{citation needed}}. This is, in part, because the character has one of the most elaborated costumes of the [[DC Universe]], and an ovious gimmick, but no particular metahuman powers or abilities. His official Pre-''Crisis'' bio, from [[Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who]], described him as ''"An average athlete... He has no special weapons or powers"'', and he doesn't use even conventional fire weapons. This makes the danger he represent reasonably questionable.

For ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' the Clock King was recreated as '''Temple Fugate''', the name being a play on the Latin phrase 'tempus fugit,' meaning 'time flies.' The character first appeared in the episode "[[The Clock King (Batman: The Animated Series)|The Clock King]]" and was voiced by [[Alan Rachins]]. Fugate was written as a stiff, [[anal-retentive]] efficiency expert, obsessed with punctuality, who adopts a clock-based motif and embarks on a campaign of revenge against the mayor of [[Gotham City]], Hamilton Hill, based on a seven year old incident; during the incident, Fugate was appealing a lawsuit against his company, and was prompted to take his coffee break on the day of the appeal later than usual by Hill (then a lawyer whose firm was representing the prosecution in the lawsuit), which - in combination with a series of incidents that happened during the break - caused him to miss the court date and, thus, the appeal. As Hill's firm was representing the prosecution in the case, Fugate accused him of sabotaging the appeal and, thus, intentionally ruining his life. He kidnaps Hill and sets him up to be crushed to death by the giant clock hands of the Gotham Clock Tower at the exact time that Hill suggested that he take his coffee break. Batman interferes and after a hard fought battle within a clock tower, the building collapses and Fugate's status becomes unknown. The character returns in the episode "[[Time Out of Joint (Batman: The Animated Series)|Time Out of Joint]]" (the name of a sculpture built by the TV series character), in which he once again plots to gain revenge against the Mayor. This time he steals a time-altering device which enables him to slow time down. His plot his foiled by Batman and Robin. The Clock King also makes an appearance in a 2004 ''[[Batman Adventures]]'' comic.

In the Batman Adventures comic, he got his revenge on Hill by rigging the mayoral election so that it seemed that Oswald C. Cobblepot ([[The Penguin]]) had won the election. A reformed Riddler began to suspect that the Penguin had rigged the election, and collaborated with Batman to find the truth. Riddler later appeared in Bludhaven at the door of the former Mayor, comatose due to massive blood loss, but alive, and managed to leave a clue that implicated Fugate in the electoral fraud. When it was revealed that Fugate had rigged the election, the
Penguin was forced to resign from office. 
  
In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode ''[[Task Force X (Justice League Unlimited)|Task Force X]]'' where he served as a planner and tactician in the "[[Suicide Squad]]" who guided the team with strict clockwork efficiency. Rachins reprised the role. The character's last appearance to date was a cameo in the last episode of that same season.
