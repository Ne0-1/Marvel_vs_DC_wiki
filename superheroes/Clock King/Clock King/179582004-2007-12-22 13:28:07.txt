'''Clock King''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He was originally an enemy of [[Green Arrow]], but has become more identified by his appearances in  ''[[Justice League International]]'' and ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', and subsequent adaptations in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. He has no super-powers or abilities other than an absolute sense of time and timing.  Clock King is a master planner and sometimes uses [[clock]]-themed gadgetry. He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it.

==Fictional character biography==
Born '''William Tockman''', Clock King took dutiful care of his [[invalid]] sister, when one day he found out from a doctor's visit that he himself only had six months to live. Despairing for his sister's future, he watched the timing of a local bank's vault in order to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and was then caught by the Green Arrow.

While he was incarcerated, his sister died without him. In further hideous irony, Tockman discovered that he really wasn't ill and was not going to die in the next six months: his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escapes; later to futilely attempt revenge on the Green Arrow.

The Clock King later went on to join [[Major Disaster]]'s [[Injustice League]], which became [[Justice League Antarctica]]. This JLA would include G'Nort, who ends up saving the lives of the entire team. Like his compatriots, Clock King became an ardent supporter of [[Maxwell Lord]], partly due to the fact he was the only one willing to hire them. His group even guards Lord when he was incapacitated due to a bullet wound. Originally, they are not trusted by the authorities but the [[Martian Manhunter]], spying, decides they are perfect bodyguards.

Later, Clock King would lead his own, separate team of villains in a mission. They consist of Radiant, Sharpe, [[Acidia]] and Crackle. They are not as well-organized as even the Injustice League. For example, Crackle still lives with his mother and they have to take the bus to their fight. It takes place at a Metropolist toy store. They end up fighting one of the many incarnations of the [[Teen Titans]] and the heroes [[Booster Gold]], Firehawk and [[Cameron Chase]]. An unclear super-effect from Chase ultimately neutralizes Clock's team and they are all imprisoned. Clock himself escapes on another bus.

===Death===

Later, Clock's friends are transformed into the new [[Suicide Squad]]. They were sent to a remote research facility where a genetic monstrosity was holding its creator hostage. Its main defense were spawned "children" that could explode. During the mission, most of the team were seemingly killed, including Clock King, who was shot repeatedly in a retreat attempt. He is seen still alive after his brutal wounds but in the end, [[Major Disaster]] believes he is the only one who survives.  It turns out [[Cluemaster]], shot in a similar manner as Clock King, survives, albeit with drastic scarring. (''Suicide Squad'' (2nd series) #1).

Since the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Clock King has not been seen. However, in an issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', one character decided to kill all the time-travelers, and mentioned someone "ending up like Time Commander and Clock Queen". Whether or not Clock Queen is connected to Clock King is unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
The Clock King has no metahuman powers or abilities, although he is athletic and extraordinarily punctual.  He also has no special weapons, using only his clock gimmick and elaborate costume to stand out.

However, his animated incarnation, see below, made more use of his time skills. For example, he knew exactly how much time it took Batman to throw a punch thus allowing him to dodge a punch every time. Later, he used his skills as an [[efficiency expert]] to coordinate a successful raid on the [[Justice League Watchtower]].

==Other media==
===Batman (1960s show)===
[[Image:B60s-Clocking.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Walter Slezak]] as the Clock King in the 1960s ''Batman'' show]]
The [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman TV series]] saw The Clock King portrayed by the late [[Walter Slezak]] in the Season two consecutive episodes, ''"The Clock King's Crazy Crimes"'' and ''"The Clock King Gets Crowned"'', aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] October 12 & 13, 1966.

The two parter was written by Batman creator [[Bill Finger]] and [[Charles Sinclair]] and directed by [[James Neilson]]. In the episode, disguised as a pop artist, Clock King tries to rob a gallery of a time-related surrealist painting. The ''"Dynamic Duo"'' are stuffed into the bottom of an oversize hourglass and left to be drowned in sand as Clock King plots to filch Bruce Wayne's collection of antique pocket watches. Later in the episode, he starts his masterplan, to steal the atomic powered [[Cesium clock]].  He wore a black cape and a top-hat with a clock inside it. He had many weapons, "Super slick watch oil", "Knock out gas", "Super sonic sound".

===Batman: The Animated Series===
In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' the Clock King was recreated as '''Temple Fugate''', the name being a play on the Latin phrase '[[tempus fugit]],' meaning 'time flies.' The character first appears in the episode "[[The Clock King (Batman: The Animated Series)|The Clock King]]" and later returns in the episode "[[Time Out of Joint (Batman: The Animated Series)|Time Out of Joint]]".

In ''The Clock King'', Temple Fugate is a mild mannered legal clerk who works in Gotham's District Court office. Fugate is an odd, lonely man obsessed with time and punctuality. His every waking moment is pre-planned, on a "to do" list broken down into nano-seconds. When urged by a pre-mayor Hamilton Hill to take a coffee break, Fugate initially refuses, as he does not want to ruin his schedule. After insistence by Hill, Fugate takes the coffee break. During the break, just when Fugate starts to relax, everything that could go wrong does, as Fugate loses documents and is late for his court appointment. In return for being late, the Judge throws the case out, but Fugate still loses millions in his company. Fugate swears revenge on Hamilton Hill and later finds out that Hill's firm was the plaintiff for the court date Fugate was late for. Fugate becomes the Clock King, using his keen knowledge of the element of time, he turns to a life of crime and revenge. His first attempt to kill Mayor Hill ends in a climatic battle with Batman inside the wheels of a clock tower, which Fugate accidentally jams with his clock-hand-like sword. The machinery collapses, and Fugate is presumed killed.

However, in ''Time Out of Joint'', Fugate returns unharmed, now armed with a device he uses to travel at faster-than-light speed (stolen from a scientist for whom he works as a butler by the name "Harold"). This time, Fugate plants a bomb at Mayor Hill's speech, planning to blow it up and kill dozens of innocent people. But Batman and Robin, having learned Fugate's secret from the scientist, use a similar device to slow down the bomb's explosion while throwing it into the river. Fugate, his plans foiled, tries to escape, but Robin catches him and destroys the device, rendering him unable to flee. He is then arrested and sent to Arkham.

This Clock King commonly dresses in a three-piece suit and bowler hat, with a pocketwatch and glasses resembling clock faces. Though lacking superpowers of his own, he proved to be a formidable opponent for Batman after having studied his every move from news footage. He was voiced by [[Alan Rachins]].

The Clock King also makes an appearance in a 2004 ''[[Batman Adventures]]'' comic. In the Batman Adventures comic, he got his revenge on Hill by rigging the mayoral election so that it seemed that Oswald C. Cobblepot ([[The Penguin]]) had won the election.

===Justice League Unlimited===
The Clock King (Fugate) also appeared in a ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode ''[[Task Force X#Depiction in other media|Task Force X]]'' where he served as a planner and tactician in the "[[Suicide Squad]]" who guided the team with strict clockwork efficiency. He was again voiced by [[Alan Rachins]]
