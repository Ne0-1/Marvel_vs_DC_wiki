The '''Clock King''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s, both of whom are [[supervillain]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The first, created by [[Bill Finger]], appeared in ''Star Spangled Comics'' #70 (July 1947) and fought [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].  The second Clock King was a villain and enemy of [[Green Arrow]], and debuted in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #111 (August 1960), and was created by [[France Herron]] and [[Lee Elias]].

==Publication history==
The character, originally called simply "the Clock", appeared in ''Star Spangled Comics'' #70 (July 1947).  He had no super-powers or abilities other than a rigid sense of order and timing. He wore a blue business suit, an orange fedora, glasses and a red tie with a picture of a clock.

The second Clock King was originally an enemy of [[Green Arrow]].  He also has no super-powers or abilities.  He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it.

Clock King is a master planner and sometimes uses [[clock]]-themed gadgetry. The Clock King eventually became a member of the [[Terror Titans]], but has become more identified by his appearances in ''[[Justice League International]]'' and ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', and subsequent adaptation in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.

==Fictional character biography==

===William Tockman===
Born '''William Tockman''', Clock King spends his early years taking care of his invalid sister. One day he finds out from a doctor's visit that he himself only has six months to live. Despairing for his sister's future, he watches the timing of a local bank's vault in order to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and been caught by the Green Arrow.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Clock King | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 84  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017  | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>

While he is incarcerated, his sister dies alone. In further hideous irony, Tockman discovers that he really is not [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]; his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escapes, later futilely attempting revenge on the Green Arrow.

With several other villains, the Clock King becomes a member of the [[Injustice League]], a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, when banding together, become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 1) #23 (January 1989)</ref> The Injustice League is defeated time and again by the [[Justice League International]], at least when they are not making laughingstocks of themselves. Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the equally laughable hero team [[Justice League Antarctica]]. This JLA includes G'Nort, who ends up saving the lives of the entire team.<ref>''Justice League America Annual'' #4 (October 1990)</ref> Like his compatriots, Clock King becomes an ardent supporter of [[Maxwell Lord]], partly due to the fact he is the only one willing to hire them. His group even guards Lord when he is incapacitated by a bullet wound.<ref>''Justice League America'' (vol. 1) #53 (August 1991)</ref> The villains again later reform as the Injustice League as henchmen of [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]].<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #49&ndash;50 (April&ndash;May 1993</ref>

Later, Clock King leads his own, separate team of villains in a mission. They consist of Radiant, Sharpe, Acidia and Crackle. They are not as well-organized as even the Injustice League. For example, Crackle still lives with his mother and they have to take the bus to their fight. It takes place at a [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] toy store. They end up fighting one of the many incarnations of the [[Teen Titans]], the heroes [[Booster Gold]] and [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]] and DEO agent [[Cameron Chase]]. An unclear super-effect from Chase ultimately neutralizes Clock's team and they are all imprisoned. Clock himself escapes on another bus.<ref>''Chase'' #4 (May 1998)</ref>

Still later, Clock's friends are transformed into the new [[Suicide Squad]]. They are sent to a remote research facility where a [[gene]]tic monstrosity is holding its creator hostage. Its main defenses are spawned "children" that could explode. During the mission, most of the team are seemingly killed, including Clock King, who is shot repeatedly in a retreat attempt. He is seen still alive after his brutal wounds but, in the end, [[Major Disaster]] believes he is the only one who survives. It turns out [[Cluemaster]], shot in a similar manner as Clock King, survives, albeit with drastic scarring. (''Suicide Squad'' (second series) #1).<ref name="dc-ency"/> [[Multi-Man]] also survives due to his ability to be reborn with new powers after dying.

Clock King is not seen for a period of time after ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In an issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', one character decides to kill all the time-travelers, and mentions someone "ending up like [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]] and Clock Queen."

===Terror Titans===
[[File:ClockKing2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover of 'Teen Titans' (vol. 3) #60. Art by Eddy Barrows.]]

A new Clock King appears in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #56 as the head of a team of villains named the [[Terror Titans]]. In an interview with ''Teen Titans'' writer Sean McKeever, he described this Clock King as "...Very smart. He sees things differently than others."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144154 |title=Sean Mckeever On The Terror Titans - Newsarama |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> Although his full name has not been confirmed, [[Disruptor (comics)|Disruptor]] did refer to him as "Tem" before being killed. His costume is similar to the suit worn by the Clock King seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', although with clock faces on the tie and lapel. After his group defeats and captures [[Kid Devil]],<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #56 (April 2008)</ref> Clock King conditions the hero<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #58 (June 2008)</ref> to be sold as a fighter to a group called "The Dark Side Club".<ref name=tt59>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #59 (July 2008)</ref> Clock King then brings the Titans to his base of operations, a dimension outside of time.<ref name=tt59 /> After besting Robin, Clock King is stymied by [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who possesses similar precognitive abilities.<ref name=tt60>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #60 (August 2008)</ref> He offers Ravager a chance to join him, but she refuses. Clock King then removes the Titans from his base and decides to move on to new plans. Ravager ultimately reconsiders his earlier offer.<ref name=tt59 /> In the ''Terror Titans'' miniseries, Clock King takes over The Dark Side Club, and uses it to brainwash young metahumans, turning them into his very own "Martyr Militia". He sends the Militia to attack the city Los Angeles, for no reason other than to amuse him.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #5 (April 2009)</ref> Clock King's plans are eventually undone by [[Miss Martian]], who was posing as one of the captured Metahumans, and Ravager, who attacks and defeats him, forcing him to flee his base of operations.<ref>''Terror Titans'' #6 (May 2009)</ref>

===New 52===
In the rebooted continuity of the [[The New 52]] (which takes place after the events of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]''), '''Billy Tockman''' is an African-American crime boss based in Seattle. Tockman owns a nightclub called the Midnight Lounge, and vintage clock repair shop called the Clock King, which he uses as a front for his operations.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #22 (September 2013)</ref> Another villain, wearing the original Clock King costume, battles the newest incarnation of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] amped up on [[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]],<ref>''Batman: The Dark Knight'' (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011)</ref> and is later seen battling Harley Quinn and Power Girl alongside [[Sportsmaster]]. <ref>''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #11 (December 2014)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
* The original Clock King has no [[metahuman]] powers or abilities, although he is athletic and extraordinarily smart. He extensively uses clock and time related gimmicks to devastating effect.

* The new Clock King has the always-active ability to see what is about to happen four seconds or so into the future, allowing him to anticipate an opponent's every move.<ref name=tt59 /> He is also a technological genius, creating devices such as teleporters, communications jamming equipment, and even an anti-gravity platform, all of them modelled after timepieces.

==Other versions==

==="Flashpoint"===
In the alternate timeline of the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" event, Clock King is imprisoned in [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|military Doom prison]]. During the prison break, Clock King joined [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Plastic Man]] to retrieve his weapons.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

===''Batman '66''===
In ''[[Batman (TV series)#Batman '66|Batman '66]]'' Issue 4, the Clock King of the [[Batman (TV series)|60's series]] appears as a secret collaborator to the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]'s latest scheme. At the end, it's revealed that he is Jervis Tetch's brother Morris Tetch who made much of the Mad Hatter's more advanced weapons.<ref>''Batman '66'' #4</ref>

===''The Batman Adventures''===
The Clock King also makes an appearance in a 2004 ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic. In this issue, he finally gets his revenge on Hill by rigging the mayoral election so that it seems that Oswald C. Cobblepot ([[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]]) has won.

===Television===

====Live action====
[[File:B60s-Clocking.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Walter Slezak]] as the Clock King in the 1960s ''Batman'' show.]]
* In the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' TV series]], the Clock King was portrayed by [[Walter Slezak]] in the season two consecutive episodes, '"The Clock King's Crazy Crimes" and "The Clock King Gets Crowned", which [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] transmitted on October 12 and October 13, 1966. The two-parter was written by ''Batman'' co-creator [[Bill Finger]] and [[Charles Sinclair (screenwriter)|Charles Sinclair]] and directed by [[James Neilson (director)|James Neilson]]. In the episode, the Clock King, disguised as a pop artist, tries to rob a gallery of a time-related [[surrealism|surrealist]] painting. Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are stuffed into the bottom of an oversized hourglass, stripped of their utility belts, and left to be drowned in sand as the Clock King plots to filch Bruce Wayne's collection of antique pocket watches, only for the duo to escape the trap later. Later in the episode, he starts his masterplan, to steal the atomic-powered [[Cesium clock]]. As the Clock King, Slezak wore a black cape and a top-hat with a clock inside it. He had many weapons such as "Super Slick Watch Oil", "Knock Out Gas", and "Super Sonic Sound".

* The William Tockman version of Clock King was featured in Season Two of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'',<ref>[http://tvline.com/2013/12/03/glee-season-5-dianna-agron-returning-quinn-returns/ Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on Arrow, HIMYM, Once, Good Wife, Hannibal, Scandal, Sleepy and More]</ref> portrayed by [[Robert Knepper]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=112409 |title=Robert Knepper Cast as Clock King on Arrow |date=11 December 2013 | website=[[ComingSoon.net]] |accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref> In the episode "Time of Death", the Clock King masterminds the theft of a hacking device that could be used to break into bank vaults and computer systems. It is revealed his motives are to raise money for medical treatment for his dying sister. He hacks into Felicity Smoak's computer system and disables it, causing her to physically get involved in the efforts to capture him. Aiming for the [[Black Canary|Canary]], Clock King ends up shooting Felicity after she pushes Canary out of the way. Felicity then defeats him by hacking into his cell phone and making it explode.<ref>[http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2014/02/arrow-season-2-timing-is-everything-in-time-of-death.html 'Arrow' Season 2: Timing is everything in 'Time of Death']</ref> Knepper reprised the role on ''Arrow'' spin-off, ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in the seventh episode of the first season,<ref name="ClockKing1">{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/08/07/flash-arrow-crossover-episode-spoilers-clock-king/|title=Arrow's [Spoiler] Crosses Over to Flash|last=Swift|first=Andy|publisher=[[TV Line]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> where he was being escorted through the Central City police station, having been transferred for unspecified reasons. He subsequently takes advantage of a city-wide blackout triggered by new villain [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Blackout|Blackout]] to take those in the police station hostage, including Barry's foster-father Joe West and his potential love interest [[Iris West Allen|Iris]], but Iris manages to turn the tables on him when she is able to grab Edward Thawne's gun from a hidden ankle holster before being taken as a hostage. She is shown shooting Tockman, who is wounded and once again arrested.

====Animation====
[[File:TempleFugate.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Temple Fugate/The Clock King as seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the Clock King is recreated as '''Temple Fugate''' (the name being a play on the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[tempus fugit]]'', meaning "time flies") who first appears in the episode "The Clock King" and later returns in the episode "Time Out of Joint" voiced by [[Alan Rachins]]. In both appearances, the Clock King commonly dresses in a [[three-piece suit]] and [[bowler hat]], with a [[pocket watch]] and glasses resembling clock faces. In his debut episode "The Clock King", Temple Fugate is a head of a [[time and motion study]] consulting company who has been fined $20 million in court,{{why|date=December 2014}} but is now appealing against it. Fugate is an odd, lonely man obsessed with time and punctuality; his every waking moment is pre-planned on a "to do" list broken down into precise blocks. Future Gotham mayor [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Hamilton Hill]] convinces Fugate to break his schedule and take his coffee break at a slightly later time.  However, due to a string of terrible luck, Fugate shows up late for his court appointment, loses his appeal and going [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] as a result. Fugate swears revenge on Hamilton Hill for making him late, and later finds out that Hill's firm represented the plaintiff for the case Fugate was late for (even though Hill himself had nothing to do with that case). Seven years later, Fugate becomes the Clock King, and dedicates his life to getting revenge on Hill. In "Time Out of Joint," Fugate is armed with a device which he can use to slow down or speed up time at his discretion, but is ultimately defeated by Batman and Robin and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]].

* [[Alan Rachins]] reprised his role as The Clock King (Fugate) in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Task Force X."  He has been recruited by [[Project Cadmus]] as part of the [[Suicide Squad]] to coordinate the mission and its timing is largely down to the second, except for a few minutes Fugate allotted for contingencies in the field. The timing for the plan was so important that the members are ordered to go on without a teammate if they are even one second late.

* The original Clock King (William Tockman) first appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Rise of the Blue Beetle!" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0810/22/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Wednesday, October 22, 2008 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> with a German accent. Like his original version in the comics, he possesses many clock-themed weapons and gadgets, and wears a modified version of his original costume. To keep with the clock theme, he has two henchmen named Tick and Tock. The Clock King is defeated by Batman and [[Green Arrow]] after they escape his trap. He later appears in "Day of the Dark Knight!", trying to escape from [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]], but was thwarted by Batman and Green Arrow. A heroic version of Clock King appears in "Deep Cover for Batman!", but is taken down by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Injustice Syndicate]]. Clock King joins forces with [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] and an army of villains in "Game Over for Owlman!". He also briefly appears in "Mayhem of The Music Meister!", having teamed up with [[Black Manta]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]] to hijack a communications satellite before falling victim to the title villain's hypnotic powers. In "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!", Aquaman helps Green Arrow fight the Clock King. When they pursue him to a nearby store and Clock King threatens a woman, Aquaman contacts the lobsters in a nearby tank and has them attack Clock King.

===Video games===
* The Clock King is a boss in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold – The Videogame]]''<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://gametrailers.com/video/ds-gameplay-batman-the/702694 |title=Batman: The Brave And The Bold Video Game, DS Gameplay Featurette &#124; Video Clip &#124; Game Trailers & Videos |publisher=GameTrailers.com |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. In the [[Wii]] version, he is hired by [[Gentleman Ghost]] to lure Batman to London, England by capturing [[Hawkman]] and threatening to blow up [[Big Ben]]. In the [[Nintendo DS|DS]] version, he and [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine le Fey]] team up on [[Dinosaur Island]] but are defeated by Batman and the [[Red Tornado]].
