'''Clock King''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He is primarily an enemy of [[Green Arrow]]. He is a [[supervillain]] only in the broadest sense of the term, as he doesn't have super-powers or any exceptional physical abilities but uses a lot of [[clock]]-themed props and weapons for his crimes. He wears a blue suit with clock drawings with a cape and a clock mask on his head.

Clock King's real name is William Tockman and he used to dress up [[alarm clock]]s for a living, while taking care of his [[invalid]] sister. He later found out after a visit to the doctor that he only had six months to live; he  despaired at his sister's future, and so took to super-villainy to raise enough money to support her after his imminent death.

Little did Tockman know that he really wasn't ill and was not going to die in the next six months: his health exam papers were actually switched by accident with another patient.

The Clock King later went on to join [[Major Disaster]]'s [[Injustice League]], which became [[Justice League Antarctica]] and was later assimilated into the [[Suicide Squad]]. The Clock King was killed on their first mission, alongside [[Big Sir]] and the [[Cluemaster]].

==Other media==
The [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman TV series]] saw The Clock King portrayed by the late [[Walter Slezak]] in the Season-2 episode, "The Clock King's Crazy Crimes/The Clock King Gets Crowned" (#9711, aired on ABC October 12 & 13, 1966).

In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the Clock King is Temple Fugate, who first appeared in the episode "The Clock King" and was portrayed by [[Alan Rachins]]. Fugate was an efficiency expert, obsessed with punctuality, and appealing a $20 million judgment against his business. Hamilton Hill, a lawyer with the firm representing the other side, who took the same train to work as Fugate, suggested that Fugate deviate from his rigid schedule so as to appear more relaxed in court. Fugate took the advice, and had his coffee break at 3:15, instead of 3:00. However, as a result of this, and a string of accidents, Fugate missed his court appearance, lost his appeal, and was ruined.

Seven years later, he adopted a clock-based motif and embarked on a campaign of revenge against Hill, who had become mayor of [[Gotham City]] in the meantime. Fugate's revenge would have culminated in murdering Hill at 3:15, by crushing him between the hands of a giant clock, had [[Batman]] not interfered.

Fugate returned in the episode "Time Out of Joint," having acquired a device that allowed him to slow down or speed up time. He resumed his revenge against Mayor Hill, but was foiled by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], who had acquired similar devices.

In a [[2004]] ''[[Batman Adventures]]'' comic, Fugate rigged the election against Mayor Hill, and watched his "years of exile and humiliation" in [[Bl√ºdhaven]]. [[Nightwing]] and Batman apprehended him.

Temple Fugate was later seen in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Task Force X," where he served as a planner and tactician in the "[[Suicide Squad]]." Rachins reprised the role.

Temple Fugate's name is a play on the Latin phrase 'tempus fugit,' meaning 'time flies.' Interestingly, Fugate has never (at least in his animated appearances) referred to himself as the Clock King, a name coined by Batman.
