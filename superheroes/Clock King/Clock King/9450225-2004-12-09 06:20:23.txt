'''Clock King''' is an enemy of [[Green Arrow]]. He is a [[super-villain]] only in the strictest senses of the term, as he doesn't have super-powers but uses a lot of [[clock]]-themed props and weapons for his crimes. He wears a blue suit with clock drawings with a cape and a clock mask on his head.

Clock King's real name is William Tockman and he used to dress up [[alarm clock]]s for a living, while taking care of his [[invalid]] sister. He later found out after a visit to the doctor that he only had six months to live; he was despaired, as he worried about his sister's future, so he took a supervillain life to raise enough money for her after his incoming death.

Little did Tockman know that he really wasn't ill and was not going to die in the next six months: his health exam papers were actually switched by accident with another patient.

[[DC's Who's Who]] describes Clock King as ''"An average athlete... He has no special weapons or powers."''
