'''Shard''' ('''Shard Bishop''') is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the  [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  

==Fictional character biography==
Shard was a Lieutenant in [[Xavier's Security Enforcers]], (X.S.E.) with her older brother [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] in their native timeline in the 2080s.  Shard was born in a mutant concentraton camp, in which mutants were branded over their right eyes with the letter "M" for recognition.  In [[Uncanny X-Men]] Annual #17, Shard is stated as having the mutant ability of "transubbing ambient light into concussive force".

Shard became the youngest X.S.E. graduate a year after Bishop attained that position.  She served under Bishop as a member of the Omega Squad (which included Bishop and his officers, Randall and Malcolm), until her promotion.

Together, in the X.S.E. Shard and Bishop were responsible for apprehending criminal mutants.  Shard was partially infected on a mission with her brother fighting a group infected with a vampire-like affliction originating from the present day mutant, [[Emplate]].

Although Emplates are considered the "living dead", Bishop took her to the New York Stark/Fujikawa building inhabited by the [[Alternate_versions_of_Gambit#Bishop'future|Witness]] in order to attempt to save her life by transmitting her essence into a holographic matrix (a technology of [[Shi'ar]] origin, akin to that used in the X-Men's [[Danger Room]]).  The experiment was a success, but Shard, already partially infected with the Emplate affliction, died.  Due to the process involved, Bishop considered himself her murderer.

Bishop eventually travelled back in time, to the present, in an effort to track down one of his time's most-wanted criminals, where he became stuck in the present day and became a member of the [[X-Men]], his idols.  Shard has also since been recreated in the present, as a computer construct, and became a clandestine member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. There, she began a romantic relationship with her teammate [[Wildchild (comics)|Wildchild]]. 

After X-Factor disbanded in ''#149'', Shard was seen in an alternate future. There she died for the second and apparently final time, saving her brother Bishop (''Bishop: the Last X-Man #14'').
