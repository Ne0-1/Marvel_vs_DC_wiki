'''Shard (Shard Bishop)''' is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] character in the  [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  
===Fictional character biography===
Shard was an officer in [[Xavier's Security Enforcers]] (X.S.E.) with her brother [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] in their native timeline in the [[2080s]].  Together, they were responsible for apprehending criminal mutants.  Shard died on a mission with her brother fighting a group infected with a vampire-like affliction originating from the present day mutant, [[Emplate]].

Bishop eventually travelled back in time, to the present, in an effort to track down one of his time's most-wanted criminals, where he became stuck in the present day and became a member of the [[X-Men]], his idols.  Shard has also since been recreated in the present, as a computer construct, and became a clandestine member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. There, she began a romantic relationship with her teammate [[Wildchild (comics)|Wildchild]]. 

After X-Factor disbanded in ''#149'', Shard was seen in an alternate future. There she died for the second and apparently final time, saving her brother Bishop (''Bishop: the Last X-Man #14).
