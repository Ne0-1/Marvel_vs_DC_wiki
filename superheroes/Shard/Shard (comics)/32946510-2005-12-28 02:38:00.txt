'''Shard''' is a [[fictional character]] in the  [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Shard was an officer in [[Xavier's Security Enforcers]] (X.S.E.) with her brother [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] in their native timeline in the 2080s.  Together, they were responsible for apprehending criminal mutants.  Shard died on a mission with her brother.

Bishop eventually travelled back in time, to the present, in an effort to track down one of his time's most-wanted criminals, where he became stuck in the present day and became a member of the [[X-Men]], his idols.  Shard has also since been recreated in the present, as a computer construct, and became a clandestine member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor]] team. After X-Factor disbanded in ''#149'', Shard was seen in an alternate future. She died there, as a hero, saving her brother Bishop (''Bishop: the Last X-Man #14).
