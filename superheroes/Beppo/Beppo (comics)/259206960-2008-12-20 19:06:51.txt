'''Beppo''' is a fictional [[monkey]] in the [[DC Universe]].  Created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[George Papp]], he first appeared in ''[[Superboy]]'' #76 (October 1959). 

==Fictional character background==
Beppo, despite his resemblance to an Earth [[chimpanzee]], is from the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].  He was originally a test animal used by [[Jor-El]] during his spaceflight development project to see if his son could survive space travel, and stowed away on board the craft that ultimately saved Superman from Krypton's destruction.

Beppo turns up years after Superboy has been adopted by the Kents, and initially causes Superboy much trouble with his super-powered mischief. Eventually Superboy leads Beppo out into deep space and leaves him there so that he can't cause further trouble. Beppo later returns and encounters [[Supergirl]], who introduced him to [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] and [[Streaky the Supercat]]. He went on to join the [[Legion of Super-Pets]].

Although he has not made a canonical appearance since the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]],'' Beppo was one of the non-existent characters revived temporarily by [[Psycho-Pirate]] during the "Second Crisis."

==Other versions==
Beppo is one of the animals in Superman's artificial reality farm in ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' #1 (May 1996). He also appears in the out-of-continuity ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', alongside Streaky the Super-Cat, as Supergirl's pet.

== Appearances in other media ==
===Superman: The Animated Series===
Beppo is referenced in "[[Monkey Fun (Superman: The Animated Series)|Monkey Fun]]", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.  Beppo is the name of [[Lois Lane]]'s childhood toy, a stuffed monkey that played "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]."  The toy was also the favorite of [[Titano]], a test chimp used by the space program.  When Titano returns to Earth and grows to gargantuan proportions, he can only be calmed down by the sound of Beppo's song ([[Pop goes the weasel]]).

===Other shows===
On the ''[[Colbert Report]]'', Stephen names God's chimp Beppo, of whom all chimps are made in His likeness.

==Other Beppos==
In the animated online adventure ''[[Smallville (TV series)#Other media|Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom]]'' (a spinoff from the TV series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''), the [http://smallville.warnerbros.com/internal_sites/ezra/index.html Ezra Small House] on the official Smallville website, and other online media related to the show, a character named '''Christopher James Beppo''' is the researcher and caretaker of the Ezra Small Prophecies, a set of cryptic writings made by the founder of the town of [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] which foretell various events within the show and the eventual destiny of Superman.[http://www.ezrasmall.com/]
