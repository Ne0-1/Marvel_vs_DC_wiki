'''Beppo''' is a [[fictional]] [[monkey]] appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]], primarily those featuring [[Superman]]. Created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[George Papp]], he first appeared in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #76 (October 1959).

==Fictional character biography==
Despite his resemblance to an Earth monkey, due to [[convergent evolution]] producing analogous species to fill similar ecological niches, Beppo is from the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. He was originally one of [[Jor-El]]'s test animals. Luckily for him, Beppo decided to stow away aboard baby [[Superman|Kal-El]]'s rocket to Earth and was thus saved from its destruction. Upon landing, Beppo hopped out unseen and went off on his own for some months. Beppo lived in a jungle and handled himself quite well, since as a Kryptonian monkey he had the usual array of super-powers.

One day Beppo, using his telescopic vision, spotted Kal-El, now a toddler living in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] with the [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Kents]]. Beppo quickly flew to Smallville and, being a monkey, secretly caused all sorts of havoc. Ma and Pa Kent initially blamed baby Clark for Beppo's super-powered monkeyshines, but they soon discovered the truth. The Kents fretted that Clark's secret might be exposed by the super-antics of the Simian of Steel but, as it turned out, their worry was needless. It wasn't long before Beppo accidentally set off some [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] fireworks stored in the Kent garage. The explosions spooked Beppo, who took off into space. The panicked Beppo kept on going when he saw a passing comet, which he thought was more fireworks chasing him. When Beppo failed to return, the Kents presumed he'd gotten lost out there somewhere. Beppo's origin is related in "The Super-Monkey from Krypton!", the cover story in ''Superboy'' #76 (October 1959). At the end of the story, which is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] by teenaged Clark, the reader is informed that Beppo made his way back to Earth before too long.

Many years later, Beppo encountered [[Supergirl]], who introduced him to [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] and [[Streaky the Supercat]]. Beppo went on to join the [[Legion of Super-Pets]].

Beppo was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' limited series. He was briefly returned to existence by the [[Psycho-Pirate]] during the 2005-06 storyline "[[Infinite Crisis]]", and then in 2009 appeared in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #5.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Beppo possessed the same powers and abilities as a Kryptonian adult, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species.

==Other versions==
* Beppo is one of the animals in Superman's artificial reality farm in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #1 (May 1996). 
*He also appears in the out-of-continuity ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', alongside Streaky the Super-Cat, as Supergirl's pet.

==In other media==
* Beppo is referenced in "Monkey Fun", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Beppo is the name of [[Lois Lane]]'s childhood toy, a stuffed monkey that played "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]". The toy was also the favorite of [[Titano]], a test chimp used by the space program. When Titano returns to Earth and grows to gargantuan proportions, he can only be calmed down by the sound of Beppo's song ("Pop Goes the Weasel"). A Beppo toy appears in [[Batman Beyond]] episode "Rats".
* In an episode of the comedy TV series ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Colbert named God's chimp Beppo, of whom all chimps are made in His likeness.
* On the official ''Smallville'' website, in the animated online adventure ''[[Smallville#Promotional tie-ins|Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom]]'' (a spinoff from the ''[[Smallville]]'' television series), the Ezra Small House,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://smallville.warnerbros.com/internal_sites/ezra/index.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031005030841/http://smallville.warnerbros.com/internal_sites/ezra/index.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2003-10-05 | title=Ezra Small House }}</ref> and other online media related to the show, a character named "'''Christopher James Beppo'''" is the researcher and caretaker of the Ezra Small Prophecies, a set of cryptic writings made by the founder of the town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] which foretell various events within the show and the eventual destiny of Superman.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ezrasmall.com/ | title=Ezra Small Prophesies}}</ref>
* In ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', there is a character named '''Beebo'''. Beebo is a fictional character that is part of the "Cuddle Me Beebo" toy brand. A toy of Beebo from 1992, carried by young [[Martin Stein]], was trapped in an anachronism, creating a time aberration of New Valhalla, due to Beebo becoming the Blue God worshiped by vikings, who started an early conquest of North America. More Beebos were seen recently in a toy factory in 2018 but were destroyed thanks to The [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. Beebo was thought of by [[Nate Heywood]] as a manifestation of "something pure", which led to him becoming an avatar of the power of Totems of Zambesi, wielded by the Legends, in the final battle against Mallus.
