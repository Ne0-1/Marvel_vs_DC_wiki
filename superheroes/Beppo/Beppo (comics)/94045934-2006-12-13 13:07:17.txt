'''Beppo''' is [[Superman]]'s pet [[monkey]] created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[George Papp]] in ''[[Superboy]]'' (1st series) #76 ([[October 1959]]). He is [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]], like Superman, and so has the same superpowers when on Earth. He was originally a test animal used by [[Jor-El]] during his spaceflight development project to see if his son could survive space travel, and stowed away on board the craft that ultimately saved Superman from Krypton's destruction.

Beppo only turned up years after Superboy had been found by the Kents, and initially caused Superboy much trouble with his super-powered mischief. Eventually Superboy led Beppo out into deep space and ditched him there so that he couldn't cause further trouble. Beppo later returned and encountered [[Supergirl]], who introduced him to [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] and [[Streaky the Supercat]]. He went on to join the [[Legion of Super-Pets]].

He has not appeared officially since the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' but as a popular character many references to him can be found in later books including ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''.
