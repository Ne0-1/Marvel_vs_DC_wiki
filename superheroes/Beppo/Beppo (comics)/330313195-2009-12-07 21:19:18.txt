'''Beppo''' is a fictional [[monkey]] in the [[DC Universe]].  Created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[George Papp]], he first appeared in ''[[Superboy]]'' v1 076 (October 1959). 

==Fictional character background==
Beppo, despite his resemblance to an Earth monkey, is from the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].  He was originally one of [[Jor-El]]'s test animals.  Luckily for him, Beppo decided to stow away aboard baby [[Superman|Kal-El]]'s rocket to Earth.  Upon landing, Beppo hopped out unseen and went off on his own for a period of some months.  Beppo lived in a jungle for a while and handled himself quite well, since as a Kryptonian monkey he had the [[Powers and abilities of Superman|usual array of super-powers]].

One day Beppo, using his telescopic vision, spotted Kal-El, now a toddler living in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] with the [[Ma and Pa Kent|Kents]].  Beppo quickly flew to Smallville and, being a monkey, secretly caused all sorts of havoc.  Ma and Pa Kent initially blamed baby Clark for Beppo's super-powered monkeyshines, but they soon discovered the truth.  The Kents fretted that Clark's secret might be exposed by the super-antics of the Simian of Steel but, as it turned out, their worry was needless.  It wasn't long before Beppo accidentally set off some [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] fireworks stored in the Kent garage.  The explosions spooked Beppo, who took off into space.  The panicked Beppo kept on going when he saw a passing comet, which he thought was more fireworks chasing him.  When Beppo failed to return, the Kents presumed he'd gotten lost out there somewhere.  Beppo's origin is related in "The Super-Monkey from Krypton!", the cover story in Superboy v1 076 (October 1959).  At the end of the story, which is told in [[flashback]] by teenaged Clark, the reader is informed that Beppo made his way back to Earth before too long.

Many years later, Beppo encountered [[Supergirl]], who introduced him to [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] and [[Streaky the Supercat]]. Beppo went on to join the [[Legion of Super-Pets]].

Beppo was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence following the original [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].  The Monk of Might made his first canonical appearance in more than twenty years in the fifth and final issue of the [[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]] series (September 2009).  Before that, Beppo had been returned to existence briefly by the [[Psycho-Pirate]] during the earlier [[Infinite Crisis]].

==Other versions==
Beppo is one of the animals in Superman's artificial reality farm in ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' #1 (May 1996). He also appears in the out-of-continuity ''[[Tiny Titans]]'', alongside Streaky the Super-Cat, as Supergirl's pet.

== Appearances in other media ==
===Superman: The Animated Series===
Beppo is referenced in "[[Monkey Fun (Superman: The Animated Series)|Monkey Fun]]", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.  Beppo is the name of [[Lois Lane]]'s childhood toy, a stuffed monkey that played "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]."  The toy was also the favorite of [[Titano]], a test chimp used by the space program.  When Titano returns to Earth and grows to gargantuan proportions, he can only be calmed down by the sound of Beppo's song ([[Pop goes the weasel]]).

===Other shows===
On the ''[[Colbert Report]]'', Stephen names God's chimp Beppo, of whom all chimps are made in His likeness.

==Other Beppos==
In the animated online adventure ''[[Smallville (TV series)#Other media|Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom]]'' (a spinoff from the TV series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''), the [http://smallville.warnerbros.com/internal_sites/ezra/index.html Ezra Small House] on the official Smallville website, and other online media related to the show, a character named '''Christopher James Beppo''' is the researcher and caretaker of the Ezra Small Prophecies, a set of cryptic writings made by the founder of the town of [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] which foretell various events within the show and the eventual destiny of Superman.[http://www.ezrasmall.com/]
