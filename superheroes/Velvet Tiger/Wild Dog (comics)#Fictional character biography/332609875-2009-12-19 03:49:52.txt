'''Wild Dog''' is a [[fictional]] [[vigilante]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Wild Dog'' #1 (September 1987), and was created by [[Max Allan Collins]] and [[Terry Beatty]]. 
 
==Publication History==
Wild Dog first appeared in a four issue mini-series (issue #1, cover date September 1987). The series is credited to [[Max Allan Collins]], [[Terry Beatty]] and [[Dick Giordano]]. Shortly thereafter, the character appeared in ''[[Action Comics#Action Comics Weekly|Action Comics Weekly]]''. Normally a Superman title, at the time ''Action Comics'' was going through an incarnation as a high page count anthology title with short episodes of different characters' ongoing stories appearing in each issue. There were three major Wild Dog story arcs in ''Action Comics Weekly''; after the third, the character appeared in his own one-shot ''Wild Dog Special''. Wild Dog's final appearance in ''Action Comics Weekly'' was issue #641 (cover date March 7 1989). The last issue of ''Action Comics Weekly'' was #642, after which the book went back to Superman stories, a normal page count, and normal monthly schedule.

==Fictional Character Biography==
Wild Dog is an auto mechanic/garage owner named Jack Wheeler from the [[Quad Cities (comics)|Quad Cities]] area who is dedicated to fighting terrorism and urban crime. Wheeler was a high school and college football star as well as a decorated [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]. The "laughing dog" jersey he wears is from his old college football uniform. His war on crime originates as a result of his girlfriend's murder by the [[Mafia]]. His actions in the beginning are mainly directed against domestic American terrorists led by the "Committee for Social Change". Wild Dog is quite willing to use deadly force against his equally violent opponents.

Armed with a [[Jatimatic GG-95 SMG PDW]] and a pair of electrified "shock gloves", his costume consists of camouflage pants, combat boots, a local college football jersey emblazoned with a snarling red dog (hiding his protective body armor), and a hockey mask to conceal his identity. 

===Infinite Crisis===

Wild Dog was recently seen, alongside the current [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and the current [[Crimson Avenger]] on a Metropolis rooftop. This group, joining in on an effort to protect the city from the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]], is seen raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and other villains in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7.

In an alternate timeline accidentally created by [[Booster Gold]] in ''52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #6'' Wild Dog is part of a resistance cell against [[Maxwell Lord]], being one of the only heroes still alive or uncaptured. Lord forces Wild Dog to shoot himself.
