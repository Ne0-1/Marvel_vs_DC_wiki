'''Wild Dog''' is a [[fictional]] [[vigilante]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Wild Dog'' #1 (September 1987), and was created by [[Max Allan Collins]] and [[Terry Beatty]].

==Publication history==
[[File:Wild Dog (comics) first issue cover.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Wild Dog'' #1 by [[Terry Beatty]].]]
Wild Dog first appeared in a four issue mini-series (issue #1, cover date September 1987). The series is credited to [[Max Allan Collins]], [[Terry Beatty]] and [[Dick Giordano]]. Shortly thereafter, the character appeared in ''[[Action Comics#Action Comics Weekly|Action Comics Weekly]]''. Normally a Superman title, at the time ''Action Comics'' was going through an incarnation as a high-page-count weekly anthology title with serialized episodes of various characters' ongoing stories appearing in each issue. There were three major Wild Dog story arcs in ''Action Comics Weekly''; after the third, the character appeared in a one-shot ''Wild Dog Special''. Wild Dog's final appearance in ''Action Comics Weekly'' was issue #641 (cover date March 7, 1989). The last issue of ''Action Comics Weekly'' was #642, after which the book went back to its standard format of monthly Superman stories.

Jack Wheeler would return as a supporting character in ''[[Cave Carson|Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye]]'', a 2016 [[Young Animal (DC Comics)|Young Animal]] series written by [[Gerard Way]] and Jon Rivera.<ref>"Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye" #1 (October, 2016)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Jack Wheeler went to college on a football scholarship. He dropped out due to an injury and enlisted in the Marines to complete his education. He quit that after most of his squad was killed by a terrorist bomb. He returned to the Quad Cities and began taking night classes. He started dating a fellow student named Claire and fell in love with her. His new girlfriend soon began experiencing "accidents" and was ultimately shot dead in front of Jack while the pair were on a date. Afterwards, it was revealed she was secretly the daughter of a Chicago crime boss who left her family to start a new life for herself.

Claire's [[Will and testament|will]] named Jack as her sole beneficiary and made him a considerably wealthy man. Furious over all the deaths he'd witnessed, but unsure of how to proceed, Jack took the somewhat-facetious advice of a friend to "use the money to fight the mob". He opened up his own car mechanic/body shop as a public identity, then secretly tracked down the rival gang members who ordered the hit. He created a costume of camouflage pants, combat boots, a local college football jersey emblazoned with a snarling red dog (hiding his protective body armor), and a [[Ice hockey|hockey]] [[goaltender]] mask to conceal his identity. Armed with a [[Jatimatic|Jatimatic GG-95 PDW]] and a pair of electrified "shock gloves", he killed the gang leaders and the hitman who had killed Claire.<ref>"Wild Dog" #4 (1987)</ref> 

In the first issue of his limited series, he barges in on a hostage situation and kills all the criminals. He successfully rescues an endangered TV news reporter and is named "Wild Dog" after the SWAT captain orders his men to shoot the vigilante "like a wild dog in the street".<ref>"Wild Dog" #1 (1987)</ref> His actions in the beginning are mainly directed against domestic American terrorists led by the "Committee for Social Change". He faces other threats, like a social group, the National Legion for Morality, willing to use arson to destroy pornographic material.<ref>"Action Comics Weekly" #603 (1988)</ref> 

Wild Dog changes opponents when he becomes a small part of the effort to resist an earth-wide alien invasion.<ref>"Invasion!" #2 (1988)</ref> Later, the alien [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] is sent to New York to kill the comic book editor [[Mike Carlin]]. Wild Dog is one of many recruited to stop Lobo. This group includes [[Black Condor]], [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], [[Garryn Bek]], [[Human Flea]], [[Strata (comics)|Strata]], [[Velvet Tiger]] and [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]].<ref>"Lobo" Vol 2 #62 (May, 1999)</ref>

===Infinite Crisis===
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
Wild Dog was recently seen, alongside the current [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and the current [[Crimson Avenger]] on a Metropolis rooftop. This group, joining in on a hundreds-strong effort to protect the city from the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]], is seen raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and other villains in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7.

In an alternate timeline accidentally created by [[Booster Gold]] in ''Booster Gold'' #8 Wild Dog is part of a resistance cell against [[Maxwell Lord]], being one of the only heroes still alive or uncaptured. Lord forces Wild Dog to shoot himself.
