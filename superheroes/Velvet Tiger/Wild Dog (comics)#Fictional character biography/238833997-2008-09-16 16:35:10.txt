'''Wild Dog''' is a [[fictional]] [[vigilante]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Wild Dog'' #1 (September 1987), and was created by [[Max Allan Collins]] and [[Terry Beatty]]. 
 
==Publication History==
Wild Dog first appeared in a four issue mini-series (issue #1, cover date September 1987). The series is credited to [[Max Allan Collins]], [[Terry Beatty]] and [[Dick Giordano]]. Shortly thereafter, the character appeared in ''[[Action Comics#Action Comics Weekly|Action Comics Weekly]]''. Normally a Superman title, at the time ''Action Comics'' was going through an incarnation as a high page count anthology title with short episodes of different characters' ongoing stories appearing in each issue. There were three major Wild Dog story arcs in ''Action Comics Weekly''; in-between the second and third, the character appeared in his own one-shot ''Wild Dog Special''. Wild Dog's final appearance in ''Action Comics Weekly'' was issue #641 (cover date March 7 1989). The last issue of ''Action Comics Weekly'' was #642, after which the book went back to Superman stories, a normal page count, and normal monthly schedule.

==Fictional Character Biography==
Wild Dog was an auto mechanic / garage owner named Jack Wheeler from the [[Quad Cities]] area who was dedicated to fighting terrorism and urban crime. (Wheeler had been a high school and college football star as well as a decorated [[marine]].  His war on criminal activity originated in the cold-blooded murder of his girlfriend by the [[Mafia]].)   His actions in the beginning were mainly directed against domestic American terrorists led by the "Committee for Social Change". As seen in the short-lived series Wild Dog was quite willing to use deadly force against his equally violent opponents.

Armed with a [[Jatimatic GG-95 SMG PDW]] and a pair of electrified "shock gloves", his costume consisted of camouflage pants, combat boots, a local college football jersey emblazoned with a snarling red dog (hiding his protective body armor) and a hockey mask to conceal his identity.

This group, joining in on an effort to protect the city from the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]], is seen raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and other villains in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7.
