'''Wild Dog''' is the title character of a four part comicbook miniseries published by DC comics. Issue #1 is cover dated September 1987, the series is credited to Max Collins, Terry Beatty and Dick Giordiano. Armed with a [[Jatimatic GG-95 SMG PDW]] and a pair of electrified "shock gloves", his costume consisted of camouflage pants, a college football jersey emblazoned with a snarling dog and a hockey mask to conceal his identity. His actions were directed against domestic American terrorists led by the "Committee for Social Change".

The series was not popular, and it was generally perceived to be an attempt to bring a [[Punisher]] style vigilante into DC's stable of characters, a perception not at all helped by the two characters' very similar origin stories. See also [[Nite-Wing]], and [[Casey Jones (TMNT)|Casey Jones]] from the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], for other urban vigilante characters.
