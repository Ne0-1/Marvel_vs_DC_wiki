The '''Tinkerer''', real name '''Phineas Mason''' and sometimes known as the '''Terrible Tinkerer''', is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[comic book]]s set in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has an almost superhuman gift of genius in [[engineering]], able to invent sophisticated [[gadget]]s from nothing more than spare parts left over from ordinary household appliances.

==Fictional character biography==
Phineas Mason is a brilliant inventor and technician who designs advanced weaponry for criminals and sometimes undertakes crimes of his own. As the "Terrible Tinkerer", he runs an underground fix-it shop disguised as a radio repair shop. On at least one occasion, a potential customer gained the inventor's attention by presenting a transistor radio and telling Mason that "I've got a radio that just can't carry a tune". Tinkerer's original scheme involved the employment of a team of petty has-been stuntmen and thugs. They specialized in placing bugs into radios and blackmailing state officials and politicians.

Tinkerer tried to present himself as an alien to confuse his pursuers by leaving behind a mask that looked like his face when he escaped from [[Spider-Man]] in a hovercraft shaped like a flying saucer.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2</ref> His next encounter with Spider-Man resulted in deploying the Toy, a hi-tech robot that serves as an assistant and lackey.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #159</ref> Toy also helped Tinkerer escape from his hideout when it was raided by the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #160</ref>

He is known to have created the suit for [[Mysterio]] who once worked as one of his alien-suited servants.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #51</ref> He created the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]'s tail,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #20</ref> and much later he was hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to rebuild the Spider-Mobile to destroy Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #160</ref>

He redesigned [[Rocket Racer]]'s rocket-powered skateboard,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #182</ref> designed an armed wheel-shaped vehicle called the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]],<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #183</ref> and repaired the [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]]'s bug-ship.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #238</ref> He robbed loan companies by using remote-controlled toys until stopped by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #53</ref>

Tinkerer also provided [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] with improved armor and weaponry,<ref>''Captain America'' #324</ref> provided [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] with new throwing diamonds,<ref>''Captain America'' #369</ref> built the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s scythe-like weapon,<ref>''Avengers'' #52</ref> and even fixed [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]]'s exo-skeleton harness and grizzly suit.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #58</ref>

He has worked for [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #233</ref> [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]],<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #369-370</ref> [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} the [[Ani-Men]]{{Issue|date=May 2009}}, [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester I]],{{Issue|date=May 2009}} and the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} 
Since he is a small business operator who works alone (and arms criminals), the Terrible Tinkerer takes precautions to prevent being cheated. For instance, [[Killer Shrike]] commissioned Tinkerer to improve his weapon gauntlets. At delivery time, the criminal decided to use them to threaten the inventor and avoid paying. The gauntlets backfired on Killer Shrike, wounding and immobilizing him due to a failsafe the Tinkerer engineers into his products for such situations.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #310</ref>

Phineas is forced to work for the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] (Adrian Toomes) interested in freeing [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] from custody. This falls apart when the heroic mutants [[Rusty Collins]] and Skids chance upon the situation and defeat the villains. The Tinkerer is arrested off-panel.<ref>''New Mutants'' #86 (Feb. 1990)</ref>

His son [[Agent (comics)|Agent]] (Rick Mason) was a world-class spy for the American government and freelance operative. Despite his father and he being on opposite sides of the law, they remained on good terms and met frequently. Tinkerer even aided his son from time to time, and once provided Rick with information about a South American coup.<ref>''The Agent Graphic Novel''</ref> After Rick was seemingly killed in action, a grief-stricken Tinkerer decided to mend his ways while still maintaining links to supervillains to give him information he could discreetly pass along.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

In the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries, [[Nick Fury]] discovered a link between the weaponry of most of the known technology-based villains in the Marvel Universe and the kingdom of [[Latveria]]. Tinkerer was revealed to have received a vast portion of his funding and presumably the resources and technology from which he has developed most of his clients' arsenals over the years from Latveria. This was part of an ongoing "terrorist" initiative fostered by the kingdom's despotic leader [[Doctor Doom]] and his minion [[Lucia von Bardas|Countess Luciana Von Bardas]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents discovered Tinkerer's workshop by using [[Killer Shrike]] as a mole. When the agents converged on the workshop, the canny villain detected them. Killer Shrike was struck down by Tinkerer's security systems, and the Tinkerer fled to Latveria rather than face justice.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Early in the ''Marvel Knight's'' imprint of Spider-Man, [[Eddie Brock]] sells the [[Venom (Marvel Comics)|Venom]] symbiote through an auction put on by Tinkerer.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #7</ref>

[[Punisher|Frank Castle]] finds and confronts Tinkerer after a confrontation with the murderous Stilt-Man. Tinkerer begs for death. Not only was his son Rick dead, but Rick's own son perished in the [[Stamford, Connecticut]] explosion that heralded the beginning of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Without his beloved son or grandson, he became suicidal and continued his work in the hope that both superheroes and supervillains would wipe each other out. Castle stabs Tinkerer in the back, likely leaving him paralyzed.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]] volume 2'' {{issue|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Phineas, now bound to a wheelchair in ''Wolverine: Origins #12'', has been contracted by the resurrected villain [[Cyber (comics)|Silas "Cyber" Burr]], to subject his new body to the [[Adamantium]]-Epidermal Bonding Process. Phineas, during ''Wolverine: Origins #15'', agrees to create a "pacemaker" for the ailing Cyber's heart condition, as well as three [[carbonadium]] bullets for [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]] in exchange for the use of Logan's mysterious carbonadium synthesizer. Cyber awakens from the procedure to discover the deadly radioactive device permanently attached to his chest and that Logan has disappeared with the C-synth. Phineas is last seen in the clutches of an enraged Cyber.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

He survived his encounter with Cyber, however, and is seen attending "the Survivors' Guild", a therapy group for survivors of the [[Punisher]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He is later apprehended by [[Iron Man]] for ties to a super [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] black market.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], [[Franklin Richards]] and [[Valeria Richards]] free him from [[Negative Zone Prison Alpha|Prison 42]] to help them return to the Earth dimension. It is mentioned that Phineas had retired as Tinkerer, but was imprisoned for breaking the [[Super Human Registration Act|Registration Act]] anyway. He is initially reluctant to help his old foes, but the resemblance of Franklin and Valeria to his own grandchildren causes him to relent.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]: Fantastic Four'' #3</ref>

It was revealed in ''Ms. Marvel'' that Rick is in fact still alive, under deep cover, and killed a deep cover CIA agent whom assisted in [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]]'s murder for [[Norman Osborn]] in exchange for Phineas's release and a cleared record for Phineas.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #37</ref>

Tinkerer is later seen in jail where he repairs [[Hypno-Hustler]]'s costume.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #13</ref>

[[Phil Urich|Hobgoblin]] (Phil Urich) later visits Tinkerer to have his gear upgraded so that he can evade the [[Doctor Octopus|Superior Spider-Man]]. It is shown that Tinkerer has taken in Tiberius Stone as a secret apprentice as Tiberius gets revenge on Hobgoblin by making it so that Hobgoblin's tech fails him.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #15</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Tinkerer===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Tinkerer was rendered by artist [[Mark Bagley]] to resemble actor [[Paul Giamatti]] as per writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]]'s instructions.<ref name=WizardXtra>Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra!]]''. p. 117.</ref> This version is '''Elijah Stern''', a former [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] employee who hired [[Killer Shrike]], [[Omega Red]] and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] (Blackie Drago) to torment his former boss [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Donald Roxxon]] as revenge for firing him. This was after he discovered a way to use [[vibranium]] as a power source but his plan was discovered by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and Stern was given a choice to work for them or die. He chose to work for them, and impressed [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] with a robot that may be the Ultimate version of the [[Spider-Slayer]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #90</ref> The key indicator that he is Tinkerer is when he stated that he merely "tinkers". Elijah appeared commanding the Spider-Slayers to destroy the creature that had formed from [[Gwen Stacy]]'s clone to [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #97-105</ref> Elijah showed an evil side when he secretly ordered the Spider Slayers who arrived at Queens.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #101</ref> When the Sinister Six show up in search of weapons as part of Norman Osborn's plot to kill [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker), Stern 'accommodates' them by upgrading Vulture's suit and giving a set of blasters and knives to [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #158</ref> [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] (Aaron Davis) later breaks into Stern's lab, blaming Stern for bad tech. After interrogating Stern, Prowler shot and killed Elijah after realizing things about the new [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] (Miles Morales).<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #7</ref>

The Ultimate version of Phineas Mason is a scientific prodigy at Nursery Two, one of the think tanks of young geniuses sponsored by the [[U.S. government]]. The [[Mole Man]] kidnapped Mason along with his fellow students with the intention of using them to seed a new underground civilization in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]. With the help of the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]], the students of Nursery Two defeated Mole Man. Rather than return to their lives above ground, Mason and his teammates opted to stay behind and start a civilization on their own terms.<ref>''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #2</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Tinkerer appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Thom Adcox-Hernandez]]. This version is depicted as younger and with more hair than his original counterpart. Phineas Mason worked alongside Quentin Beck under [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s employ until being arrested at the end of the episode. Phineas assumes the 'Tinkerer' identity in the episode "Blueprints". He designed [[Mysterio]]'s gear and devices. Following [[Spider-Man]] taking out Mysterio's android doubles, Mysterio talks with Tinkerer who asks why he made the android controlling the others look like him. Tinkerer contacts the [[Doctor Octopus|Master Planner]] telling him that everything Mysterio stole has not been found in the warehouse that he was hiding in. Tinkerer later oversees the assemblage of the [[Sinister Six]] and works as a second-in-command to Master Planner. In the episode "Probable Cause", the [[Tombstone (comics)|Big Man]] hires Tinkerer to create super-suits: [[Fancy Dan]]'s [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] suit and upgrades [[Montana (comics)|Montana]]'s [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] gauntlets.

===Video games===
* Tinkerer appears as the first level boss in the [[Sega Master System|Master System]] version of the first Sega ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin|Spider-Man]]'' video game. He combats Spider-Man at the end of the Warehouse level, driving a forklift.

* Tinkerer appears as a villain in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[William Utay]]. He seems to be more of a protagonist in this version, even though his villainous ways are still shown. In the game, he develops a sonic device in order to fight the [[symbiote (comics)|alien symbiote]] invasion after Spider-Man frees him from Ryker's Island (only because [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] and [[Hank Pym|Henry Pym]] were unavailable). He is transferred from Stark Tower to Wilson Fisk Industries where he mentions that his Sonic Detonator will only work on the Trask Building (as it was made from American steel that was forged before 1940). In exchange for building a Sonic Detonator, Tinkerer requests access to the facilities in Wilson Fisk Industries, $25,000,000 in cash, a full pardon, a specific castle in Italy, and a specific girl from his favorite tool calendar waiting by the pool. [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] informs Tinkerer that his facilities are at his disposal and will make some calls for the castle and the girl while the full pardon and the money can be given to him by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Following Spider-Man's fight against Symbiote-[[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], Black Widow informs Tinkerer that his money has been wired and to begin the detonation sequence. After Symbiote-Vulture cuts the data links to Tinkerer's Sonic Detonator upon defeating the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents positioned there, Tinkerer objects to Black Widow calling an air strike since they need the Trask Building intact. In both Black Suit ending, Kingpin tells Black Widow that the Tinkerer is ready as she gives a symbiote-controlled [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] a mission to bring her Spider-Man dead or alive. In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions, he has a headquarters by the pier and has also captured [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] and brainwashes him. He fights Spider-Man in a giant robot that has a force field. After Spider-Man defeats the Tinkerer, he escapes by ejecting from the robot.

* Tinkerer is the main antagonist of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]. He has been supplying [[Lucia von Bardas]] and other supervillains with technology. When encountered by the heroes, Tinkerer unleashes some robotic soldiers on them. In the reactor room, Tinkerer attacks the heroes in his Tank-Bot. Tinkerer escapes when his Tank-Bot is destroyed. Tinkerer later pops up in [[Nick Fury]]'s secret base stating that he might know who is the one responsible for pulling the strings on the supervillains that Iron Man had under control of his control nanites. While Fury and the heroes infiltrated Prison 42, Tinkerer had already left. He is later revealed to be the one behind the nanite hive mind called The Fold. The heroes later encounter him in a Repeater Tower in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] where he attacks the heroes alongside two Fold soldiers (which is when Tinkerer is invulnerable in his personal forcefield until they are destroyed). He managed to escape to the top of the Repeater Tower to jam the Nanite Statis Signal. The heroes make it to the top and knock him out. In the Wii version of the game, Tinkerer is references to be supplying advanced equipment from von Bardis to supervillains, but he is nowhere to be found in Latveria. Eventually, Tinkerer comes to Fury's secret base to explain to the heroes that he did the research behind the nanites, and says the nanites have become unresponsive to all signals, and he says he needs a pure sample of uninjected nanites. After retrieving the nanites by infiltrating Ryker's Island while Captain America attacks and entering the Negative Zone, Tinkerer is nowhere to be found. Eventually on the tower in Iceland, Tinkerer is fought. He is defeated by destroying supervillain-shaped toys with powers matching their specific villain which causes his control panel to explode in his face.

* Tinkerer appears as a boss in the Nintendo DS version of ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He uses his fragment of the Table of Order and Chaos to power up a machine that creates an army of robots. Spider-Man tracks him down to his lair in an abandoned construction site, and destroys his machine, defeating him. Before Spider-Man takes the fragment from him, Tinkerer gloats that he sold an army of robots to [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].
