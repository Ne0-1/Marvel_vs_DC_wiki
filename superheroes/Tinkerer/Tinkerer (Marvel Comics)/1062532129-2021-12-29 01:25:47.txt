The '''Tinkerer''' ('''Phineas Mason''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]] and the father of [[Agent (comics)|Rick Mason]]. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], and made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #2 (May 1963).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=382}}</ref> The Tinkerer is generally depicted as a genius in [[engineering]] who is able to create [[gadget]]s from nothing more than spare parts left over from ordinary household appliances. While in his initial appearances he sought to personally eliminate Spider-Man, more recent storylines depict him under the employ of other supervillains, whom he supplies with his gadgets for their personal vendettas against Spider-Man or other heroes.

Since his introduction in comics, the character has been adapted into several other forms of media, such as animated television series and video games. The Tinkerer made his live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), portrayed by [[Michael Chernus]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Criminal career===
'''Phineas Mason''' is a brilliant inventor and technician who designs advanced weaponry for criminals and sometimes undertakes crimes of his own. As the "'''Terrible Tinkerer'''", he runs an underground fix-it shop disguised as a radio repair shop. On at least one occasion, a potential customer gained the inventor's attention by presenting a transistor radio and telling Mason that "I've got a radio that just can't carry a tune". The Tinkerer's original scheme involved the employment of a team of petty has-been stuntmen and thugs. They specialized in placing [[bugging|bug]]s into radios and blackmailing state officials and politicians. The Tinkerer tried to present himself as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] to confuse his pursuers by leaving behind a mask that looked like his face when he escaped from [[Spider-Man]] in a hovercraft shaped like a flying saucer.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=346â€“347}}</ref>

The Tinkerer's next encounter with Spider-Man resulted in deploying the Toy, a hi-tech robot that serves as an assistant and lackey.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #159</ref> The Toy also helped the Tinkerer escape from his hideout when raided by the police.<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #160.

Marvel Comics.</ref> designed the armed wheel-shaped [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]] vehicle,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #183. Marvel Comics.</ref> and repaired the [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]]'s bug-ship.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #238. Marvel Comics.</ref> He robbed loan companies by using remote-controlled toys until stopped by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #53. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Tinkerer also provided [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] with improved armor and weaponry,<ref>''Captain America'' #324</ref> provided [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] with new throwing diamonds,<ref>''Captain America'' #369</ref> built the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s scythe-like weapon,<ref>''Avengers'' #52</ref> and even fixed [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]]'s exo-skeleton harness and grizzly suit.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #58. Marvel Comics.</ref> He has worked for [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #233</ref> the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] (Abner Jenkins),<ref>''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #369-370</ref> the [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], the [[Ani-Men]], [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]], and the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]].

Since he is a small business operator who works alone (and arms criminals), the Terrible Tinkerer takes precautions to prevent being cheated. For instance, [[Killer Shrike]] commissioned the Tinkerer to improve weapon gauntlets. At delivery time, the criminal decided to use the weapons to threaten the inventor and avoid paying. The gauntlets backfired on Killer Shrike, wounding and immobilizing due to a failsafe the Tinkerer engineers into his products for such situations.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #310. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mason is forced to work for the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (Adrian Toomes) interested in freeing [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] from custody. This falls apart when the heroic mutants [[Rusty Collins]] and Skids chance upon the situation and defeat the villains. The Tinkerer is arrested off-panel.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #86 (February 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Trapster]] later sued the Tinkerer for selling faulty equipment. The Trapster's character witnesses in the case against the Tinkerer include the Beetle, [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]], [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], Jack O'Lantern, [[Mad Thinker]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], [[Stilt-Man]], [[Spymaster]] and [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. When Taskmaster accuses the other villains of not properly using the equipment that the Tinkerer provided, it resulted in an in-court brawl that was broken up by [[She-Hulk]] which leads to the villains getting arrested. When the Tinkerer and Mad Thinker ask She-Hulk who is superior, She-Hulk says to sort it out themselves and storms off.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #59 (January 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref> His son [[Agent (comics)|Rick Mason]] is a world-class mercenary for the American government and freelance operative. Despite the two being on opposite sides of the law, father and son remained on good terms and met frequently. The Tinkerer even aided Rick from time to time, and once provided his son with information about a coup in South America.<ref>''The Agent Graphic Novel''</ref> After Rick was seemingly killed in action, the grief-stricken father decided to mend his ways while still maintaining links to supervillains to give information he could discreetly pass along.<ref>''Cage'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries, [[Nick Fury]] discovered a link between the weaponry of most of the known technology-based villains in the Marvel Universe and the kingdom of [[Latveria]]. The Tinkerer was revealed to have received a vast portion of his funding and presumably the resources and technology from which he has developed most of his clients' arsenals over the years from Latveria. This was part of an ongoing "terrorist" initiative fostered by the kingdom's despotic leader [[Doctor Doom]] and minion [[Lucia von Bardas|Countess Luciana Von Bardas]].<ref>''Secret War'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents discovered the Tinkerer's workshop by using Killer Shrike as a mole. When the agents converged on the workshop, the canny villain detected this. Killer Shrike was struck down by the Tinkerer's security systems, and the Tinkerer fled to Latveria rather than face justice. Early in the ''Marvel Knights'' imprint of Spider-Man, [[Eddie Brock]] sells the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote through an auction put on by the Tinkerer.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Punisher]] finds and confronts the Tinkerer after a confrontation with the murderous Stilt-Man to which Tinkerer begs for death. Not only was his son dead, but his grandson perished in the [[Stamford, Connecticut]] explosion that heralded the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'s beginning. Without his beloved son or grandson, he was suicidal and continued his work in the hope that both superheroes and supervillains would wipe each other out. The Punisher stabs the Tinkerer in the back, likely leaving him paralyzed.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Now bound to a wheelchair, Mason has been contracted by [[Cyber (Marvel Comics)|Silas "Cyber" Burr]] to subject the resurrected villain's new body to the [[Adamantium]]-epidermal bonding process. Mason agrees to create a "pacemaker" for the ailing Cyber's heart condition, as well as three [[carbonadium]] bullets for [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] in exchange for the use of Logan's mysterious carbonadium synthesizer. Cyber awakens from the procedure to discover the deadly radioactive device permanently attached to the chest and that Logan has disappeared with the C-synth. Phineas is last seen in the enraged Cyber's clutches.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #12-15. Marvel Comics.</ref> Surviving his encounter with Cyber, he is seen attending the Survivors' Guild, a therapy group for survivors of the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #16</ref> He is later apprehended by [[Iron Man]] for ties to a super [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] black market.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #7</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, he is freed from Prison 42 to help [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] and [[Valeria Richards]] return to the Earth dimension. It is mentioned that Mason had retired the Tinkerer identity but is imprisoned for breaking the [[Super Human Registration Act|Registration Act]] anyway. He is initially reluctant to help his old foes, but Franklin's and Valeria's resemblance to his own grandchildren causes him to relent.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was revealed Rick is in fact still alive, under deep cover, and in a conspiracy which resulted in [[Carol Danvers]]'s apparent murder for [[Norman Osborn]] in exchange for his father's release and cleared record.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #37. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Tinkerer is later seen in jail where he repairs [[Hypno-Hustler]]'s costume.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Phil Urich]] later visits the Tinkerer to have the Hobgoblin's gear upgraded to evade the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]]. It is shown that the Tinkerer has taken in [[Tyler Stone (Marvel Comics)|Tiberius Stone]] as a secret apprentice as Stone gets revenge on the Hobgoblin by making it so that the Hobgoblin's tech fails.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He fabricated the identity of his own brother '''Hophni Mason''' via a robotic suit.<ref>''Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #300. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Hophni, he acted a confidant of various superheroes (such as [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] and [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]]),<ref>''Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and both provided technology and an acquaintance to [[Teresa Parker]].<ref>''Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #3-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> His faÃ§ade is revealed to which he used his said disguise as a battlesuit which gets defeated by Spider-Man, however, it gets revealed he's an ally to the Vedomi alien race of sentient AIs.<ref>''Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #299-300. Marvel Comics.</ref> After escaping from custody, the Tinkerer (equipped with the Vedomi's battlesuit) battles Spider-Man. Spider-Man realized the Tinkerer was sorrowful and resentful towards humanity and help change his point of view and stay with the Vedomi to help guide positively.<ref>''Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #306-307. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Phineas Mason is a scientific prodigy at Nursery Two, one of the think tanks of young geniuses sponsored by the [[U.S. government]]. The [[Mole Man]] kidnapped Mason and his fellow students with the intention of using them to seed a new underground civilization in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]. With the [[Fantastic Four]]'s help, the Nursery Two students defeated Mole Man. Rather than return to their lives above ground, Mason and his teammates opted to stay behind and start a civilization on their own terms.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Ultimate equivalent of Tinkerer is '''Elijah Stern''', an original character created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Mark Bagley]], and designed to resemble [[Paul Giamatti]].<ref name=WizardXtra>Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra!]]''. p. 117.</ref> This iteration's alias key indicator is stating that he merely "tinkers".

Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]] (Aaron Davis) later breaks into his workshop, getting interrogated before being killed in cold blood once his killer realized things about the new [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #7.

===''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows''===
During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline in the pages of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows]]'', a version of Tinkerer resides in the [[Battleworld]] domain of The Regency.

When Spider-Man came to him for Inhibitor Chips (to conceal the superhuman signatures of himself and his daughter Annie), Tinkerer stalled until the Sinister Six could arrive, although Spider-Man managed to steal the Inhibitor Chips and escape.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #3.

===Old Man Logan===
On Earth-807127, Tinkerer was mentioned by [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Old Man Logan|Pappy Banner]] where he built an Adamantium suit of armor that ran on gamma energy.
