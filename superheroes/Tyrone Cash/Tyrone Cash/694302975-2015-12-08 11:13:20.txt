'''Tyrone Cash''' is a fictional character in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. He is a member of [[The Ultimates]] and is described as being the first [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] before [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Ultimate Hulk|Bruce Banner]] became the Hulk.<ref name="UC:A8">''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #8</ref>

==Publication history==
Tyrone Cash first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' Vol. 2 #1 and was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Leinil Francis Yu]].

==Fictional character biography==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, '''Dr. Leonard Williams''' was a [[professor]] at [[Cambridge University]] and a family man with a wife and children but due to disability he relied on the aid of crutches to walk. Cambridge is where he worked with a young [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]]. They worked together in order to create a super soldier formula. During this time, he became Bruce's "mentor" and allegedly taught Banner "everything he knows." Williams disappears in an unexplained occurrence in which several people are killed, and comes to be considered a missing person.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #7</ref>

Leonard Williams became the first Hulk and lives as "Tyrone Cash." Unlike the Bruce Banner's Hulk, Tyrone Cash still retains his intellect and self-control. The years he was "missing," he was actually being monitored by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while he was "murdering and pillaging his way through [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]." Now 16 years after the accident Leonard Williams "perished" in, Tyrone Cash resides in [[South America]] living as a ruthless gang lord. In order to draft Williams/Cash into the Avengers black ops team, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] sends [[War Machine]] to retrieve him. War Machine approaches Cash peacefully, and tries to remind him of his previous life, but Cash turns on him, and starts brutally beating War Machine. During their fight, Cash shows how powerful he is and how truly sadistic and ruthless he has become. He plucks a one-man plane from the air and uses it as a weapon, with no remorse for killing the pilot or the others on his island. He threatens to quickly rebuild his "crime empire" if War Machine ruins it, and only stops fighting after War Machine says "We'll tell your wife and kid you're still alive."<ref name="UC:A8"/>

The first assignment given to Cash and his fellow Avengers is to take out the enigmatic and deadly [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)#Ultimate Ghost Rider|Ghost Rider]]. In an attempt to "get the jump on" Ghost Rider the Avengers and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents stand guard at an airport. Ghost Rider eventually arrives to capture, and inevitably kill, his target. Ghost Rider ripped a man from his plane and quickly rides off, but his escape is cut short but a well placed rocket courtesy of [[Hawkeye (comics)#Other versions|Hawkeye]].

Cash was discovered to be behind the sale of S.H.I.E.L.D.-owned Super-Soldiers on the black market. After the Avengers attempted to take him down and arrest him, he confessed that he was secretly taking orders from [[Carol Danvers]], and that she had been selling S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets for years.<ref>''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #2</ref>

He is taken down by [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] who hypnotizes him and drained his Hulk-blood out of him. Upon being brought to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Tyrone Cash told Nick Fury the secrets of the Hulk drug and was then executed by Nick Fury.<ref>''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tyrone Cash has [[superhuman strength]], stamina and durability, and a [[healing factor]] which are similar to those abilities possessed by the Hulk. Tyrone also possesses genius-level intellect.

==Other versions==
===Secret Wars===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, an alternate version of Leonard Williams appears as a member of the Thor Corps on [[Battleworld]]. He is seen with Thor versions of [[Gamora]], Kit Renner, and other unknown Thor Corps members where they pin down the Banshee Squadron when they landed upon leaving Hala Field in their aircraft.<ref>''Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps'' #3</ref>
