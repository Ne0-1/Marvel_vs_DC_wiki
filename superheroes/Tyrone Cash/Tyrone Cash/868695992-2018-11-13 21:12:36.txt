'''Tyrone Cash''' is a fictional character in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. He is a member of [[The Ultimates]] and is described as being the first [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] before [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Ultimate Marvel|Bruce Banner]] became the Hulk.<ref name="UC:A8">''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #8</ref>

==Publication history==
Tyrone Cash first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' Vol. 2 #1 and was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Leinil Francis Yu]].

==Fictional character biography==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, '''Dr. Leonard Williams''' was a [[professor]] at [[Cambridge University]] and a family man with a wife and children but due to disability he relied on the aid of crutches to walk. Cambridge is where he worked with a young [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Ultimate Marvel|Bruce Banner]]. They worked together in order to create a Super-Soldier Formula. During this time, he became Bruce's "mentor" and allegedly taught Banner "everything he knows." Williams disappears in an unexplained occurrence in which several people are killed, and comes to be considered a missing person.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #7</ref>

Leonard Williams became the first Hulk and lives as "Tyrone Cash." Unlike the Bruce Banner's Hulk, Tyrone Cash still retains his intellect and self-control and takes a pill containing the modified Hulk Serum as one of its ingredients. The years he was "missing," he was actually being monitored by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while he was "murdering and pillaging his way through [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]." Now 16 years after the accident Leonard Williams "perished" in, Tyrone Cash resides in [[South America]] living as a ruthless gang leader. In order to draft Williams/Cash into the Avengers black ops team, [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|General Nick Fury]] sends [[War Machine#Ultimate Marvel|War Machine]] to retrieve him. War Machine approaches Cash peacefully, and tries to remind him of his previous life, but Cash turns on him, and starts brutally beating War Machine. During their fight, Cash shows how powerful he is and how truly sadistic and ruthless he has become. He plucks a one-man plane from the air and uses it as a weapon, with no remorse for killing the pilot or the others on his island. He threatens to quickly rebuild his "crime empire" if War Machine ruins it. Cash only stops fighting after War Machine says "We'll tell your wife and kid you're still alive."<ref name="UC:A8"/>

The first assignment given to Cash and his fellow [[Avengers (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Avengers]] is to take out the enigmatic and deadly [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)#Ultimate Marvel|Ghost Rider]]. In an attempt to "get the jump on" Ghost Rider the Avengers and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents stand guard at an airport. Ghost Rider eventually arrives to capture, and inevitably kill, his target. Ghost Rider ripped a man from his plane and quickly rides off, but his escape is cut short by a well placed rocket courtesy of [[Alternative versions of Hawkeye#Ultimate Marvel|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #4-6</ref>

Tyrone Cash is discovered to be behind the sale of S.H.I.E.L.D.-owned Super-Soldiers on the [[black market]]. After the Avengers attempt to take him down and arrest him, he confesses that he was secretly taking orders from [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Marvel|Carol Danvers]] and that she has been selling S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets for years.<ref>''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #2</ref> He is taken down by [[Blade (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Blade]], who hypnotizes him and drains his Hulk Serum out of him. Upon being brought to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Tyrone Cash tells Nick Fury the secrets of the Hulk Serum and is then killed by Nick Fury.<ref>''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Using a pill that contain a perfected version of the Hulk Serum, Tyrone Cash has [[superhuman strength]], stamina and durability, and a healing factor which are similar to those abilities possessed by the Hulk. Tyrone also possesses genius-level intellect.
