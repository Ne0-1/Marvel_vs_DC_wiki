'''Tyrone Cash''' is a fictional character in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. He is a member of [[The Ultimates]], and is described as being the first [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (before [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Ultimate Hulk|Bruce Banner]]).<ref name="UC:A8">''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #8</ref>.

==Fictional character biography==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, '''Dr. Leonard Williams''' was a professor at [[Cambridge University]] and a family man with a wife and children but due to disability he relied on the aid of crutches to walk. Cambridge is where he worked with a young [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]]. They worked together in order to create a super soldier formula. During this time, he became Bruce's "mentor" and allegedly taught Banner "everything he knows." Williams disappears in an unexplained occurrence in which several people are killed, and comes to be considered a missing person. <ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #7</ref>
 
Leonard Williams became the first Hulk and lives as "Tyrone Cash." Unlike the Bruce Banners Hulk, Tyrone Cash still retains his intellect and self control. The years he was "missing," he was actually being monitored by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while he was "murdering and pillaging his way through [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]." Now 16 years after the accident, Leonard Williams "perished" in, Tyrone Cash resides in [[South America]] living as a ruthless gang lord. In order to draft Williams/Cash, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] sends [[War Machine]] to retrieve him. War Machine approaches Cash peacefully, and tries to remind him of his previous life, but Cash turns on him, and starts brutally beating War Machine. During their fight, Cash shows how powerful he is and how truly sadistic and ruthless he has become. He plucks a one man plane from the air and uses it as a weapon, with no remorse for killing the pilot or the others on his island. He threatens to quickly rebuild his "crime empire" if War Machine ruins it, and only stops fighting after War Machine says, "We'll tell your wife and kid you're still alive."<ref name="UC:A8"/>
 
The first assignment given to Cash and his fellow Avengers is to take out the enigmatic and deadly [[Ghost_Rider_(Johnny_Blaze)#Ultimate_Ghost_Rider|Ghost Rider]]. In an attempt to "get the jump on" Ghost Rider the Avengers and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents stand guard at an airport. Ghost Rider eventually arrives to capture, and inevitably kill, his target. Ghost Rider ripped a man from his plane and quickly rides off but his escape is cut short but a well placed rocket courtesy of [[Hawkeye (comics)#Other versions|Hawkeye]].
