'''Lady Quark''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the [[DC Universe]]. In the [[DC Comics]] 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985-1986), the character is one of the rulers of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#Catalogued|Earth-Six]], where the [[American Revolutionary War]] had been won by [[England]].

==Fictional character biography==
===''Crisis''===
Lady Quark's husband Karak, Lord Volt and daughter Liana, Princess Fern are both killed when Earth-6 is destroyed during the Crisis. She is saved at the last minute by [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]], a dimensional traveler.  Lady Quark helps most of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]]'s surviving heroes and they journey to the Dawn of Time to battle the [[Anti-Monitor]]. After the Crisis is over, Lady Quark resettles on Earth with Pariah and [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]]. 

Missing her husband, Lady Quark approaches [[Starman (comics)#Will Payton|Will Payton]] with the idea of having him become her consort in ''Starman'' Volume 1, #8 (March 1989), but Payton rejects her advances. 

===L.E.G.I.O.N.===
Lady Quark is eventually recruited by [[Vril Dox]] to be become a member of the peace-keeping force [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '90'' #18.  During her stay with the team, an alternate time-line presents itself when Dox captures the time-traveler [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]]; Lady Quark, Dox and Waverider then merge into a powerful, murderous dictator in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '91 Annual'' #2. Lady Quark is apparently killed in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #62 after a parasitic shapeshifter absorbs her memories and powers.  The shapeshifter replaces her in L.E.G.I.O.N., but later dies in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #70. Lady Quark's corpse is seen floating in space, heavily maimed. 

===Return===
Eleven years later, Lady Quark returns alive and well without explanation in ''[[Villains United]]'' #5 (2005), in which she is captured by [[Sinestro]] at the request of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]. She is imprisoned in Luthor's tower as part of his plan to bring the core Earths of the Multiverse back into existence. Lady Quark is later freed and joins Earth's heroes in defeating Luthor in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005-2006). 

Lady Quark appears again in several splash pages of ''Tales of The Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime'' (December 2007), and again in a double page spread of Legionnaires and characters associated with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #5 (July 2009).

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Quark is a [[metahuman]] with the ability to absorb and emit nuclear energies.  She can direct these energies as percussive forces from her body.  Her powers allow her to fly and travel through space.
