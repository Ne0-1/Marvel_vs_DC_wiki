===Fictional character history===
[[Curtis Elkins]] was a Guardsman at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], a prison for super powered criminals. While there Curtis befriended Hugh Taylor, a new guardsman fresh out of the army. Curtis left the Vault sometime after Hugh was murdered by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] during an escape.

After that, Curtis and a few of his fellow Guardsmen joined [[The Jury (comics)|The Jury]], an agency organized by [[General Orwell Taylor]]. Their purpose was to track down and destroy Venom. To that end many of them were armed with sonic and fire generating weapons which the alien symbiote was vulnerable to.  After the death of Orwell, the firm was reformed by his older son Maxwell to fit the principles of civil rights and the legal court system.  It was in fact a change done in accordance with Curtis' personal ideology of law and order.  At a final fight with [[Hybrid (Venom Spawn)|Hybrid]], he was seriously injured, not only by physical damage, but also by mental contact with the symbiotes.

Almost all of his later team members were his colleagues from the Vault, either those involved in the riot, or those involved in the Guardsmen at other times.  They include [[Screech (comics)|Screech]] (Maxwell Taylor), [[Ramshot]] (Samuel Caulkin), [[Bomblast]] (First Name Unknown, Last Name Parmenter), [[Firearm (Marvel Comics)|Firearm]] (Unknown), [[Wysper]] (Jennifer Stewart). 

His former enemy Scott Washington aka Hybrid was also a guard in the Vault.

====Powers and abilities====
Although their suits of [[powered armor]] were made by altering Guardsmen suits, they are neither identical nor equal, and let the wearing person possess different abilities.  Sentry's strength is the greatest of them all.  He was strong enough to hold down [[Spider-Man]] in one of their fights.  He has flight technology made differently from the others, with a ramjet propulsion mini engine installed into his boots.  His whole costume is a green-brown color while his partners' are "standard" Guardsmen colors.  He has a powerful energy gun.  There's a picklock tool kit inside his right glove.

==Sentry (Robert Reynolds)==
{{main|Sentry (Robert Reynolds)}}
The Sentry known as [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Robert Reynolds]] first appeared in his own [[limited series]], in which he was marketed as a forgotten creation of [[Stan Lee]], a falsehood that was eventually revealed to be a marketing ploy, and Robert Reynolds had been [[retcon]]ned into the Marvel universe. His popularity not diminished, he became a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and has been the subject of a second limited series.

{{main|Senator Ward}}

'''Steward Ward''' (which is supposedly an assumed name; both names could be considered synonyms for "sentry") appears as a Senator in Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol. 2 #4, with frequent appearances in the this and the concurrent Amazing Spider-Man title throughout Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 2 #24. Mysterious and seemingly up to no good, Ward lurked behind the scenes of the title until he ran afoul of [[Dr. Octopus]] and the [[Sinister Six]]. Ward reappeared a few issues later, and his backstory and connections to Spider-Man ally [[Arthur Stacy]] and the mysterious [[Ranger (comics)|Ranger]] were revealed in a storyline running Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 2. A former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent operating as ''Sentry'', Ward was as a double agent for [[Z'Nox]] aliens, who used Ward to aid in an invasion of Earth. Years later, as Z'Nox aliens found themselves on Earth during a brief period when it was designated an [[Maximum Security|intergalatic prison]], Ward was infected by Z'Nox lifeform, mutating him into a half-human/half-alien being. Ranger subsequently sacrificed himself to destroy Ward.

==Sentry 459==
[[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] 459 was a large android placed on Earth by the alien race The [[Kree]], later discovered by the [[Fantastic Four]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Sentry===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s private version of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is called Sentry.  It is used for detailed imaging within the Solar System and was the first to detect [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] when it appeared over the Great Red Spot of [[Jupiter]].

A humanoid Sentry appears in the "Crossover" story arc of [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] (where the Ultimate [[Frightful Four]] was introduced). This Sentry is from an unspecified dimension, and is the source of the infection in [[Marvel Zombies]]. He is never called by name, and is only distinguishable by his outfit (though other aspects of his appearance are more reminiscent of [[Superman]] including a short, spitcurled hairstyle, (Sentry has long hair), and missing patch of uniform in the approximate shape and location of Superman's "S" shield.).

During the second Sentry mini-series, when the Sentry begins to tell his origin, a false comic-book cover appears that reads "Ultimate Sentry", which shows the Robert Reynolds version of the Sentry. This false cover also states that it created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Mark Bagley]], a reference to their [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] series.
