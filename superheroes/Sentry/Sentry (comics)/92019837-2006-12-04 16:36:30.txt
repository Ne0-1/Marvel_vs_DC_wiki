The Sentry (real name '''Curtis Elkins''') is a member of an undercover hi-tech anti-crime unit, [[The Jury (comics)|The Jury]], which is in loose relation with the government but operating beyond it by being furnished with full powers to arrest, to bring up charges and execute the verdict as one legal entity.  His rank is commanding officer.  His ethnicity is African-American.

====Character history====
Working as a [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] in [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]] (a special jail for villains with super-powers), he was  keeping an eye on such "higher class" criminals as [[Rhino (comics)|The Rhino]], [[Tarantula (comics)|The Tarantula]], [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] and [[Klaw]].  After a riot by the captives, the whole place was burnt to the ground and several wardens and civilians were slaughtered, so disappointed Elkins quit the police.  Many of the former guards were dispatched to various penitentary projects, like the one in "Facility #12", which was created to separate [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] from his symbiote.

After that he joined The Jury, an agency organized by General Orwell Taylor, whose son, Hugh was killed by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], when he escaped from the lab of Facility #12.  For that reason, in the beginning, the Jury's primary target was Venom, and all the other descendants of the original symbiote.  After the death of Orwell, the firm was reformed by his older son Maxwell to fit the principles of civil rights and the legal court system.  It was in fact a change done in accordance with Curtis' personal ideology of law and order.  At a final fight with Hybrid, he was seriously injured, not only by physical damage, but also by mental contact with the symbiotes.

Almost all of his later team members were his colleagues from the Vault, either those involved in the riot, or those involved in the Guardsmen at other times.  They include Screech (Max Taylor), Ramshot (Samuel Caulkin), Bomblast (First Name Unknown, Last Name Parmenter), Firearm (Unknown), Wysper (Jennifer Stewart).<br>
His former enemy [[Hybrid (Venom spawn)|Hybrid]] was also a guard in the Vault.

====Powers and abilities====
Although their suits of [[powered armor]] were made by altering Guardsmen suits, they are neither identical nor equal, and let the wearing person possess different abilities.  Sentry's strength is the greatest of them all.  He was strong enough to hold down [[Spider-Man]] in one of their fights.  He has flight technology made differently from the others, with a ramjet propulsion mini engine installed into his boots.  His whole costume is a green-brown color while his partners' are "standard" Guardsmen colors.  He has a powerful energy gun.  There's a picklock tool kit inside his right glove.

==Robert Reynolds==
{{main|Sentry (Robert Reynolds)}}
The Sentry known as [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Robert Reynolds]] first appeared in his own [[limited series]], where he was marketed as a forgotten creation of Stan Lee. This hoax was revealed to be a simple marketing ploy, and Robert Reynolds had been [[retcon|retconned]] into the Marvel universe. His popularity not diminished, he became a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and has been the subject of another limited series devoted to him.

{{main|Senator Ward}}

'''Steward Ward''' (which is supposedly an assumed name; both names could be considered synonyms for "sentry") appears as a Senator in the 22nd issue of the Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 2. He used to be a secret agent of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] under the name of ''Sentry'', and served as a double agent for the breed of [[Z'Nox]], an alien civilization ready to invade Earth.  He is also worked off his own bat considering himself a soldier of fortune, who's looking for the right opportunity to turn the situation to his favor.  So could happen that he stole a pathogen of an extraterrestrial lifeform, the Z'Nox, stored in a [[HYDRA]] hideout.  It later infected him, mutating him into a half-human/half-alien being.

Ward had a high stake in many gang wars, control over a Vampire overlord, and was wanted by [[HYDRA]], the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], and the [[Ranger (Marvel Comics)|Ranger]]. during their army days, the Ranger had sworn to kill Ward should he ever betray his faction. The Ranger assassinated the alien hybrid that Ward had become.

==Sentry 459==
Sentry 459 was a large android placed on Earth by the alien race The [[Kree]], later discovered by the [[Fantastic Four]].


==Ultimate Sentry==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s private version of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is called Sentry.  It is used for detailed imaging within the Solar System and was the first to detect [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] when it appeared over the Great Red Spot of [[Jupiter]].

A humanoid Sentry appears in the "Crossover" story arc of [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] (where the Ultimate [[Frightful Four]] was introduced). This Sentry is from an unspecified dimension, and is the source of the infection in [[Marvel Zombies]]. He is never called by name, and is only distinguishable by his outfit (though other aspects of his appearance are more reminiscent of [[Superman]]).
