The '''Sentry''' is one of the strangest [[comic book]] superheroes to emerge in recent years. He was created by [[Paul Jenkins]] and Jae Lee for the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Knights]] line. 

== The Sentry hoax ==

The Sentry was marketed with a [[hoax]]. Comic industry magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' reported that Marvel had discovered sketches by an unknown artist named Artie Rosen of a superhero created by [[Stan Lee]] immediately prior to the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Sentry miniseries was promoted as the first appearance of an unknown [[Stan Lee]] [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] hero. However, Marvel had made the whole thing up and ''Wizard'' had played along, for reasons revealed in the story. 

== The Sentry and the Marvel Universe ==

The miniseries established Bob Reynolds, a borderline [[alcoholic]] married man with possible psychotic delusions, as the Sentry, a [[Superman]]-like hero who derived his powers from a special serum. The Sentry was an optimistic and socially accepted hero who stood in marked contrast to the mostly freakish nature of Marvel characters. He had connections to [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Professor X]]. However, his existence was retroactively erased by an unknown figure who tried to conceal the Sentry's identity even from himself. This was also the reason that Lee and Marvel had supposedly forgotten about the character.
{{spoiler}}
It was revealed that the Sentry and his archenemy the Void required each other to exist, and as one grew more powerful, so did the other. The Sentry remembered that he was the one who had erased the world's memory of him and restarted the program that would do so, defeating the Void once again. The whole story can be seen as a meta-commentary on the darkness that overwhelmed superhero comics by the mid-80s, destroying the optimism and wit of the Silver Age.

At the end of the limited series, it seemed as if the Sentry would fade away into obscurity again.

==The Sentry as an Avenger==

However, in [[2004]], the Sentry was reintroduced by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] as an [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] in the pages of ''New Avengers'' as a prisoner of the Vault for murdering his wife. How this will be reconciled with previous continuity remains to be seen.

In the wake of the Sentry's reappearance as an Avenger, copies of ''The Sentry'' #1 suddenly shot up in value in the collector's market.
