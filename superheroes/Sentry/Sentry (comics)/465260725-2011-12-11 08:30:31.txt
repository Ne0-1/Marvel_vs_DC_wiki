'''Sentry''' is the codename of several unrelated [[fictional character]]s of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Currently, the most prominent Sentry is [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Robert Reynolds]], appearing in Marvel's ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' and ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' titles, and the subject of two [[limited series]].

==Sentry 459==

{{main|Sentry (Kree)}}

The first Marvel Comics character to use the name was [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry 459]], a large android placed on Earth by the alien race The [[Kree]], later discovered by the [[Fantastic Four]]. Other models of the Sentry robot later appeared in issues of various comics series.

==Sentry (Curtis Elkins)==
{{main|Sentry (Curtis Elkins)}}
===Fictional character history===
[[Curtis Elkins]] was a [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], a prison for super powered criminals. While there Curtis befriended Hugh Taylor, a new Guardsman fresh out of the [[United States Army|Army]]. Curtis left the Vault sometime after Hugh was murdered by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] during an escape.

After that, Curtis and a few of his fellow Guardsmen joined [[The Jury (comics)|The Jury]], an agency organized by [[General Orwell Taylor]]. Their purpose was to track down and destroy Venom. To that end many of them were armed with sonic and fire generating weapons to which the alien symbiote was vulnerable. After the death of Orwell, the firm was reformed by his older son Maxwell to fit the principles of civil rights and the legal court system.  It was in fact a change done in accordance with Curtis' personal ideology of law and order. At a final fight with [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]], he was seriously injured, not only by physical damage, but also by mental contact with the symbiotes.

Almost all of his later team members were his colleagues from the Vault, either those involved in the riot, or those involved in the Guardsmen at other times. They include [[Screech (comics)|Screech]] (Maxwell Taylor), [[Ramshot]] (Samuel Caulkin), [[Bomblast]] (first name unknown, last name Parmenter), [[Firearm (Marvel Comics)|Firearm]] (unknown) and [[Wysper]] (Jennifer Stewart). 

His former enemy Hybrid (real name Scott Washington) was also a Guardsman in the Vault.

====Powers and abilities====
Although their suits of [[powered armor]] were made by altering Guardsmen suits, they are neither identical nor equal, and let the wearer possess different abilities. Sentry's strength is the greatest of them all. He was strong enough to hold down [[Spider-Man]] in one of their fights. He has flight technology made differently from the others, with a ramjet propulsion mini engine installed into his boots. His whole costume is a green-brown color while his partners' are "standard" Guardsmen colors. He has a powerful energy gun. There's a lock-pick tool kit inside his right glove.

==Sentry (Stewart Ward)==
{{main|Senator Ward}}
'''Steward Ward''' appears as a Senator in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' vol. 2 #4 (April 1999), with frequent appearances in this and the concurrent ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' title throughout ''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #24. Mysterious and seemingly up to no good, Ward lurked behind the scenes of the title until he ran afoul of [[Dr. Octopus]] and the [[Sinister Six]]. Ward reappeared a few issues later, and his backstory and connections to Spider-Man ally [[Arthur Stacy]] and the mysterious [[Ranger (comics)|Ranger]] were revealed in a storyline running ''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2. A former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent operating as ''Sentry'', Ward was as a double agent for [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Z|Z'Nox]] aliens, who used Ward to aid in an invasion of Earth. Years later, as Z'Nox aliens found themselves on Earth during a brief period when it was designated an [[Maximum Security (comics)|intergalactic prison]], Ward was infected by Z'Nox lifeform, mutating him into a half-human/half-alien being. Ranger subsequently sacrificed himself to destroy Ward.

==Sentry (Robert Reynolds)==
{{main|Sentry (Robert Reynolds)}}
The Sentry known as [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Robert Reynolds]] first appeared in his own  [[Marvel Knights]] [[limited series]] (September 2000), in which he was marketed as a forgotten creation of [[Stan Lee]], a falsehood that was eventually revealed to be a marketing ploy. Robert Reynolds has been [[retcon]]ned into having existed inside the [[Marvel Universe]] since its creation, but the public forgot about him when it was revealed his subconscious creates a deadly counterpart, the Void. His popularity not diminished, he became a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and has been the subject of a several other limited series.

Robert "Bob" Reynolds is said to have the power of a million exploding suns. And his power is not limited to any one capability, nor to only his conscious mind. His powers are also said to be virtually limitless as seen in the [[Dark Avengers]] when he is killed by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] and then somehow rematerializes in front of the Avengers team back at their HQ. It is also mentioned in the Dark Avengers issues that the Sentry no longer requires most human necessities. He can super-heat his entire body, sterilizing it so he doesn't need to shower, and his digestive system also produces enough nutrients that he doesn't require food or drink. In ''Siege'' #2 he is shown to be strong enough to kill the War god [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]. He has flown to the Sun within minutes and survived its heat. Apparently he got his powers from an enhanced version of the Super-Soldier Serum that created Captain America. In Siege #4 he is killed by a lightning strike from Thor after the Void is fully released. Thor then wraps his remains in a cape and disposes of them in the Sun.

==Sentry (Val, the Galadorian)==
[[Image:Sentry4.jpg|thumb|{{Descript-inner-art|Spaceknights||1|Oct, 2000}}Art by [[Chris Batista]] and Chip Wallace.]]
'''Val''', first appeared in ''[[Spaceknights]]'' #1 (October, 2000) and was created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Chris Batista]].  He is a defender Spaceknight and is a warrant officer of the flagship of the Galadorian army.  He was wounded during an assault by the Trionians, who killed the ''Prime Director'', the first man of the Galadorian nation and its fleet sent on a mission to stop ethnic cleansing in their Universe.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Sentry===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s private version of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is called Sentry.  It is used for detailed imaging within the Solar System and was the first to detect [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] when it appeared over the Great Red Spot of [[Jupiter]].

During the second ''Sentry'' mini-series, when the Sentry begins to tell his origin, a false comic-book cover appears that reads ''Ultimate Sentry'', which shows the Robert Reynolds version of the Sentry. This false cover also states that it was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Mark Bagley]], a reference to their ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' series.

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombie Sentry appears in the "Crossover" story arc of ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]''. This Sentry is the source of the infection in ''[[Marvel Zombies]]''. He is never called by name, and is only identifiable by his costume. Other aspects of his appearance are more reminiscent of [[Superman]] including short, spitcurled hair rather than the [[Earth-616]] Sentry's long hair. The zombie Sentry is also missing a patch of his uniform roughly in the shape and location of Superman's "S" shield due to Ash shooting him in the first issue of the prequel miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]''. Originally, the source of the infection was intended to be a zombie version of Superman, hence the similarities. However, due to copyright issues, trademarked names and images such as Superman's logo had to be omitted. Some reprints of ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' have altered artwork to remove these similarities.

The zombie Sentry isn't seen again after infecting the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] shortly after his arrival. His fate is not revealed.

In ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', it is revealed that Sentry from Earth-Z is the original host seen in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #21. After being bitten by a contaminated Hulk, the Earth-Z Sentry is trapped by Giant-Man in order to power up the Multidimensional Device owned by Uatu (the Watcher) in the Blue Area of the Moon. After Spider-Man releases Sand-Man with nanobots that destroy all zombies present (except for the Sentry himself), Uatu appears and sends Sentry into the universe that was first infected, thus beginning the infection, trapping the Sentry in a time loop and thereby containing the infection to an extent.
