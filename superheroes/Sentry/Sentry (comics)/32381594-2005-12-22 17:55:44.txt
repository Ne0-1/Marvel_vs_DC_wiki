The '''Sentry''' is one of the strangest [[comic book]] superheroes to emerge in recent years. He was created by [[Paul Jenkins]] and [[Jae Lee]] for the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Knights]] line.

==Hoax ==
The Sentry was marketed with a [[hoax]]. Comic industry magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' reported that Marvel had discovered sketches by an unknown artist named Artie Rosen of a superhero created by [[Stan Lee]] immediately prior to the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Sentry miniseries was promoted as the first appearance of an unknown [[Stan Lee]] [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] hero. However, Marvel had made the whole thing up and ''Wizard'' had played along, for reasons revealed in the story.

==Sentry and the Marvel Universe ==

The miniseries established Bob Reynolds, a borderline [[alcoholic]] married man with possible [[psychosis|psychotic]] delusions, as the Sentry, a [[Superman]]-like hero who derived his powers from a special serum. The Sentry was an optimistic and socially accepted hero who stood in marked contrast to the mostly freakish nature of Marvel characters. He had connections to [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Professor X]]. However, his existence was retroactively erased by an unknown figure who tried to conceal the Sentry's identity even from himself. This was also the reason that Lee and Marvel had supposedly forgotten about the character.  The Sentry's sidekick, Billy Turner, the Scout, had also been affected by this erasure.

It was revealed that the Sentry and his archenemy the Void required each other to exist, and as one grew more powerful, so did the other. The Sentry remembered that he was the one who had erased the world's memory of him and restarted the program that would do so, defeating the Void once again. The whole story can be seen as a meta-commentary on the darkness that overwhelmed superhero comics by the mid-80s, destroying the optimism and wit of the Silver Age.

At the end of the limited series, it seemed as if the Sentry would fade away into obscurity again.

==Avenger==

However, in [[2004]], the Sentry was reintroduced by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] in the pages of ''[[Avengers_(comics)#New_Avengers|New Avengers]]''.  In the first issue, lawyers [[Daredevil (comics) |Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]] with bodyguard [[Luke Cage]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Spider-Woman |Jessica Drew]] travel to 'The Raft,' a super-maximum security annex to Rykers (not "Rikers" in Marvel) Island penitentiary designed to hold the [[Marvel Universe]]'s worst [[supervillain]]s.  Here, Murdock and Nelson are visiting the Sentry, who has been imprisoned for murdering his wife, in order to "find out what happened to him and his wife".  Soon after their arrival the supervillain [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] stages a massive jailbreak, freeing almost ninety supervillains who then attacked Murdock, Nelson, Cage and Drew, along with the newly arrived Captain America and Spider-Man.  During the ensuing melee the group is confronted by the alien [[symbiote]], [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].  Foggy Nelson, thrown into the cell containing Robert Reynolds, attempts to convince the Sentry to help them.  Without saying a word, the Sentry blasts through nine levels of the complex carrying Carnage into space, where he ripped the alien symbiote in half, possibly killing it (though there appeared to be no body inside the symbiote).

Issues of ''New Avengers'' #s 7-10 revealed the true story behind Sentry's delusions and psychopathic tendencies. It was revealed that the Sentry has powerful psychic and mental powers holding his physical powers together. This fact was then exploited by the [[Mastermind (comics) | Mastermind]], Jason Wyngarde, who was hired by a long-forgotten villain, the ''Crazed General''. The Mastermind implanted a mental virus inside the Sentry's mind which gave birth to his delusions and eventual existence of the Void, which is actually his repressed persona. This also gave the Mastermind the ability to make him sense anything he wants to. The mental virus subsequently impared his ability to remember his old life and a solution he saw was to implant his memories into the comic writer Paul Jenkins, who then drew his comics. 

Luckily for Reynolds, [[Emma Frost]] knew how the Mastermind's powers work and was able to cure him, paving way for his official inclusion to the Avengers and the installation (or appearance) of the Watchtower atop the Stark Tower.

But what the inclusion of the Sentry in the ''New Avengers'' line-up means in terms of future storylines (in regard to the events of ''The Sentry'' mini-series) remains unseen. A new 8-issue Sentry mini-series by [[Paul Jenkins]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]] was launched by Marvel in late September [[2005]], spinning out of events in [[Avengers_(comics)#New_Avengers|New Avengers]] #s 7-10.

In the wake of the Sentry's reappearance as an Avenger, copies of ''The Sentry'' #1 suddenly shot up in value in the collector's market.

== Powers and abilities ==
The Sentry's powers are derived from a serum which causes his [[molecules]] to step an instant ahead of the current timeline. Though most of his powers and their limits are still unknown, he has displayed several abilities similarly possessed by DC's [[Superman]]. Such are super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, and flight. Aside from those mentioned, he can also project energy fields, control light, and has vast psychic and mental forces mainly used for holding his physical powers together, though it is not yet mentioned whether the Sentry can use them the way [[Professor X]] and other [[psychics]] use theirs; the only psychic abilities he had displayed so far is implanting his memories inside Paul Jenkins' mind and calming the fury of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].

It may be theorized that the Sentry also has the ability to produce hard-light constructs similar to those of [[Dazzler]]'s when it was revealed that the Void is just an expression of his repressed persona, and thus his creation.

With Marvel dubbing The Sentry as the world's most powerful superhero, and with the serum causing a photosynthetic reaction to his body, completely altering his state of consciousness, it is nonetheless conceivable that Sentry's powers are limitless, and may even rival those of the [[Silver Surfer]]'s and [[Phoenix (comics) | Phoenix]]'s.

He has very similar powers to [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]] and [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], as they too were based on Superman.

== A "Superman" for Marvel? ==

The very design and powers of the Sentry are very untraditional for [[Marvel]]. DC has long been home of the "capes" and the superheroes who hold press conferences. Marvel, with its focus on New York City, has always had few caped characters, and ones whose powers always came from tragedy of some kind that haunts the hero for the rest of his career. The Sentry is different. The "Golden Guardian of Good" has been portrayed as one of the few heroes that are popular among citizens of the Marvel Universe.  This has lead to the controversal thought that the Sentry might be Marvel's newest stab at creating a "Marvelized Superman", one of mold less cynical than [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] from [[Squadron Supreme]]. This dovetails with Marvel's recent initiative to create new characters ([[Araña]], [[Scorpion (comics)#Carmilla Black|Scorpion]], [[Young Avengers]]) and revitalize broken and old concepts ([[Moon Knight]], [[Ghost Rider]]). Furthermore Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] stating upon the launch of [[Avengers (comics)#New Avengers|New Avengers]] that "the Sentry's time has come" indicates that, at least as long as Brian Bendis is a major player at Marvel, the Sentry is being nurtured into one of Marvel's first major new characters of the 21st century.

The new Sentry mini-series revealed some interesting takes on what could be considered classic Superman problems. Many Superman comic books, most notably [[Paul Dini]] and [[Alex Ross]]'s "Superman: Peace on Earth" have dealt with the quandry of the Kryptonian, for all his powers and influence, cannot be everywhere at once and cannot save everyone. 

The Sentry has adopted a solution that would likely be unthinkable in the DCU but fits the chacterization as "Marvel's Superman". Rather than decide who he should save, he has his computer, [[CLOC]], in the Watchtower, calculate probabilities and casualty estimates, telling the Sentry where to go and exactly how long. In this way the Sentry remains emotionally unattached to letting, for instance, a [[suicide bomber]] detonate himself in the Eiffel Tower while he is stopping a Nuclear Accident in Iran. Unlike Superman, who is well known to love being a hero and a role model, the Sentry, for all the love the public adornes him with, saves the world in a very stoic, almost robotic manner, moving from disaster to disaster as CLOC tells him, deriving little personal satisfaction from his work. This character trait, the separation of the importance of the heroic acts from the hero seems to be the "Marvel Flaw" of the Sentry, much as the way the issue of Power and Responsibility have dogged [[Spider-Man]] throughout his career and defending an America that is somewhat less than ideal has been [[Captain America]]'s.

The issue as to what extent the Sentry is "Marvel's Superman" continues to be a source of debate among fans and detractors of the character and [[Avengers_(comics)#New_Avengers|New Avengers]]. The Sentry has had a very limited number of actual appearances in the Marvel Universe - His original limited series, 6 issues of [[Avengers (comics)#New Avengers|New Avengers]], cameos in [[House of M]] alongside the other [[Avengers_(comics)#New_Avengers|New Avengers]] and the first issue of his new limited series. As the Sentry appears more often, a firmer ground to come to a conclusion about the debate of the amount of  "[[Superman]]" in the Sentry will likely be found. Additionally, considering the dual nature of his being, his complex psyche, and even his appearance, it is possibly more accurate to compare him to [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], or even [[Marvelman]], both of whom can also be said to have been based on Superman. The three, of course, also have very similar powers, although Sentry appears to be uncharacteristically powerful for even a Superman figure.

But as he is being written by Bendis and Jenkis, the Sentry, revived from his "missing years" is now Earth's premier hero, one of the few the citizens of the [[Marvel Universe]] do not fear.
