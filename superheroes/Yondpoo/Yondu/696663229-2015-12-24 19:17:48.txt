==Fictional character biography==
===Earth-691===
Yondu Udonta is a member of the Zatoan tribe, primitive beings native to [[Centauri IV]]. He functions as a hunter. His homeworld was the first planet to be colonized by humans that was outside Earth's solar system. Yondu is born in the late thirtieth century. Yondu's people had fled from contact with overwhelming earth colonizers who had begun arriving in 2940 A.D.

In 3006 A.D., [[Vance Astro]], an astronaut from Earth, lands on Yondu's planet with an antiquated propulsion ship. Despite realizing his mission was pointless, he performs the recon anyway. Vance encounters Yondu during the latter's trial of manhood. Yondu attacks him, but is repelled by Vance's powers. Vance keeps this secret as Yondu's action was illegal. Yondu works with Vance when the [[Badoon]], an alien race, overtakes the planet later that year. All the other Centaurians are believed to have been slaughtered. Vance and Yondu escape in his ship to fetch help but the Badoon capture them easily. The duo are taken to Earth which, by 3007 A.D., has also been conquered. When questioned, Vance pretends to be unfriendly with Yondu, calling him a stupid creature. They later escape the attentions of [[Drang]], the leader of the local Badoon forces, when Yondu changes the course of his arrow as Vance fires at him as part of an escape plan, pretending he wants to execute Yondu with his arrows, but Yondu gives a call that changes the course and distracts the Badoon. They team up with [[Charlie-27]] of the [[Jupiter]] colony and [[Martinex]] of the [[Pluto]] colony when they come out of a telepod (whose appearance was caused by Starhawk) and form the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to fight the Badoon.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 1 #18</ref>

For the next seven years, the four survivors attacked the Badoon's outposts in the solar system. In 3014 A.D., the Guardians teamed with the time-traveling [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Captain America]], and [[Sharon Carter]] to retake New York City from the Badoon forces.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #5</ref> In 3015 A.D., the Guardians time-traveled to the 20th Century and met the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #5</ref> They returned to 3015 A.D. with the Defenders and later met [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]].<ref>''Defenders'' #26-29</ref> After humanity defeated the Brotherhood of Badoon occupiers, the Sisterhood of Badoon arrived and removed the males from Earth.<ref>''Marvel Presents'' #3</ref>

They battled Taserface and the [[Stark (species)|Stark]], and defeated the Stark.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #1-4</ref> Yondu's right hand was later destroyed by Interface, and replaced by Martinex with a bionic appendage. Martinex had offered to use their transmutative technology to make him a new hand from his own DNA but Yondu had refused, believing that he should accept the bionic hand as penance for his recent faithlessness and that Anthos was telling him to accept a new philosophy.<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy #16">''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #16</ref> Yondu would later leave the team when it is revealed that a small enclave of his people have survived on Centauri IV.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #25</ref> These Kikaahe (“cave dwellers”) had escaped death at the hands of the Badoon because the walls of the cavern where they lived contained the mineral trillite (“yaka”) which blocks radio waves, thereby shielding them from sensors. Since his newfound people would not accept his bionic weapon-hand, Yondu allowed the Guardians to use their advanced medical technology to restore his flesh-and-blood hand, making his body whole once more. During their farewells, Vance apologizes for what he had thought was unacceptable treatment of Yondu during their earlier adventurers.<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy Annual #2, third story">''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #2</ref>

===Earth-616===
On this Earth, Yondu is the leader of the Ravagers, a group of Space Pirates. Yondu found [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] when the ship he piloted malfunctioned and left him stranded. The Ravagers rescued him as Peter tried to steal his ship. Peter managed to outsmart every member of the crew and even knocked out Yondu before capturing him. After he woke up, Yondu managed to set himself free from his restrains and attacked Peter and gave him a choice between letting himself be released to space without more trouble or get killed right there. Peter instead asked him if he could join his crew. Yondu wasn't sold on the idea. After he found out Peter was like him as both of them are "kids without homes," Yondu changed his mind and let him stay in the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy. Peter decided to stay and try to learn everything he could from space while he was part of the Ravagers.<ref>''Star-Lord'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Yondu possesses no superhuman physical powers, but is a natural mystic, like his entire tribe.  As a member of the [[marsupial]] alien race of the planet Centauri IV, Yondu possesses an intuitive mystical "sixth sense" perception that permits him limited empathic relationships with other lifeforms.  The higher the lifeform, the more limited is his empathic potential. Additionally, Yondu possesses an intuitive and rather mystical rapport with nature, particularly with his own world, but also with any world that still possesses natural wildlife. With this rapport, he can sense incongruous elements (foreign bodies or substances) or focus on specific elements within the whole (such as the location of a given plant). He is also sensitive to mystical beings and forces and is able to detect their presence and activities without effort. By going into a trance, Yondu is able to replenish his own inner strength by communing with natural forces.

Yondu is an above average physical specimen of his race. He has slightly more strength and endurance than the average human male. An apprentice hunter, Yondu is an expert in the use of bow and arrow. His ability to whistle with a range of four octaves aids his archery (see Weapons, below). The native Centuarian language is a system of grunts, clicks, and whistles, but Yondu has managed to master the English language, although it is painful for him to speak for too long without resting his throat. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled hunter and tracker. He has extensive knowledge of the social and religious customs of the natives of Centauri IV.

===Weapons===
Yondu uses a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} single curve bow and a quiver of arrows composed of ''yaka'', a special sound-sensitive metal found only on Centauri IV. A yaka arrow can actually change its direction (but not speed) in response to certain high-octave whistle-sounds some Centaurians can produce. It is not yet known precisely what pitch causes a yaka arrow to move in what way. Yondu is so skillful at controlling his arrows, he can cause an arrow to return to his hand or weave its way through a crowd of people without touching them. Yondu's arrows are {{convert|15|in|cm}} in length and are very flexible. He carries about 20 of them at one time. In Secret Wars (2015), Yondu utilizes his expertise in archery by shooting "drone-arrows" to give the Guardians an eye in the sky.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Yondu's right hand was replaced for a time by a bionic device called a weapons concealment appendage, a metal cup replacing his right hand.<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy #16"/> Thus, he could no longer practice archery nor perform functions requiring him to grasp with his right hand. The device can release from within itself a number of weapons, including a mace, a hatchet, a scythe, a barbed spear, and others; when not in use the weapons are concealed within the appendage at a reduced sized, until enlarged by Pym particles. Later, after discovering that some of his people had survived on Centauri IV and realizing that they would not accept his bionic weapon-hand, Yondu asked the Guardians to use their advanced technology to transform it into a duplicate of his original hand, and they did so.<ref name="Guardians of the Galaxy Annual #2, third story"/>

Responsible for [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]]'s kidnapping, a job contracted by Quill's father, Yondu decides to keep the boy and raise him. Yondu initially chases after Quill after he took an orb-like artifact for himself instead of turning it over to the Ravagers, placing a bounty on Quill's head. After eventually capturing Quill and [[Gamora]], Yondu is persuaded to aid the Guardians in stopping [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] from destroying Xandar with the promise of claiming the [[Infinity Gem|Infinity Stone]] that was hidden inside the orb. But after Yondu claims the orb from Quill and departs, he later learns that Quill gave him a fake that holds a [[Troll doll]] to add to his collection of small figurines, much to his amusement.
