'''The Champion''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is one of the [[alien]] [[Elders of the Universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]] Annual'' #2.

He is an [[immortality|immortal]] who keeps himself busy by fighting assorted [[superhero]]es, including [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] and [[The Incredible Hulk]].  Although he wishes to prove himself the greatest warrior in the universe, he does so fairly.  For example, in his first appearance, he fought the Thing and defeated him, but the Thing would not surrender; when forced to choose between killing his defeated opponent or yielding, the Champion yielded.

The Champion later came into possession of the Power Gem (one of the [[Infinity Gems]]); [[Thanos]] tricked the Champion into giving him the gem during the ''[[Thanos Quest]]''.
