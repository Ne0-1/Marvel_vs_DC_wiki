'''The Champion''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is not necessarily a villain but has played the role in the past through his impetuous and arrogant actions. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]] Annual'' #2.
==Character biography==
The Champion is one of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Elders of the Universe]]. He is an [[immortality|immortal]] who keeps himself busy by fighting assorted [[superhero]]es, including [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]], [[The Incredible Hulk]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Thor (comics)|Thor]], and [[Wonder Man]].  Although he wishes to prove himself the greatest warrior in the universe, he does so fairly.  For example, in his first appearance, he fought the Thing and defeated him with ease, but the Thing would not surrender; when forced to choose between killing his defeated opponent or yielding, the Champion yielded.

The Champion later came into possession of the Power Gem (one of the [[Infinity Gems]]); [[Thanos]] tricked the Champion into giving him the gem during the ''[[Thanos Quest]]''.

==Powers and abilities==
The Champion controls an energy source referred to as the Power Primordial.  This energy is apparently residual energy that is left over from the Big Bang itself.  The Champion has channeled this energy force into the development of his physical form.

While exercising, the bodies of humans taps into electro-chemical energies found in their molecular structure.  The Champion's body, however, taps into cosmic nuclear energy during exercise.  As a result, the Champion possesses virtually limitless physical strength, the limits of which aren't known.  However, he once destroyed an entire planet with the force generated by a single punch after jumping several thousand feet into the air.  Hence, his strength vastly exceeds the Class 100 level, being able to lift in excess of 100 tons.  The Champion's physical strength is only determined by the amount of cosmic force that his body can contain.  

Aside from his vast strength, his body does not tire from physical exertion, since his musculature generates no lactic acids.  The Champion is not limited by the need for food, drink, or sleep.  The Power Primordial is all that is required to sustain him.  

The Champion's body is virtually invulnerable against all forms of conventional injury.  His body is capable of resisting penetration wounds, extreme temperatures of heat or cold, corrosives, etc. Only an injury that resulted in the dispertion of a great majority of his bodily molecules could, potentially cause him life threatning injury. The Champion's body is functionally immortal and he is immune to the effects of aging and is immune to all diseases and infections.  The Champion can survive indefinitely and unaided in the vacuum of space.  As he becomes angry, he subconsciously draws in further amounts of energy from his surroundings, increasing his abilities even further, most notably his physical strength.  

Having channeled all of the cosmic energy at his command to transform his body into a practically perfect fighting machine, the Champion isn't able to direct the energy into force-blasts, unlike most of the other Elders.

Although being nearly as old as the universe itself, the Champion is not as intelligent as the other Elders of the Universe, partially due to the fact that most of the other Elders have chosen to devote at least some of their energies to the development of their minds as well as their physical bodies, his experience and knowledge could still be considered well beyond that of an average human.  However, when it comes to physical combat, his knowledge and expertise is unmatched. He is as formidable at hand to hand combat as a being could be and is a master of every fighting style that exists across the Universe.

When not "jobbering" to the heroes of Marvel, Champion is nearly undefeatable in hand to hand combat.

==Limitations==

The Champion possesses very strong psychological inhibitions against killing.  In all of his tens of thousands of bouts, he has never killed an opponent.  During a battle with the Thing, the Champion had beaten him within an inch of his life.  The Thing would not submit and, as a result, the Champion submitted, realizing he would have to kill the Thing in order to win.

The Power Primordial is channeled through the Elders of the Universe and sustains them only through their very desire and will to continue to exist in persuing their various interests.  The Champion's interests, of course, being fighting, training to fight, and seeking opponents to fight.  If the Champion were to grow disinterested in his pursuits and chose not to continue them, he could potentially die as a result, although since Death decreed no Elder could ever enter her realm, this may no longer be true.
