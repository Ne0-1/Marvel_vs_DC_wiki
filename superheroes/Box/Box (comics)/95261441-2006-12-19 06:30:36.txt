'''Box (Roger Bochs)''' is a [[superhero]] from [[Canada]]. He was featured in [[Marvel Comics]] publications, notably [[Alpha Flight]].

==Fictional history==
'''Roger Bochs''' was born in [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan]]. He was a brilliant engineer and mechanic, who lost both his legs. He created a remote-controlled robot which he called Box as a play on his own name. [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]] saw Bochs' potential. He helped him with the construction of Box and recruited Bochs' into [[Gamma Flight]], a training program for the Canadian superhero group [[Alpha Flight]], which was led by Hudson as [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]]. Bochs quickly graduated to [[Beta Flight]], a group for more advanced superhero trainess, but the Canadian government severed its links with Alpha Flight shortly afterwards and Beta Flight and Gamma Flight were cancelled. Some members of Beta Flight joined Alpha Flight, while most Gamma Flight-members were recruited by Jerome Jaxon, an old enemy of Hudson, to join [[Omega Flight]], a criminal organisation. Bochs was approached as well and joined Omega Flight, but with the intention to destroy it from within. When Jaxon discovered this, he took Box's controlling helmet and had the robot attack Guardian. During the battle Guardian managed to damage Box and the feedback killed Jaxon, but the damage sustained during the battle caused Guardian's suit to explode later.

Bochs returned to work on Box, but felt partly responsible for Guardian's death. Another friend of Guardian, [[Madison Jeffries]] met up with Bochs. Jeffries had the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] ability to shape metal, plastic and glass with his mind. Together they vastly improved upon the original Box design. Now the controller no longer wore a helmet, but physically merged with stronger and bigger Box. Bochs wanted to use Box to hunt down [[Delphine Courtney]], an android working for Jaxon and the leader of Omega Flight for its part in Hudson's death, but Box was needed elsewhere: Walter Langowksi alias [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]'s body had been taken over by the Great Beast [[Tanaraq]] and [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] was forced to destroy the body. Alpha Flight managed to save the his soul and projected it into the armor. Bochs tried to find a new body for him, but failed and Langowski's soul left Box. Bochs controlled Box once again and joined Alpha Flight as an official member. [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] expressed a romantic interest in Bochs, who returned her affection, but Aurora's fickle nature caused him much stress. 

During one mission underwater, Bochs emerged too fast while merged with Box and was suffering from [[Decompression sickness]]. He was unable to leave Box and started to panic that he could never touch Aurora again. Jeffries' brother Lionel alias [[Scramble (comics)|Scramble]], who could shape flesh and bone with his mind, not only separated and healed Bochs from his decompression sickness, he also restored Bochs' legs and gave him an athlete's body. Lionel didn't tell Bochs though that he had used dead human bodies as material for Bochs' legs and new body. During this time, Langowski's soul briefly took over Box again before settling down in the body of the recently deceased Snowbird. Langowski had been Aurora's lover before Bochs and she left Bochs for him again. Bochs was bitter (though he had some amusement when he found out that Langowksi couldn't use Snowbird's shapeshifting to turn into a male). Feeling betrayed by Aurora and with his legs starting to decompose, Bochs went insane. Madison Jeffries took over Box to prevent the amount of damage Bochs could do, but this only increased the sense of betrayel that Bochs felt. 

Bochs left Alpha Flight and went to Lionel Jeffries, hoping that he could restore his legs again. Lionel, who also turned out to be insane, merged with Bochs and they formed Omega, who combined Lionel's powers with Bochs' genius. Madison Jeffries in Box fought Omega and during the fight Bochs personality came to its senses again and started to rebel against Lionel. In the end, Madison was forced to kill Omega, including Bochs.

==Powers and abilities==
The original Box was a robot, which was controlled by human, wearing a special helmet. The upgraded version of Box is a unique construct: it can't operate on its own and its controller doesn't wear it, but has to [[phasing (ability)|phase]] into the Box and merge with it. The controller feels a psychic bond with Box and can feel the damage done to Box as pain. If a person remains merged with Box for too long, he may be bonded to the armor permanently. 
Box has superhuman strength (which was increased with every improvement Roger Bochs and Madison Jeffries made on the armor) and durability. The improved Box also had the ability to fly and had a wide array of sensors and detecting equipment.

==Other users of Box==
* [[Jerome Jaxon]], who stole the controlling helmet of the original Box from Bochs.
