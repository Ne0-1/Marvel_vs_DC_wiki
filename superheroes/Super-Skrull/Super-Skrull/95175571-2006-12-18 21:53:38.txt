The '''Super-Skrull (Kl'rt)''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. The Super-Skrull's first appearance was in ''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1, #18 (September 1963).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===

'''Kl'rt''' - more commonly known as the Super-Skrull - hails from the Skrull homeworld of Tarnax IV, which has since been destroyed by [[Galactus]]. The Skrull Emperor Dorrek wanted revenge against the [[Fantastic Four]], who thwarted the Empire's attempt to invade Earth. Dorrek handpicked the warrior Kl'rt to be the instrument of his revenge: he was artificially augmented and given the combined abilities of the Fantastic Four. Kl'rt's power levels, however, exceeded the originals - he was stronger than [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]]; had superior flight and greater pyrokinetic ability than the [[Human Torch]]; exercised better control of invisibility and energiakinesis than [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]]; and maintained an ability to stretch beyond that of [[Mr. Fantastic]]. The newly-named "Super-Skrull" also retained his innate Skrullian shapeshifting abilities and strong hypnotic skills. He was then dispatched to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four and pave the way for a renewed invasion by the Skrull Empire.

===Against the heroes===

During their first encounter, the Super-Skrull keeps the Fantastic Four at bay with his superior powers.  However, [[Mr. Fantastic]] correctly guesses that Kl'rt's powers are augmented by an energy beam directed from the Skrull homeworld.  Blocking the beam deprives Kl'rt of his new powers and he is quickly defeated, returning to the Skrull homeworld in shame. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1, #18</ref> He is, however, sent back to Earth time and again, and battles other heroes such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]; <ref>''Thor'' Vol. 1, #142</ref> [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]; <ref>''Captain Marvel'' Vol. 1, #2 - 3</ref> [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ms. Marvel]]. <ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' Vol. 1, #62</ref> The last encounter leaves Kl'rt trapped in the [[Van Allen]] radiation belt.

Years later a Canadian research team accidentally pulls Kl'rt back from deep space, and he promptly slaughters the entire group, with the exception of physicist superhero [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]. Kl'rt also discovers that the time in the radiation belt has given him [[cancer]]. Sasquatch is initially defeated by the Super-Skrull, but eventually manages to trick him, converting the Super-Skrull into a stream of dissociated particles and transmitting him back into deep space. <ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1, #9 - 10</ref> The Super-Skrull is later freed by the [[Silver Surfer]], and discovers that the cancer has regressed. This is apparently caused by a "chronal anomaly" in the area of space Kl'rt occupied, which reverted his cellular makeup to a healthy, pre-cancerous state. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 1, #25 - 31</ref>

At some point during Kl'rt's imprisonment in the Van Allen belts, he is freed by the sorcerer Master Khan and used against the hero [[Iron Fist]]. Khan brainwashes the Super-Skrull into believing that he is a twelve-year-old human boy named Bobby Wright, who gains both superhuman powers and a terminal disease from exposure to an alien spore.  As "Bobby", he uses his powers to assume an adult superhuman identity - Captain Hero - and ingratiate himself with Iron Fist and his crimefighting partner, [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]. A misuse of powers by Captain Hero apparently leaves Iron Fist dead (later revealed to be doppleganger), followed by what appears to be the disintegration of Captain Hero (with Khan thinking Iron Fist dead the Super-Skrull actually returns to disembodiment in the Van Allen belts).

Kl'rt's imprisonment in space also had another beneficial effect: it shielded him from the effects of Zabyk's Disaster, in which all Skrulls lost their shapeshifting abilities. <ref> ''Avengers'' Vol. 1, Annual #14</ref> Kl'rt later joins forces with S'Byll, a claimant to the Skrull Throne, and she is able to use him as a genetic template to restore the shape-shifting abilities of the Skrulls. S'Byll becomes the Empress of the Skrull Empire shortly thereafter, and Kl'rt is lauded as the savior of Skrull society. When the Empire subsequently falls into a disarray, Kl'rt goes into hiding on Earth and later attacks the [[Fantastic Four]]. After a brutal battle, the Super-Skrull is captured and imprisoned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in the superhuman prison, the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. 

Kl'rt later escapes imprisonment and renews contact with the Skrull Empire.  He then seeks to take [[Young Avengers]] member [[Hulkling]] into protective custody due to his Skrullian heritage on his mother's side (as the son of the deceased [[Princess Anelle]]). In a tactical masterstroke, the Super-Skrull impersonates a willing Hulkling (who wishes to stay on Earth) and returns to space, able to spy on both the Skrulls and the Kree, who also have a stake in Hulkling's mixed parentage (given that Hulking is also the son of Kree hero [[Mar-Vell]]. <ref>''Young Avengers'' Vol. 1, #9 - 12</ref>

===Annihilation===

{{spoiler}}
In the ''Annihilation: Super-Skrull'' mini-series, Kl'rt attempts to stop the destructive wave before it reaches the Skrull homeworld.  After nearly being overwhelmed by the forces of [[Annihilus]], he sacrifices himself by destroying the ''Harvester of Sorrow'' -  the enormous organic warship that destroyed hundreds of Skrull worlds and wreaked havoc throughout the universe. Kl'rt's body is later recovered and mysteriously revived. <ref>''Annihilation'' #3 (2006)</ref>

It has also been stated that the Super-Skrull will return in a new four-issue limited series titled ''Super Skrull: Armada'', to be written by [[Javier Grillo-Marxuach]]. <ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/JoeMonday_2.html stated]</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

The Super-Skrull has a  version of the Fantastic Four's superhuman abilities at the levels the team possessed when they began their careers. If the current Skrull ruler permits, a satellite can send an augmentation beam that ampliflies the Super-Skrull's abilities beyond the Fantastic Four's current levels. Kl'rt also possesses the Skrull's innate racial ability to shape-shift and the unique power of hypnosis. He is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and was extensively trained in warfare by the Skrull Empire. The Super-Skrull also has knowledge of and access to technology centuries ahead of conventional Earth science.
