The '''Super-Skrull''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].  He is primarily used as an enemy of the [[Fantastic Four]]. His first appearance was in ''Fantastic Four'' (Vol.1) #18 (September, [[1963]]). 

==Character biography==
Kl'rt, more widely known as Super-Skrull, is an extraterrestrial from planet Tarnax IV (now destroyed), in the Tarnax Solar system in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. He is a member of the [[Skrulls]], a race of space-faring alien conquerors with technology centuries (if not eons) ahead of conventional Earth science. He was created (or augmented) by the Skrull Emperor Dorrek to avenge the Skrull Empire from the [[Fantastic Four]], who had thwarted its attempt to invade the Earth. 

Thanks to his prowess as a warrior, he was selected by the Emperor and artificially bestowed with replicas of the Fantastic Four's superhuman abilities: immense strength and an impervious rock-like shell which he could materialize on any part of his body (similar to [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]]), pyrokinesis, flight, and spontaneous immolation (similar to [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Johnny Storm]]), invisibility (similar to [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]]), and a stretchy elastic rubbery consistency (similar to [[Reed Richards]]). He also retained his innate Skrullian shapeshifting abilities. These abilities proved to be insufficient for defeating the Fantastic Four; nevertheless, he confronted them and other Earth superheroes on multiple occasions.

Several years later, Kl'rt developed [[cancer]]. Maddened with pain, he attacked the Canadian physicist superhero [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], who converted him into a stream of dissociated particles and transmitted him into Earth's [[van Allen belt]]s. Peculiarly, when he was subsequently freed by the [[Silver Surfer]], the cancer had vanished. This was caused by a "chronal anomaly" in the van Allen belt, which regressed the pattern of Kl'rt's body to a time before he had been exposed to Skrull carcinogens.

More importantly, his imprisonment in the van Allen belt had shielded Kl'rt from the effects of '''Zabyk's Disaster''', in which all Skrulls everywhere lost their shapeshifting abilities. He joined forces with '''S'Byll''', a claimant to the Skrull Throne, and she was able to use him as a template to restore her own abilities, and to restore the abilities of others. S'Byll became the Empress of the Skrull Empire shortly thereafter, and Kl'rt was lauded as the savior of Skrull society.

Curiously, since then, a Skrull named Xavin from Tarnax VII has become active, claiming to be 'a Super-Skrull'. It follows that the Super-Skrulls are some sort of elite warrior class, similar to the [[Green Lantern Corps]] or or the [[Ronan the Accuser#Kree Public Accusers|Kree Public Accusers]].

==The Skrullian Skymaster==

In the Squadron Supreme mini-series, it was revealed that one of the founding members of that alternate Earth's premier team was himself a Skrull who had come into contact with astronaut Joseph Ledger, known better as [[Doctor Spectrum]].  In gratitude for being saved from drifting aimlessly through space, the Skrull gave Ledger the power prism giving him his powers.  Upon arriving on Earth, the alien joined Spectrum and other superheroes to form the Squadron.  Shortly after the team was founded, the Skrull mentioned that he was contructing a new ship to transport him back to his homeworld.

In the Squadron Supreme's second graphic novel, New World Order, it was revealed that in fact he never was able to leave Earth and instead spent several years living under a covert identity in order to assimilate into humanity.  At the request of his former teammates, he rejoined the Squadron (which had returned from Marvel Earth after an extended absence) to combat the new dictatorship which had taken control of the world.

During this tale, it was revealed that this Skrull has the same abilities as Kl'rt from [[Earth-616]], making him in fact the Super-Skrull of Earth-Squadron.

==Powers and abilities==
The Super-Skrull has replicas of the Fantastic Four's superhuman abilities at a higher levels. Therefore, his strength is able to lift over 85 tons the Thing is currently capable of lifting (over the years, the Thing has grown considerably stronger since his initial exposure to the cosmic rays). He also has the abilities of flight, pyrokinesis, invisibility, the ability to make his body stretch with elastic plasticity, and the ability to erect an invisible force field around himself. By combining the powers of The Thing and The Human Torch in his hands he can punch with the force and power that mimics that of [[Iron Fist]].

He also has the Skrull's racial ability to shape-shift and also has the unique power of hypnosis.

Aside from this, the Super-Skrull is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant extensively trained in warfare by the Skrull Empire. He also has knowledge of technology centuries ahead of conventional science, though it's worth noting that despite this knowledge and an above average intelligence, he is not a scientist or a technological genius â€“ he simply comes from a far more advanced culture.
