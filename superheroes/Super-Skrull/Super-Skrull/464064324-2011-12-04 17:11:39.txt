The '''Super-Skrull''' ('''Kl'rt''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}
The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #18 (Sept. 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Kl'rt''' - more commonly known as the Super-Skrull - hails from the [[Skrull]] capital world of Tarnax IV (in the Tarnax System in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]) which has since been destroyed by [[Galactus]]. The Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII wanted revenge against the [[Fantastic Four]], who thwarted the Empire's attempt to invade Earth. Dorrek handpicked the mighty warrior Kl'rt, who was artificially augmented and given the combined abilities of the Fantastic Four. Kl'rt's power levels, however, exceeded the originals--stronger than the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]; superior flight and greater pyrokinetic ability than the [[Human Torch]]; better control of invisibility and telekinesis than the [[Invisible Woman]]; and an ability to stretch beyond that of [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]]. The newly-named "Super-Skrull" also retained his innate Skrull shapeshifting abilities and strong hypnotic skills. He was then dispatched to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four and pave the way for a renewed invasion by the Skrull Empire.

During their first encounter, the Super-Skrull keeps the Fantastic Four at bay with his superior powers after landing in New York and claiming the world in the name of the Skrull Empire, finally forcing them to run away. However, Mr. Fantastic correctly guesses that Kl'rt's powers are augmented by an energy beam directed from the Skrull home world after he detects it. He then challenges the Super-Skrull to a fight on the uninhabitated Crater Isle using a floating radio-controlled Mike{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}. Blocking the beam with a device the Invisible Girl places on him while the rest of the members distract him and are hypnotized by him, deprives Kl'rt of his new powers and he is quickly defeated. He is imprisoned in a crater by the Human Torch while pursuing the Invisible Girl, and was tripped up by her.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #18 (Sep. 1963)</ref> He returns in the guise of the Invincible Man, after the Skrulls restored his powers, to fight the Fantastic Four. He broke out of his prison, travelled to New York, and kidnapped [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]]'s jailed father, Franklin Storm, pretending he was Storm so the Fantastic Four were less willing to fight him. However the Fantastic Four are finally able to realize his deception. Finally he is returned to his home world in exchange for Storm, who then dies due to a bomb placed on him by a Skrull in a last attempt to kill the Four, although Storm turns downwards so his body absorbs the blast.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #32</ref> The Super-Skrull was also among the villains summoned by [[Doctor Doom]] to attack [[Mister Fantastic|Reed]] and Sue at their wedding, though Mister Fantastic used a machine to remove all the villain's memories of it.<ref>''Fantastic four Annual'' #3</ref> He is sent back to Earth time and again, and battles other heroes such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #142 (Jul. 1967)</ref> and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #2 - 3 (Jun. - Jul. 1968)</ref> The Super-Skrull also acts as the Empire's agent on Earth during the [[Kree-Skrull War]], and manages to temporarily disband the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and kidnap Mar-Vell and the Avenger siblings the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>''Avengers'' #89 - 97 (Jun. 1971 - Mar. 1972)</ref> With the war ending in a truce, the disgraced Super Skrull later sides with the Titan [[Thanos]] and alongside Skragg aids Thanos in his quest for the [[Cosmic Cube]]. The Super-Skrull attempts to capture [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] for Thanos, but winds up fighting Mar-Vell and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. The hero Mar-Vell, however, defeats both the Super-Skrull and eventually Thanos.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #25 - 33 (Nov. 1970 - Apr. 1971)</ref> After a skirmish with [[Spider-Man]], the Human Torch, and [[Ms. Marvel]], Kl'rt becomes trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #62 (Oct. 1977)</ref>

Years later a Canadian research team accidentally pulls Kl'rt back from deep space, and he promptly slaughters the entire group, with the exception of physicist superhero [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]. Kl'rt also discovers that the time in the radiation belt has given him [[cancer]]. Sasquatch is initially defeated by the Super-Skrull, but eventually manages to trick him, converting the Super-Skrull into a stream of dissociated particles and transmitting him back into deep space.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #9 - 10 (Apr. - May 1984)</ref> The Super-Skrull is later freed by the [[Silver Surfer]], and discovers that his cancer has gone into remission. This is apparently caused by a "chronal anomaly" in the area of space Kl'rt occupied, which reverted his cellular makeup to a healthy, pre-cancerous state.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #25 - 31 (Jul. - Dec. (last two issues in one month) 1989)</ref>

At some point during Kl'rt's imprisonment in the Van Allen belt, he is magically freed and cured of cancer by the sorcerer [[Master Khan]],<ref>revealed in ''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #25</ref> and used against the hero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Khan brainwashes the Super-Skrull into believing that he is a twelve-year-old human boy named Bobby Wright, who gains both superhuman powers and a terminal disease from exposure to an alien spore.  As "Bobby", he uses his powers to assume an adult superhuman identity - Captain Hero - and ingratiate himself with Iron Fist and his crime fighting partner, [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]. A misuse of powers by Captain Hero apparently leaves Iron Fist dead (later revealed to be doppelganger), followed by what appears to be the disintegration of Captain Hero (with Khan thinking Iron Fist dead the Super-Skrull actually returns to disembodiment in the Van Allen belt).<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #15 - 18 (Jun. - Sep. 1991)</ref>

Kl'rt's imprisonment in space also had another beneficial effect: it shielded him from the effects of Zabyk's Disaster, in which all Skrulls lost their shapeshifting abilities.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #14 (1985)</ref> Kl'rt later joins forces with S'Byll, a claimant to the Skrull Throne, and she is able to use him as a genetic template to restore the shape-shifting abilities of the Skrulls.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} S'Byll becomes the Empress of the Skrull Empire shortly thereafter, and Kl'rt is lauded as the savior of Skrull society.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} When the Empire subsequently falls into disarray, Kl'rt goes into hiding on Earth and later attacks the [[Fantastic Four]]. After a brutal battle, the Super-Skrull is captured and imprisoned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in the superhuman prison, the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Kl'rt later escapes imprisonment and renews contact with the Skrull Empire. He then seeks to take [[Young Avengers]] member [[Hulkling]] into protective custody due to his Skrullian heritage on his mother's side (as the son of the deceased [[Anelle|Princess Anelle]]). The Super-Skrull impersonates a willing Hulkling (who wishes to stay on Earth) and returns to space, able to spy on both the Skrulls and the Kree, who also have a stake in Hulkling's mixed parentage, given that Hulkling is also the son of Kree hero [[Mar-Vell]].<ref>''Young Avengers'' #9 - 12 (2005)</ref>

During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]], Kl'rt attempts to stop the destructive wave before it reaches the Skrull home world.  After nearly being overwhelmed by the forces of [[Annihilus]], he sacrifices himself by destroying the enormous organic warship '''Harvester of Sorrow'''. He also meets a [[Negative Zone]] android named Praxagora, who becomes his lover.<ref>''Annihilation: Super-Skrull'' #1-4 (2006)</ref> Kl'rt's body is later recovered and mysteriously revived.<ref>''Annihilation'' #2 (2006)</ref>

Kl'rt later teams with [[Ronan the Accuser]] to reclaim the Kree home world from a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invasion.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'': ''Wraith'' #1-4 (Jul-Oct 2007)</ref> In course of defeating the Phalanx, their leader [[Ultron]] caused the death of Praxagora.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #6</ref>

During the Skrull's [[Secret Invasion]] of Earth, Super-Skrull aids the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] against the Skrulls.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4, #16 (Oct. 2008)</ref> 

After an unexplained capture, Kl'rt is seen as a prisoner on [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #156 (Apr. 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Skrulls, Kl'rt can shapeshift, but thanks to the re-engineering he underwent at the hands of Skrull scientists, he also has a version of all the Fantastic Four's superpowers. These include a heightened physical malleability far beyond that which the Skrulls naturally possess; superhuman strength, stamina and durability; flight, heat manipulation and energy projection in the form of plasma, concussive force and anti-matter blasts; invisibility, which he can extend to his environment, and the creation of invisible force fields. These powers were initially equal to the Fantastic Four when they started out, with the Super-Skrull relying on an energy charge from his homeworld to boost his powers to a point where hecould surpass them,{{issue|date=December 2011}} but he has developed his expertise over time to a point where he can match most heroes on his own without the boost. Additionally, the Super-Skrull has a unique power of his own, the ability to control the minds of others or paralyze them by emitting a hypnotic force from his eyes.

The Super-Skrull is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant as he is an expert in all forms of armed and unarmed combat known to the Skrulls and is highly trained in the martial applications of his powers. He is an excellent tactician and has detailed knowledge of and access to technology centuries ahead of conventional Marvel Earth science. He is also a competent starship pilot and a superb impersonator.

==Other Super-Skrulls==
Kl'rt is not the only Super-Skrull serving the Skrull Empire. Here is a list of other Super-Skrulls:

* '''Criti Noll''' - A Skrull who not only possesses the powers of Henry Pym, he also possesses [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s quick reflexes, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'s super-speed, and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]'s density and mass control.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1</ref>
* '''Godkiller''' - A specially-bred female Super-Skrull that has the powers of [[Battleaxe (comics)|Battleaxe]], [[Thundra]], [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], and [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]]. She was also genetically-modified to wield [[Beta Ray Bill]]'s hammer Stormbreaker.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #2</ref>
* '''Rl'nnd''' - A Skrull who possesses the powers of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].<ref name="MM25">''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' volume 2 #25</ref><ref name="MM26">''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' volume 2 #26</ref>
* '''[[Xavin]]''' - A "Super-Skrull in training." She/he has the powers of the Fantastic Four but can only use one at a time. She/he is currently a member of the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' universe, the Super-Skrull is the Skrull Emperor and also the oldest living Skrull.

However, it is revealed that this is all part of the Skrulls' plan to take Earth's technology and use it to further their plans of conquest. Although the Super-Skrull wears a special anti-assassination suit that allows him to duplicate the powers of all superhumans in a 500-mile vicinity to protect himself, he is defeated when Ben Grimm is the last human left on Earth, only realising after Ben pointed it out to him that, since the last person on Earth no longer ''has'' any powers, he no longer has any powers to duplicate. Easily defeating the Super-Skrull, Ben takes his suit and uses it to travel back in time to the teleportation accident, allowing it to take place while sacrificing himself to save humanity.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #27-#29</ref>
