'''Doctor Psycho''' is a fictional character appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].  A villainous telepathic [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], Doctor Psycho has traditionally been presented as an adversary for [[Wonder Woman]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Doctor Psycho | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 106  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>  First introduced to comics readers in the 1940s by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]], Doctor Psycho has undergone several minor updates over the years as comics continuities have shifted and evolved.  Through this process, the character has retained several key features, such as a [[misogynist]]ic obsession with (and hatred of) beautiful women, a psychiatric instability ranging from mild paranoia to full-on schizophrenia, and a diminutive stature.  

== Background ==
The character of Doctor Psycho was created by William Moulton Marston, creator of the character Wonder Woman and author of her original adventures.  Marston, a psychologist, created Doctor Psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women.  The character of Doctor Psycho was also one of [[List of Wonder Woman enemies#Cult leaders|several villains]] created for Wonder Woman who were deceptive occultists beguiling the masses for their own self-enriching purposes.

As Wonder Woman's [[List of Wonder Woman enemies|rogues]] and [[List of Wonder Woman supporting characters|supporting cast]] were largely jettisoned during the period that Robert Kanigher wrote and edited the Wonder Woman comics, Doctor Psycho was one of the few villains to appear in the Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age adventures.  The character was also one of the few such villains to be modernized in the early issues of the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Wonder Woman comic.

== Fictional character history ==
=== Pre-Crisis ===
Doctor Psycho first appears as a colleague of the [[Duke of Deception]].  The [[Ares (DC Comics)|God of War]], enraged that women were gaining power in Earth society and potentially threatening his ability to engulf the world in war, ordered Deception to discredit women.  Deception called upon Doctor Psycho to set about eliminating women from the war effort.

Doctor Psycho was revealed in flashback to have been a medical student who was frequently humiliated by his peers.  He discovered that his fiancee Marva Jane Gray was in love with college athletic champion Ben Bradley.  Bradley removed his rival for Marva's affections by staging a robbery of $125,000 worth of radium from the college lab and hunching down in disguise so that Marva would think she saw her diminutive fiance as the culprit.

Convicted on the basis of Marva's testimony, Psycho seethed behind bars for years, planning his revenge while developing a psychopathic hatred of all women.  Upon his release, he tortured and killed Bradley, who falsely confessed that Marva was his willing accomplice.  Psycho then kidnapped and tortured Marva, hypnotically compelling her to marry him, and then subjecting her to daily occult experiments.

Learning that he could use Marva as a medium for summoning [[ectoplasm]] he could use at will to fashion and animate human forms around his own misshapen body, he created a new career for himself as an occultist and sham psychic who developed a following of millions.

At Deception's urging, he used his fame as an occultist to campaign for eliminating women from the war effort by creating an ectoplasmic form purporting to be the spirit of George Washington, claiming that women were hindering the war effort.  He also disguised himself as Colonel Darnell of military intelligence to frame female staff of military intelligence for espionage.

With the aid of Steve Trevor and the Holliday College girls, Wonder Woman disrupted his plot but was forced to let him go, unable to prove any of his crimes in a court of law.  (''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #5.)  Psycho fixated his pathological hatred of women into fantasies of revenge against Wonder Woman.

Freed from Psycho's influence, Marva joined the WAACs and helped Wonder Woman expose Nazi saboteur Stoffer, who had disguised himself as General Scott (''Sensation Comics'' #20).

Psycho was eventually imprisoned but escaped by faking his own death, kidnapping Marva and then his former secretary, Joan White, to use as mediums for his ectoplasmic power.  He attempted to court Etta Candy in a disguise, but his cover was blown by Etta's suitor Oscar Sweetgulper and he was returned to prison (''Wonder Woman'' #18).

In the Golden Age, Psycho's brother [[Ironsides (DC Comics)|Ironsides]] was a brilliant geologist who was also a villain.

Psycho eventually realized that he could use Steve Trevor as a medium.  Kidnapping Trevor, he fashioned an ectoplasmic dream of power from Trevor's [[unconscious mind]] and became the powerful [[Captain Wonder (DC Comics)|Captain Wonder]], who teamed up with the [[Silver Swan (comics)#Pre-Crisis|Silver Swan]] to destroy Wonder Woman.  His powerful form was destroyed when Trevor awakened from his slumber.

When the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] was testing heroes and villains in the run-up to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], he set up Doctor Psycho to retrieve an ectoplasmic machinery from military intelligence and to fight with several of Wonder Woman's other rogues, but they were defeated by the combined might of Wonder Woman and [[Etta Candy]], who used the ectoplasm machine to create a superpowerful version of herself patterned after Wonder Woman. (''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #323.)

===Post-Crisis===
He is a [[telepathy|telepath]] with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people's [[dream]]s.  Psycho was enlisted by [[Circe (DC Comics)|Circe]] to create disturbing dreams for Wonder Woman's close friend, [[Vanessa Kapatelis]], with the result that Wonder Woman would be forced to separate herself from her closest allies. This was part of a plot intended to leave Wonder Woman isolated and create widespread public fear of her fellow Amazons.  Psycho later helps warp Kapatelis' damaged psyche to turn her into the new [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Dr. Psycho's plans are foiled and he subsequently spends some time as a patient in a mental facillity, confined to a padded room and a straitjacket. Several members of the time-lost [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] were in telepathic range. When [[Saturn Girl]] mentally shouts for a lost member, this awakened Dr. Psycho enough for him to attack several staff members and flee. The call brought him to the Legion, whom he also attacks.

In the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries leading up to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Psycho has surfaced as a core member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Working with Talia Al Ghul, he recruits many supervillains for the Society...and is rejected and successfully rebuffed by [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]. He threatens to have Catman kill himself. The  presence of the man's loyal pack of lions convinces Psycho he might be eaten if he forces Catman to harm himself. This rejection angers him, causing much grumbling for some time afterwards. He also spends time working with Deathstroke in order to capture one of the [[Marvel Family]] of superheroes. Other members of the Society realize that Psycho is trying to mentally influence them. Unaffected, they brush it off as something to be expected.

After the events of the sixth issue of ''[[Infinite Crisis]],'' Psycho travels with [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth.  He takes control of Doomsday, and uses him to spearhead [[Battle of Metropolis|a supervillain assault on Metropolis]]. The villains lose this battle.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

====One Year Later====
====Trials of Manhunter====
After the [[52 (comics)|One Year Later]] gap, Psycho is arrested and put on trial with [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] (Manhunter) as his defense attorney. Following his arrest, he is abandoned by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. During the trial, he uses his mind controlling abilities to make Spencer dream of herself dressed as Wonder Woman in a scene reminiscent of a Roman Colosseum. Before the trial verdict could be revealed, his powers are returned to him as a result of his ties to the Society who had constructed the machine that was blocking them. He uses his telepathy to hold the people in courtroom hostage.

This forces Spencer to try and put on her uniform but she instead reveals herself to Doctor Psycho as [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. Psycho then makes Kate put on her suit, but drops his guard to sneak a kiss with her, resulting in him being stabbed in the stomach and head. This causes him to forget about Kate's alter-ego and lose his powers.

====Secret Six====
Doctor Psycho has lately been shown still in a position of authority with the Society in the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] mini-series. He has been working with former enemy [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] for [[Vandal Savage]] and hiring various villains to put out hits on other Secret Six members. In the final issue of ''Secret Six'' (December, 2006), he is stabbed repeatedly and seriously injured by the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]].

====Return of Wonder Woman====
He has recently resurfaced with his powers restored and amplified by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] in the current [[Wonder Woman]] series. He is assisting [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Giganta]].

On the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Doctor Psycho as a member of the latest [[Injustice League]].

====Final Crisis====
[[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was sent to the DMA (Department of Metahuman Affairs) Headquarters to retrieve Doctor Psycho who is held captive in there.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 3 #27</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Psycho is a skilled telepath, and uses psionic powers to traumatize and terrify those who stand in his way. In his [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] appearances, he was a [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] who used his victims to draw [[ectoplasm (parapsychology)|ectoplasm]] into the physical world, which he shaped into various beings and disguises.<ref name="dc-ency"/>
