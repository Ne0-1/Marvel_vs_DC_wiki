'''Doctor Psycho''' is a [[supervillain]] in [[Wonder Woman]]'s rogue's gallery.

== Character History ==

He is a [[telepath]] with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people's [[dreams]]. Introduced in [[1943]] in ''Wonder Woman'' #5 (volume 1), he was originally drawn as an archetypical [[mad scientist]] with a large head and wild black hair. In recent depictions, he has kept the hair, but is better described as a [[little person]] in dress clothes.

In the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries leading up to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Psycho has surfaced as a core member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].  He may be the organization's biggest talker.

After the events of the sixth issue of ''[[Infinite Crisis]],'' Psycho travelled with [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth.  He then took control of Doomsday, and used him to spearhead [[Battle of Metropolis|a supervillain assault on Metropolis]].

Psycho is a rather fitting foe for Wonder Woman, as he is incredibly sexist, and holds a misogynistic view of women due to ridicule as a child. After hypnotizing a woman into marrying him, he discovered his ability to use [[ectoplasm]] as a disguise, which he would often use against Wonder Woman. Most recently, Psycho no longer needs a medium to work through.

===[[One Year Later]]===

==== Trials of Manhunter ====
After the [[52 (comics)|One Year Later]] gap, Psycho was arrested and put on trial with [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] as his defence attorney. Following his arrest, he was abandoned by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. During the trial, he used his mind controlling abilities to make Kate Spencer dream of herself dressed as Wonder Woman in a scene reminiscent of a Roman Colloseum. Before the trial verdict could be revealed, his powers were returned to him as a result of his ties to the Society who had constructed the machine that was blocking them. As soon as his powers returned, he used them to hold everyone in the courtroom hostage. 

This forced [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] to try and put on her uniform but she instead revealed herself to Doctor Psycho as [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. Psycho then made Kate put on her suit, but dropped his guard to sneak a kiss with her, resulting in him being stabbed in the stomach and head. This caused him to forget about Kate's alter-ego and lose his powers.

==== Return of Wonder Woman ====
He has recently resurfaced with his powers restored in the current ''Wonder Woman'' series, where he has been assisting [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Giganta]].

==Powers/Abilities==

Psycho is a skilled telepath, and uses psionic powers to traumatize and terrify those who stand in his way. In his [[Pre-Crisis]] appearances, he was a [[hypnotist]] who used his victims to draw [[ectoplasm]] into the physical world, which he shaped into various beings and disguises.

==Notes==

* Doctor Psycho is, in fact, an actual doctor, unlike another supervillain known as [[Doctor Doom]].
