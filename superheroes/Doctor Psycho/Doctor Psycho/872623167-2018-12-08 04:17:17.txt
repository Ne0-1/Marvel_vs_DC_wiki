'''Doctor Psycho''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media. Traditionally presented as an adversary of [[Wonder Woman]],<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Doctor Psycho | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 106  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> he was first introduced to comics readers in the 1940s by [[Wonder Woman]] creator [[William Moulton Marston]]. He has since undergone several minor updates over the years as comics continuities have shifted and evolved. In his original appearances, Doctor Psycho demonstrated a command over the occult and was able to harness supernatural energies. Since 1987, he has been presented as a powerful telepath. Despite these changes, Doctor Psycho has consistently been portrayed as suffering from mental illness (ranging from mild obsessiveness to full-blown insanity), possessing a diminutive stature, and harboring a misogynistic hatred of women.

==Background==
The character of Doctor Psycho was created by [[William Moulton Marston]], creator of Wonder Woman and author of her original adventures. Marston, a psychologist, created Doctor Psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women. The character was partly inspired by actor [[Lon Chaney]] ("Man of a thousand faces") and partly by Marston's undergraduate advisor [[Hugo Münsterberg]], who was opposed to women's suffrage and feminism, and was into metaphysics.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Lepore | first = Jill | authorlink = Jill Lepore | title = The Last Amazon | magazine = The New Yorker | year = 2014 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/last-amazon}}</ref> Doctor Psycho was also one of [[List of Wonder Woman enemies#Cult leaders|several villains]] created for Wonder Woman who were occultists, beguiling the masses for their own self-enriching purposes.

As Wonder Woman's [[List of Wonder Woman enemies|rogues]] and [[List of Wonder Woman supporting characters|supporting cast]] were largely jettisoned during the period that Robert Kanigher wrote and edited the issues, Doctor Psycho remained one of the few villains to appear in the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden]], [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]], and [[Bronze Age of Comics|Bronze Age]] adventures. The character was also one of the few such villains to be modernized in the early issues of the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' issues.

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-''Crisis''===
Doctor Psycho first appears as a pawn of the [[Duke of Deception]]. The [[Ares (DC Comics)|God of War]], enraged that women were gaining power in Earth society and potentially threatening his ability to engulf the world in war, ordered Deception to discredit women. Deception called upon Doctor Psycho to set about eliminating women from the war effort.

Doctor Psycho was revealed in flashback to have been a medical student who was frequently humiliated by his peers. He discovered that his fiancee Marva Jane Gray was in love with college athletic champion Ben Bradley. Bradley removed him as a rival for Marva's affections by stealing $125,000 worth of radium from the college lab and hunching down in disguise so that Marva would think she saw her diminutive fiance as the culprit.

Convicted on the basis of Marva's testimony, Psycho seethed behind bars for years, planning his revenge while developing an intense hatred of all women. Upon his release, he tortured and killed Bradley, who falsely confessed that Marva was his willing accomplice. Psycho then kidnapped and tortured Marva, hypnotically compelling her to marry him, and then subjecting her to daily occult experiments.

Learning that he could use Marva as a medium for summoning ectoplasm he could use at will to fashion and animate human forms around his own misshapen body, he created a new career for himself as an occultist and sham psychic who developed a following of millions.

At Deception's urging, he used his fame as an occultist to campaign for eliminating women from the war effort by creating an ectoplasmic form purporting to be the spirit of [[George Washington]], claiming that women were hindering the war effort. He also disguised himself as Colonel Darnell of Military Intelligence to frame female staff of military intelligence for espionage.

With the aid of Steve Trevor and the Holliday College girls, Wonder Woman disrupted his plot but was forced to let him go, unable to prove any of his crimes in a court of law.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #5</ref> Doctor Psycho fixated his pathological hatred of women into fantasies of revenge against Wonder Woman.

Freed from Psycho's influence, Marva joined the WAACs and helped Wonder Woman expose Nazi saboteur Stoffer, who had disguised himself as General Scott.<ref>''Sensation Comics'' #20</ref>

Psycho was eventually imprisoned but escaped by faking his own death, kidnapping Marva and then his former secretary, Joan White, to use as mediums for his ectoplasmic power. He attempted to court Etta Candy in a disguise, but his cover was blown by Etta's suitor Oscar Sweetgulper and he was returned to prison.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #18</ref>

In the Golden Age, Psycho's brother [[Ironsides (DC Comics)|Ironsides]] was a brilliant geologist who was also a villain. Ironsides invented the Iron Giant's disguise. He did not, however, display any superpowers.

Psycho eventually realized that he could use Steve Trevor as a medium. Kidnapping Trevor, he fashioned an ectoplasmic dream of power from Trevor's [[unconscious mind]] and became the powerful [[Captain Wonder (DC Comics)|Captain Wonder]], who teamed up with the [[Silver Swan (comics)#Pre-Crisis|Silver Swan]] to destroy Wonder Woman. His powerful form was destroyed when Trevor awakened from his slumber.

When the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] was testing heroes and villains in the run-up to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], he set up Doctor Psycho to retrieve ectoplasmic machinery from military intelligence and to fight with several of Wonder Woman's other rogues, but they were defeated by the combined might of Wonder Woman and [[Etta Candy]], who used the ectoplasm machine to create a superpowered version of herself patterned after Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #323</ref>

===Post-''Crisis''===
He is a telepath with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people's dreams. Psycho was enlisted by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] to create disturbing dreams for Wonder Woman's close friend, [[Vanessa Kapatelis]], with the result that Wonder Woman would be forced to separate herself from her closest allies. This was part of a plot intended to leave Wonder Woman isolated and create widespread public fear of her fellow Amazons. Psycho later helps warp Kapatelis' damaged psyche to turn her into the new [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Dr. Psycho's plans are foiled and he subsequently spends some time as a patient in a mental facility, confined to a padded room and a straitjacket. Several members of the time-lost [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] were in telepathic range. When [[Saturn Girl]] mentally shouts for a lost member, this awakened Dr. Psycho enough for him to attack several staff members and flee. The call brought him to the Legion, whom he also attacks.

In the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries leading up to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Psycho has surfaced as a core member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Working with [[Talia al Ghul]], he recruits many supervillains for the Society, and is rejected and successfully rebuffed by [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]. He threatens to have Catman kill himself. The presence of the man's loyal pack of lions convinces Psycho that he might be eaten if he forces Catman to harm himself. This rejection angers him, causing much grumbling for some time afterwards. He also spends time working with Deathstroke in order to capture one of the [[Marvel Family]]. Other members of the Society realize that Psycho is trying to mentally influence them. Unaffected, they brush it off as something to be expected.

After the events of the 6th issue of ''[[Infinite Crisis]],'' Psycho travels with [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth.  He takes control of Doomsday, and uses him to spearhead [[Battle of Metropolis|a supervillain assault on Metropolis]]. The villains lose this battle.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

[[One Year Later]], Doctor Psycho is arrested and put on trial with [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] (Manhunter) as his defense attorney. Following his arrest, he is abandoned by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. During the trial, he uses his mind-controlling abilities to make Spencer dream of herself dressed as Wonder Woman in a scene reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum. Before the trial verdict could be revealed, his powers are returned to him as a result of his ties to the Society who had constructed the machine that was blocking them. He uses his telepathy to hold the people in the courtroom hostage.

This forces Spencer to try to put on her uniform but she instead reveals herself to Doctor Psycho as [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. Psycho then makes Kate put on her suit, but drops his guard to sneak a kiss with her, resulting in him being stabbed in the stomach and head. This causes him to forget about Kate's alter-ego and lose his powers.

Doctor Psycho has lately been shown still in a position of authority with the Society in the ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' miniseries. He has been working with former enemy [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] for [[Vandal Savage]] and hiring various villains to put out hits on other Secret Six members. In the final issue of ''Secret Six'' (December 2006), he is stabbed repeatedly and seriously injured by the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]].

He resurfaced with his powers restored and amplified by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] in the [[Wonder Woman]] series beginning in 2006. He was assisting [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Giganta]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #01</ref>

On the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Doctor Psycho as a member of the latest [[Injustice League]].

During the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was sent to the DMA (Department of Metahuman Affairs) Headquarters to retrieve Doctor Psycho, who is held captive there.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #27</ref>

===''The New 52''===
In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Doctor Psycho first appears in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]''; a conman psychic who practices [[seance]], using his telepathy to steal identities of customers in [[Manhattan]]. The purpose of this guise is to hide from the [[H.I.V.E.]], who are hunting those with telepathic abilities. He first encounters [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] after hearing about aliens in the city. His [[astral projection|astral form]] is unintentionally pulled into Superboy's mind, who is fighting [[Plasmus]].<ref>''Superboy'' #18 (May 2013)</ref>

After learning of Superboy's origin, which remains unknown to Superboy, he attempts to befriend him. The two are attacked by agents of H.I.V.E, which they defeat. They form an alliance against the organization.<ref>''Superboy'' #20 (July 2013)</ref> During their investigation, they run into a girl with psionic powers named Sarah, her powers manifest into a being called Decay; she had been previously experimented on by the H.I.V.E.<ref>''Superboy'' #21 (August 2013)</ref>

Later during the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, [[Question (comics)|Question]] gives Superman a newspaper clipping stating that Doctor Psycho was sighted in [[Khandaq]] the day when [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] was killed. This causes Superman, Question, and the Justice League to go after Doctor Psycho.<ref name="Justice League Dark #22">''Justice League Dark'' #22</ref> Superman, Question, and the others arrive in Pittsburgh to confront Doctor Psycho. Martian Manhunter looks into Doctor Psycho's mind and learns that he was sent to Kahndaq by the Secret Society, but did not do anything to control Superman's mind.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #7</ref>

During the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, Doctor Psycho is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref name="Justice League Dark #22"/> Then he appears in ''Justice League'' vol. 2 #29, where he is sent by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]], along with the [[Fearsome Five]] and [[Hector Hammond]], to fight against [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the [[Metal Men]]. He ends up being defeated by Gold.

===''DC Rebirth''===
After the events of ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Doctor Psycho's history had been altered. Using his illusions to pose as a scientist for [[A.R.G.U.S.]] named Dr. Edward Carne, Doctor Psycho was first seen after [[Silver Swan (comics)|Vanessa Kapatelis]] was defeated and brought into custody by Wonder Woman. As Doctor Carne, Psycho told Wonder Woman that when Vanessa woke from her comatose state that he would be there for her.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #40 (April 2018)</ref>

Later, Doctor Psycho was one of several powerful psychics kidnapped by [[Amanda Waller]] to hack into [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s mind.<ref>''Justice League: No Justice'' #1 (2018)</ref>

In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Doctor Psycho is among the villains that attend an underground meeting held by the [[Riddler]], where they talk about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Psycho is a skilled occultist, and uses [[psionic]] powers to traumatize and terrify those who stand in his way. In his [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] appearances, he was a hypnotist skilled in the occult who used his victims to draw ectoplasm ectoplasm into the physical world, which he shaped into various beings and disguises.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''The New 52'' continuity, Doctor Psycho possesses psychic abilities including the regular telepathy, mind control, astral projection, telekinesis, levitation, projecting destructive blasts of psionic energy and creating psionic energy constructs such as armor, although Edgar has stated that he possesses every psionic power imaginable.

He can overcome this weakness by siphoning mental energies from other individuals with psionic powers such as Superboy.
