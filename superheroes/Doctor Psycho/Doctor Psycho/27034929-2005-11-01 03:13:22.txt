'''Doctor Psycho''' is a [[supervillain]] in [[Wonder Woman]]'s rogue's gallery.  He is a [[telepath]] with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people's [[dreams]].  Introduced in [[1943]] in ''Wonder Woman'' #5 (volume 1), he was originally drawn as an archetypical [[mad scientist]] with a large head and wild black hair.  In recent depictions, he has kept the hair, but is better described as a [[little person]] in dress clothes.

In the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries leading up to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Psycho has surfaced as a core member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].  He may be the organization's biggest talker.
