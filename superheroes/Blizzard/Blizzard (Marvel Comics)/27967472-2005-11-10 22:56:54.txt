The '''Blizzard''' is the name of several [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], all of whom are primarily foes of [[Iron Man]]. The second Blizzard is currently attempting to become a superhero. 
==Blizzard I==
The first Blizzard (real name Professor Gregor Shapanka) was a scientist of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] birth who was obsessed with immortality.  Deciding that [[cryonics]] were the first step towards his goal, he entered into the employ of Stark Industries in order to find some means of financing his research.  Shapanka attempted to steal directly from Stark Industries' head, Tony Stark (Iron Man) to finance his goals.  When he was caught and fired, he then stole technology from Stark Industries to create a costume containing cold-generating devices.  

He first appeared under the codename '''Jack Frost''' in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' volume 1 #45, and adopted the codename "Blizzard" in his next appearance, ''Iron Man'' volume 1 #86.  On several occasions, he worked alongside other villains in the employ of the multimillionaire [[Justin Hammer]].  He somehow temporarily gained cold-based powers that were inherent, not technology-based, but he lost these powers at some point after a battle with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  The Blizzard was killed by the [[time travel]]er [[Iron Man 2020]] (Arno Stark, a descendant of Iron Man) in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #20.

==Blizzard II (current Blizzard)==
The second Blizzard (real name Donald "Donny" Gill) was a criminal who was given the costume of original Blizzard, or a duplicate thereof, by agents of Justin Hammer.  He first appeared in ''Iron Man'' volume 1 #223.  He was occasionally partnered with the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] and [[Blacklash]] (also known as [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]]) as the "B-Team".  

Although the replacement Iron Man (James Rhodes, later codenamed [[War Machine]]) convinced the Blizzard to leave Hammer's service and attempt to reform, he eventually returned to crime and to his old employer.  Much later, Abner Jenkins (the Beetle, now codenamed [[MACH-1 (comics)|MACH-1]]) convinced him to join his new team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He is currently trying his best to reform. Very meek for a former supervillain, he has some trouble asserting himself.

==Blizzard III==
A third Blizzard appeared only once: in the [[1992]] ''Marvel Holiday Special''.  After losing his job, he stole a Blizzard costume from the home of his friend Donny Gill, who was in prison at the time.  He made a brief and half-hearted attempt at a criminal career, but Iron Man quickly defeated him and, in the spirit of the season, offered him a legitimate job at Stark Enterprises.

==Powers and abilities==
All Blizzards had the same powers which were derived from their costume. The original costume used by all three Blizzard had the following abilities: The micro circuitry of the costume is highly advanced and enables the wearer to freeze any moisture in the air around the wearer into unusually hard ice to form various projectiles and shields. It is capable of shooting small ice missiles or bullets with sufficient force and density to cut steel. The wearer can also make metal brittle by coming into direct contact with it. The wearer is effectively shielded from sub-zero temperatures the suit generates. It can also project enough cold to lower the temperature in a room from 68 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds. However, the finite supply of water and moisture that the suit is able to take into its reserves is not sufficient enough to create giant ice bridges such as the mutant Ice-Man is capable of creating. 

The current costume used by Donny Gill has been improved upon by the members of the Thunderbolts formerly known as the [[Beetle]] and the [[Fixer]]. It can essentially emulate most of the powers originally wielded by the mutant known as [[Ice-Man]], including the spontaneous generation of Ice Bridges for extremely swift and manueverable transportation (it does not give the wearer thermal vision). The limits of this costume are not yet known.

Aside from the costume none of the Blizzards had any permanent superhuman abilities. However, the first Blizzard was an accomplished engineer and a pioneer in the field of cryonics.
