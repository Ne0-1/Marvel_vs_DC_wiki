Gregor Shapanka (also known as Jack Frost) is a Hungarian scientist obsessed with immortality, and decides that the study of [[cryonics]] is the first step towards his goal. Shapanka takes a job at [[Stark Industries]] to fund his research, and attempts to steal from Tony Stark. After being caught and fired, he creates a suit with cold-generating devices and is dubbed  "Jack Frost" by the newspapers. He tries to raid Stark Industries, but is defeated by Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #45 (Sept. 1963)</ref> 

Several years later Shapanka returns, using the alias "Blizzard". He again tries to steal from Stark Industries, and is again defeated by Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #86 - 87 (Apr. - May 1976)</ref> Shortly thereafter, Shapanka reconstructs his cold suit in prison; however, when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] uses his electrical powers to break out of the adjoining cell Shapanka is caught in the blast and the suit is fused to his body.

Donald "Donnie" Gill, born in Delaware, was a professional criminal hired by [[Justin Hammer]] (who gave him a cryogenic suit resembling the original [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]]. Since Blizzard was vaporized by Iron Man 2020, Donnie adopted the name. His first mission involved working with two other super-villains—the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] and [[Blacklash]]—to capture [[Force (comics)|Force]], who had betrayed Hammer. However, Blizzard was clumsy and annoyed his teammates with his amateurish mistakes (such as creating an ice wall blocking the path to their objective). After encasing Blacklash in ice, the trio fled as reinforcements arrived to protect Force.<ref>''Iron Man'' #223-224</ref>

The trio again tried to capture Force, who was protected by [[Iron Man]]. Although Blizzard fought better, when Force entered the fight he neutralized the villains' powers. Blizzard, Beetle, and Blacklash split up, fled and rested until their powers returned. Force found Blizzard, whose powers were ineffective against him so Blizzard fought him with bare hands. Force repelled him, blasting him through a wall. Blizzard doggedly tried to blast Force again (despite warnings), and was electrocuted. The Beetle and Blacklash abandoned Blizzard; Chemistro blamed them for their failures, and they were arrested.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Before Blizzard could be jailed, he was rescued by [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] for Hammer. His loyalty to Hammer increased, although Iron Man tried to mentor him. Hammer negotiated with Iron Man for Blizzard, forcing the latter to help him take down the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #239-240</ref> Iron Man agreed, but Blizzard refused to believe that Hammer betrayed him. After hearing a recording, Blizzard was crushed; he surrendered to Iron Man, and was saved by Chemistro and Melter.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

After solo missions against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and the [[New Warriors]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} attending the [[AIM (comics)|AIM Weapons Expo]] with several other super-villains{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and joining the largest group of the [[Masters of Evil]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Blizzard worked with a smaller team (including villains [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and daughters of [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]] and [[Batroc the Leaper]]). Their mission failed after interference from [[Agent X]] and his allies.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Blizzard attacked [[She-Hulk]] in a bar; instead of defeating him, she invited him for a drink. Drunk, he contemplated his lack of recognition. Before collapsing in a stupor, Blizzard noted that he liked She-Hulk. After reverting to her Jennifer Walters persona she collapsed, vomiting, on top of him.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #1 (2004)</ref>

With the Avengers disbanded, the Beetle (now known as [[Abner Jenkins|Mach-IV]]) decided to form a new group of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Like the original Thunderbolts, they were former villains seeking redemption for their crimes as superheroes. Gill was one of the first members invited to join by Mach-IV, and he agreed.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #1</ref> However, he lacked confidence despite his desire to help people. As a Thunderbolt Blizzard fought several enemies, including [[Fathom Five (comics)|Fathom Five]],<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #1</ref> the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #2</ref> and the [[Purple Man]].<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #12</ref>

Blizzard and fellow Thunderbolt [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]] became close friends. When Speed Demon tried to commit crimes with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], Blizzard convinced him to use his former Whizzer outfit and a tracking device. Angry with Blizzard, Speed Demon tied him upside-down and naked on a bridge.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #8</ref> Although doubting his status as a superhero and feeling hopeless, Blizzard gained strength from the others (especially [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], who insulted him and dismissed him from the group when she became its leader).{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

[[Baron Zemo]], forming a group to fight Songbird's Thunderbolts, recruited Blizzard (who spent his days in bars after his firing by Songbird). His new teammate, the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], enhanced Blizzard's abilities.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} He battled the Thunderbolts; the groups were soon assimilated, and Blizzard helped them against the [[U-Foes]] during [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103</ref> Against [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]], Blizzard proved himself to his teammates by shielding them (and Songbird).{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

In the final battle against the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], Blizzard's suit was destroyed after the Wellspring energy was released<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #108</ref> and he was pardoned for his past crimes.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #109</ref> Blizzard later appeared as an inmate at the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #156</ref>

Blizzard later aligns himself with Iron Man, [[Zeke Stane]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], and [[Living Laser]] against [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]] but is defeated by the Mandarin's forces.<ref>''Iron Man'' #526 (November 2012)</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Blizzard was seen with Whirlwind robbing banks when they are approached by Spymaster. Blizzard and Whirlwind are recruited by Spymaster to join him and his villain allies (consisting of [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] IV, [[Titanium Man]], [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], and Whiplash IV) in a plot to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower. During the briefing, Blizzard suddenly collapses.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #1</ref> When Blizzard regains consciousness, he discovers that his skin has turned white and he can generate ice on his own. Blizzard had been exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]]s unleashed upon the face of the entire Earth by [[Black Bolt]]. Being unknowingly an Inhuman descendant, Blizzard experienced Terrigenesis which causes the manifestation of his latent powers. Blizzard thought that this was his opportunity to "be part of something bigger" and decided to leave Spymaster's team. However, he and Whirlwind were brutally attacked by Spymaster and Titanium Man when they tried to leave.<ref>''Infinity: The Heist'' #2</ref>

===Randy Macklin===
Randy Macklin, an ex-criminal, fails to find work following his release from prison and uses a spare Blizzard costume he was safeguarding for his friend Donnie Gill. Macklin, however, is quickly defeated by Iron Man, who offers him a legitimate job at [[Stark Enterprises]].<ref>''Marvel Holiday Special'' (January 1994)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
All the Blizzards have similar powers, derived from their costumes. Micro-circuited cryogenic units make it possible to emit freezing rays, which lower the temperature of the surrounding air (or objects) and release ice as a projectile.

Donnie Gill's costume is upgraded by supervillains [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]. This enables even greater manipulation of cold where Gill can encase people in snow and ice, create an ice barricade or generate "ice sleds" for transport.

==Other versions==
===House of M: Masters of Evil===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, the Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Masters of Evil.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1</ref>

===Power Pack===
The Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears in ''[[Power Pack|Iron Man & Power Pack Issue #2]]'' with Speed Demon. He kidnaps Irena Crumb (daughter of millionaire Arnold Crumb) from her school and takes her to an abandoned warehouse across town, where he tortures her. Speed Demon runs in, telling him that Power Pack has found them; Power Pack bursts in, and the three fight. Blizzard sneaks up on [[Jack Power|Mass Master]] (who is trying to save Irena) and freezes him. He vaporizes, and Blizzard tries to freeze him again. He freezes the ground, causing Speed Demon to slip and smash into him (almost knocking him out). The Pack ties him up, and [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] takes his mask so she can rescue Irena from Speed Demon. Later, Blizzard and Speed Demon are arrested.<ref>''Power Pack'' #2</ref>
