== Fictional character biography ==
===Gregor Shapanka===
Gregor Shapanka is a Hungarian scientist obsessed with immortality, and decides studying [[cryonics]] is the first step towards his goal. Shapanka then joins the company Stark Industries to fund his research, and eventually attempts to steal directly from [[Tony Stark]] - secretly the hero [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]].  Shapanka is caught and fired, but not before stealing technology to create a suit containing cold-generating devices. Using the alias '''Jack Frost''' Shapanka attempts to raid Stark Industries, but is defeated by Iron Man. <ref>''Tales of Suspense'' v1. #45</ref> 

Several years later, Shapanka returns with an updated suit and using the alias '''Blizzard'''. He again attempts to steal from Stark Industries and is once again defeated by Iron Man. <ref>''Iron Man'' v1. #86 - 87</ref>
Shortly thereafter, Shapanka reconstructs his cold-suit in prison; but when Electro uses his electrical powers to break out of the adjoining cell, Shapanka is caught in the blast and the suit is fused to his body. Electro and the Blizzard then join forces to take over the Daily Bugle, but are stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. <ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' v1. #56</ref>
He briefly resumes his Jack Frost identity, and retreats to subterranea.  There, he is accidentally discovered by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who then destroys the place.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #249</ref>
Some months later criminal mastermind [[Justin Hammer]] hires the Blizzard to join an army of supervillains and battle Iron Man, who subsequently beats the Blizzard twice in a matter of days. <ref>''Iron Man'' v1, #123 - 124 + 127. Marvel Comics</ref> 

Some time later the Blizzard attempts a bank robbery but is thwarted by Spider-Man. Blizzard then mistakes the [[Iron Man 2020]] for the modern Iron Man and attempts to ambush him. The future Iron Man, however, is on an urgent mission and instantly kills the Blizzard with a repulsor blast. <ref>''Spider-Man'' Annual #20</ref>

===Donald Gill===
{{main|Blizzard (Donnie Gill)}}

===Randy Macklin===
Randall "Randy" Macklin, an ex-criminal, fails to find work following his release from prison and uses a spare Blizzard costume he was safeguarding for friend Donald Gill. Macklin, however, is quickly defeated by Iron Man, who then offers him a legitimate job at Stark Enterprises. <ref>''Marvel Holiday Special'' (1992)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
All three villains have similar powers which derive from their costumes. Micro-circuited cryogenic units make it possible to emit freezing rays which instantly lower the temperature of the surrounding air or objects and also release ice as a projectile. The current costume used by Donny Gill has been upgraded by the supervillains [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] and allows for even greater manipulation of cold, as Gill can encase people in snow and ice, create an ice barricade, or generate "ice sleds" for transport.

For a brief period of time, a power overload of Shapanka's battery pack apparently gave him the psionic ability to generate intense cold and animate ice statues without artificial aids.

Shapanka was a gifted scientist, with considerable scientific expertise and laboratory skills, with a PhD. in biochemistry and physics.

==In other media==
* In the [[1994]] [[Iron Man (TV series)|''Iron Man'' animated series]], Blizzard served as one of the minions of [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]]. He was voiced by [[Chuck McCann]].
