'''Spyne''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Cable (2nd series) #17''.

Spyne was one of the mutant members of the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. A cannibalistic carnivore, Spyne views his adversaries as a meal more than anything else.

Spyne was first seen with the Dark Riders as they hunted down the team's former member [[Foxbat]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]]. Later, Spyne was amongst those Dark Riders that hunted [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] in the Morlock tunnels and clashed with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Storm (comic)|Storm]], and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. Spyne was able to disarm Cable, but Cable defeated him with his telekinetic powers.

After clashing with Cable and his allies once more in Egypt, whereupon their leader was revealed to be Cable's son Tyler, calling himself [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]], Spyne and the Dark Riders captured Faye Livingstone, a woman who once had a romantic history with [[Mister Sinister]]. The Dark Riders then captured [[Jean Grey]] for Genesis.

After the events with Mister Sinister, Spyne took part in breaking [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] out of a Scottish dungeon and took them to their rebuilt fortress in Egypt where the villain was stripped of his adamantium in a process that killed him. When the feral X-Man [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] infiltrated their fortress, the Dark Riders captured him and put him in an Adamantium-bonding process using Cyber's leftover adamantium skin. When fellow X-Man [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] interfered with Genesis' plans for Wolverine, Spyne and the others started to beat up on Cannonball. This allowed Wolverine to break free from the bonding process, and both he and Cannonball fled to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s resurrection chamber, where the Dark Riders pursued them. 

In the ensuing battle, Spyne was killed by Wolverine just as he was prepared to attack Cannonball. Wolverine then used Spyne's severed tail to ensare and kill his fellow Dark Rider [[Deadbolt (comics)|Deadbolt]].
