'''Gloria Grant''', more commonly known as '''Glory Grant''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] supporting character of [[Spider-Man]]. She is introduced in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #140 (January 1975) as a neighbor of Peter Parker. Peter then helps her secure a position as [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s secretary at the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', replacing [[Betty Brant]].

==Fictional character biography==
When first introduced, Glory Grant is pursuing a modeling career and meets ''Daily Bugle'' photographer Peter Parker, the man known as [[Spider-Man]]. Peter had just moved in across the hall in her Lower West Side apartment building. She is revealed to Peter as an very charming person and Peter and Glory became fast friends; though a frequent visitor to his apartment, she is unaware that Peter is Spider-Man.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #163</ref> Later, when Glory was looking for work, Peter brought her to the ''Bugle'', where irascible publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] had been going through secretaries at an alarming rate since the departure of his long-time secretary [[Betty Brant]]. By this time, it seemed as if Betty might be the only person who could live up to Jameson's demanding standards while tolerating Jameson's abrasive personality. While Glory was hesitant to apply for the job, she went ahead, encouraged by Peter and city editor [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] and to everyone's surprise, Jonah took an immediate liking to her. The smart, pleasantly efficient Glory has gone on to become the longest-serving secretary in recent ''Bugle'' history, working for both Jameson and Robertson, who was later promoted to editor-in-chief.<ref>Spectacular Spider-Man #2</ref>

As a ''Bugle'' employee and occasional associate of Spider-Man, Glory has had many brushes with danger over the years; but Grant's darkest hour by far came when she fell madly in love with lycanthropic gang boss Eduardo Lobo. Alongside his brother Carlos, Eduardo was waging a gang war against the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], and he seduced Glory with the intention of using her to access the ''Bugle'' 's research files on the Kingpin. However, once he had the files, Eduardo realized he had truly fallen in love with Glory and could not bring himself to abandon her. In fact, he admitted, she was now the only thing in the world that truly mattered to him. Glory, wracked by guilt over romancing a criminal and compromising the ''Bugle'' 's files, agonized over what to do next; Peter advised her to follow her heart. When the Lobos' gang war climaxed in a chaotic battle with various rival criminals, Eduardo ended up in a death struggle with Spider-Man. During the fight, Glory picked up a fallen gun (which the Kingpin's lieutenant the Arranger had loaded with silver bullets), aimed, and fired, killing Eduardo. When Spider-Man thanked her, a grief-stricken Glory revealed that she had been aiming at Spider-Man, having followed her heart as Peter suggested.<ref>Spectacular Spider-Man #146 & 149-154/Web of Spider-Man #47-48, 51 & 55, 1989</ref>

Glory regarded Spider-Man with bitter resentment ever since then, but this did not stop him from aiding her and government agent [[Shotgun (comics)|Shotgun]] against the late [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] witch [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], who spiritually possessed Grant long enough to engineer a scheme that brought Calypso fully back from the dead.<ref>(Spider-Man Annual '97, 1997)</ref> Glory has recently reappeared as Jonah's aide after he becomes Mayor.
