'''Pipeline''' ('''Cormick Grimshaw''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #235''.

==Fictional character biography==
As a member of the [[Genosha]]n [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]], Pipeline was exempt from the mutate process that his fellow mutants were subjected to, and served his country faithfully. He participates in the raid that captures four of the X-Men's charges. This takes places on the grounds of the X-Men mansion, in Salem Center, New York, a violation of American sovereignty. One of the prisoners, Warlock, did not survive subsequent imprisonment. He also participates in a second raid on US soil, attacking an airport in an attempt to get at Rene Majcomb.

After the fall of the Genoshan government, Pipeline fought in the resulting civil war on the side of the Magistrates. According to claims he made, he lost his home and family in this war.

===Cable===
During a raid on a mutate camp, he was captured by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and telepathically forced to help. He, Cable, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], Jenny Ransome and Phillip Moreau investigated clues to a new mutate facility, eventually discovering that the otherdimensional [[Sugar Man]] was behind the mutate process. He soon changed his loyalty, agreeing to work with the rebels to bring peace to Genosha.

Later, when [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] was ceded control of the island by the United Nations, Pipeline was invited to stay and help his new ruler consolidate his power. He accepted, but only so as to ensure that his country flourishes once more.

With the genocide of the Genoshan population at the hands of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] commanded by [[Cassandra Nova]], the twin sister of [[Professor Xavier]], Pipeline's fate is unknown. It is unknown if he retained or lost his mutant powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities==
Digitize organic or inorganic matter and transmit it through electronic systems as data transmissions, teleporting the matter, and attach additional files to the packages, teleporting a person and sedating them or paralyzing them on arrival.
