'''It! The Living Colossus''' ('''Robert "Bob" O'Bryan''') is a [[fictional character]] in [[comic-book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Initially a statue animated by a hostile [[extraterrestrial]], he [[first appeared]] in the [[science-fiction]] anthology series ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #14 (Feb. 1961), in a story drawn by [[Jack Kirby]] (writer unknown). He was revived in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #21 (Dec. 1973) by writer [[Tony Isabella]] and artist [[Dick Ayers]] as the [[protagonist]] of a short-lived feature, in which he was animated by a wheelchair-using [[special-effects]] designer.

==Publication history==
It! The Living Colossus debuted in the 18-page science fiction story "I Created the Colossus" in the anthology series ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #14 (Feb. 1961), published by [[Marvel Comics]] 1950s and early 1960s forerunner, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. [[Penciler|Penciled]] by industry legend [[Jack Kirby]] and [[inker|inked]] by [[Dick Ayers]], and scripted by an uncredited writer, this "[[Atlas Comics (1950s)#Pre-superhero Marvel|Marvel pre-superhero]]" monster returned for a 13-page sequel story, "Colossus Lives Again", by the same art team, in the by-now Marvel comic ''Tales of Suspense'' #20 (Aug. 1961). The two stories were reprinted in, respectively, ''[[Monsters on the Prowl]]'' #17 (June 1972) and #25 (Sept. 1973).

The character was revived in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #21 (Dec. 1973) by writer [[Tony Isabella]] and artist [[Dick Ayers]], who both drew and [[Letterer|lettered]] the stories. The feature ran four issues, through #24 (June 1974).

Isabella said in 2001 that after the [[Theodore Sturgeon]] story "It!" in ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' #1 (Dec. 1972) had sold well, "Came the word from on high that Marvel should do a regular 'It!' series". Marvel already had an It-like swamp monster in [[Man-Thing]], so, "looking over the sales figures for recent issues of Marvel's giant monster reprint books, we discovered the issues which reprinted the 'Colossus' stories by Jack Kirby [''Monsters on the Prowl'' #17 and 25] sold much better than the other issues which had been published around the same time".<ref name=cba>''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #13, p. 100</ref>

In 2009, Isabella elaborated, saying editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]]
{{cquote|wanted to give me a series to write and knew I was a monster-movie fan. He asked for my input on our new 'It', and that's when I learned [the "Colossus" sales information]. I pitched him on the new 'It' being a continuation of those stories, though in my original pitch, the [[special effects]]-man hero of the second Colossus story had married his actress sweetheart and already started a family with her. Any member of the family would have been able to activate and control the Colossus. Roy steered me to the more dramatic premise of the hero being paralyzed.<ref>Tony Isabella interviewed in Millsted, Ian. "It! The Living Colossus", ''Back Issue'' #39 (October 2009), p. 69</ref>}}

Assessing the series, Isabella said, "It was an honor working with Dick Ayers, one of the original 'Big Four' artists of the [[Marvel Universe]]. However, I don't think Dick was at his best here. He wasn't being treated very well by Marvel and it was showing in his work".<ref name=cba />

In an unusual storytelling technique for the time, Isabella made longer stories than the budgeted 15-page tales by inserting reprint panels or pages from 1959-61 pre-superhero monster stories. "I could expand the page count of the 'It!' stories while including [[backstory]] which would have otherwise eaten up some of those new pages".<ref name=cba />

Had the series continued, Isabella said in 2009, "subsequent stories would have featured [[Goom]] and [[Googam]] ... and a team-up with [the [[superhero]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to stop an invasion of Earth by the [[Storm Giants]] of [[Norse mythology|Norse legend]]".<ref>Isabella in Millsted, p. 71</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
It, the Living Colossus was an immense 100-foot-tall stone humanoid [[statue]] constructed by Moscow sculptor Boris Petrovski to protest against the oppressive nature of the [[Soviet]] government.  It became animated initially by the mind transferral of an alien Kigor and rampaged briefly through [[Moscow]] after being attacked by the military.  When the rescue party arrived, the Kigor abandoned the Colossus and returned to its home-world, leaving It inanimate.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #14 (Feb. 1961)</ref> The statue was later transported to [[Los Angeles, California]] and reanimated by the Kigors, who used it to attack the [[U.S. Army]]. The Kigors were defeated by Hollywood [[special-effects]] designer Bob O'Bryan, a man with a physical [[disability]], and the statue was rendered inanimate.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #20 (Aug. 1961)</ref>

O'Bryan later had to use a wheelchair.  The statue was stolen by the evil Doctor Vault, who reduced It in size from {{convert|100|ft|m}} to {{convert|30|ft|m}}. It was then animated by the mind transferral of O'Bryan, and It battled Vault's minions and escaped.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #21 (Dec. 1973)</ref> It then battled Granitor and alien invaders from the planet Stonus V. Alongside [[Fin Fang Foom]], It defeated the invaders.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #22-23 (Feb. & April 1974)</ref> However, It then battled Fin Fang Foom and became controlled by the villainous Doctor Vault.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #24 (June 1974)</ref>

O'Bryan was later cured, and married Diane Cummings, living in Los Angeles. As It, he battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  The statue became controlled by Doctor Vault, and was totally destroyed in battle with the Hulk, reduced to dust.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #244 (Feb. 1980)</ref> It was rebuilt as a [[robot]],<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #169 (Early Dec. 1994)</ref> and reformed by O'Bryan under the control of Lotus Newmark. After becoming involved with [[Wonder Man]] and the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]],<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers Two]]: [[Wonder Man]] & the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'' #2-3 (both July 2000)</ref>, It later became a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

===The Initiative===
O'Bryan is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.

==Powers and abilities==
Bob O'Bryan becomes It, the Living Colossus through mind transferral into an animated stone statue, its composition altered by the alien Kigors. It has tremendous superhuman strength, as well as superhuman stamina and durability, and the ability to manipulate gravitons for flight. As a statue, it could survive underwater without air. However, It does have a vulnerability to nerve gas or knockout gas, forcing the command intelligence back into its original body. There is also an unrevealed time limit for the command intelligence to remain in the statue.

==Other versions==
[[Reed Richards]] made a duplicate of It using the "Ionic Inanimate Matter Converter". It was sent to oppose the [[Cosmic Cube]]-empowered [[Dr. Doom]].<ref>''Fantastic Four: Worldâ€™s Greatest Comic Magazine'' #12 (Jan. 2002)</ref>

Another duplicate of It, as well as a second, brown version of the creature, fought on behalf of the terrorist front organization [[H.A.T.E.]], defending the secret State 51 installation from the [[Nextwave]] squad.<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #11 (Feb. 2007)</ref>

==Other characters==
There have been other characters in the Marvel Universe known as "It". These include:
*Roger Kirk, was known as "It" (and also "The Thing That Couldn't Die"), in ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' #1.

It murdered those around it until it fell into a stream, which washed the skeleton clean. 
*An operation of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] was known as "I.T." and was run by Albert DeVoor. I.T. went under different alias on each world in an effort to ignite a nuclear war between [[Earth-616|mainstream Marvel Earth]] (as Inter-Looking Technologies), [[Earth-A]] (as Inter-Related Technocracies) and the Fifth Dimension (as Inter-Politan Thermodynamics) in order to generate power for Polemachus (see [[Arkon]]). This occurred in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #160-163.
