'''It! The Living Colossus''' ('''Robert "Bob" O’Bryan''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] who [[first appeared]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' vol. 1, #14 (Feb. 1961), in a story drawn by [[Jack Kirby]] (writer unknown). He was revived as a continuing-series star in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #21 (Dec. 1973).

==Publication history==
The Jack Kirby-drawn [[Atlas Comics (1950s)#Pre-superhero Marvel|Marvel pre-superhero]] monster was revived by writer [[Tony Isabella]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''. [[Dick Ayers]] drew and lettered the stories.

Isabella said in 2001 in ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #13, page 100, that after the [[Theodore Sturgeon]] story "It!" in ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' #1 (Dec. 1972) had sold well, "Came the word from on high that Marvel should do a regular 'It!' series." But Marvel already had Man-Thing, so, "looking over the sales figures for recent issues of Marvel's giant monster reprint books, we discovered the issues which reprinted the 'Colossus' stories by Jack Kirby  [''Monsters on the Prowl'' #17, 25] sold much better than the other issues which had been published around the same time".

Isabella, in the interview above, said, "It was an honor working with Dick Ayers, one of the original 'Big Four' artists of the [[Marvel Universe]]. However, I don't think Dick was at his best here. He wasn't being treated very well by Marvel and it was showing in his work".

In an unusual storytelling technique for the time, Isabella made longer stories than the budgeted 15-page tales by inserting reprint panels or pages from 1959-61 pre-superhero monster stories. "I could expand the page count of the 'It!' stories while including [[backstory]] which would have otherwise eaten up some of those new pages".

==Fictional character biography==
It, the Living Colossus was an immense 100-foot-tall stone humanoid [[statue]] constructed by Moscow sculptor Boris Petrovski to protest against the oppressive nature of the [[Soviet]] government.

When the rescue party arrived, the Kigor abandoned the Colossus and returned to its home-world, leaving It inanimate.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #14</ref> The statue was later transported to Los Angeles and reanimated by the Kigors, who used it to attack the U.S. army.
