'''It the Living Colossus (Robert "Bob" O’Bryan)''' is a fictional character from [[Marvel Comics]] who first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1 #14.

==Publication history==

The [[Jack Kirby]] pre-superhero monster book was revived by writer [[Tony Isabella]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''. [[Dick Ayers]] drew and lettered the stories.

Isabella said in 2001 in ''Comic Book Artist'' #13, page 100, that after the [[Ted Sturgeon]] story "It!" in ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' #1 had sold well, "Came the word from on high that Marvel should do a regular 'It!' series." But Marvel already had Man-Thing, so, "looking over the sales figures for recent issues of Marvel's giant monster reprint books, we discovered the issues which reprinted the 'Colossus' stories by Jack Kirby sold much better than the other issues which had been published around the same time."

Isabella, in the interview above, said, "It was an honor working with Dick Ayers, one of the original 'Big Four' artists of the [[Marvel Universe]]. However, I don't think Dick was at this best here. He wasn't being treated very well by Marvel and it was showing in his work."

In an unusual storytelling technique for the time, Isabella made longer stories than the budgeted 15-page tales by inserting reprint panels or pages from the classic pre-superhero monster stories. "I could expand the page count of the 'It!' stories while including back story which would have otherwise eaten up some of those new pages."

==Fictional character biography==
'''It the Living Colossus''' was an immense stone [[statue]] constructed by Boris Petrovski to protest against the oppressive nature of the [[Soviet]] government.  It became animated initially by Kigor and rampaged briefly through [[Moscow]] after being attacked by the military.  When the rescue party arrived, Kigor abandoned the Colossus which was later controlled by '''Bob O'Bryan''', a man with a physical [[disability]] who could project his consciousness into the Colossus.  Later It was reduced from 100' to 30' by the evil [[Dr. Vault]] who used took control of the Colossus and used it in battle against invaders from Stonus V.  It was eventually destroyed by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]<ref>Wonder Man Annual #2</ref> but was rebuilt as a [[robot]]<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #169</ref>, and reformed by O’Bryan under the control of [[Lotus Newmark]].  It is currently a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]’s [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.

[[Reed Richards]] made a duplicate of It using the [[Ionic Inanimate Matter Converter]].  It was sent to oppose the [[Cosmic Cube]] empowered [[Dr. Doom]]<ref>''Fantastic Four: World’s Greatest Comic Magazine'' #12</ref>

Another duplicate of It, as well as a second, brownish, version of the creature, fought on behalf of terrorist front organisaion [[H.A.T.E.]], defending the secret State 51 installation from the [[Nextwave]] squad.<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #11</ref>

==Powers==
It the Living Colossus has tremendous strength, can fly, and can command intelligence which was forced back into it’s original body by nerve gas.

==Notes==
There have been other characters known as It.  These include:
*'''Roger Kirk''', was known as '''It''' (and also '''The Thing That Couldn’t Die'''), in ''Supernatural Thrillers'' #1.  Kirk had died in [[1929]] and became a swamp creature created from the reanimated human corpse and vegetation which accumulated around his skeleton.  It murdered those around it until it fell into a stream, which washed the skeleton clean. 
*An operation of [[Roxxon]] was known as '''I.T.''' and was run by [[Albert DeVoor]].  I.T went under different alias on each world in an effort to ignite a nuclear war between [[Earth-616]] (as '''Interlocking Technologies'''), [[Earth-A]] (as '''Inter-Related Technocracies''') and the [[Fifth Dimension]] (as '''Inter-Politan Thermodynamics''') in order to generate power for [[Polemachus]].  This occurred in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #160-163. 
*In the [[House of M]], [[Ben Grimm]], the only survivor of the ill-fated space shuttle flight of Reed Richards and his crew, was captured and named '''It''' by [[Victor von Doom]] and was a member of the [[Fearsome Foursome]].  It first appeared in ''House of M: Fantastic Four'' #1
*In ''Tales to Astonish'' vol. 1 #92-93, a robot of unknown origins was called '''It the Silent One'''.  It was activated on the ocean floor and battled [[Namor]].  It was destroyed after a collision with a submarine,
