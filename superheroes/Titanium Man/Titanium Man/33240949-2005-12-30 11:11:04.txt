The '''Titanium Man''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The original Titanium Man first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #69 (September [[1965]]). He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].

==Character biography==

The original Titanium Man, Boris Bullsky, was the champion of the [[Soviet Union]] who fought [[Iron Man]], the champion of the [[United States]], in a famous battle during the [[Cold War]]. This first Titanium Man was killed in battle with [[Beta Ray Bill]] by his own allies: they were capitalist Russian expatriates who transformed him into inorganic matter when they learned that he was a Soviet agent. However, he was revived some years later by Valentin Shatalov, the sixth man to wear the [[Crimson Dynamo]] armor.

The second Titanium Man was the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] formerly known as the Gremlin, and served with the Soviet-era [[superhero]] group, the [[Soviet Super Soldiers]]. The Gremlin was killed while in combat with Iron Man when the suit's jets exploded.

A new Titanium Man (this time the suit was donned by a renegade Russian agent) returned shortly after Tony Stark (Iron Man) was appointed as the Secretary of Defense. After stowing away on Stark's rocket during a mission to intercept a comet headed towards Earth, he attempted to disrupt the mission, which would result in the comet's landing in North America. However, he was thrown off the ship during his attempts.

==Powers and abilities==
The Titanium Men used green or grey armor similar to that used by Iron Man and to that used by their sometime compatriot, the [[Crimson Dynamo]].  Neither suit of armor was as sophisticated as that used by Anthony Stark as Iron Man. In fact, the armor was rather unstable, directly resulting in the death of the second Titanium Man.

The suit of armor enabled the wearer to fly at subsonic speeds, shoot concussive force blasts from hands, increased physical strength to superhuman levels, and the armor was resistant to conventional artillery. 

Boris Bullsky, the original Titanium Man, had enhanced strength due to treatments given to him by the soviet government to augment his physiology. He was also a giant. The Gremlin, being a dwarf who seldom exercised, was weaker than most teenagers. He possessed super-human intelligence, was capable of creating advanced devices and weapons, and was an accomplished genetic engineer.

==Other media==
Titanium Man is possibly the subject of the song "Magneto and Titanium Man" by [[Wings (band)|Wings]], along with fellow Marvel villain [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].  The Crimson Dynamo is also mentioned by name in the song.
