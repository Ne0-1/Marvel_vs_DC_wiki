The '''Titanium Man''' ("''Chelovek-Titan''") is the name of two [[fictional character]]s, [[supervillains]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The original Titanium Man first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #69 (September 1965). He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Titanium Man I===
'''Boris Bullski''' was born in [[Makiivka|Makeyevka]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]. According to the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], he was a [[KGB]]-member when he was a young man, and she was his combat instructor for a time. An ambitious official of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], Boris Bullski was demoted after displeasing his superiors.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

While working as an administrator of a [[Siberia]]n [[labor camp]], he commissioned the imprisoned scientists at the camp to build a suit of armor using the lab of Anton Vanko, the creator of the original [[Crimson Dynamo]] armor. Seeking to win back the Party's favor, Bullski conceived the idea of winning a propaganda victory against the [[First World|West]] by defeating the [[United States|American]] superhero [[Iron Man]]. He assigned the scientists to create a powerful suit of [[titanium]] armor based on the Iron Man technology, though the inferior resources available to the scientists meant that the armor was twice the size of Iron Man's.  Bullski received permission to issue his challenge and Iron Man accepted, defeating Titanium Man in a battle before a worldwide television audience.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Undaunted, Bullski prepared for a rematch by having the suit redesigned and undergoing medical treatments that increased both his size and strength. Traveling to the United States, Bullski fought Iron Man in the skies above [[Washington, D.C.]] but was defeated. Withdrawing for retrieval by a Soviet submarine, he discovered that he had been abandoned on orders from [[Moscow]]. After working for the [[North Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist]] scientist Half-Face (who increased his power yet again) for a while, he returned to the service of the [[Government of the Soviet Union]], and was dispatched to the United States to retrieve the third Crimson Dynamo. Finding the Dynamo at Cord Industries, a three-way battle between Titanium Man, Crimson Dynamo, and Iron Man began, during which Titanium Man killed Janice Cord with an electronic beam. Enraged, Iron Man soundly defeated Titanium Man, and left him in the murky depths of the [[Hudson River]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After the defeat, the two disgraced Soviet agents fled to Communist-controlled Vietnam, where they joined with [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] to form the [[Titanic Three]]. Though Bullski enjoyed working as a sanctioned agent once again, he longed to return to the Soviet Union, and devised a new plan to win his superiors' favor. Adopting the alias of "The Other", he dispatched another former Soviet agent, the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], to destroy Iron Man. When the Unicorn failed, the Titanium Man went to destroy Iron Man himself, only to fail once more.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Despite his failures, Bullski was in favor with the Soviet government once more, and returned to the United States on a mission for the KGB. By threatening the parents of a Soviet defector named Sergei, he forced the man to design technologically advanced armored suits that could be transformed into small card-like objects. Posing as "the Commander", Bullski used the suits to equip members of the Green Liberation Front (G.L.F.), an organization of disaffected [[Vietnam War]] veterans who felt ignored by their country. With the suits, the G.L.F. robbed a [[New York City]] bank and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]];<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1 #357 (July 1985)</ref> though the members believed that they were simply acting as thieves, Bullski used the robberies as a cover for implanting a [[computer virus]] that would destroy American financial records, causing chaos in the [[Economic history of the United States|economy of the United States]]. [[Beta Ray Bill]] and [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] opposed the G.L.F. and the Commander, but when Sergei discovered that his parents were dead he exposed Bullski's true identity and the angry members of the G.L.F. turned on the Titanium Man. Teleporting away, he rematerialized in card form, which Sergei then simply tore and threw away.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1 #358 (August 1985)</ref>

Sometime later, the new Crimson Dynamo was sent to the United States by the Soviet government to retrieve the remnants for reintegration.<ref name="sss1nov92">''Soviet Super Soldiers'' #1 (Nov. 1992)</ref> The G.L.F. discovered the Crimson Dynamo's mission and attacked him, forcing him to seek assistance by reactivating the Titanium Man, who due to the incomplete nature of his reassembly was still missing body parts. Enraged, Bullski slaughtered the members of the G.L.F., and was only stopped when the Dynamo lured him over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and returned him to card form.<ref name="sss1nov92" /> Bullski was later restored and continued to serve as Titanium Man, as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers<ref name="sss1nov92" /> and later Remont-4, but felt increasingly despondent as the Soviet Union declined. After an attack on a Stark Enterprises factory in [[Russia]] he was believed killed while battling Tony Stark, who was wearing Crimson Dynamo armor that was being controlled by [[Colonel General]] Valentin Shatalov, a former friend of Bullski.

Sometime later, during a space mission to destroy an enormous [[asteroid]] that threatened to impact on [[Earth]], a Titanium Man, stated his name was Andy Stockwell (revealed to be an alias to Bullski), and had never had a connection with the USSR. However, moments later it was revealed he was actually a member of "The Hammer", an international network of communist [[sleeper cell]]s who wanted to destroy the United States. He was lost in space, but being relatively close to Earth, may have returned under his own power.

Now a mercenary, Bullski was by Tony Stark hired to fake an attack on Congress trying to show reasons to stop the superhuman registration act. He battled [[Spider-Man]] there and made a withdrawal after Spidey damaged his helmet with his cybernetic claws, but not without saying to a camera in Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit a planned talk which Stark used in the Congress in rejection of the SRA.

Later, the Titanium Man reappeared, this time in Russia, as a member of the rogue Soviet super-rebel group called Remont Six. He was knocked out by [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]], but was apparently not captured.<ref>''Hulk: Winter Guard''</ref>

Time later Titanium Man was seen being beaten down by [[Noh-Varr|the Protector]]. The identity of this Titanium Man or the circumstances of the battle remain undisclosed, but he is presumably Bullski, because he was wearing that version of the armor.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4 #2</ref>

===Titanium Man II===
The second Titanium Man was '''Kondrati Topolov''', the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] formerly known as '''[[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]]''',<ref>''Iron Man Manual Mark 3''</ref> and served with the Soviet-era [[superhero]] group, the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]]. The Gremlin was killed in combat with [[Iron Man]] during the first "[[Armor Wars]]" when the titanium in the suit exceeded its combustible temperature.

===Other Titanium Men===
The third Titanium Man's identity is the subject of some controversy. The first time this figure manifested itself, he attacked Stark Enterprises and Iron Man directly, apparently under orders of Stark-Fujikawa (possibly as a mercenary). While he was shown to cherish Soviet paraphernalia and newspaper clippings featuring Boris Bullski, his identity was not firmly established.

Sometime later, during a space mission to destroy an enormous [[asteroid]] that threatened to impact on [[Earth]], a Titanium Man, claiming to be this same person, stated his name was Andy Stockwell, and had never had a connection with the USSR. However, moments later it was revealed he was actually a member of "The Hammer", an international network of communist [[sleeper cell]]s who wanted to destroy the United States. He was lost in space, but being relatively close to Earth, may have returned under his own power.

In any case, ''a'' Titanium Man was contacted and hired, ostensibly through the Hammer again, to do a mercenary job for, of all people, Tony Stark in his effort to stop the [[Civil War (comics)|superhuman registration bill]].

It has been strongly suggested (outside of comicsÂ´ pages) that the third Titanium Man was indeed Boris Bullski, but against this speaks his apparent willingness to work for Tony Stark (under any set of circumstances) rather than kill him. His face was revealed to look nothing like Bullski's, and it is possible that there are multiple Titanium Men, or at least several people filling the role in turn.

Recently, the Titanium Man reappeared, this time in Russia, as a member of the rogue Soviet super-rebel group called Remont Six. He was knocked out by [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]], but was apparently not captured.<ref>Hulk: Winter Guard</ref>

In the same period, another Titanium Man was seen being beaten down by [[Noh-Varr]]. The identity of this Titanium Man or the circumstances of the battle remain undisclosed.<ref>Avengers Vol. 4 2</ref>

A Titanium Man was among the Iron Man villains recruited by [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Zeke Stane]] to assist in a plot to take down Iron Man.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513</ref>

During [[Doctor Octopus]]'s [[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|latest scheme]], Octavius contacted the Titanium Man as one of several villains to assist in his plans after two of the [[Sinister Six]] were defeated, but this backfired when the Titanium Man contacted the Black Widow to warn her about the villain's current schemes, defining himself as a Russian patriot rather than an American villain, and obeying [[Spider-Man]]'s call to rally other heroes against his foe,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #685</ref> but he was defeated by [[Mac Gargan|the Scorpion]] despite his best efforts.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Titanium Men used green armor similar to that used by [[Iron Man]] and to that used by the [[Crimson Dynamo]] (their sometime compatriot). Neither suit of armor was as sophisticated as that used by Tony Stark as Iron Man, but some of its weapons were deceptively powerful, and the first Titanium Man's physical strength seems to have been greater than that of Iron Man. He also boasted that his armor was made to last, not, like American technology, "with planned obsolescence" (although he had actually received several significant upgrades himself).

The suit of armor increases the wearer's physical strength to superhuman levels, and is in fact stronger than Iron Man. It was also able to fly at supersonic speeds (it can even reach [[escape velocity]]), shoot concussive force blasts from the hands, project constrictive force "rings", fire an electromagnetically paralytic beam from the helmet, and was resistant to conventional artillery. 

Boris Bullski, the original Titanium Man, also possessed enhanced strength due to treatments given to him by the Soviet government to augment his physiology, making him grow into an 11-foot-tall giant. The Gremlin, being a dwarf who seldom exercised, was weaker than most people, but he possessed super-human intelligence, was capable of creating advanced devices and weapons, and was an accomplished genetic engineer.

==Other versions==

===Heroes Reborn â Iron Man===
A Soviet Titanium Man, developed for the Russians by [[Victor von Doom]], proved the better of the Iron Man prototype. Later, the same individual was shown, together with the Crimson Dynamo, as a free agent working for [[HYDRA]]. This Titanium Man was physically similar to the original mainstream version.<ref>Iron Man Vol. 2 #9</ref>

===Civil War: House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, the second Titanium Man was seen as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #2</ref>

===Ultimate Titanium Man===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the Titanium Man is '''[[Howard Stark Sr.]]''' when the character was featured in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'', although parts of him resembled [[Iron Monger]] as well.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #4</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Titanium Man appeared in the Iron Man portion of ''[[The Marvel Superheroes]]'' voiced by [[Ed McNamara]].

* Titanium Man appeared in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series voiced by [[Gerard Maguire]]. In the series' first episode, he's shown as a powerful minion of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and a creation of [[MODOK]]. Titanium Man does not make more appearances during the first season. In one chapter of the second season, Titanium Man makes an alliance with Dark Aegis, but at the end he helps Iron Man and [[War Machine]], sacrificing himself in order to stop Dark Aegis.

* Titanium Man appeared in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]''. In this version, he is the armored identity of [[Justin Hammer]] (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) who created the Titanium Man armor as part of Project Titanium and to pass it off as Justin Hammer's bodyguard.<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=676</ref> In "Titanium vs. Iron," Justin Hammer dons the prototype Titanium Man armor (despite [[Fixer (comics)|Mr. Fix]]'s objection since the vibranium is needed to help perfect the armor) to ambush Iron Man in his stealth armor when Iron Man comes to delete the remaining data revolving around Project Titanium. War Machine comes to Iron Man's aid only for Titanium Man to knock out War Machine. Titanium Man ends up chasing after Iron Man (who ends up carrying War Machine away) and ends up dropping War Machine. Iron Man has his armor do a proposal which spins Iron Man free and pick up War Machine. When Titanium Man catches up, he destroys the stealth armor only to discover that Tony had bailed at the last minute. Titanium Man ends up chasing after Tony until War Machine wakes up. In the nick of time, Tony Stark's Mark II armor arrives and helps War Machine fight Titanium Man. Iron Man was able to bind Titanium Man with his own weapon long enough for the duo to use a double blast from their repulsors to heat up the Titanium Man armor to its burning point. Upon returning to Hammer Multinational, Justin Hammer bails from the red-hot suit as [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]] attempts to freeze it. Unfortunately, the Titanium Man armor's burning point being so high that once Blizzard manages to cool it down, all that remains of the Titanium Man armor is a pile of molten slag. Despite destroying the armor, Tony believes that Titanium Man will return stronger than ever. Later in "The Hawk and the Spider," Hammer uses a rebuilt Titanium Man armor to steal the U.I. chip of [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] (which was stolen from Iron Man by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]). The armor, now upgraded by using blended Titanium and [[Vibranium]] reappeared in "Heavy Mettle" where Hammer uses it to make a truce with Iron Man in order to take down Stane and Stark International. Tony refuses and Titanium Man blasts Iron Man onto a roof because Tony turned his back on him. While kicking Iron Man, Hammer receives a message that Obadiah Stane is stealing the Iron Monger armor. He reluctantly leaves. He then plants a device (which was made by Mr. Fix 2.0) on Iron Monger while watching Stane kidnap [[Pepper Potts]]. Justin Hammer's assistant Sasha advises him to save Pepper in front of the press to make him look good. Hammer attempts this but is swatted away by Stane who tells Hammer to build better armor. Hammer watches the fight between Iron Monger, Iron Man and War Machine from afar. When Obadiah Stane ceases action, Titanium Man orders Sasha to take control of the armor and destroy everything to her delight. Titanium Man once again tries to claim credit for stopping Iron Monger which Iron Man discovers and attacks Justin Hammer. Sasha loses control of the armor when Obadiah Stane breaks a joystick, causing the Iron Monger armor to fall from a high building. The fall puts Stane in a coma which Hammer laughs at. An attack from Iron Man and War Machine sends Titanium Man flying. The armor is disabled and Sasha doesn't bother reactivating it. Hammer crashes in the mountains now trapped inside the armor absolutely helpless. In "Hostile Takeover," it was revealed that the Titanium Man armor's backup system kicked on enabling Justin Hammer to return. Titanium Man assists [[Blacklash|Whiplash]] and [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]] into attacking Iron Man at the docks. When it comes to the fight in Hammer Multinational between Iron Man and [[War Machine]] against [[Killer Shrike]], Unicorn, and Whiplash, Justin Hammer ran off and returned in the Titanium Man armor. Using artificial cosmic ray lasers, Iron Man and War Machine were able to take down Titanium Man. In "The Hammer Falls," Justin Hammer takes the Titanium Man armor to hunt down whoever has been blackmailing him. Titanium Man attacks Killer Shrike and Unicorn where Justin suspects them of blackmailing only for Iron Man to get involved. Titanium Man later intercepts the prison transport carrying Killer Shrike. When his illegal activities have been exposed on television, Justin Hammer escapes into the Titanium Man armor and plans to detonate a pod containing Zombie Gas. Iron Man manages to detonate a bomb to eliminate the Zombie Gas and then use his Extremis ability to disable the Titanium Man armor.

===Video game===

He is first seen at the nuclear power plant, working alongside mercenaries to obtain a power source for A.I.M., when Iron Man arrives and stops him. Later however, Titanium Man and A.I.M. soldiers later launch an attack on the Stark Industries compound to try to take Stark's Iron Man suit, but Iron Man defeats him and all of his A.I.M. forces.
