The '''Titanium Man''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who, as the champion of the [[Soviet Union]], fought [[Iron Man]], the champion of the [[United States]], in a famous battle during the [[Cold War]].  This first Titanium Man was killed in battle with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] by his own allies when they learned that he was a Soviet agent; the second Titanium Man is the mutant formerly known as the Gremlin, and has served with the Soviet-era [[superhero]] group, the [[Soviet Super Soldiers]].

Both Titanium Men have used grey armor similar to that used by Iron Man and to that used by their sometime compatriot, the [[Crimson Dynamo]].
