==Primus I==
The first Primus is a shapeshifting bio-[[android]], an artificial humanoid created by the [[mad scientist]] named [[Arnim Zola]]. Primus thinks independently, and has superhuman strength and can harden his body to stone-like consistency.  He can also alter his shape, so as to resemble a specific human being exactly.  Zola caused Primus to merge with [[Doughboy (comics)|Doughboy]], which was another of his creations, and which could assume unusual shapes.  Primus can now turn himself into Doughboy and retain mental control of Doughboy while in the latter's form.

Primus has been a foe of [[Captain America]] and the [[New Warriors]], and an ally of the [[Mad Thinker]].

==Primus II==
Being born to alien parents of the planet Archko, Primus spent most of his childhood life living there. At one point in his life, he got attacked by the Screamers who killed his parents and wife Stara. Primus was revealed to have trained in the use of shadow powers originating from the Shadow Realm. He fled to Earth where he was found by the first [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Together they defeated the evil Screamers, and Mar-Vell offered to help Primus get his life back in order, but Primus preferred to live alone. What became of him next is unknown as Primus wasn't seen since.
