'''Jack of Hearts''' (Jack Hart) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]'' #22 (March, 1976).

Jack is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created an energy source called "zero fluid", and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the Contraxian race.  After being exposed to a vat of zero fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body.  After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the corporation that killed his father.  This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as the [[Sons of the Tiger]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].

Later, Jack moved past his mission of blind vengeance and became a true hero, working with various other superheroes such as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Moondragon]] and the [[Silver Surfer]].  Jack Hart was reunited a college girlfriend named Marcy (who was also a fellow graduate student of Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man).  Marcy, a scientist, and [[SHIELD]] offered to help find a cure for Jack's dangerous super powers.  Marcy turned out to be a Contraxian agent sent to Earth to find Jack, and it was at this time Jack learned of his half-Contraxian heritage.  Marcy took Jack to Contraxia where he saved the homeworld of his mother from its dying sun.  The Contraxians could not find a solution for Jack's unstable powers, and he left Contraxia to wander space.  While wandering space his containment suit was breached in battle with [[The Presence]] which led him to seek aid from the Silver Surfer, who found an alien armorer who designed a new containment suit for Jack.  Shortly after this adventure, Jack fell in love with the alien warrior woman known as [[Ganymede]], though she did not return his feelings.  Eventually he joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], becoming the fifty-second superhero to join.

In ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #76 (aka #491, due to renumbering), Jack of Hearts chose to commit suicide rather than continue living in containment 14 hours a day.  Jack took a child murderer who had abducted [[Cassie Lang]], the daughter of [[Scott Lang]] (the second Ant-Man), along with him when he exploded in space.

In ''Avengers'' #500 (now back to its original renumbering) during the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" event, Jack reappeared as what appeared to be a zombie just long enough to blow himself up, along with half of the Avengers mansion and Scott Lang.  This Jack may have been some type of "apparition" created by an insane [[Scarlet Witch]] rather than the actual Jack of Hearts; either way, the character is still quite dead.
