==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Jack of Hearts first appeared in ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]'' #22 (March, 1976), and was created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and illustrator [[Keith Giffen]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Jack Hart was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].  He is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created an energy source called "zero fluid", and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#C|Contraxian]] race.  After being exposed to a vat of zero fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body.  After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]] that killed his father.  This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as the [[Sons of the Tiger]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. He also fought the [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]].<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #23</ref> Eventually, he killed Stryke, his father's killer.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #31</ref>

Later, Jack mistakenly fought [[Iron Man]]. Being new to super-heroics, he asked Iron Man to take him on as an apprentice, which he did, to show him the ropes. Jack teamed with Iron Man, [[Nick Fury]], [[Guardsman (comics)#Guardsman (Michael O'Brien)|Guardsman]], [[Jasper Sitwell]], [[Jean DeWolff]], and the [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|Wraith]], and battled [[Midas (comics)|Midas]]. Jack was briefly turned to a golden living statue by Midas, and then freed from this golden state by Iron Man and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #103, 105-108</ref> Jack then aided Iron Man in fighting the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] on the moon.<ref>''Iron Man'' #109</ref> Jack aided Iron Man against the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] Commander Arcturus.<ref>''Iron Man'' #110-112</ref> Jack later went off on his own, and fought Hemlock.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #44</ref>

===Being a Hero===
Later, Jack moved past his mission of blind vengeance and became a true hero, working with various other superheroes such as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  Jack fought the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who was under mental control of the [[Machinesmith]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #48</ref> Jack Hart was then reunited with a college girlfriend named [[Marcy Kane]] (who was also a fellow graduate student of Peter Parker, a.k.a. [[Spider-Man]]).  Marcy, a scientist, and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] offered to help find a cure for Jack's dangerous super powers. Jack fought some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and his powers were temporarily dampened by Spider-Man.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #134</ref> Marcy turned out to be a [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#C|Contraxian]] agent sent to Earth to find Jack. It was at this time Jack learned of his half-Contraxian heritage.  Marcy took Jack to Contraxia, where he discovered that his powers had increased exponentially, and saved the home-world of his mother by reenergizing its dying sun.  The Contraxians could not find a solution for Jack's unstable powers, and he left Contraxia to wander outer space in exile.<ref>''Jack of Hearts'' #1-4</ref>

While wandering space he was captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]. He later escaped captivity on the Stranger's planet.<ref>''Quasar'' #15</ref> Jack fought [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] during his return to Earth; however, Jack exploded when his containment suit was breached in battle with the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]].<ref>''Quasar'' #19-20</ref> Jack was retrieved from space, revived and mentally controlled by [[Moondragon]], and he attacked [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]].<ref>''Quasar'' #28</ref> The damage to his armor led Jack to seek aid from the Silver Surfer, who found an alien armorer on Anvil who designed a new containment suit for Jack.  Jack then battled [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] and [[Geatar]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #76-78</ref>  Shortly after this adventure, Jack fell in love with the alien warrior woman known as [[Ganymede (comics)|Ganymede]], though she did not return his feelings.

In an effort to save R-76, an outpost manned by the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellians]], Jack of Hearts was injured in battle with the [[Servitors (Marvel Comics)|Servitors]]. Jack was rescued by a team of Avengers, and succeeded in convincing the [[Infinites]] to restore R-76.<ref>''Avengers Infinity'' #1-4</ref> Subsequently, Jack and these Avengers were captured , first by the [[Shi'Ar]], and then by the [[Ruul]] acting under the orders of the [[Supreme Intelligence]].<ref>''Avengers'', vol. 3 #35</ref> Jack & the Avengers eventually escaped to Earth & helped reverse a plan to have Earth consumed by [[Ego the Living Planet]].<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1-3</ref>

Jack's return to Earth happened during the period known as the Kang War, and Jack of Hearts was accepted as a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], becoming the fifty-second superhero to join the team, though the traditional welcoming ceremony for new Avengers were deferred given the nature of the crisis they faced.<ref>''Avengers'', vol. 3 # 38</ref> During his tenure, the Avengers teamed-up with the [[Justice League of America]],<ref>''JLA Avengers'' #1-4</ref> and fought the [[Red Skull]] for unleashing a biological weapon at [[Mount Rushmore]], killing many civilians.<ref>''Avengers'', vol. 3, #65-70</ref>

===Death===
In ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #76 (aka #491, due to renumbering), Jack of Hearts chose to commit suicide rather than continue living in containment 14 hours a day.  Jack took a child murderer who had abducted [[Cassie Lang]], the daughter of [[Scott Lang]] (the second Ant-Man), along with him when he exploded in space. With his uniform destroyed in the blast, the naked body of Jack of Hearts drifted deeper into space.

===Avengers Disassembled===
In ''Avengers'' #500 (now back to its original renumbering) at the onset of the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" event, Jack reappeared in uniform as what appeared to be a zombie just long enough to blow himself up, killing Scott Lang and destroying half of the Avengers Mansion. Jack's return was caused by the probability-shifting powers of the [[Scarlet Witch]] through methods that have remained ambiguous. Unlike his prior explosion in space, Jack's body was never recovered from the ruins. It's thus unclear if that was the real Jack of Hearts or a magical creation of Scarlet Witch, and in this case the status of the real Jack of Hearts is yet to be determined.

===Afterlife===
During the adventures of Hercules in Hades, Jack can be seen playing [[slots]] to win a chance to return to the living. This is not the intended way the afterlife should operate, according to the characters. Jack wins, and excitedly declares that he is next for resurrection.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jack Hart's superhuman powers are as a result of the mutagenic effect of his father's "Zero Fluid," combined with the alien genes from his Contraxian mother. He has superhuman stamina and durability. Jack of Hearts also has the ability to generate "zero energy" within his body and project it as concussive force or intense heat or as a propellant to fly. Jack is sometimes unable to exert complete control over his energies, however. For a short time after restarting Contraxia's sun, he uncontrollably radiated enough heat to melt one of Contraxia's polar ice caps.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}  He can survive unprotected in space. Jack of Hearts's brain has incorporated the artificial intelligence of a computerized device called the Scanalyzer, enabling him to think with the speed of a computer and store and retrieve information with a computer-like capacity and efficiency.

The left half of Jack of Hearts' body has turned purplish-black from direct exposure to "Zero Fluid". Jack of Hearts' left eye has an opaque white membrane covering the entire pupil.

Jack originally wore a suit of armor crafted in medieval Europe.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}  His second suit of armor was designed by Torval, and made from alien materials designed to contain the Zero energy his body generates.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Jack is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, has had some S.H.I.E.L.D. combat training, and is a skilled writer of poetry.
