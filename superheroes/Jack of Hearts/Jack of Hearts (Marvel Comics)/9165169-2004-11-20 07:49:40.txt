'''Jack of Hearts''' first appeared in DEADLY HANDS OF KUNG FU #22.  Jack of Hearts real name is Jack Hart.  Jack is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created Zero Fluid, and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the Contraxian race. 

After being exposed to a vat of Zero Fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body.

After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the Corporation that killed his father.  This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as Sons of the Tiger and the [[Hulk]].

Later Jack moved past his blind mission of vengeance and became a true superhero working with various superheros such as the [[Defenders]], the [[Thing]], Quasar, [[Spider-Man]], [[Moondragon]] and the [[Silver Surfer]].  Eventually he joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], becoming the fifty-second superhero to join.

In Avengers Vol. 3 #76 (aka #491) Jack of Hearts chooses to commit suicide rather than continue living in containment 14 hours a day.  Jack takes a child murderer who had abducted [[Ant-Man|Ant-Manâ€™s]] daughter along with him so that they both die when Jack explodes in space.

In Avengers Vol.3 #85 (aka #500) Jack reappears just long to blow himself up, the Avengers mansion, and Ant-Man II.  This Jack was probably not the real Jack of Hearts, but instead some type of "apparition" created by an insane [[Scarlet Witch]].
