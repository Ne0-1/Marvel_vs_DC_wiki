'''Jack of Hearts''' (Jack Hart) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]'' #22 (March, 1976).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Jack Hart was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].  He is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created an energy source called "zero fluid", and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#C|Contraxian]] race.  After being exposed to a vat of zero fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body.  After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]] that killed his father.  This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as the [[Sons of the Tiger]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].

===Being a Hero===

Later, Jack moved past his mission of blind vengeance and became a true hero, working with various other superheroes such as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Moondragon]] and the [[Silver Surfer]].  Jack Hart was reunited with a college girlfriend named [[Marcy Kane]] (who was also a fellow graduate student of Peter Parker, aka [[Spider-Man]]).  Marcy, a scientist, and [[SHIELD]] offered to help find a cure for Jack's dangerous super powers.  Marcy turned out to be a [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#C|Contraxian]] agent sent to Earth to find Jack, and it was at this time Jack learned of his half-Contraxian heritage.  Marcy took Jack to Contraxia where he saved the homeworld of his mother from its dying sun.  The Contraxians could not find a solution for Jack's unstable powers, and he left Contraxia to wander space.  While wandering space his containment suit was breached in battle with [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|The Presence]] which led him to seek aid from the Silver Surfer, who found an alien armorer who designed a new containment suit for Jack.  Shortly after this adventure, Jack fell in love with the alien warrior woman known as [[Ganymede (comics)|Ganymede]], though she did not return his feelings.  Eventually he joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], becoming the fifty-second superhero to join.

===Death===
In ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #76 (aka #491, due to renumbering), Jack of Hearts chose to commit suicide rather than continue living in containment 14 hours a day.  Jack took a child murderer who had abducted [[Cassie Lang]], the daughter of [[Scott Lang]] (the second Ant-Man), along with him when he exploded in space.

===Avengers Disassembled===

In ''Avengers'' #500 (now back to its original renumbering) during the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" event, Jack reappeared as what appeared to be a zombie just long enough to blow himself up, along with half of the Avengers mansion and Scott Lang.  Jack's return was caused by the probability-shifting powers of the [[Scarlet Witch]] through methods that have remained ambiguous.
