'''Special Agent Abigail Brand''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Her first appearance was a cameo in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]''  #3 (2004), and she was introduced fully in ''Astonishing X-Men'' #6 (2004). She was created by [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]].  

==Fictional character biography==
Abigail Brand is a Special Agent of the United States Government and the head of [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]], a subdivision of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], charged with defending the Earth from extra-terrestrial threats. It was in this capacity that Brand encountered the alien [[Ord (comics)|Ord]], who was convinced that a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] from Earth was destined to destroy his planet. In order to avoid an interplanetary war, Brand acquiesced to Ord's plan to avert the destruction of his world by creating a cure for the mutant condition. It has since been learned the mutant prophesized to destroy Breakworld is [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]; furthermore, statements made by Ord suggest that neutralizing Earth's mutant population is just one step in an as-yet unrevealed plan.

After her involvement in this plan became known to the [[X-Men]] Brand faced a board of inquiry to face charges against her conduct. She defended her actions on the grounds that averting interplanetary warfare was a responsibility so great as to justify courses of action that would otherwise be considered immoral or illegal. This defence seems to have convinced the board as she was subsequently seen still in command of S.W.O.R.D.

Despite the antagonistic relationship she and Nick Fury demonstrated toward each other, she is considered a [[Nick Fury]] loyalist by new S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Maria Hill]]. Brand has made no effort to hide her dislike for Hill, and no further contact between the two has been shown.

In a final attempt to draw Breakworld's forces away from the Earth, Brand has the X-Men (including Colossus), Ord, and Ord's ally [[Danger Room|Danger]], teleported aboard a S.W.O.R.D. vessel speeding to the Breakworld itself.  Ord is able to contact his homeworld to alert them of Colossus' location, not knowing that this is all part of Brand's plan. Despite their past differences, and Brand's continuing high-handed attitude, she attempts to work with the X-Men to find a solution to the crisis. However, Breakworld's forces catch up with the S.W.O.R.D. vessel earlier than expected, before Brand has a plan in place. Once on the surface of Breakworld, Brand and Henry McCoy become separated from the other X-Men and are forced to take shelter in a small cave to avoid a device that has altered the weather to subfreezing temperatures. To McCoy's astonishment, Brand uses some as-yet unrevealed ability to generate heat. It is not yet known whether this abiliity is a mutant power or some other type of superhuman ability. 

==Physical appearance==
Brand has a [[tattoo]] on each arm; one reads "Grace", the other "Anna".  The significance of these tattoos has yet to be revealed,<ref> ''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #8 (2005)</ref> Brand's green hair is a trait normally associated with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemy [[HYDRA]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] referred to her as "Hydra-hair".<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #6 (2004)</ref>
