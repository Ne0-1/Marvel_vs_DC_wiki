==Character Biography==

Abigail Brant is a Special Agent of the United States Government and the head of [[S.W.O.R.D.]]('''S'''entient '''W'''orld '''O'''bservation and '''R'''esponse '''D'''epartment) a sub-division of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] charged with defending the Earth from extra-terrestrial threats. It was in this capacity that Brand encountered the alien [[Ord]], who was convinced that a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] from Earth was destined to destroy his planet. In order to avoid an interplanetary war, Brand acquiesced to Ord's plan to avert the destruction of his world by creating a cure for the mutant condition.

After her involvement in this plan became known to the [[X-Men]] Brand faced a board of enquiry to face charges against her conduct. She defended her actions on the grounds that averting interplanetary warfare was a responsibility so great as to justify courses of action that would otherwise be considered immoral or illegal. This defence seems to have convinced the board as she was subsequently seen still in command of S.W.O.R.D.      

==Physical Appearance==

Brand has a [[tattoo]] on each arm; one reads "Grace" the other "Anna" as seen in ''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 3) #8 (2005). Interestingly Brand's green hair is a trait normally associated with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemy [[HYDRA]]. This fact was noted by [[Wolverine (comics)| Wolverine]] when he referred to her as "Hydra-hair" in ''Astonishing X-Men'' (Vol. 3) #6 (2004). It is not yet known whether either of these facts are significant.
