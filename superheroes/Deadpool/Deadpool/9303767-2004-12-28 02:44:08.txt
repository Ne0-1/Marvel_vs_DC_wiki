'''Deadpool''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[mercenary]], [[anti-hero]] and occasional [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Deadpool (real name Wade Wilson) was created by [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] in ''[[New Mutants]]'' Volume 1, Issue 98, and went on to become a frequent [[antagonist]] of [[X-Force]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] before receiving his own series.  Deadpool has a [[superhuman]] rate of healing, carries a small arsenal of bladed weapons and firearms, and wears a personal [[teleportation]] device in his belt.  Deadpool, like Wolverine, gained his superhuman powers from the [[Weapon X]] Project (though Deadpool was in a later iteration of the Project).  Most recently, he was erroneously thought to be the man called [[Agent X (comics)|Agent X]].  He is infatuated (sometimes to the point of obsession) with the former X-Force member [[Siryn]].  He is currently partnered with former X-Force leader [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].  Recently, Deadpool and Cable got involved with terrorists trying to unleash a shape-shifting virus upon the world.  After both of them getting infected by the virus, the pair had to exchange bodily fluids. As a result of gaining Cable's techno-organic virus, Deadpool's scarred face briefly changed to a more normal appearance, only to return to being scarred after the facade conflict ended.

Liefeld's critics point out the number of similarities between Deadpool and [[Deathstroke the Terminator]], a character created for [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Teen Titans]]'' by [[George Perez]] in the [[1970s]].  Both characters' costumes share similar themes, both are mercenaries who use similar weaponry, and (most tellingly) Deathstroke's real name is Slade Wilson, while Deadpool's is Wade Wilson.  Deadpool's relationship with Siryn also mirrors Deathstroke's relationship with [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]. Additionally, Deadpool routinely clashes with X-Force, a group of teenage superheroes, which is not unlike Deathstroke clashing with the Teen Titans, a group of teenage superheroes.

It is possible that the inspiration for Deadpool's name came from ''[[The Dead Pool]]'', a [[Dirty Harry]] [[film|movie]] starring [[Clint Eastwood]]. Wade Wilson's own motivation for selecting this ''nom de guerre'' stems from his traumatic experience with the Weapon X project, where rejects from the program placed bets in a "dead pool" on who would be the next to die.
