'''Deadpool''' ('''Wade Winston Wilson''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''X-Force'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the [[fourth wall]] for humorous effect and running gags.

The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', he refers to his own scarred appearance as "[[Ryan Reynolds]] crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]" (though in the comic, Reynolds' name is misspelled as "Renolds".)<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #2, p. 13.

Liefeld's favorite comic title before ''[[X-Men]]'' was ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', which featured weapons like [[Captain America's shield]], [[Mjolnir (comics)|Thor's hammer]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'s bow and arrow, he decided to give weapons to his new characters as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/02/deadpool-creator-rob-liefeld|title=The Mouth Behind the Merc|website=Complex}}</ref> Liefeld, also a fan of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics, showed his new character to then-writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans". Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56.</ref>

Other inspirations were [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Liefeld states: "Wolverine and Spider-Man were the two properties I was competing with at all times. I didn't have those, I didn't have access to those. I had to make my own Spider-Man and Wolverine. That's what [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Deadpool were meant to be, my own Spider-Man and my own Wolverine."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2016/02/12/interview-rob-liefeld-talks-deadpool-comics-cable-and-more/3/#18cf32d4c3ac|title=Interview: Rob Liefeld Talks 'Deadpool', Comics, Cable, and More|first=Mark|last=Hughes|publisher=}}</ref>

Both Deadpool and Cable were also meant to be tied into Wolverine's history already from the start, as Liefeld describes: "Wolverine was my guy. If I could tie anything into Wolverine, I was winning." Like Wolverine, Deadpool is (or is thought to be) Canadian.<ref>''Marvel NOW Deadpool'' #3.</ref> The original story had him joining the [[Weapon X]] program after being kicked out of the U.S. Army Special Forces and given an artificial healing factor based on Wolverine's thanks to Dr. [[Emrys Killebrew]], one of the head scientists.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #39.</ref>

In his first appearance, Deadpool is hired by [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]] to attack Cable and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in ''[[X-Force]]'' as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, "Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it. Someone who hasn't paid for their crimes presents a problem for me."<ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 39}}</ref>

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character, its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=July 16, 2009|publisher=Newsarama.com|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref> Reportedly Kelly introduced the [[fourth wall]] breaking gimmick.<ref name=acrithit>{{cite web|url=http://www.acriticalhit.com/you-dont-know-merc-a-history-of-deadpool/|title=You don't know merc: a history of Deadpool|author=Kate Willaert|publisher=A Critical Hit|website=acriticalhit.com|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

The series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me" and that by issue 37, he realized that "it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game â€“ Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=September 2000|publisher=Christopher Priest official site|accessdate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> Kelly may have introduced Deadpool to breaking the fourth wall, but Priest "could be credited for establishing it as an essential part of the character's personality and worldview." Priest left the series after only one year at issue #45.<ref name=acrithit/>

===2000s===
For a time, writers who followed generally ignored the fourth wall entirely, until [[Gail Simone]] took over with issue #65. Her version is remembered for the frequent use of the "little yellow boxes."<ref name=acrithit/> ''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title with a similar character called ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' in 2002. This occurred during a line-wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants and X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that "When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|accessdate=August 12, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827112755/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|archivedate=August 27, 2009}}</ref> It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the supervillain [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenberg]] later founded Agency X with a mysterious man called Alex Hayden, who took the name dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]. Deadpool later returned to the series. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor, but then returned to conclude with issues 13â€“15.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone Has All the Answers |work=Word Balloon with John Siuntres|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=August 21, 2009}}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2016}}

Deadpool's next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was cancelled with issue #50 and replaced by a new ''[[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|Cable]]'' series in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 â€“ MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO???

A new ''Deadpool'' [[ongoing series]] written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen [[Veranke]].<ref name="NEWDeadpool">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |format=news |work= }}</ref><ref name="SeptRelease">{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = [[Wolverine: Origins]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 25 | date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}.</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things." The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]]; "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself." This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #8â€“9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130â€“131.<ref>Richards, Dave (December 16, 2008).[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19197 "Way Talks Deadpool & Thunderbolts, Bob"].

A special anniversary issue titled ''Deadpool'' #900 was released in October 2009. It features stories written by several authors, with the main feature written by the original ''Deadpool'' series writer Joe Kelly and drawn by Deadpool's creator Rob Liefeld. A third Deadpool ongoing series, ''Deadpool Team-Up'', launched in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by [[Fred Van Lente]], with art by Dalibor Talajic.

===2010s===

Deadpool (vol. 2) was written by [[Daniel Way]] and drawn by [[AlÃ© Garza]]. In the story arc "DEAD", Wade is "cured" of his healing ability and becomes mortal. As a side effect, he also has his old, unscarred face once again. Although he spent the majority of the story arc looking forward to dying, he suppresses his desires in order to protect his friend and [[sidekick]] [[Bob, Agent of Hydra|Hydra Bob]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

After he loses his healing factor, Wilson claims he felt "more alive than ever."{{issue|date=December 2012}} However, after a harsh beating from Intelligencia, Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help from [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in training.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but actually, he allowed Black Box to study Wade in order to prepare his vengeance against Wilson, even letting him know Deadpool lost his healing factor.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Wade managed to defeat Black Box, Black Tom and Black Swan, but in the process, his face was burned and disfigured again.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Former FBI agent Allison Kemp wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other enemies of Deadpool such as T-Ray and [[Slayback]] and trained them to kill Deadpool.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Daniel Way|penciller = Ale Garza|inker = Sean Parsons|colorist = Guru eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

Initially a secret, his bride was revealed in the webcomic ''Deadpool: The Gauntlet'' to be [[Shiklah|Shiklah, Queen of the Undead]]. Deadpool also discovers that he has a daughter by the name of Eleanor from a former flame of Deadpool named Carmelita.<ref name="Deadpool #19">''Deadpool'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the events of "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]", it was revealed that Deadpool was tricked into killing his parents by a scientist known as Butler (who abducted Eleanor and gave her to his brother), however Deadpool does not know about it.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Much later, he clashed with [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], believing the universe was telling the latter to defeat him. After several fights and getting torn to pieces, Deadpool bonds with four symbiotes: Riot, Phage, Lasher and Agony. Playing mind games, Deadpool tricked [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] by using his shapeshifting abilities to make her disoriented and having her flee. After the symbiotic Deadpool and Carnage fought again, Deadpool captures Shriek and forces her to impersonate himself, making it trick Carnage into almost killing her in the process. Feeling broken after a mental breakdown, Carnage allowed himself to be arrested and was placed in an unlocked cell. While sitting in the cell until he was his own self, Carnage swore vengeance on Deadpool. Deadpool, after defeating Carnage, gives the four symbiotes to a war dog who helped Deadpool fight Carnage to deliver them to the government.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #1-4.

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Deadpool appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2.

Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.<ref>''Deadpool'' (2012) #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====All New, All Different Marvel====
Eight months after the events of ''Secret Wars'' and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Avengers'' #0</ref>

In the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically-manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from merchandise.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #1</ref>

Madcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface word sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #23-29</ref>

Not long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterwards, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death, and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground, and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #31-36</ref>

He often has conversations with his two internal monologues, which are shown as caption boxes in his panels; in ''Deadpool Annual'' #1 (2014) it is revealed that [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]], a foe of [[Captain America]], is the psychotic voice appearing in white captions with a typewriter serif;<ref>''Deadpool Annual'' #1 (2014).</ref> the other voice is unidentified and often mistakenly attributed to Dr. Bong, Deadpool's former psychiatrist.

The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to a mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], claims in ''Deadpool'' #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #23.</ref> There have been other dubious stories about his historyâ€”at one point the supervillain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] claimed to be his father.<ref name="Deadpool #36">''Deadpool'' (2012) #36.</ref> Frequently, revelations are later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether or not he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which writer the reader prefers.<ref>"Cable and Deadpool" #47.</ref>

Deadpool is depicted as having a regenerative healing factor, which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body, but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his [[neuron]]s are also affected by the accelerated regeneration. It is thought that while his psychosis is a handicap, it is also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent.

Deadpool has sometimes been portrayed to have a strong sense of core morality. In ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'', he storms out after [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] tries to rationalize [[Fantomex]] killing [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who was at the time in a child form. After Wolverine argues that Deadpool is motivated solely by money, [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] reveals that Deadpool never cashed any of his checks.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #5 (2011).</ref>

===Sexual orientation===
In December 2013, Deadpool was confirmed as being [[Pansexuality|pansexual]] by ''Deadpool'' writer Gerry Duggan via Twitter.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=408076514568065024|user=GerryDuggan|title=@JD_Boucher tell the kids I have a...|accessdate=September 6, 2015|date=December 4, 2013}}</ref> When asked about Deadpool's sexuality, co-creator Fabian Nicieza stated, "Deadpool is whatever sexual inclination his brain tells him he is in THAT moment. And then the moment passes."<ref>{{cite tweet|number=631482629494149121|user=FabianNicieza|title=Deadpool is whatever sexual...|accessdate= September 6, 2015|date=August 12, 2015}}</ref> Nicieza has also stated,

<blockquote>Not trying to be dismissive, but readers always want to 'make a character their own' and often that is to the exclusion of what the character might mean to other fans. I've been dogged with the DP sexuality questions for YEARS. It is a bit tiring. He is NO sex and ALL sexes. He is yours and everyone else's. So not dismissive, but rather the epitome of inclusive.<ref>{{cite web|title = Deadpool Co-Creator Weighs in on Character's Sexuality - Comic Book Resources|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/deadpool-co-creator-weighs-in-on-characters-sexuality|website = www.comicbookresources.com|accessdate = September 6, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

===Powers and abilities===
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. The speed of his healing factor depends on the severity of the wound and Deadpool's mental state. It works most efficiently when he is awake, alert, and in good spirits.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By Daniel Way:The Complete Collection By Daniel Way: Volume One|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Deadpool's accelerated healing factor is strong enough that he has survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal a decapitation wound,<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #44.</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #131.</ref><ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #898.</ref> he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the [[Hulk]] in the graphic novel ''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe''.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying [[neuron]]s being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers,<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #8.</ref><ref>''Deadpool'' #69.</ref> although this ability is inconsistent.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool: Enemy of the State''.</ref><ref>''Agent X'' # 14.</ref> It has been revealed that at the time his healing ability was given to him, Deadpool suffered from some form of cancer; after the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as well as his cancerous cells unable to die, giving him a heavily scarred appearance beneath his suit.{{issue|date=April 2015}}

Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins, due to his accelerated healing factor. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated.<ref>''Deadpool'' #12.</ref> He can be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers if he is exposed to a large enough dosage.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Unlike Wolverine, whose wounds sometimes cause excruciating pain as they heal depending on the severity, Deadpool has some degree of pain insensitivity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/103688/does-deadpool-feel-pain|title=11 Does Deadpool feel pain ?|date=September 25, 2015|language=en-US}}</ref>

Deadpool is effectively [[immortality|immortal]], although he has died several times.<ref name="Deadpool #61">''Deadpool'' #61.</ref><ref>Deadpool & Death Annual.</ref> He is still alive 800 years in the future when the new X-Force encounters him.<ref>''X-Force / Cable Messiah War'' Oneshot.</ref> In addition, [[Thanos]] once declared that Deadpool should "consider yourself cursed{{nbsp}}... with life!" out of jealousy over Deadpool's status as [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]'s love interest.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #64.</ref> His enemy T-Ray later resurrected him,<ref name="Deadpool #61"/> under Thanos' instruction, using an artifact he had given him.<ref>''Deadpool'' #64.</ref> Later, Deadpool was informed that Thanos had placed a curse on him, and tracked Thanos down. He revealed that the only thing keeping Wade alive was his "spell of darkest necromancy". Although Thanos removed this curse in order to kill Deadpool, he felt forced to immediately bring him back using "a fusion of necromancy and science" in order to request his aid in tracking down [[Mistress Death]], who had gone missing.<ref>''Deadpool vs Thanos'' #1.</ref>

Deadpool is a highly trained [[assassination|assassin]] and [[mercenary]]. He is adept in multiple forms of [[martial art]]s, including [[Savate]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #1 (August 1991)</ref> Deadpool is an extraordinary athlete, and an expert swordsman and marksman. He is skilled in the use of multiple weapons, including [[katana]]s, knives, grenades, and guns. His accelerated healing factor may contribute to his abilities, allowing him to perform intense exercise for extended periods of time with minimal aches and fatigue.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Deadpool: The Complete Collection By Daniel Way: Volume One|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Deadpool: 15 Things Only True Fans Know About His Katana |url=https://screenrant.com/deadpool-facts-trivia-katanas-marvel/ |accessdate=March 28, 2019 |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> Although in earlier years he was originally portrayed as having superhuman strength, he is no longer depicted as having this ability.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36.</ref>

Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possesses a device which projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. Deadpool is [[Multilingualism|multilingual]], with the ability to speak fluently in German, Spanish, [[American Sign Language|ASL]], and Japanese, in addition to his native English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superherodb.com/deadpool/10-835/powers/|title=Deadpool|website=www.superherodb.com|access-date=October 21, 2018}}</ref>

Since Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional character,<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue34" /> he uses this knowledge to his advantage to deal with opponents or gain knowledge to which he should not normally have access, such as reading past issues of his and others' comics.<ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #885.</ref> For example, Deadpool knows he has a Wikipedia article and hopes his fans keep his page updated.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol, 3, #36.</ref>

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Deadpool}}

* Wade Wilson / Deadpool makes his first feature film appearance in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]].<ref>{{Cite news| author=Marc Graser |author2=Tatiana Siegel | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Reynolds, will.i.am join 'Wolverine' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=February 19, 2008 | accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> He is a highly skilled, wisecracking, and amoral mercenary who wields a pair of [[katana]]s with peak athleticism and skill sufficient to deflect fully automatic weapons fire. He is supposedly killed by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]], but is later revealed to have been transformed by [[William Stryker|Colonel William Stryker]] into mutant killer "Weapon XI" (stunts performed by [[Scott Adkins]]) who possesses other mutants' powers, including [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]]' optic blasts, [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]]'s teleportation, Wolverine's healing factor, and a pair of extendable blades resembling the character's prized swords; Stryker is able to completely control him thanks to [[Chris Bradley]]'s [[technopathy]]. He is referred to by Stryker as "the Deadpool" because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been 'pooled' together into one being. Wolverine and Victor fight Deadpool in the film's climax and manage to defeat him by decapitating him and sending him falling into a cooling tower of a nuclear power plant, although a [[post-credits scene]] appearing in DVD releases and some theatrical presentations of the film implies Deadpool is still alive, as his hand is shown reaching out for his still-living head amid the rubble of the destroyed tower.<!--Do not add info on "shushing" or breaking the fourth wall-->{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

* Following the events of ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', which reset the ''X-Men'' film series timeline, Ryan Reynolds reprised his role in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', which premiered in February 2016. This version depicted Wade as a mercenary who after being diagnosed with late-stage cancer turns to [[Ajax (comics)|Ajax]] who has offered a cure. Ajax tortures Wade in order to catalyse the treatment, which eventually results in regressive mutant genes activating, causing his disfigurement and healing factor. Wade goes on a vendetta to force Ajax to fix his disfigurement, and eventually kills him on Ajax's admission that this was impossible. This film also introduces to Reynolds's incarnation his most famous weakness from the comics: his [[Truman Syndrome]] that adds to the comedic effect by giving him the ability to reference not just X-Men movies and casts, but also Ryan Reynolds and his filmography. 
** Before screenings of the film ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' in U.S. territories a pre-film sequence, that was later titled ''[[Deadpool: No Good Deed]]'' and released online, was shown serving as a teaser of sorts for ''Deadpool 2''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/logan-deadpool-2-teaser-2017-3|title=There's a secret teaser for 'Deadpool 2' in front of 'Logan' screenings|work=Business Insider|access-date=March 12, 2017|language=en}}</ref> [[Rhett Reese]], the writer, confirmed that the film was a short and "not a teaser or a trailer".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The plot of the short revolves around Deadpool attempting to change into his costume in a phone booth fast enough to stop a nearby mugging. The man is shot before Deadpool can finish putting on his costume. Deadpool apologizes as he could have just called the police since he was already inside a phone booth. He then lies down and initiates a one-sided conversation with the dead man.
