'''Deadpool''' ('''Wade Winston Wilson''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[mercenary]] and [[anti-hero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by artist [[Rob Liefeld]] and writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], Deadpool first appeared in ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' #98 (Feb. 1991).

A disfigured and mentally unstable [[mercenary]], Deadpool originally appeared as a [[villain]] in an issue of ''[[New Mutants]]'', and later in issues of ''[[X-Force]]''. The character has since starred in several ongoing series, and shares titles with other characters such as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. The character, known as the "Merc with a Mouth", is famous for his talkative nature and his tendency to "break the [[fourth wall]]", which is used by writers for humorous effect. Deadpool was ranked 182nd on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's list of the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html ''Wizard'' magazine's list of the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}; listed [http://www.statueforum.com/showthread.php?t=69413 in this forum thread]</ref> ranked 45th on ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's list of The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=45|title=The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters|publisher=www.empireonline.com|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> and placed 31st on [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/31 |title=Deadpool - #31 Top Comic Book Heroes |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===1990s===
Created by artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance in the pages of ''New Mutants'' #98 published in February 1991. Rob Liefeld, a fan of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics, showed his new character to then writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans." Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an in-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56</ref> In his first appearance, Deadpool was hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]] to attack [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in [[X-Force]] as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993 the character received his own [[limited series|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success, and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor (artist)|Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa.

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]]. ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=2009-07-16|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

The series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me' and that by issue 37, he realized that 'it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game - Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=2000-09|publisher=digitalpriest.com|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>

===2000s===
''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title by [[Gail Simone]] with a similar character called [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] in 2002. This occurred during a line wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants/X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that 'When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the aristocratic (and telepathic) villain known as the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Weeks later, a mysterious figure showed up at the apartment of Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenberg]]. The man took the name ''Alex Hayden'' and together they started "Agency X," with Hayden dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] after the company. Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool suffering from amnesia. The title character of ''Agent X'' was eventually revealed not to be Deadpool and the climax of that series saw the original character restored. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone has all the answers (podcast interview)|publisher=Wordballoon|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

Deadpool's next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was canceled with issue #50 and replaced by a new ''[[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|Cable]]'' series in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 - MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO???

A new ''Deadpool'' [[ongoing series]] written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen [[Veranke]].<ref name="NEWDeadpool">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |accessdate=2008-05-04 |format=news |work= }}</ref><ref name="SeptRelease">{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = [[Wolverine: Origins]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 25 | Date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things."<ref name=cbr19197 /> The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]], "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself.".<ref name=cbr19197 /> This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #8-9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130-131.<ref name=cbr19197>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19197 Way Talks Deadpool & Thunderbolts, Bob], [[Comic Book Resources]], December 16, 2008</ref> ''Thunderbolts'' writer [[Andy Diggle]] said, "it's a natural progression for Deadpool to go after Norman, and for Norman to send his personal hit-squad after Deadpool."<ref name=newsaramadptb>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120816-Diggle-Tbolts-Deadpool.html Thunderbolts vs. Deadpool: FIGHT], [[Newsarama]], December 16, 2008</ref> In ''Deadpool'' #15, Deadpool decides to become a hero resulting in conflicts with proper heroes like [[Spider-Man]]<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23969 |title=Daniel Way Bets on "Deadpool" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010 }}</ref> (who he had recently encountered in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #611 as part of "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]"<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22067 |title=Deadpool Vs.

==Powers and abilities==
{{Primary sources|section|date=November 2009}}
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various artists and writers with varying levels of efficiency. Artificially endowed by the [[Weapon X]] program, this enables him to regenerate any destroyed tissues or organs at a super-human rate as well as making him immune to known diseases and infections. An unanticipated side effect was a rapid acceleration of the cancerous tumors he was suffering from at the time, causing them to quickly spread across his entire body as soon as his powers fully activated. Because of this, his healing factor super charged his cancer, resulting in massive [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]] causing his appearance to be severely disfigured. Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying brain cells being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any and all head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers, as the altered or damaged brain cells quickly regenerate to their original state. It is also the cause of his psychosis and mental instability. Deadpool's healing factor is strong enough that he has previously survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once, though in each of these occurrences, his head had to be reunited with his body to heal the wound instead of his body growing a new head (or vice-versa).<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #44</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #131</ref><ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #898</ref> Unlike Wolverine’s natural healing factor, Deadpool’s is mentally driven to a partial extent. Similar to Wolverine, his healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels heightening at least his endurance and stamina. Though it had been said in earlier years that he also had super-human strength, that detail has apparently been glossed over, if not forgotten, as of late.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36</ref> Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins. For example, it is extremely difficult, though not impossible, for him to become intoxicated.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #12</ref> He can, however, be affected by certain drugs such as tranquilizers, if he is exposed to a massive enough dosage. Deadpool's healing factor also provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process to an unknown degree which cannot be measured as of yet, since he is not old enough to see any effect. However, his life span is extended to such a degree that he is still alive as Deadpool 800 years from the present as shown when the new X-Force encountered him in the future.<ref>''X-Force / Cable Messiah War'' Oneshot</ref>

Aside from his physical advantages, Deadpool is a superb [[assassination|assassin]] and [[mercenary]], an expert in multiple forms of [[martial art]]s, an expert swordsman and marksman. It has also been discussed that, while his psychosis and [[dissociative identity disorder]] is a handicap, it is also one of his greatest attributes as it makes him an extremely unpredictable opponent. [[Taskmaster]] (who has photo-reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone's fighting skills by observation, thus making him their equal in battle) was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #38</ref> It has also given him some protection from the effects of the Penance Stare, as all it did was show him what lead to him becoming what he was (or as he put it, a "highlight" reel) and Ghost Rider turning back into Johnny Blaze. Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possessed a device which projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. In addition, Deadpool is [[multilingual]] and has demonstrated the ability to speak [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Occasionally, Deadpool has also been shown as having a [[magic satchel]], often pulling weapons out of nowhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/deadpool.htm |title=Deadpool |publisher=Marvel Directory |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

==Identity==

The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to his mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], claims in ''Deadpool'' #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> There have been other dubious stories about his history - at one point the supervillain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] claimed to be his father.<ref>''Deadpool'' #36</ref> Frequently, revelations are later retconned or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which writer the reader prefers best.<ref>"Cable and Deadpool" #47</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
A version of the character appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. Depicted as an anti-mutant extremist, he is a [[cyborg]] and leader of the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] who hunt mutants for sport on a reality TV show. Beneath the mask, this incarnation of Deadpool appears to be a skull with exposed brain, his skin formed by a transparent shell. He also has the ability to mimic an individual's appearance and voice, though not their powers. His real name is '''Sergeant "Wadey" Wilson''', and he's a [[Gulf War]] veteran.<ref>''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #91-94</ref>

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Deadpool was redubbed '''Dead Man Wade''' and reimagined as a bitter, humorless member of Apocalypse's [[Pale Riders]], having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse's eugenics program. Sent with his team to invade the Savage Land, he attempted to unleash chaos upon the sanctuary, but was killed by Nightcrawler, who teleported his head off his body and hid it in a crater.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3, May 1995</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the first ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' limited series, a zombie version of Deadpool is seen fighting the [[Silver Surfer]]. The zombie Deadpool eventually loses his body and appears as a disembodied head beginning in ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]''. This incarnation of Deadpool, frequently referred to as '''Headpool''', entered the mainstream Marvel continuity when he is encountered and captured by the original Deadpool in ''Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12208 |title=Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth #1 - Marvel Comics Catalog |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> Along with several other alternate versions of Deadpool, Headpool went on to appear in ''Deadpool Corps'' with a [[Beanie#Propeller beanie|propeller beanie]] mounted to his head, allowing him to fly and fight.<ref>Deadpool Corps #1</ref>

===Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth===
Several alternate incarnations of Deadpool are introduced in the series ''Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth''. Attempting to return Headpool to the [[Marvel Zombies (series)|Marvel Zombies]] universe, Deadpool encounters multiple versions of himself as they exist in other universes, including a female version of himself named '''Lady Deadpool''', '''Major Wade Wilson''', a militant but sane version of Deadpool, and '''The Deadpool Kid''', a cowboy version of Deadpool who exists within a universe resembling the Wild West.<ref name="Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth #7">''Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth'' #7</ref>

===Deadpool Corps===
In the twelve-issue series ''Deadpool Corps'' and prequel series ''Prelude to Deadpool Corps'', Deadpool is joined by several alternate versions of himself from different universes to create a super-group. Lady Deadpool and Headpool return from their previous appearances in ''Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth'', joined by newcomers '''Kidpool''', a child version of Deadpool who attends [[Professor X]]'s school,<ref name="Prelude to Deadpool Corps #2">''Prelude to Deadpool Corps'' #2</ref> and '''Dogpool''', a dog endowed with Deadpool's familiar healing factor.<ref name="Prelude to Deadpool Corps #3">''Prelude to Deadpool Corps'' #3</ref>

===Marvel 2997===
In [[Messiah War]] Deadpool helps Cable to get [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] back from [[Stryfe]] who is later revealed to be inside this version of Deadpool's head. After seemingly defeating Stryfe, this version of Deadpool is quickly ripped in half and appears to die shortly after, his last words being a joke on "severance" pay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/995/995458p1.html |title=IGN: Cable #15 review |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

===Weapon X: Days of Future Present===
In the alternate Earth ending of the [[Weapon X]] comic, Deadpool is recruited by Wolverine to be part of a new team of X-Men after the old team is killed. He joins, claiming Wolverine only wants him as the "token human". This version of Deadpool is killed by [[Agent Zero]]'s Anti-Healing Factor corrosive acid.

==In other media==
===Television===
* While Deadpool never had a speaking role in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], he made several cameo appearances throughout the series in various episodes. He appears in a flashback sequence alongside Wolverine in one of Sabretooth's mental sessions with Professor Xavier in the episode "Deadly Reunions". In the episode "Whatever it Takes", [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] shape-shifts into Deadpool's form, and the character makes a similar appearance by proxy when Xavier's dark side projected an image of Deadpool to attack Wolverine in the episode "Dark Shroud."
* At the time before the cancellation of ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' was announced, a proposed season two was in the works which would have included Deadpool being sent by Weapon X to bring in Wolverine. [[Nolan North]] was cast for his voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=581 |title=Marvel Animation Age |publisher=Marvel.toonzone.net |date=2010-10-14 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}</ref>

* Deadpool is one of the primary antagonists of the film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]].<ref>{{Cite news| author=Marc Graser | coauthors=Tatiana Siegel | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Reynolds, will.i.am join 'Wolverine' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> He is a highly skilled, wisecracking but greatly immoral mercenary who wields a pair of samurai swords with superhuman speed and skill sufficient to deflect fully automatic weapons fire. He is later killed offscreen by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], only to return transformed by [[William Stryker|Colonel William Stryker]] into Weapon XI (stunts portrayed by [[Scott Adkins]]), a mutant killer who possesses other mutants' powers, including [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]]' optic blasts, [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]]'s teleportation, [[Chris Bradley]]'s [[technopath]]y, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s healing factor, and a pair of extendable blades resembling Wilson's prized swords. He is referred to by Stryker as "the Deadpool" because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been "pooled" together into one being. Wolverine and Sabretooth fight Deadpool in the film's climax and manage to defeat him by decapitating him and sending him falling into a cooling tower of a nuclear power plant, although a [[post-credits scene]] appearing in DVD releases and some theatrical presentations of the film implies Deadpool is still alive.<!--Do not add info on "shushing" or breaking the fourth wall--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/ElBicho/news/?a=7247|title=X-Men Origins:Wolverine - Deadpool Ending}}</ref>

===Video games===
* Deadpool appears in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[John Kassir]]. Deadpool initially appears as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]], having been hired and brainwashed by [[Mister Sinister]]. He fights the united [[X-Men]] and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] in the New York City's North Side during Act 4. Deadpool is also unlocked as a playable character once the game is completed for the first time. As in the comics, Deadpool breaks the fourth wall if the player stalls enough. If the enemy Deadpool is fought using the playable Deadpool, they will argue about which one is the real Deadpool.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted: Oct 9, 2005 |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gt-video-x-men-legends/8010 |title=GameTrailers Review - X-Men Legends 2 |publisher=Gametrailers.com |date=2005-10-09 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

* In ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', Deadpool is a playable character from the beginning of the game with John Kassir reprising speaking role from ''X-Men Legends II''. He can take on multiple costumes, including outfits based on his classic appearance, his appearance in the Ultimate Universe, his appearance from the ''Deadpool: Agent of Weapon X'' arc, and an updated version of the costume used in ''Cable and Deadpool''. Deadpool frequently breaks the fourth wall referencing the game itself and parodying other Marvel Comics heroes. He recounts his origin story in a briefing for his simulator mission, initially as a humorous pastiche of the origins of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] before proceeding to tell his real origin.<ref name="MUA1">{{Cite book|title=Marvel Ultimate Alliance: Signature Series Guide |first=Thom |last=Denick |publisher=Brady Games |location=Indianapolis, Indiana| isbn=0-7440-0844-1 |year=2006 |pages=8, 9}}</ref>

* Deadpool appears in the video game adaptation of ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' voiced by [[Steven Blum]].

* Deadpool appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' again voiced by John Kassir. His unmasked Ultimate Marvel appearance serves as an alternative costume. In the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions, he appears as a boss in the game's third stage, but will join the party upon his defeat when he realizes that the heroes aren't part of Titanium Man's terrorist attack. In keeping with his previous appearance, Deadpool has been written so that he is fully aware of his presence in a video game, and his dialogue throughout the title reflects this insight (for example, if the player chooses to enlist him in the Anti-Registration team, he quips to [[Maria Hill]] the possibility of being Pro-Registration "in the next playthrough").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpoolbugle.com/2009/04/evidence-of-deadpool-in-marvel-ultimate.html |title=Evidence of Deadpool in MUA2 |publisher=Deadpool Bugle |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvelultimatealliance.marvel.com/en/news_comments/deadpool_making_the_merc |title=Deadpool: Making the Merc |publisher=Marvelultimatealliance.marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/marvelultimateallianceiifusion/video/6213947/marvel-ultimate-alliance-2-washington-dc-gameplay-movie?tag=videos;title;6 Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 -Washington DC Gameplay Movie], [[GameSpot]]</ref><ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/marvelultimateallianceiifusion/video/6210370/marvel-ultimate-alliance-2-deadpool-interview Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 Deadpool Interview], [[GameSpot]]</ref> Also during the credits, Deadpool confronts one of the writers with a complaint about the game not starring him. In the Wii, PSP, and PS2 versions, he is playable from the start and appears during the credit sequence and load screens watching television while sitting in a recliner.

* Ultimate Deadpool appears as a villain in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'' voiced by [[Nolan North]], reprising his speaking role from ''Hulk vs Wolverine''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Miller |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/110/1107684p1.html |title=SDCC 10: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions Preview - Xbox 360 Preview at IGN |publisher=Xbox360.ign.com |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> This version of Deadpool incorporates traits from his mainstream counterpart such as breaking the fourth wall, a teleportation device, and an implied healing factor. Instead of leading an army of Reavers as he does in the Ultimate universe he uses an army of weapon-wielding fanboys and robots. He lures and fights Ultimate Spider-Man on an [[oil platform]] as part of his newest game show called ''Pain Factor'' when he learns what the tablet actually is and uses it to make two copies of himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/111/1115287p5.html |title = The Deadly Villains of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions - Comics Feature at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>

* Deadpool appears as a playable fighter in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', voiced again by [[Nolan North]]. His abilities include use of his guns, swords, and teleporter, which will malfunction if used excessively. He performs his own anomalous version of the [[Shoryuken]], and again breaks the fourth wall, with a special move in which he beats his opponent with his [[Health (gaming)|health bar]] and his hyper combo bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2010/may/08/four-new-marvel-vs-capcom-3-characters-confirmed/ |title=Updated: New Marvel vs. Capcom 3 characters shown : News |publisher=EventHubs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> He is frequently featured opposite of Capcom's [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] from the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series.<ref>http://www.capcom-unity.com/jgonzo/blog/2010/06/15/e3_2010:_marvel_vs_capcom_3</ref> His victory sequences have him approach the camera and say various things to the player. In Deadpool's ending sequence, he throws a party to celebrate his defeat of [[Galactus]], but his actions inadvertently cause the destruction of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], for which he implicates the player. Deadpool later appears as a playable character in the standalone updated version of the game, ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''.

* Deadpool is a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted Jun 15, 2011 12:44 pm |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16103/super_hero_squad_online_meet_deadpool |title=Super Hero Squad Online: Meet Deadpool &#124; Marvel Heroes Games |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref>
