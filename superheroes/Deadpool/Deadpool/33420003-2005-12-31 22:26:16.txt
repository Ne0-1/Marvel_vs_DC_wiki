'''Deadpool''' (real name Jack (surname unknown), alias Wade Wilson) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[mercenary]], [[anti-hero]] and occasional [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Deadpool was created by [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] in ''[[New Mutants]]'' volume 1, issue 98, and went on to become an [[antagonist]] of [[X-Force]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] before receiving his own series.

Recently, he was erroneously thought to be the man called [[Agent X (comics)|Agent X]], and is currently allied with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. He is infatuated (sometimes to the point of obsession) with the former X-Force member [[Siryn]].

==Publication history==
Deadpool, an irreverent and sardonic rogue of a mercenary, originally appeared in the pages of the ''New Mutants'' and later ''X-Force''.  He was created by [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]], and he had a costume that resembled a cross between that of Spider-Man and the DC character, [[Deathstroke]].  He would also go on to appear in the pages of ''Wolverine'' and the ''X-Men''.  The character became quite popular and eventually a limited series featuring the character was created in 1993, written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] with art by future superstar [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success, and a second limited series followed in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Ian Churchill]].

The ''Deadpool'' series often homaged "classic" comic covers, as here with the homage to the [[:Image:AmazingFantasy15.jpg|cover of ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15]], [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance.]]

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly]], with newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as the artist. It firmly established his nickname, the "Merc with a Mouth", and created a supporting cast, including Blind Al, and his best friend, Weasel. Blind Al is an elderly blind woman who serves as a mother figure, though she is techinically his hostage, and in truth, afraid of him. His book became a high-octane, lowbrow comedy parody of the cosmic drama, [[antihero]]-heavy plotlines in other comics of the time. The ongoing series gained cult popularity for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick. 

Unfortunately, the series began in 1997, around the time that Marvel was undergoing massive financial problems. Within a year, the title's lagging sales brought it to the brink of cancellation. On at least one occasion, Marvel planned to cancel the title but reneged after letter-writing campaign from the comic's rabid fanbase. Kelly, believing that the title would be cancelled with issue #36, plotted his story arc to conclude at this issue. When he learned that the book was not being cancelled, he decided to leave the book at this point anyway, out of frustration with lagging sales and lack of editorial support. Kelly's run on Deadpool was critically acclaimed and he gained a [[Harvey Award]] nomination for his [[Spider-Man]] satire in the double-sized #11. Due largely to the quality of his work on Deadpool, Kelly got wide attention in the industry and he went on to write major titles such as ''[[X-Men]]'', ''[[Action Comics]]'', and ''[[Justice League|JLA]]''.

The series lasted until issue 69, at which point, it was relaunched as a new title by [[Gail Simone]] with a similar character called [[Agent X]] in 2002. While exact details are sparse, rumors contend that this was a move by Marvel to cease paying artist [[Rob Liefeld]] for characters he had created for them. Thus, Deadpool became Agent X, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] became [[Soldier X]], and [[X-Force]] became [[X-Statix]]. The title character of Agent X was eventually revealed not to really be Deadpool, and the climax of that series saw the original character restored.

Agent X came to a close with issue 15, and with that (and the cancellation of Soldier X), it was decided the characters Cable and Deadpool would share a teambook, simply called ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]''. The series is currently still being published, written by Fabian Nicieza.

==Character biography==
Deadpool was formerly a government special operative who had contracted terminal cancer.  He volunteered for the clandestine Weapon X program where he was mutagenically altered.  This process granted him a superhuman regenerative healing factor allegedly based on the DNA of the mutant [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  This process stopped the progression of his cancer and greatly enhanced his physique.  However, the cancer interacted with the mutagenic process in unanticipated ways; disfiguring him horribly and making him mentally unstable.

Although he retained his sense of humor this process left him jaded.  Deadpool soon left the Weapon X program and began work as a mercenary.  Typically, he worked for villains such as the mysterious Mr. Tolliver.  This initially made him an adversary of Cable, Wolverine, and the New Mutants (later X-Force).  

Eventually, Deadpool became less of a villain and more of a reluctant hero, though the element of his moral ambiguity always remained.  It was later revealed that he had friends, such as Weasel and [[Blind Al]], that he was loyal to and cared about.  As the character became more developed it became obvious that although he carefully projected the guise of an invincible, merciless, gun-for-hire, he was actually an insecure and severely scarred man, emotionally and physically, who used his sardonic wit to cope with reality and deal with relationships. 

The character frequented a hang-out spot for mercenaries called "Hell house" with its own odd cast of characters, an often comedic rivalry with a man named T-Ray, and eventually the inclusion of Deuce the Devil Dog, who originally belonged to Franklin "Foggy" Nelson, best pal and partner of the Marvel Superhero [[Daredevil]].  Deadpool ran into other mercenaries, such as the Taskmaster and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] during his adventures. It was also at this time that Deadpool's relationship with Siryn was strengthened as she helped him deal with the loss of his full range of healing powers. Deadpool also had a brief and disturbing relationship with Typhoid Mary.

It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the aristocratic (and telepathic) villain known as the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]].  Swan had infected Deadpool with a virus that would erase his memory in retaliation for several of his successful mercenary hits which had been erroneously attributed to Deadpool. This led to an escalation of events in which Swan murdered a man known as Nijo (who had discovered that Swan had killed his brother) and a duel with Deadpool.  Deadpool and Swan then fought but as result of a miscalculation on Deadpools' part all parties were seemingly obliterated.

Weeks later, a mysterious figure showed up at the apartment of Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenburg]], who gave him the name Alex Hayden, and they started "Agency X," with Hayden dubbed [[Agent X]] after the company. Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool, with a case of amnesia. In fact, the truth was more complicated, as shown when the Black Swan showed up with a "tabula rasa" Deadpool in tow (who Hayden immediately shot in the head). It was revealed that "Hayden" was really Nijo's corpse, which had been revived and given Deadpool's healing factor by Swan's out of control mental powers (Swan had also received a copy of the healing factor), and whose mind was created from an amalgam of Deadpool and the Swan. And that Deadpool's personality was growing back (unwittingly accelerated by Hayden's bullet to his head).

In an attempt to regain the parts of his mind he had lost, as well as remove the pieces of their minds he wanted rid of ("You and Wilson have my skills, Mr Hayden. In return, I received a taste for [[Radiohead]] and an encyclopedic knowledge of pornographic knock-knock jokes. Yes, I'd like to switch back if possible"), including Nijo's sense of honour, Swan proposed a three-way mind meld. Hayden agreed. However the Swan, being an evil cad, attempted to double cross the other two and kill them as soon as it was complete, but while he concentrated on Hayden, Deadpool immediately stabbed the Swan in the back. Deadpool, Hayden and Hayden's allies [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]] and [[Taskmaster]] eventually defeated and killed the Swan, and had him stuffed so that the healing factor couldn't resurrect him (Hayden would later be shown using the corpse as a [[surfboard]]).

Deadpool is currently partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].  Recently, Deadpool and Cable were involved with a terrorist plot aimed at unleashing the shape-shifting "Façade Virus" upon the world.  After both were infected with the virus it was necessary to merge their DNA structure so that now Cable has some of Deadpool's DNA and vice versa.  As a result of the Façade in his system, Deadpool's face was temporarily cured of the hideous scarring. Once Cable shut down all infections of the virus worldwide, however, Deadpool was returned to his usual self. The exchange also resulted in Cable and Deadpool sharing large amounts of DNA, so that whenever Cable uses his teleporter to "bodyslide", both he and Deadpool teleport together -- sometimes literally (a "bodyslide by one" results in them being badly integrated into a single body, forcing a messy separation, which, thanks to the DNA share with Wade, Cable is also able to recover from).

He commonly develops obsessions over words or people, repeatedly mentioning the words, such as [[duodenum]] and [[chimichanga]], and obsessing over people such as [[Bea Arthur]] and the [[Olsen Twins]].

==Powers and equipment==
Deadpool has been artificially endowed with a [[superhuman]] regenerative [[healing factor]] by the Weapon X program. As Deadpool had cancer at the time of the gene therapy which endowed him with these abilities, it binded to the "healing factor" so that in a sense the cancer is his healing factor, which is why his skin is still horribly scarred. This causes his cells to be in a constant state of flux and regeneration, rendering him immune to psychics such as Professor X and Emma Frost. In addition, this constant flux is what causes him to have his witty banter and ADD-type personality. This entails that he can regenerate and heal hundreds of times faster than a normal human, and has recovered completely from injuries that would have killed most humans, even those with superhuman abilities. He can regenerate whole organs and even severed limbs.  As a byproduct of his unique physiology he possesses a degree of enhanced strength, agility and reflexes.

Aside from his physical advantages, Deadpool is a superb assassin and mercenary. He is a master of multiple forms of armed and unarmed combat. He favors bladed weapons as his primary means of dispensing his enemies as he feels it is more honorable to meet opponents in single combat, but if he is having a bad day or in a hurry he will just shoot them. He typically carries a small arsenal of both experimental hi-tech and conventional firearms and bladed weapons. He owns a personal [[teleportation]] device, usually located on his belt. This device is used to teleport him out of, and occasionally into, trouble.

Deadpool has actually met and established a relationship with the personification of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] in the Marvel universe, and as a result has been cursed by T-Ray, at the behest of [[Thanos]], to be unable to die.  This is a plot point that may or may not be advocated by some writers.

Deadpool's speech and thought balloons and captions are usually colored yellow, to represent his distinctive voice (although nobody knows exactly ''what'' is distinctive about his voice, only that it sounds different).  Cable has described his voice as having a "gravelly, Demi Moore" quality.  Blind Al has also stated that Deadpool's voice sounds like a distinct mixture of "gasoline and gravel." In his earliest appearances, his speech balloons were normal balloons with yellow borders; in later appearances, the interior would be colored yellow and the text would be written in a slightly mangled font. In his recent appearance in the ''X-Men Legends II: The Rise of Apocalpyse'' video game, he had a rather high-pitched, spaced-out voice, and spoke in a fast cadence, maintaining his aforementioned "cerebral flux".

A little known factoid is that in a past life, as seen in the Widdle Wade special, Deadpool was once a sumo-wrestler, and also has been made a member of the X-Men on at least two separate occasions (once in ''Cable & Deadpool'', and once in a current version of ''Weapon X'').

==Breaking the Fourth Wall==
Deadpool is one of few Marvel comic books that have broken the "[[fourth wall]]" and called attention to his nature as a comic book character. This may be due in part that early in the series when Deadpool had dealings with the [[Norse god]] [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], he was told the secret of the universe by the [[trickster]] god: "There is a man with a typewriter...". However, this explanation doesn't explain some instances that occured before the Loki storyarc, particularly in the pictured exchange with [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], but in those instances, it can possibly be attributed with his insanity and bizarre worldview; a comically accurate paranoia, of sorts. Whereas books like DC's [[Animal Man]] and [[Doom Patrol]] did so for the purpose of meta-textual analysis and postmodern deconstruction, Deadpool's banter to the reader was always more along the lines of [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon styled [[slapstick]]. In fact, early on in the series, some ads for the book came with the tag-line "Deadpool: Breaking down the fourth wall, brick by brick!"
[[Image:DeadpoolBullseye.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Deadpool acknowledges his existence in a comic book prior to the [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] story arc.]]
At the end of ''[[Agent X]]'' #15, upon coming back from the dead, he wonders if he "still thinks in those little yellow boxes". In the current ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]/Deadpool'' ongoing series, Deadpool occasionally narrates previous events for the reader, on one occasion mentioning that the book's editor told him that the current reader is the only person who has actually bought the book. The character also makes frequent in-jokes about the comic book industry.

Additionally, Deadpool sometimes answers his own letter column.

==Inspiration==
Liefeld's critics point out the number of similarities between Deadpool and [[Deathstroke the Terminator]], a character created for [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' by [[George Pérez]] in the 1970s. Both characters' costumes share similar themes, both are mercenaries who use similar weaponry, and (most tellingly) Deathstroke's real name is Slade Wilson, while Deadpool's was originally given as Wade Wilson. Deadpool's relationship with Siryn also mirrors Deathstroke's relationship with [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]. Additionally, Deadpool routinely clashes with X-Force, a group of teenage superheroes, which is not unlike Deathstroke clashing with the Teen Titans, another group of teenage superheroes.

It is possible that the inspiration for Deadpool's name came from ''[[The Dead Pool]]'', a [[Dirty Harry]] [[film|movie]] starring [[Clint Eastwood]]. Wade Wilson's own motivation for selecting this ''nom de guerre'' stems from his traumatic experience with the Weapon X project, where rejects from the program placed bets in a "dead pool" on who would be the next to die. It also helps that the "dead" prefix has so many possible endings - as an example, in the Deadpool comic series, Wade briefly had command of three other mercenaries, the so-called Deadpool Interns. He quickly discarded whatever monikers they had previously had, and renamed them Deadweight (an excessively large girl), Deadhead (a spaced-out man), and Deadend (a mutant that discharges energy blasts from his backside). The "dead" prefix is yet another link that Wade shares with Slade Wilson- ''Dead''pool and ''Death''stroke, respectively. On top of all that, Dead''pool'' seems to further parody Death''stroke'' with their swimming suffix.

These similarities have been lampooned in the Deadpool comics, with Deadpool claiming, in the letters section, that he doesn't want to appear in a DC crossover, for fear that someone will notice his striking similarities to a certain DC character (referring, of course, to Deathstroke).

==Other media==
Deadpool has recently made an appearance in ''[[X-Men Legends II]]'' as both a boss character and playable character (upon completion of the game), and due to his wide range of poewers is one of the most powerful characters in the game, if not the most powerful.

Deadpool will soon appear in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity along with the Marauders in Ultimate Spider-Man #91, where they assault the X-Men's Mansion during a visit from Peter Parker.
