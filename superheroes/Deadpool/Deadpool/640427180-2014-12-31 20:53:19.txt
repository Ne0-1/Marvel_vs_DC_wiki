'''Deadpool''' ('''Wade Winston Wilson''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[mercenary]] and [[anti-hero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by artist [[Rob Liefeld]] and writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], Deadpool first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #98 (Feb. 1991).

A disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary, Deadpool originally appeared as a [[villain]] in an issue of ''New Mutants'', and later in issues of ''[[X-Force]]''. The character has since starred in several ongoing series, and shares titles with other characters such as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Also known as the "Merc with a Mouth," Deadpool is famous for his talkative nature and his tendency to break the [[fourth wall]], which is used by writers to humorous effect.

He was portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]] in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' and will appear in his own feature film set to be released on February 12, 2016 also starring Reynolds.<ref>September 18, 2014, [http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/18/deadpool-movie-officially-set-for-2016-release Deadpool Movie Officially Set for 2016 Release], [[IGN]]</ref><ref>http://screenrant.com/deadpool-movie-ryan-reynolds-cast/</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Further2|[[List of Deadpool titles]]}}

===1990s===
Created by artist [[Rob Liefeld]] and writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], Deadpool made his first appearance in the pages of ''New Mutants'' #98 published in February 1991. Rob Liefeld, a fan of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics, showed his new character to then writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans." Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56</ref> In his first appearance, Deadpool was hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]] to attack [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in [[X-Force]] as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[limited series|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor :()|Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, "Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it. Someone who hasn't paid for their crimes presents a problem for me."<ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 39}}</ref>

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=2009-07-16|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

The series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me" and that by issue 37, he realized that "it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game – Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=September 2000|publisher=digitalpriest.com|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>

===2000s===
''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title by [[Gail Simone]] with a similar character called [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] in 2002. This occurred during a line wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants and X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that 'When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the aristocratic (and telepathic) villain known as the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Weeks later, a mysterious figure showed up at the apartment of Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenberg]]. The man took the name ''Alex Hayden'' and together they started "Agency X," with Hayden dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] after the company. Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool suffering from amnesia. The title character of ''Agent X'' was eventually revealed not to be Deadpool and the climax of that series saw the original character restored. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor, but then returned to conclude with issues 13-15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone has all the answers (podcast interview)|publisher=Wordballoon|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

Deadpool's next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was canceled with issue #50 and replaced by a new ''[[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|Cable]]'' series in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 – MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO???

A new ''Deadpool'' [[ongoing series]] written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen [[Veranke]].<ref name="NEWDeadpool">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |accessdate=2008-05-04 |format=news |work= }}</ref><ref name="SeptRelease">{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = [[Wolverine: Origins]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 25 | date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things."<ref name=cbr19197 /> The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]], "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself.".<ref name=cbr19197 /> This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #8-9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130-131.<ref name=cbr19197>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19197 Way Talks Deadpool & Thunderbolts, Bob], [[Comic Book Resources]], December 16, 2008</ref> ''Thunderbolts'' writer [[Andy Diggle]] said, "it's a natural progression for Deadpool to go after Norman, and for Norman to send his personal hit-squad after Deadpool."<ref name=newsaramadptb>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120816-Diggle-Tbolts-Deadpool.html Thunderbolts vs. Deadpool: FIGHT], [[Newsarama]], December 16, 2008</ref> In ''Deadpool'' #15, Deadpool decides to become a hero resulting in conflicts with proper heroes like [[Spider-Man]]<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23969 |title=Daniel Way Bets on "Deadpool" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010 }}</ref> (who he had recently encountered in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #611 as part of "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]"<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22067 |title=Deadpool Vs.

A third Deadpool ongoing series, ''Deadpool Team-Up'', launched in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by [[Fred Van Lente]], with art by Dalibor Talajic.

Another Deadpool series, titled ''Deadpool Corps'' also by Gischler, was released in April 2010.

Deadpool (vol. 2) is written by [[Daniel Way]] and drawn by [[Alé Garza]]. In the story arc "DEAD", Wade is 'cured' of his healing ability and becomes mortal. As a side effect, he also has his old, unscarred face back. Although he spent the majority of the story arc looking forward to dying, he steps up and puts his desires on the back burner to protect his friend and lackey Hydra Bob.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

After he lost his healing factor, Wilson claimed he felt "more alive than ever."{{issue|date=December 2012}} However, after a harsh beating from Intelligencia, Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help with Taskmaster in training.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but actually he allowed Black Box to study Wade in order to prepare his vengeance against Wilson, even letting him know Deadpool lost his healing factor.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Wade managed to defeat Black Box, Black Tom and Black Swan, but in the process his face was burned and disfigured again.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Former FBI agent Allison Kemp wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other enemies of Deadpool such as T-Ray and Slayback and trained them to kill Deadpool.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Deadpool infiltrated their base and managed to get T-Ray and Slayback killed, when Kemp was about to kill herself in an explosion which would kill Wade in the process, he convinced her not to attack him.{{issue|date=December 2012}} In that moment, he was surprised by the returned Evil Deadpool, who informed Wade that the serum they took was not permanent, reasons why Wade's face didn't heal or a finger he lost grew back, so Wade would return after Evil Deadpool shot him.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Daniel Way's Deadpool series concluded with issue 63.

As part of Marvel's [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative a new ''Deadpool'' ongoing series was launched, written by [[Brian Posehn]] and Gerry Duggan and illustrated by [[Tony Moore (artist)|Tony Moore]].<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/19199/marvel_now_qa_deadpool Marvel NOW!

Initially a secret, his bride was revealed in the web comic ''Deadpool: The Gauntlet'' to be Shiklah, Queen of the Undead.<ref>''Deadpool: The Gauntlet'' #1</ref> During the events of "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]", it was revealed that Deadpool was tricked into killing his parents, however Deadpool does not know about it.<ref>''Deadpool Vol. 4'' #32</ref>

Much later, he clashed with [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]],<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> and Carnage vowed revenge on Deadpool for tricking him into wounding [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]].<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Deadpool appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> The group of villains becomes inverted to heroes, after a spell cast by Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom.{{issue|date=November 2014}} This group was later named the Astonishing Avengers.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men'' #6</ref>

Prior to facing Red Skull's Onslaught, Deadpool was asked to join the X-Men by Storm, but turned the offer down.<ref name="Deadpool #36">''Deadpool'' #36</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. Artificially endowed by the [[Weapon X]] program, this enables him to regenerate any destroyed tissue at a super-human rate as well as making him immune to all known diseases. An unanticipated side effect was an acceleration of the cancerous tumors he was suffering from at the time, causing them to quickly spread across his entire body. Because of this, his healing factor supercharged his cancer, resulting in massive [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]] causing his appearance to be severely deformed.

Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying brain cells being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers, as the altered or damaged brain cells quickly regenerate to their original state. It is also the cause of his psychosis and mental instability. It is sometimes implied that his healing factor merely bolstered and exacerbated an underlying mental issue, as a young Wade Wilson was shown as a withdrawn, disturbed young kid caught in his many daydreams, and when Deadpool at one point lost his healing factor, he did not regain his sanity.<ref name="Deadpool #60">''Deadpool'' #60</ref> Deadpool's healing factor is strong enough that he has previously survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once. Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal the wound,<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #44</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #131</ref><ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #898</ref> he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Deadpool'' #39</ref> Unlike Wolverine's natural healing factor, Deadpool's is mentally driven. Similar to Wolverine, his healing factor also affects his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. Though in earlier years he also had super-human strength, that detail has apparently been forgotten.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36</ref> Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #12</ref> He can be affected by certain drugs such as tranquilizers, if he is exposed to a large enough dosage. Deadpool's healing factor also slows the aging process. He is still alive 800 years in the future when the new X-Force encounters him.<ref>''X-Force / Cable Messiah War'' Oneshot</ref>

Aside from his physical advantages, Deadpool is a superb [[assassination|assassin]] and [[mercenary]], adept in multiple forms of [[martial art]]s, and an expert swordsman and marksman. It is thought that while his psychosis and [[dissociative identity disorder]] are a handicap, they are also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent. [[Taskmaster]] (who has photo-reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone's fighting skills by observation) was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #38</ref> Taskmaster has also stated that Deadpool is an expert at distracting his opponents.<ref>''Deadpool-Magnum Opus Part 3'' #9</ref> Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possesses a device which projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. He also has a [[magic satchel]] containing all of his unlimited weaponry and ammo. He can also drive multiple vehicles including spaceships.<ref>''Deadpool: Space Oddity''</ref> In addition, Deadpool is [[multilingual]]; in addition to [[English Language|English]], he can speak [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

Deadpool is also able to break the [[fourth wall]] which is an ability few other characters possess. For example he knows he is in a comic book, video game, TV Show, and even Wikipedia{{cn|date=December 2014}} and can use this knowledge to his advantage. This ability is often used to comedic effect but occasionally he uses this ability to deal with opponents or gain knowledge he shouldn't by "reading" past issues of his and others comics. Other characters in the comic universe think this is part of his insanity and often don't understand who he is talking to or what he is talking about when he does it. For example, his attempts to explain to Domino multiple times that "it's a fourth wall thing.", even while yelling (in capitals), seems to be of little help in getting her to understand the concept. Deadpool also talks to the voices in his head which are represented by text in square boxes which he apparently can see on the page next to him. The boxes are sometimes yellow and sometimes white and often the yellow and white boxes tend to argue with each other.

==Identity==
The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to his mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], claims in ''Deadpool'' #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> There have been other dubious stories about his history—at one point the supervillain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] claimed to be his father.<ref name="Deadpool #36"/> Frequently, revelations are later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which the writer or the reader prefers.<ref>"Cable and Deadpool" #47</ref> In the 2011–2012 series, Deadpool is implied, in a flashback, to be the real Wade Wilson, the deranged and already partly insane son of a decorated war hero, often daydreaming childish and dangerous ideas, spurring him to the mercenary lifestyle.<ref name="Deadpool #60"/> He has professed to be Canadian,<ref>''Marvel NOW Deadpool'' #3</ref> even though the original story had him joining the Weapon X program after being kicked out of the United States Army Special Forces.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #39</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Deadpool was redubbed '''Dead Man Wade''' and reimagined as a bitter, humorless member of Apocalypse's [[Pale Riders]], having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse's eugenics program. Sent with his team to invade the Savage Land, he attempted to unleash chaos upon the sanctuary, but was killed by Nightcrawler, who teleported his head off his body and hid it in a crater.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3, May 1995</ref> In ''Age of Apocalypse'' #3 Dead Man Wade was revealed to be resurrected like many of the other Alpha mutants.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

After giving a few false origin stories, Deadpool finally reveals that he had been a street kid taken in by Fury to be a hero, though he later decided being a mercenary was easier than carrying morals and a conscience. Ultimately Spider-Man acknowledges he could have turned out like Deadpool had circumstances in his own life been different. He is shown capable of negating Taskmaster's ability to copy someone's fighting style, utilizing a fighting style that parodies various dance moves.
