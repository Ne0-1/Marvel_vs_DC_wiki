'''Deadpool''' (real name '''Wade Winston Wilson''') is a  fictional [[antihero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 [[cover-date]]d (Feb. 1991). Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''X-Force'', but has since evolved into the role of an antihero. Deadpool is a disfigured and mentally unstable [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of an accelerated [[healing factor]]. He is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the [[fourth wall]], which is used by writers to create humorous effect.

[[Ryan Reynolds]] portrayed the character in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' and will reprise the role in the upcoming 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]''.<ref>September 18, 2014, [http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/18/deadpool-movie-officially-set-for-2016-release Deadpool Movie Officially Set for 2016 Release], [[IGN]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/deadpool-movie-ryan-reynolds-cast/|title=Ryan Reynolds Confirmed To Star in ‘Deadpool’ Movie|author=Andrew Dyce|work=Screen Rant}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Further2|[[List of Deadpool titles]]}}

===1990s===
Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/10441/new_mutants_1983_98 |title=New Mutants (1983) #98 &ndash; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2015}}</ref> Deadpool made his first appearance in the pages of ''The New Mutants'' #98, [[cover date]]d February 1991. According to Nicieza, Liefeld came up with the character's visual design and name, and Nicieza himself came up with the character's speech mannerisms.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McElhatton |first=Greg |date=January 1993 |title=The Busiest Man in Comics |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |volume= |issue=17 |page=45 |publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]|quote=Rob Liefeld created Deadpool's name and look, and I came up with his snappy patter.}}</ref> Rob Liefeld, a fan of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics, showed his new character to then writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans". Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56</ref>

[[Image:Deadpool11.jpg|thumb|left|''Deadpool'' #11 (Dec. 1997), an homage to the cover of ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 featuring [[Spider-Man]]. Art by [[Pete Woods]].]]
In his first appearance, Deadpool is hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]] to attack [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in [[X-Force]] as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[limited series|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, "Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it. Someone who hasn't paid for their crimes presents a problem for me."<ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 39}}</ref>

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=2009-07-16|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

The series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me" and that by issue 37, he realized that "it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game – Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=September 2000|publisher=digitalpriest.com|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>

===2000s===
''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title by [[Gail Simone]] with a similar character called [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] in 2002. This occurred during a line wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants and X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that 'When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the aristocratic (and telepathic) villain known as the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Weeks later, a mysterious figure showed up at the apartment of Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenberg]]. The man took the name ''Alex Hayden'' and together they started "Agency X", with Hayden dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] after the company. Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool suffering from amnesia. The title character of ''Agent X'' was eventually revealed not to be Deadpool and the climax of that series saw the original character restored. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor, but then returned to conclude with issues 13-15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone has all the answers (podcast interview)|publisher=Wordballoon|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

Deadpool's next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was canceled with issue #50 and replaced by a new ''[[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|Cable]]'' series in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 – MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO???

A new ''Deadpool'' [[ongoing series]] written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen [[Veranke]].<ref name="NEWDeadpool">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |accessdate=2008-05-04 |format=news |work= }}</ref><ref name="SeptRelease">{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = [[Wolverine: Origins]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 25 | date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things."<ref name=cbr19197 /> The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]], "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself.".<ref name=cbr19197 /> This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #8-9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130-131.<ref name=cbr19197>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19197 Way Talks Deadpool & Thunderbolts, Bob], [[Comic Book Resources]], December 16, 2008</ref> ''Thunderbolts'' writer [[Andy Diggle]] said, "it's a natural progression for Deadpool to go after Norman, and for Norman to send his personal hit-squad after Deadpool."<ref name=newsaramadptb>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120816-Diggle-Tbolts-Deadpool.html Thunderbolts vs. Deadpool: FIGHT], [[Newsarama]], December 16, 2008</ref> In ''Deadpool'' #15, Deadpool decides to become a hero resulting in conflicts with proper heroes like [[Spider-Man]]<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23969 |title=Daniel Way Bets on "Deadpool" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010 }}</ref> (who he had recently encountered in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #611 as part of "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]"<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22067 |title=Deadpool Vs.

A third Deadpool ongoing series, ''Deadpool Team-Up'', launched in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by [[Fred Van Lente]], with art by Dalibor Talajic.

Another Deadpool series, titled ''Deadpool Corps'' also by Gischler, was released in April 2010.

Deadpool (vol. 2) is written by [[Daniel Way]] and drawn by [[Alé Garza]]. In the story arc "DEAD", Wade is "cured" of his healing ability and becomes mortal. As a side effect, he also has his old, unscarred face once again. Although he spent the majority of the story arc looking forward to dying, he suppresses his desires in order to protect his friend and [[sidekick]] [[Bob, Agent of Hydra|Hydra Bob]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

After he lost his healing factor, Wilson claimed he felt "more alive than ever."{{issue|date=December 2012}} However, after a harsh beating from Intelligencia, Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help with Taskmaster in training.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but actually he allowed Black Box to study Wade in order to prepare his vengeance against Wilson, even letting him know Deadpool lost his healing factor.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Wade managed to defeat Black Box, Black Tom and Black Swan, but in the process his face was burned and disfigured again.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Former FBI agent Allison Kemp wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other enemies of Deadpool such as T-Ray and Slayback and trained them to kill Deadpool.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Deadpool infiltrated their base and managed to get T-Ray and Slayback killed, when Kemp was about to kill herself in an explosion which would kill Wade in the process, he convinced her not to attack him.{{issue|date=December 2012}} In that moment, he was surprised by the returned Evil Deadpool, who informed Wade that the serum they took was not permanent, reasons why Wade's face didn't heal or a finger he lost grew back, so Wade would return after Evil Deadpool shot him.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Daniel Way's Deadpool series concluded with issue 63.

As part of Marvel's [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative a new ''Deadpool'' ongoing series was launched, written by [[Brian Posehn]] and Gerry Duggan and illustrated by [[Tony Moore (artist)|Tony Moore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19199/marvel_now_qa_deadpool|title=Marvel NOW!

Initially a secret, his bride was revealed in the web comic ''Deadpool: The Gauntlet'' to be [[Shiklah|Shiklah, Queen of the Undead]]. Deadpool also discovers that he has a daughter by the name of Eleanor from a former flame of Deadpool named Carmelita.<ref name="Deadpool #19">''Deadpool'' #19</ref>

During the events of "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]", it was revealed that Deadpool was tricked into killing his parents by a scientist known as Butler (who abducted Eleanor and gave her to his brother), however Deadpool does not know about it.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #32</ref>

Much later, he clashed with [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]],<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> and Carnage vowed revenge on Deadpool for tricking him into wounding [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]].<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

Deadpool's death occurs in ''Deadpool'' #250, involving story ideas that cowriters Gerry Duggan and Brian Posehn have had in mind since the beginning of the NOW series.<ref>[http://m.ign.com/articles/2015/01/09/marvel-reveals-deadpool-will-die-in-april-2015 Marvel reveals Deadpool will die in April 2015].

He, along with his family and friends, (''and presumably everyone on Earth'') are all killed when the Earth [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|collides with an alternate universe's Earth]]. Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.<ref>''Deadpool'' (2012) #45</ref>

Eight months after the events of ''Secret Wars'' and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Avengers'' #0</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to a mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], claims in ''Deadpool'' #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> There have been other dubious stories about his history—at one point the supervillain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] claimed to be his father.<ref name="Deadpool #36">''Deadpool'' (2012) #36</ref> Frequently, revelations are later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which the writer or the reader prefers.<ref>"Cable and Deadpool" #47</ref>

In the 2011–2012 series, Deadpool is implied, in a flashback, to be the real Wade Wilson, the deranged and already partly insane son of a decorated war hero, often daydreaming childish and dangerous ideas, spurring him to the mercenary lifestyle.<ref name="Deadpool #60"/> He has professed to be Canadian,<ref>''Marvel NOW Deadpool'' #3</ref> even though the original story had him joining the Weapon X program after being kicked out of the [[United States Army Special Forces]].<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #39</ref>

Deadpool is depicted as having an accelerated [[healing factor]], which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body, but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his [[neuron]]s are also affected by the accelerated regeneration.

}}</ref> Taskmaster has also stated that Deadpool is an expert at distracting his opponents.<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue02" />

The character is known for his talkative nature, dubbing him the "Merc with a Mouth". It is sometimes implied that his healing factor merely exacerbated an underlying mental issue, with Wilson having been a withdrawn, disturbed youth; this is demonstrated when Deadpool at one point lost his healing factor but did not regain his sanity.<ref name="Deadpool #60">''Deadpool'' #60</ref>

Despite all this, Deadpool has a strong sense of core morality; in [[Uncanny X-Force]], he storms out after [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] tries to rationalize [[Fantomex]] killing [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who was at the time in a child form. After Wolverine argues that Deadpool is motivated solely by money, [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] reveals that Deadpool never cashed any of his checks.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #5 (2011)</ref>

=== Sexual orientation ===
In December 2013, Deadpool was confirmed as being [[omnisexual]] by ''Deadpool'' writer Gerry Dugan via Twitter.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gerry Duggan on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/gerryduggan/status/408076514568065024|accessdate = 2015-09-06}}</ref> When asked about Deadpool's sexuality, co-creator Fabian Nicieza stated, "Deadpool is whatever sexual inclination his brain tells him he is in THAT moment. And then the moment passes."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fabian Nicieza on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/fabiannicieza/status/631482629494149121|accessdate = 2015-09-06}}</ref> Nicieza has also stated, "Not trying to be dismissive, but readers always want to 'make a character their own' and often that is to the exclusion of what the character might mean to other fans. I've been dogged with the DP sexuality questions for YEARS. It is a bit tiring. He is NO sex and ALL sexes. He is yours and everyone else's. So not dismissive, but rather the epitome of inclusive."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Deadpool Co-Creator Weighs in on Character's Sexuality - Comic Book Resources|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/deadpool-co-creator-weighs-in-on-characters-sexuality|website = www.comicbookresources.com|accessdate = 2015-09-06}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated [[healing factor]], depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. Artificially endowed by the [[Weapon X]] program, this enables him to regenerate any destroyed tissue at a superhuman rate, as well as making him immune to diseases.  Deadpool's healing factor is strong enough that he has previously survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal the wound,<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #44</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #131</ref><ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #898</ref> he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].{{issue|date=December 2015}}

Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying [[neuron]]s being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers,<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #8</ref><ref>''Deadpool'' #69</ref> although this ability is inconsistent.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool: Enema of the State''</ref><ref>''Agent X'' # 14</ref> It has been revealed that at the time that his healing ability was given to him, Deadpool suffered from some form of cancer. After the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as well as his cancerous cells unable to die, giving him a heavily scarred appearance beneath his suit.{{issue|date=April 2015}}

Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins, due to his enhanced cell regeneration. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated.<ref>''Deadpool'' #12</ref> He can be affected by certain drugs such as tranquilizers, if he is exposed to a large enough dosage{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

Deadpool is effectively [[immortal]], although he has died several times.<ref name="Deadpool #61">''Deadpool'' #61</ref><ref>Deadpool & Death Annual</ref> He is still alive 800 years in the future when the new X-Force encounters him.<ref>''X-Force / Cable Messiah War'' Oneshot</ref> In addition, [[Thanos]] once declared that Deadpool should "consider yourself cursed ... with life!" out of jealousy over Deadpool's status as [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Lady Death]]'s love interest.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #64</ref> His enemy T-Ray later resurrected him,<ref name="Deadpool #61"/> under Thanos' instruction, using an artifact he had given him.<ref>''Deadpool'' #64</ref> Recently, Deadpool was informed that Thanos had placed a curse on him, and tracked Thanos down. He revealed that the only thing keeping Wade alive was his "spell of darkest necromancy". Although Thanos removed this curse in order to kill Deadpool, he felt forced to immediately bring him back using "a fusion of necromancy and science" in order to request his aid in tracking down [[Mistress Death]], who had gone missing.<ref>''Deadpool vs Thanos'' #1</ref>

Deadpool is a highly trained [[assassination|assassin]] and [[mercenary]], adept in multiple forms of [[martial art]]s, and an expert swordsman and marksman. Although in earlier years he was originally portrayed as having superhuman strength, he is no longer depicted as having this ability.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36</ref>

Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possesses a device which projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. He also has a [[magic satchel]] containing all of his unlimited weaponry and ammo. Deadpool is [[multilingual]], with the ability to speak fluently in German, Spanish, and Japanese, in addition to his native English{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

Since Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional character,<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue34" /> he uses this knowledge to his advantage to deal with opponents or gain knowledge to which he should not normally have access, such as "reading" past issues of his and others' comics.<ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #885</ref> Deadpool even knows he has a Wikipedia article and hopes his fans keep his page updated.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 3 #36</ref>

==Other versions==

Despite (and because of) [[Spider-Man]]'s growing dislike for Deadpool's antics, attitudes and willingness to kill (or 'un-alive' as Deadpool says), they both end up fighting [[Taskmaster]] and each other for critical S.H.I.E.L.D. data about the secret identities of America's superheroes. After giving a few false origin stories (as well mocking Wolverine), Deadpool finally reveals that he had been a street kid taken in by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] to be a hero, though he later decided being a mercenary was easier than carrying morals and a conscience. Ultimately, Spider-Man acknowledges that the web-slinger himself could have turned out like Deadpool had circumstances in his own life been different. He is shown capable of negating Taskmaster's ability to copy someone's fighting style, utilizing an unpredictable fighting style that parodies various dance moves.

Wolverine and Victor fight Deadpool in the film's climax and manage to defeat him by decapitating him and sending him falling into a cooling tower of a nuclear power plant, although a [[post-credits scene]] appearing in DVD releases and some theatrical presentations of the film implies Deadpool is still alive, as a hand is shown reaching out for his still-living head amid the rubble of the destroyed tower.<!--Do not add info on "shushing" or breaking the fourth wall-->{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
