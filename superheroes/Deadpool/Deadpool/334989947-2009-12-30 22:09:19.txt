'''Deadpool''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by artist [[Rob Liefeld]] and writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], Deadpool first appeared in ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' #98 (Feb. 1991).

A disfigured and mentally unstable [[mercenary]], Deadpool originally appeared as a [[villain]] in an issue of ''[[New Mutants]]'', and later in issues of ''[[X-Force]]''. The character has since starred in several ongoing series, and sharing titles with other characters such as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].  The character is famous for his tendency to break the [[fourth wall]] and is frequently referred to by the moniker "[[Mercenary|Merc]] with a Mouth."

==Publication history==
===1990s===

Created by artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance in the pages of ''New Mutants'' #98 published in February 1991. Rob Liefeld, a fan of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics, showed his new character to then writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans." Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an in-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56</ref> In his first appearance, Deadpool was hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]] to attack [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in [[X-Force]] as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in various different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993 the character received his own [[limited series|miniseries]], entitled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]].  It was a relative success, and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]] and pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]].

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title,  initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=2009-07-16|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

The series was taken over by Christopher Priest who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me' and that by issue 37, he realised that 'it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game - Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=2000-09|publisher=digitalpriest.com|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>. 

===2000s===

''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title by [[Gail Simone]] with a similar character called [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] in 2002. This occurred during a line wide revamp of X-men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants/X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that 'When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>. It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the aristocratic (and telepathic) villain known as the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Weeks later, a mysterious figure showed up at the apartment of Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenberg]].  The man took the name ''Alex Hayden'' and together they started "Agency X," with Hayden dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] after the company.  Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool suffering from amnesia. The title character of ''Agent X'' was eventually revealed not to be Deadpool and the climax of that series saw the original character restored. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor <ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone has all the answers (podcast interview)|publisher=Wordballoon|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>. 

Deadpool's next appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was canceled with issue #50 and replaced by a new [[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|''Cable'']] series in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 - MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO??? AFTER ''DISASSEMBLED''], [[Newsarama]]</ref>  Deadpool then appeared briefly in the ''[[Origin (comics)|Wolverine: Origins]]'' title by writer [[Daniel Way]] before Way and Paco Medina launched another ''Deadpool'' title in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comics.3253.NYCC_%2708%3A_Deadpool_Goes_Solo NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo], Marvel.com News</ref> Medina was the main series artist, with Carlo Barberi filling in on the first issue after the [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in.<ref name=cbr18470>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18470 Merc with a Mouth to Feed: Daniel Way Talks Deadpool], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 16, 2008</ref>

A new ''Deadpool'' ongoing series written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen  [[Veranke]].<ref name="NEWDeadpool">{{cite web |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |accessdate=2008-05-04 |format=news |work= }}</ref><ref name="SeptRelease">{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = ''[[Origin (comics)|Wolverine: Origins]]'' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 25 | Date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things."<ref name=cbr19197 /> The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]], "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself.".<ref name=cbr19197 /> This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' Vol. 4 #8-9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130-131.<ref name=cbr19197>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19197 Way Talks Deadpool & Thunderbolts, Bob], [[Comic Book Resources]], December 16, 2008</ref> ''Thunderbolts'' writer [[Andy Diggle]] said, "it's a natural progression for Deadpool to go after Norman, and for Norman to send his personal hit-squad after Deadpool."<ref name=newsaramadptb>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120816-Diggle-Tbolts-Deadpool.html Thunderbolts vs. Deadpool: FIGHT], [[Newsarama]], December 16, 2008</ref>

Another ongoing Deadpool series, ''Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth'' launched in July 2009, written by Victor Gischler, with art by Bong Dazo. In it Deadpool teams up with the head of the zombie Deadpool from ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' and ''[[Marvel Zombies 4|4]]''.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20906 Getting Ahead: Gischler on New Deadpool Series], [[Comic Book Resources]], April 22, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/050912-Deadpool-Merc.html Deadpool and Head: Gischler on Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth], [[Newsarama]], May 12, 2009</ref>

A special anniversary issue titled ''Deadpool'' #900 will be released in October 2009. It will feature stories written by several authors, with the main feature written by the original ''Deadpool'' series writer Joe Kelly and drawn by Deadpool's creator Rob Liefeld. A third Deadpool ongoing series, ''Deadpool Team-Up'', will launch in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by Fred van Lente, with art by Dalibor Talajic.  This series will feature Deadpool teaming up with different heroes from the Marvel Universe in each issue, such as [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22570 Advance X-Solicits, November 2009], [[Comic Book Resources]], August 17, 2009</ref> It has also been confirmed by Chris Yost that Deadpool will soon join the cast of the new ''X-Force'' team.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22472]</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Primary sources|section|date=November 2009}}
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various artists and writers with varying levels of efficiency. Said healing factor, which was artificially endowed by the [[Weapon X]] program, enables him to regenerate any destroyed tissues or organs very quickly. However, his healing factor results in massive scar tissue causing his appearance to be deformed. The speed at which this healing factor works varies in direct proportion to the severity of the damage Deadpool suffers. Deadpool's healing factor is strong enough that he has previously survived decapitation more than once, though in each of these occurrences, his head had to be reattached to his body instead of his head growing a new body. Unlike Wolverine’s natural healing factor, Deadpool’s is mentally driven to a partial extent. As a by-product of his healing factor, he possesses enhanced strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes. At the time of the gene therapy that gave the character his healing factor he was dying of terminal cancer. An unanticipated side effect of the therapy was a rapid acceleration of the tumors as well, causing them to quickly spread across his entire body as soon as his powers fully activated. Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, which renders him resistant to telepathy.

Aside from his physical advantages, Deadpool is a superb [[assassin]] and [[mercenary]], an expert in multiple forms of martial arts, and an expert swordsman and marksman. Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possessed a device which projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. In addition, Deadpool is [[multilingual]] and has demonstrated the ability to speak [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Occasionally, Deadpool has also been shown as having a [[magic satchel]], often pulling weapons out of nowhere.<ref>http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/deadpool.htm Marvel Directory - Deadpool</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
A version of the character appears in [[Ultimate Spider-Man]]. Depicted as an anti-mutant extremist, he is a [[cyborg]] and leader of the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] who hunt mutants for sport on a reality TV show. Ultimate Deadpool's face has no skin and the top portion of his skull removed to reveal his brain. The human shape is achieved by wearing a plastic mask.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Deadpool was redubbed '''Dead Man Wade''' and reimagined as a bitter, humorless member of Apocalypse's [[Pale Riders]], having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse's eugenics program.  Sent with his team to invade the Savage Land, he attempted to unleash chaos upon the sanctuary, but was killed by Nightcrawler, who teleported his head off his body and hid it in a crater.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3, May 1995</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In [[Marvel Zombies]] a zombified Deadpool is seen fighting a zombie [[Silver Surfer]]. It is revealed that Deadpool escaped to return in [[Marvel Zombies 3]] and lose his body, in [[Marvel Zombies 4]] where his head causes trouble, and in ''Deadpool: Merc With A Mouth'', which began in July 2009 and sees the mainstream Deadpool encounter and capture the zombified Deadpool's head.<ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12208 Deadpool: Merc With A Mouth #1 - Marvel Comics Catalog]</ref>

===Marvel 2997===
In [[Messiah War]] Deadpool helps Cable to get [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] back from [[Stryfe]] who is later revealed to be inside this version of Deadpool's head. After seemingly defeating Stryfe, this version of Deadpool is quickly ripped in half and dies shortly after, his last words being a joke on "severance" pay.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/995/995458p1.html IGN: Cable #15 review]</ref>

===Weapon X: Days of Future Present===
In the alternate Earth ending of the [[Weapon X]] comic, Deadpool is recruited by Wolverine to be part of a new team of X-Men after the old team is killed. He joins, claiming Wolverine only wants him as the "token human". This version of Deadpool is killed by [[Agent Zero]]'s Healing Factor corrosive acid. This version of Deadpool speaks in white text boxes.<ref>''[[Weapon X: Days of Future Present]]''</ref>
