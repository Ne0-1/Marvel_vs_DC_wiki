'''Deadpool''' ('''Wade Wilson''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[mercenary]] and [[anti-hero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by artist [[Rob Liefeld]] and writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], Deadpool first appeared in ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' #98 (Feb. 1991).

A disfigured and mentally unstable [[mercenary]], Deadpool originally appeared as a [[villain]] in an issue of ''[[New Mutants]]'', and later in issues of ''[[X-Force]]''. The character has since starred in several ongoing series, and shares titles with other characters such as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. The character, known as the "[[Mercenary|Merc]] with a Mouth", is famous for his talkative nature and his tendency to "break the [[fourth wall]]", which is used by writers for humorous effect. Deadpool was ranked 182nd on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's list of the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html ''Wizard'' magazine's list of the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}; listed [http://www.statueforum.com/showthread.php?t=69413 in this forum thread]</ref> and ranked 45th on ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's list of The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=45|title=The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters|publisher=www.empireonline.com|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===1990s===
Created by artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance in the pages of ''New Mutants'' #98 published in February 1991. Rob Liefeld, a fan of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comics, showed his new character to then writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans." Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an in-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56</ref> In his first appearance, Deadpool was hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]] to attack [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in [[X-Force]] as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in various different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes For Hire]]''. In 1993 the character received his own [[limited series|miniseries]], entitled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success, and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]] and pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]].

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=2009-07-16|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

The series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me' and that by issue 37, he realized that 'it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game - Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=2000-09|publisher=digitalpriest.com|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>

===2000s===
''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title by [[Gail Simone]] with a similar character called [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] in 2002. This occurred during a line wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants/X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that 'When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the aristocratic (and telepathic) villain known as the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Weeks later, a mysterious figure showed up at the apartment of Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenberg]]. The man took the name ''Alex Hayden'' and together they started "Agency X," with Hayden dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] after the company. Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool suffering from amnesia. The title character of ''Agent X'' was eventually revealed not to be Deadpool and the climax of that series saw the original character restored. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone has all the answers (podcast interview)|publisher=Wordballoon|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>

Deadpool's next appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was canceled with issue #50 and replaced by a new ''[[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|Cable]]'' series in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 - MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO???

A new ''Deadpool'' [[ongoing series]] written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen [[Veranke]].<ref name="NEWDeadpool">{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |accessdate=2008-05-04 |format=news |work= }}</ref><ref name="SeptRelease">{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = [[Wolverine: Origins]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 25 | Date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things."<ref name=cbr19197 /> The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]], "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself.".<ref name=cbr19197 /> This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' vol. 4 #8-9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130-131.<ref name=cbr19197>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19197 Way Talks Deadpool & Thunderbolts, Bob], [[Comic Book Resources]], December 16, 2008</ref> ''Thunderbolts'' writer [[Andy Diggle]] said, "it's a natural progression for Deadpool to go after Norman, and for Norman to send his personal hit-squad after Deadpool."<ref name=newsaramadptb>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120816-Diggle-Tbolts-Deadpool.html Thunderbolts vs. Deadpool: FIGHT], [[Newsarama]], December 16, 2008</ref> In ''Deadpool'' #15, Deadpool decides to become a hero resulting in conflicts with proper heroes like [[Spider-Man]]<ref>{{Cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23969 |title=Daniel Way Bets on "Deadpool" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010 }}</ref> (who he had recently encountered in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #611 as part of "[[The Gauntlet (comics)|The Gauntlet]]"<ref>{{Cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22067 |title=Deadpool Vs.

==Powers and abilities==
{{Primary sources|section|date=November 2009}}
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various artists and writers with varying levels of efficiency. Said healing factor, which was artificially endowed by the [[Weapon X]] program, enables him to regenerate any destroyed tissues or organs at a super-human rate. An unanticipated side effect of the therapy was a rapid acceleration of the cancerous tumors he was suffering from at the time as well, causing them to quickly spread across his entire body as soon as his powers fully activated. Because of this, his healing factor super charged his cancer, resulting in massive [[scar tissue]] causing his appearance to be severely disfigured. Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying brain cells being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. While this allows Deadpool to recover from any and all head wounds, it is also the cause of his psychosis and mental instability, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers, as the altered (and thus damaged) brain cells quickly regenerate to their original state. Deadpool's healing factor is strong enough that he has previously survived decapitation more than once, though in each of these occurrences, his head had to be reunited with his body to heal the wound instead of his body growing a new head (or vice-versa).<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #44</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #131</ref><ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #898</ref> Unlike Wolverine’s natural healing factor, Deadpool’s is mentally driven to a partial extent. Similar to Wolverine, his healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels heightening at least his endurance and stamina. Though it had been said in earlier years that he also had super-human strength, that detail has apparently been glossed over, if not forgotten, as of late.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36</ref> Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins. For example, it is extremely difficult, though not impossible, for him to become intoxicated.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #12</ref> He can, however, be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers, if he is exposed to a massive enough dosage. As for alcohol, it appears that while he is capable of getting drunk, just like Wolverine, it takes massive amounts and the effects quickly wear off. Deadpool's healing factor also provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process to an unknown degree which cannot be measured as of yet, since he is, naturally, not old enough to see any effect. However, his life span is, apparently, extended to such a degree, that he is still alive as Deadpool 800 years from the present as shown when the new X-Force encountered him in the future.<ref>''X-Force / Cable Messiah War'' Oneshot</ref>

Aside from his physical advantages, Deadpool is a superb [[assassination|assassin]] and [[mercenary]], an expert in multiple forms of [[martial art]]s, an expert swordsman and marksman. It has also been discussed that, while his psychosis and [[dissociative identity disorder]] is a handicap, it is also one of his greatest attributes as it makes him an extremely unpredictable opponent. Taskmaster (who has Photo-Reflexive Memory which allows him to copy anyone's fighting skills by observation, thus making him their equal in battle) was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #38</ref> Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possessed a device which projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. In addition, Deadpool is [[multilingual]] and has demonstrated the ability to speak [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Occasionally, Deadpool has also been shown as having a [[magic satchel]], often pulling weapons out of nowhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/deadpool.htm |title=Deadpool |publisher=Marvel Directory |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

==Characterization==
Wade Wilson was dying from cancer when the Weapon X program offered him a chance for a cure. Undergoing procedures which attempted to recreate the healing factor of Weapon X (aka Wolverine), Wilson's cancer went into overdrive, scarring him externally and neurologically. Wilson was left in a near-catatonic state; he was deemed a failure and was sent to a facility where rejects of the Weapon Plus program were locked away. While there, he became the subject of betting among the other inmates in what was known as the dead pool. In this game, the inmates gambled on whom the warden would kill next; Wilson had been chosen as a test subject for the warden's various experiments and was given high odds for death. Wilson survived, however; eventually the healing factor manifested itself and, though still scarred and insane, he mustered enough lucidity to escape. Wilson thereafter used his abilities to become a renowned - if unstable - mercenary, taking the name of Deadpool to reflect the odds that he beat.

The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to his mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], claims in ''Deadpool'' #23 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> There have been other dubious stories about his history - at one point the supervillain Loki claimed to be his father.<ref>''Deadpool'' #36</ref> Frequently, revelations are later retconned or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether he is actually Wade Wilson depends on who happens to be writing the comics at the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Television===
* While Deadpool doesn't directly appear in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] shape-shifted into Deadpool in the episode "Whatever it Takes", and when Xavier's dark side projected an image of Deadpool to attack Wolverine in the episode "Dark Shroud" (episode 2 of the Phoenix Saga). He also appears alongside Wolverine in one of Sabretooth's mental sessions with Professor Xavier in "Deadly Reunions".
* At the time when ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' was cancelled, a proposed season two was in the works which would have included the appearance of Deadpool (with [[Nolan North]] voicing him) where he was to be sent by Weapon X to bring in Wolverine.<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=581</ref>

[[Image:ReynoldsasDeadpool.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Ryan Reynolds]] as Wade Wilson in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''.]]
* Deadpool/Wade Wilson appears in the film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', with pre-transformation Wade played by [[Ryan Reynolds]] and Deadpool/Weapon XI played by [[Scott Adkins]].<ref>{{Cite news| author=Marc Graser | coauthors=Tatiana Siegel | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Reynolds, will.i.am join 'Wolverine' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> He appears to be a highly skilled, wisecracking mercenary, who wields a pair of swords with superhuman speed and skill sufficient to deflect fully-automatic weapons fire. Alluding to this, [[William Stryker|Colonel William Stryker]] claims that he would be the perfect soldier if he could keep his mouth shut. Later in the film, Victor claims that Wade was killed off screen. However, Wade was in fact used to become "Weapon XI" a.k.a. the Deadpool (portrayed by both Reynolds and [[Scott Adkins]]), possessing other mutants' powers, including [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s healing factor, [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]]' optic blasts, [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]]'s teleportation power, and [[Chris Bradley]]'s [[technopath]]y (as seen when Stryker is controlling him through his computer). The name Deadpool in the film originates from the fact that these different powers were "pool-ed" together to make the ultimate mutant killer. He also possessed two long [[adamantium]] blades extending from his arms. Under the remote control of Stryker, Deadpool begins fighting Wolverine, and seems to be overpowering him, until Sabretooth returns to assist his brother. Wolverine then eventually gets the upper hand and cuts off Deadpool's head. In some copies of the theatrical release, there is a [[post-credits scene]] in which Deadpool's hand is seen reaching for his severed head, at which point, he opens his eyes and makes a noise.<!--Do not add info on "shushing" or breaking the fourth wall--><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/ElBicho/news/?a=7247|title=X-Men Origins:Wolverine - Deadpool Ending}}</ref> This scene was later included in all DVD releases of the film.

===Video games===
* Deadpool appears in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[John Kassir]]. Deadpool initially appears as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]], having been hired and brainwashed by [[Mister Sinister]]. He fights the united [[X-Men]] and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] in the New York City's North Side during Act 4. Deadpool is also unlocked as a playable character once the game is completed for the first time. As in the comics, Deadpool breaks the fourth wall if the player stalls enough. If the enemy Deadpool is fought using the playable Deadpool, they will argue about which one is the real Deadpool.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Posted: Oct 9, 2005 |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gt-video-x-men-legends/8010 |title=GameTrailers Review - X-Men Legends 2 |publisher=Gametrailers.com |date=2005-10-09 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

* In ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', Deadpool is a playable character from the beginning of the game with John Kassir reprising his role as the voice of the character. Gameplay-wise, he fights in nearly exactly the same manner as he does in ''X-Men Legends II''. His costumes include Classic, Ultimate (based on his Ultimate Universe counterpart), Weapon X (from the ''Deadpool: Agent of Weapon X'' arc), and Assassin (the updated costume used in ''Cable and Deadpool''). Deadpool frequently makes comments during the game that parody the other Marvel superheroes or acknowledge the fact that he's a video game character; special dialogue sequences are triggered when he speaks with [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]] (first time at Stark Tower labs), [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] (at [[Stark Tower]]), a trapped S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent in the attacked Helicarrier, [[Edwin Jarvis]], the [[Ancient One]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] (at [[Sanctum Sanctorum]]), [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] (at [[Valhalla]]), [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Nick Fury]] (at [[Attilan]]), and [[Black Bolt]]. His simulator mission is set in [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade's]] [[Murderworld]], where he battles [[Spider-Man|Dark Spider-Man]]; during the mission briefing, in which other characters' missions begin with the character discussing his/her origin, Deadpool initially tells a pastiche of the origin stories of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as his own before proceeding to tell his real origin.<ref name="MUA1">{{Cite book|title=Marvel Ultimate Alliance: Signature Series Guide |first=Thom |last=Denick |publisher=Brady Games |location=Indianapolis, Indiana| isbn=0-7440-0844-1 |year=2006 |pages=8, 9}}</ref>

* Deadpool appears in the video game adaption to ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' voiced by [[Steven Blum]].

* Deadpool appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' again voiced by John Kassir. His unmasked Ultimate Marvel appearance serves as an alternative costume. In the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions, he appears as a boss in the game's second stage, but will join the party upon his defeat when he realizes that the heroes aren't part of Titanium Man's terrorist attack. Deadpool has been written so that he is fully aware of his presence in a video game, and his dialogue throughout the title reflects this insight (for example, if the player chooses to enlist him in the Anti-Registration team, he quips to [[Maria Hill]] the possibility of being Pro-Registration "in the next playthrough" and his ingame datafile event makes mention that he believes he's in a comicbook or video game).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadpoolbugle.com/2009/04/evidence-of-deadpool-in-marvel-ultimate.html |title=Evidence of Deadpool in MUA2 |publisher=Deadpool Bugle |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvelultimatealliance.marvel.com/en/news_comments/deadpool_making_the_merc |title=Deadpool: Making the Merc |publisher=Marvelultimatealliance.marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/marvelultimateallianceiifusion/video/6213947/marvel-ultimate-alliance-2-washington-dc-gameplay-movie?tag=videos;title;6 Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 -Washington DC Gameplay Movie], [[GameSpot]]</ref><ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/marvelultimateallianceiifusion/video/6210370/marvel-ultimate-alliance-2-deadpool-interview Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 Deadpool Interview], [[GameSpot]]</ref> Also during the credits, Deadpool confronts one of the writers with a complaint about the game not starring him. In the Wii, PSP, and PS2 versions, he is playable from the start (but can only be switched in after the team splits up). As before, his dialogue during gameplay breaks the fourth wall. He appears during the credit sequence and in load screens sitting in a recliner, watching television.

* Deadpool has been confirmed as one of the playable fighters in the upcoming game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' voiced by [[Nolan North]]. Identified abilities include use of his teleporter, which will malfunction if used excessively, plus his own version of the [[Shoryuken]], and another move in which he beats his opponent with his [[Health (gaming)|health bar]] and his Hyper Combo bar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2010/may/08/four-new-marvel-vs-capcom-3-characters-confirmed/ |title=Updated: New Marvel vs. Capcom 3 characters shown : News |publisher=EventHubs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> In the trailer presented at [[E3 2010]] he is shown in a fight against Capcom's [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] from the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series.<ref>http://www.capcom-unity.com/jgonzo/blog/2010/06/15/e3_2010:_marvel_vs_capcom_3</ref>

Instead of leading an army of Reavers as he does in the Ultimate universe he uses an army of weapon-wielding fanboys and robots. He fights Ultimate Spider-Man on an [[oil platform]] as part of his newest game show called ''Pain Factor''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/111/1115287p5.html |title = The Deadly Villains of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions - Comics Feature at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref> The prize ends up being a fragment from the Tablet of Order and Chaos as Spider-Man goes around attacking Deadpool's loyal fans and destroying the cameras. When he confronts Deadpool after evading some tidal waves, Deadpool gives him the fragment which turns out to be a prop. Deadpool uses the real fragment's power to clone himself in order to fight Spider-Man. Spider-Man manages to defeat Deadpool and claim the fragment.
