'''Krystalin''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics's]] [[Marvel 2099|2099 universe]], a look at superheroes in the year [[2099]]. She was one of the founding members of a future incarnation of the [[X-Men]] called [[X-Men 2099]].

==Fictional character biography==
Krystalin was one of the founding members of the future incarnation of the X-Men assembled by [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an Chi Xan]]. She was also one of the few members to appear in almost every issue, although interaction with the team was not always a priority. 

She was among the group which tried to clear Xi'an of the murder charges against him and got captured by the '''[[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]]'''. After escaping, Krystalin went into the desert and found former '''Lawless''' member '''Victor Ten Eagles''', who was looking for confirmation on an X-Man sighting. He believed that he had seen the original [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] in the mountains and the two went to investigate. The stumbled upon a secret base used by '''Master Zhao''' and his "Chosen" group of X-Men: One-Eyed Jack, Psycho K, Wingspan, Frostbite, and Monster (who he had genetically enhanced to be more like [[Professor X|Professor X's]] original five X-Men: [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]). Using his mental powers, Zhao forced Krystalin and Victor to join his group, however they were rescued by the remainder of the X-Men arriving. 

===Family Matters===

Krystalin soon received a call saying her father, Reverend Ogada, had died. Ogada had been a member of a religious following of the ancient hero, the Black Panther (her mother followed Thor). She went to the funeral and had some disagreements with her brother Zak, who wanted her to join the Panthers and quit the X-Men. Krystalin did not agree with the group's philosophy and didn't want to leave the family she had found, and the two left agreeing to disagree. Soon after a [[paramilitary]] group called the '''Free Radicals''' kidnapped Zak, wanting the Panthers to liberate their imprisoned member, Billy the Kid. The Panthers told Krystalin to stay out of the deal, and she was happy to, preferring to take her own path. She went to a source of hers, Havana, to try and find out where Zak was being kept. Havana took Krystalin to a man named Nurf who knew the location. When she arrived she found one of the Free Radicals, Trance, holding her brother captive with her [[hypnosis]]. She said that the plans had changed and instead of an even exchange of captives she was going to attempt to free Billy the Kid. If she failed she would command Zak to commit [[suicide]]. Billy the Kid was freed and her brother survived, but the world was then rocked by a [[gamma radiation]] [[bomb]], almost costing Krystalin her life if not for the timely arrival of [[Bloodhawk]]. 

When Krystalin came to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to see Meanstreak when it was in the midst of being altered by the '''Virtual Unreality Projector''' [[Halloween Jack (comics)|Halloween Jack]] tries to goad them into admitting feelings for each other. 

===Doom And The Savage Land===

When the X-Men became the protectorates of [[Doom 2099|President Doom's]] Halo City, Krystalin saves the life of '''Morphine Somers''', one of Doom's [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members. An [[assassination|assassin]] named Herod was trying to kill all of Doom's staff. Krystalin arrived just in time to save Somers from the assault, granting the team the thanks of Doom.

As with many other mutants and humans, Krystalin and many of her X-Men allies travel to the [[Savage Land]] when most of the earth floods. She is seen working closely with the [[Fantastic Four]], who, having become lost in time, are trying to help the best they can.

==Powers==
Krystalin is capable of extracting minerals from the atmosphere to form hard [[crystalline]] constructs of various shapes and size, usually in the form of offensive weapons (such as [[bo staff]]s) but occasionally in defensive ways (such as shields, armor, and slides).

==Notes==
*During the comic book, no other name was given to Krystalin than "Krys"--a shortening of her codename. However, on her trading card it gave her name as Ruth Kristen. Her mother's last name was Porter and her father's was Ogada, so henceforth the amalgamation of all of them.

*It was inferred that Krystalin and Victor Ten Eagles had some sort of romantic fling. She was the only member of the X-Men whom Victor trusted and later in the series when Krystalin showed concern for him he told her that their relationship had been "diverting" for both of them from the stress of their lives.
