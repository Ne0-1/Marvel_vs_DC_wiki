The '''Maximums''' is a [[DC Comics]] superteam parodying [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Ultimates]] and [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], including the lower-case speech bubbles associated with the [[Ultimate Universe]] and the Avengers' battlecry "Avengers Assemble!" to their "Maximums March!" They are based in [[San Francisco]].

They were introduced in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #20 as inhabitants of an alternate world. It was eventually revealed they had been created by The [[Joker]] and [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. 

==Team members==

* Soldier ([[Captain America]]): Real name possibly Scout. A military minded and uncomprimising leader, apparently the first "super-soldier" of his world. His son "Lucky" ([[Bucky (comics)|Bucky]]) is proverbially the only super-soldier to stay dead.
* Viking ([[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]): Red-bearded, beserker son of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|frost giants]], who wields an axe forged by [[Ymir (comics)|Ymir]]. The axe is capable of wounding Superman.
* Robot ([[Iron Man]]): A living machine, believed by some to be a man in armour. Possibly the most reasonable of the Maximums.
* Monster ([[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]): Real name Becky. A young girl who becomes a rampaging monster. Vulnerable to electrical discharges.
* Skyscraper ([[Hank Pym|Giant Man]]): Real name Harvey. Apparently killed by Superman. Unlike Giant Man, Skyscraper's enormous size seems to be permanent.
* Hornet ([[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]]): Real name Jaime. Possibly a human/alien hybrid, she appears much more insect like than her Marvel Universe and Ultimate counterparts. Possibly [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]], as she was seduced by [[Godiva (comics)|Godiva]]. During her appearance she seeks vengeance for the death of her boyfriend, the Skyscraper.
* Bowman ([[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]): Real name Clive. Deceased by the time of the story, but (supposedly) still appearing as a [[ghost]].
* Wolfen ([[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]/[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]): Physically resembles the Beast, with Wolverine's costume markings on his fur. Like Wolverine, he tends to go into beserker rages.
* Bug ([[Spider-Man]]): Wisecracking young insect-based hero with four arms.

At the end of "With a Vengeance", Mxyzptlk reveals that Soldier and Wolfen are based on Batman, while Viking and Monster bear a slight resemblance to Superman's powers. As Mxy implies for Viking, "Ice axe or arctic breath, what's the diff?" (the latter power being one of [[Powers and abilities of Superman|Superman's]].)

==Enemies==
Apart from Batman and Superman, the team's greatest enemies are the Axis of Evil, parodying the [[Masters of Evil]]. The Axis members are Godiva ([[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|the Enchantress]]); Annihilate ([[Executioner (comics)|the Executioner]]); Demise ([[Grim Reaper (comics)|the Grim Reaper]]); and Rapier ([[Swordsman (comics)|the Swordsman]]/[[Black Knight (comics)#Villainous Black Knight|the Black Knight]]).

Other villains may include the Bug's archenemy Halloween (based on the [[Green Goblin]]), although the appearance of Halloween throwing Kristen off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (modeled after the death of [[Spider-Man]]'s former girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]]) turned out to be a ploy to distract Superman.

Hornet has commented that the team seems to spend most of the time fighting itself, most notably a battle with former member the Chaos Witch in which Bowman was killed (a reference to the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the events of ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'').

The Maximums' Earth also includes a version of [[Ghost Rider]] named the Skull Biker, but nothing more is known about him, except that his powers are Satanic in origin.

Additionally, [[Captain Atom]] was briefly sent here as a result of an atomic explosion involving [[Kryptonite]]. While recuperating, he was delusional, glowing green, and destroyed several buildings. He was, essentially, this Earth's equivalent to the [[Radioactive Man]].
