The '''Maximums''' are a [[DC Comics]] superteam parodying [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Ultimates]] and [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], including the lower-case speech bubbles associated with the [[Ultimate Universe]]. They are based in [[San Fransisco]].

They were introduced in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #20 as inhabitants of an alternate world. It was eventually revealed they had been created by The [[Joker]] and [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]].

==Team members==
* Soldier ([[Captain America]]). Real name possibly Scout. A military minded and uncomprimising leader, apparently the first "super-soldier" of his world. His son "Lucky" is proverbially the only super-soldier to stay dead.
* Viking ([[Thor]]). Red-bearded, beserker son of the [[frost giants]], who wields an axe forged by [[Ymir]]. 
* Robot ([[Iron Man]]/[[Vision (comics)|Vision]]). A living machine, believed by some to be a man in armour. Possibly the most reasonable of the Maximums.
* Monster ([[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]). Real name Becky. A young girl who becomes a rampaging monster.
* Skyscraper ([[Giant Man]]). Real name Harvey. Apparently killed by Superman.
* Hornet ([[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]]). Real name Jaime. Possibly a human/alien hybrid, she appears much more insect like than her Marvel Universe and Ultimate counterparts.
* Bowman ([[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]). Real name Clive. Deceased by the time of the story, but (supposedly) still apearing as a [[ghost]].
* Wolfen ([[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]/[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]). Physically resembles the Beast, with Wolverine's costume markings on his fur. Like Wolverine, tends to beserker rages. 
* Bug ([[Spider-Man]]). Wisecracking young insect-based hero with four arms. His girlfiend's name is Kristen (partly based on [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s role as the movie [[Mary-Jane Watson]], but also in appearance similar to [[Kristin Kreuk]] of TV's Smallville).

It should also be noted that, at the end of "With a Vengeance", Mxyzptlk reveals that Soldier, Viking, Monster, and Wolfen are also based on [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] themselves, with Soldier and Wolfen resembling Batman, and Viking and Monster bearing a slight resemblance to Superman's powers. As Mxy implies for Viking, "Ice axe or arctic breath, what's the diff?" (referring to Superman's arctic breath).

==Enemies==
Apart from Batman and Superman, the team's greatest enemies are the Axis of Evil, parodying the [[Masters of Evil]]. The Axis members are Godiva ([[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|the Enchantress]]); Annihilate ([[Executioner (comics)|the Executioner]]); Demise ([[Grim Reaper (comics)|the Grim Reaper]]); and Rapier ([[Swordsman (comics)|the Swordsman]]/[[Black Knight (comics)#Villainous Black Knight|the Black Knight]]).

Other villains may include the Bug's archenemy Halloween (based on the [[Green Goblin]]), although the appearance of Halloween throwing Kristen off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] turned out to be a ploy to distract Superman.

Hornet has commented that the team seems to spend most of the time fighting itself, most notably a battle with former member the Chaos Witch in which Bowman was killed (a reference to the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the events of ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'').

The Maximums' Earth also includes version of [[Ghost Rider]] named the Skull Biker, but nothing more is known about him, except that his powers are Satanic in origin.

Additionally, [[Captain Atom]] was briefly sent here as a result of an atomic explosion involving [[Kryptonite]]. While recuperating, he was delusional, glowing green, and destroyed several buildings. He was, essentially, this Earth's equivalent to the [[Radioactive Man]].
