'''Leir''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is one of the Celtic gods of [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]], god of lightning and the spear.  For ages, emnity existed between the gods of Avalon and the gods of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].

When the [[Heliopolis (comics)|Heliopolitan]] god [[Seth (comics)|Seth]] sought to make war against the other gods, he dispatched foul beasts to both Avalon and Asgard.  When [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] pursued one of these beasts, it travelled to Avalon, and he followed.  When the Celtic gods saw Thor, they blamed him for the beasts, and Leir battled Thor.  [[Hogun]] the Grim followed Thor to offer his support, and when one of the beasts appeared, the gods knew that none of them were responsible for the beasts.  The three gods battled the beast and drove it off.  Leir felt that he owed Thor a debt for helping against the winged monster, and sent a force of Celtic gods to battle the armies of Seth when he attacked Asgard.

Leir is based on [[Lyr]] in [[Celtic mythology]].
