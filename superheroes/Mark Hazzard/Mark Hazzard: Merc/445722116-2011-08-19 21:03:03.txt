'''''Mark Hazzard: Merc''''' was a [[comic book]] [[ongoing series|series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] under their [[New Universe]] [[imprint]]. The series ran for twelve issues in [[1986 in comics|1986]] and [[1987 in comics|1987]], plus one Annual, which ended the series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Backstory===
Mark Hazzard's father was a career soldier who was very demanding of Mark; although Mark was generally very successful academically and as a football player, his father was perpetually disappointed in him for not being "the best." In [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]], Mark met and fell in love with his future wife, Joan. After graduating from high school, he went to [[West Point]], where he was a cadet officer. Fed up with his father's disapproval—notably his disapproval of Joan—Mark dropped out, got married, and enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. Hazzard spent three tours in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] ironically enough discovering something at which he was, finally, among the best: combat. While "in country," Hazzard met his future accomplices Louis "Treetop" Barrington and Sgt. Major Peel. Returning home, Mark and Joan produced a son, Scotty, but Hazzard coundn't find work. Mark finally became a [[mercenary]], then a mercenary commander. Under Hazzard's leadership, his mercenary crew tended to be more scrupulous than most in its choice of clients. Mark was happy, but his wife wasn't; she gave him an ultimatum, to choose between his life as a merc or their marriage.

===The series===
The series ran for 12 regular issues and one annual.

After their divorce, Joan married a lawyer named Gordon, who had a strained relationship with Hazzard. Jealous, Gordon arranged for Hazzard to be sent on a mission in Iran, expecting him to die. Hazzard was rescued by his merc crew, and then investigated his betrayal. Tracking it back to Gordon, Hazzard strangled him but not before Gordon was able to inflict an ultimately fatal injury on Hazzard. Taken to a hospital, Hazzard was removed from life support at Scottie's request; Scottie believed his father would prefer it that way.

An eight page special was printed in February 2006 as a backup story in ''Amazing Fantasy #18'' as part of a ''Untold Tales of the New Universe'' event, which was created to commemorate '''The 20th Anniversary of The New Universe''' and would also serve as a preamble to Warren Ellis' ''newuniversal''. It was written by [[Tony Lee]] with art by [[Leonard Kirk]].
