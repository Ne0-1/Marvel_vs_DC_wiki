'''Agatha Harkness''' is a [[fictional character]], a powerful witch in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Supposedly, she was one of the original witches from the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. She somehow survived and later became a significant figure in Marvel continuity, protecting [[Franklin Richards]] as his nanny and notably becoming the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s mentor in real magic. She died helping the Fantastic Four. She also had a [[familiar]] named Ebony, a weird cat-like creature that could sense the presence of mystical beings.

==Fictional character biography==
Agatha Harkness was first introduced as [[Franklin Richards]]' governess. Through the actions of [[Nicholas Scratch]], her son, she was revealed as being a member of the previously unknown New Salem, Colorado colony of witches.  Scratch had taken control of the town and had persuaded its inhabitants that Agatha had betrayed the communities' secrets by working for the Fantastic Four. She was abducted back to the community along with Franklin so that she might be put on trial. The [[Fantastic Four]] followed and came into conflict with [[Salem's Seven]], who were Agatha's grandchildren by Scratch. The Fantastic Four eventually won out and freed Agatha. In the process, the community of New Salem was shown the evil of Scratch and he was banished to another dimension. 

Scratch would later try multiple times to escape and get his revenge on the Fantastic Four. Each time they were assisted by Agatha, who eventually disowned Scratch.

Agatha became the magical tutor for the [[Scarlet Witch]].

Eventually [[Salem's Seven]] took over the New Salem community again.  They captured Agatha and killed her by burning her at the stake, though Agatha soon made her presence known to Wanda in what appeared to be a post-death astral form. In an ensuing battle between the Scarlet Witch and Salem's Seven, the entire community's energies were drawn into Vertigo of the Seven, who lost control of them.  Wanda managed to capture some of the energy and funnel it away, but the entire town was still decimated. Following hints from Agatha's astral form, Wanda channeled the remaining energy to become pregnant with her husband, The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]'s, children.

Later, Agatha resurfaced, again alive and well, when Wanda's infant children began exhibiting odd behavior (disappearing for brief periods of time) and Wanda became unstable after her husband's dismantling; she provided no explanation for her return. After [[Mephisto]] claimed that Scarlet Witch's children were actually fragments of his own soul and reabsorbed them, Agatha briefly mind-wiped Wanda's memory of her children in an attempt to help her deal with the trauma, but she restored those memories soon after when Wanda became a pawn in a complex plot by Immortus. 

Agatha would assist the Fantastic Four again, in babysitting and in controlling Frankin Richard's fluctuating cosmic powers. She also saved the life of the Avenger [[Tigra]], who had become confused, lost and injured while trapped in a very feline form. Agatha would stick with Tigra until her powers, for the moment, were stabilized.

She went on to aid other mystics in a number of crisis situations, and trained Wanda further in the use of her powers, claiming that her mutant ability was actually to use "chaos magic," the energies derived from the demonic Chthon who had been sealed under the mountain where Wanda was born, and helped her fully resurrect the Avenger Wonder Man.

In a controversial sequence during ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #503'' (in the [[Avengers Disassembled]] storyline), Wanda, again having no memory of her children, angrily confronted Agatha about them. At the end of that issue (occurring some time after Wanda and Agatha's confrontation), [[Nick Fury]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] found what appeared to be Agatha's corpse in her home and concluded that Agatha had been dead for a long time.

In New Avengers 26 Wanda mentions that she is under the care of an Aunt Agatha, whether this is the one and the same remains to be seen.

==Powers and abilities==
Like many of the other magicians of the Marvel universe, Agatha Harkness possesses vast and almost incalculable magical powers, which she can use to manifest various effects.

==In other media==
Harkness has appeared in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'', voiced by [[Elizabeth Shepherd]]. 

Harkness has appeared in a few episodes of ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Pauline Newstone]].

In [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man: The Game]], during a race with Johnny Storm, if he is in the lead, will shout to Spider-Man "Agatha Harkness is faster than you!".

In ''[[Lessons (Buffy episode)|Lessons]]'', the first episode of season 7 of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]], [[Willow Rosenberg]]'s unseen witch teacher is referred to as "Miss Harkness," likely a cross-media reference to Agatha Harkness.

The character of [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] from the [[United Kingdom|British]] science-fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' was named after Agatha Harkness.<ref>{{cite interview
