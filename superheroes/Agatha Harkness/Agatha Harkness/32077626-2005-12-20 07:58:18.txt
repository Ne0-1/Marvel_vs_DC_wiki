'''Agatha Harkness''' is a fictional character, a powerful witch in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Supposedly, she was one of the original witches from the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. She somehow survived and later became a significant figure in Marvel continuity, perhaps most notably becoming the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s mentor in real magic. She died helping the Fantastic Four fight some villains. 

She was seemingly brought back to life by the Scarlet Witch during the [[Avengers Disassembled]] storyline. In Avengers 503, after the Scarlet Witch had been defeated, Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. found Agatha's corpse in the house she had been hiding in. It had apparently been decaying for some time.
