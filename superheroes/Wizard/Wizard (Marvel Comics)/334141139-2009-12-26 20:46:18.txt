'''The Wizard''' ('''Bentley Wittman'''), also known as '''the Wingless Wizard''', is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. His first appearance was in ''Strange Tales'' #102 and was created as an enemy for the [[Human Torch]].

==Fictional character biography==
Bentley Wittman grew up possessing near-superhuman levels of genius and was a child prodigy and chess champion. As an adult, became an inventor of great renown, selling his futuristic inventions to the wealthy and becoming quite rich. He became known as the Wizard by legally assuming this stage name and using his advanced scientific inventions to perform feats of "magic" as a stage magician and escape artist.

Intellectually bored, however, he decided to become a professional criminal and defeat Johnny Storm, who had just appeared to the world as the [[Human Torch]]. Pretending to be a victim, he was rescued by the Torch and invited him to his high-tech, futuristic mansion on Long Island where he captured the Torch with ease. The Wizard then impersonated the Torch, launching a crime spree to destroy the Torch's reputation, before being captured by the [[Fantastic Four]] and sent to prison.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #102</ref>

The Wizard had a rematch with the Human Torch before long, escaping from prison using a chemical which melted through stone.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #105</ref> With [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]], he battled the Torch again,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #110</ref> and the Wizard captured the Torch and the [[Invisible Woman]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #118</ref> The conclusion of one encounter with the Torch sent him flying uncontrollably upward by one of his anti-gravity discs, unable to descend safely. He was rescued by two other adversaries of the Torch: the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and Paste-Pot Pete (soon after, the [[Trapster]]).{{Issue|date=July 2009}} After he suggested they team up, a suggestion by the Trapster inspired him to form a team that would be a criminal counterpart to the Fantastic Four, with himself, his two rescuers, and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], who was then suffering from amnesia; becoming the Frightful Four.<ref name="Fantastic Four #36">''Fantastic Four'' #36</ref>

The Frightful Four proved to be one of the most formidable menaces that the Fantastic Four had yet encountered. The Frightful Four raided the Fantastic Four's [[Baxter Building]] headquarters, and affixed the Wizard's anti-gravity discs to the four - minus Johnny, but with [[Alicia Masters]], who managed to alert the Torch with the [[Invisible Girl]]'s flare gun. Johnny soon appeared and forced the Wizard to use his anti-grav ship to free his team members before they floated into airless space. Then, together they beat the Frightful Four until the Wizard and the Sandman exploded the Wizard's ship as a distraction, and escaped.<ref name="Fantastic Four #36"/> Later, kidnapping the Invisible Girl, they lured the Fantastic Four to a Pacific atoll where they rigged an experimental "Q-bomb" to detonate. The Fantastic Four narrowly escaped.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #38</ref> Weeks later, the Frightful Four made their third attempt. Capturing the Thing, the Wizard used his "Id Machine" to simulate the Thing's natural tendencies toward violence and brainwash him into obeying the Wizard's commands. The Fantastic Four finally managed to subdue the Frightful Four, then all but Medusa were turned over to the authorities.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #41-43</ref>

In his continued quest to crush the Fantastic Four, the Wizard has tried many iterations of the Frightful Four and has very rarely operated outside the Frightful Four. The Wizard engineered the Sandman's escape from prison, and provided him with a design for a new costume.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #57</ref> With the Trapster and Sandman, he battled Medusa.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 1 #15</ref> He formed a partnership with [[Mysterio]], and they battled the Torch and [[Spider-Man]], but were foiled by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4</ref> He battled the Fantastic Four alone,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #78</ref> and later battled them once again with the Frightful Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #94</ref> With the Trapster and Sandman, he invaded the Fantastic Four headquarters, where they encountered [[Annihilus]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #2</ref> The Wizard replaced Medusa with [[Thundra]] in the Frightful Four, and they battled the Fantastic Four and Medusa.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #129-130</ref> However, Thundra, also ended up betraying him and allying herself with the Fantastic Four as Medusa did.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #133</ref> With the Trapster and Sandman, the Wizard battled the Fantastic Four again.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #148</ref> The Wizard, Trapster, and Sandman eventually captured the Fantastic Four, and recruited the [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Brute]] (Reed Richards of the original Counter-Earth) into the Frightful Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #176-178</ref> With the Frightful Four, the Wizard later captured Spider-Man and [[Namor]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #42; ''Fantastic Four'' #218</ref> The Wizard later teamed up with the [[Plantman]], helping him to escape prison and providing him a vehicle and equipment,<ref>''Avengers'' #231-232</ref> but then ran into a conflict with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #235</ref> With the [[Mad Thinker]] and the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]], the Wizard attempted to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia Masters ([[Lyja]] in disguise).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #300</ref> The Wizard also captured the Thing and [[Franklin Richards]] in an attempt to use them against the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #301</ref>

When the Sandman appeared to give up his life of crime, the Wizard formed a new Frightful Four with [[Hydro-Man]], [[Klaw]], and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]]. They invaded Fantastic Four headquarters, but sided with the real Fantastic Four against the Fantastic Four clones created by [[Aron (comics)|Aron the Watcher]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #326-333</ref> The Wizard later engineered a mass breakout from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #26</ref> He was later broken out of prison by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to join the inner circle of villains organizing the [[Acts of Vengeance]] against the Avengers.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #158; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #327; ''Avengers'' #312</ref> He freed the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]] from prison, and sent them against Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #159</ref> With the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], he then battled the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #313</ref> However, he then inadvertently led the Avengers to the criminals' base.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #55</ref> The Wizard eventually escaped [[Ryker's Island]] Prison.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #24</ref> With the Trapster, he was also defeated by the reformed Sandman.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> Often avoiding the limelight that he once embraced, the Wizard hoped to hide from authorities using his former name Bentley Wittman. He was found by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], however, who convinced the Wizard to provide anti-gravity discs in order for them to battle [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]],{{Issue|date=July 2009}} and later, to attach to the [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] Protocol Satellites.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Later still, when the Sandman had appeared to reform his criminal ways, the Wizard took it upon himself to subject his former ally to his id machine, re-integrating the Sandman's mind and restoring him to villainy.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

Finally, when the Fantastic Four's popularity reached an all-time low, the Wizard decided it was time to re-form the Frightful Four once more. No longer motivated by petty jealousy, the Wizard believed the Fantastic Four to be the source of all his troubles, his fall from grace.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He rescued the Trapster from the Negative Zone, boosted the powers of Hydro-Man, and called upon his ex-wife, Salamandra, to round out the Frightful Four.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He also manipulated Cole, his and Salamandra's daughter, to develop a relationship with the Human Torch in order to teleport to her and bypass the Fantastic Four's defenses.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} During the resulting battle, the Wizard turned on the Trapster, revealing that he intended Cole to be the next member of the Frightful Four. When the Frightful Four defeated the heroes, the Wizard flaunted his success on television and left them humiliated.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} However, when the Wizard admitted that he only wanted to include Cole once he saw her exhibit superhuman powers, she turned on him. She sought out the Fantastic Four to lead them back to her father and to try to find a cure for her powers. The Wizard and Cole confronted each other, and Cole used one of the Trapster's traps to ensnare her father, then used her powers over gravity to bring the Wizard's lair down around him.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

===Secret War===
Wizard plays a small role in the "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]" crossover event allied with [[Lucia von Bardas]] and other B-List supervillains. He has since returned, alive and well, in ''Fantastic Four'' #546, with a Frightful ''Five'' (himself, [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], [[Trapster]], [[Hydro-Man]], and [[Klaw]]).

===Post-Civil War===
The Wizard is among the characters recruited in [[Hood (comics)|The Hood]]'s syndicate of villains.<ref>''[[New Avengers]]'' #33</ref> He is then seen in a blue uniform reminiscent of his original outfit.<ref>[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/796/796467p4.html IGN Interview: Marvel's Massive Avengers Conspiracy]</ref> He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by [[Doctor Strange]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', he is one among many of supervillains who rejoined The Hood's crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

Wizard later appeared as a member of the Intelligencia (consisting of himself, [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]], [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], [[Mad Thinker]] and his [[Awesome Android]], [[MODOK]], and [[Red Ghost]] & his Super Apes).<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha''</ref><ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Wittman is a scientific genius with Ph.Ds in several sciences, particularly in the fields of [[physics|applied physics]] and [[Particle physics|sub-atomic particles]]. He has constructed a number of devices which he employs in his criminal activities:

* His anti-gravity discs can lift several hundred pounds each, and can be remotely controlled via relays in his armor. These give him the ability to fly, which is, contrary to popular belief, accomplished ''without'' wings. He was able to create a basic one using prison workshop materials. 

* His gauntlets (alternatively referred to as ''Power Gloves'' or ''Wonder Gloves'') can unleash potent [[electricity|electrical]] blasts or use directed gravitational fields to increase his strength. The strength he can gain from his Wonder Gloves is unknown. When he constructed one for [[Imus Champion]] in an appropriate size, the villain was able to hurt both [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] in battle.

* His body armor provides him with protection from assault, and devices in his helmet allow him to [[mind control|control the minds]] of others.

In addition to being a scientist and engineer, Wittman is also a talented stage magician, escape artist, and master of disguise.

He claims to have been captain of a ship that reached the edge of the world and found a golden city, with the "Four Most Frightful" as his crew. Shortly before arriving in [[Atlantis]] with [[Doctor Doom|Otto von Doom]], he admits that this was an exaggeration.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}
