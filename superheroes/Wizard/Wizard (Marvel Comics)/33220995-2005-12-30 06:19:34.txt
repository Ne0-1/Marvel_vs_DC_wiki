'''The Wizard''' (also known as ''the Wingless Wizard'') is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  His first appearance was in Strange Tales #102.

==Character biography==
The Wizard began his career as a celebrated physicist, inventor, and stage magician.  He amassed a sizeable fortune creating specialty high-tech items for the wealthy.  Eventually he got bored and chose the challenge of defeating first the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] and then the entire [[Fantastic Four]].  A chance teaming with the [[Trapster]] and the [[The Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] inspired the Wizard to form the [[Frightful Four]].  When he encountered the then-amnesiac [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] wandering [[Europe]], he convinced her to join his group.  After his split with the Trapster, the Wizard decided to return to being a solo act.  He has since suffered the humiliation of being defeated by [[Franklin Richards]].

The Wizard wants power, glory, and most of all, a challenge.  When he realized that [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] had amassed a treasure trove of high-tech items in the [[Baxter Building]], the Wizard decided he had to have them.  Many of his plots for the Frightful Four revolved around his fixation on plundering the Baxter Building.

==Powers and abilities==
Wittman is a scientific genius, particularly in the fields of [[physics|applied physics]] and [[particle physics|sub-atomic particles]].  His ''Anti-[[Gravity]] Discs'' can lift several hundred pounds each, and can be remotely controlled via relays in his armor.  His gauntlets (alternatively referred to as ''Power Gloves'' or ''Wonder Gloves'') can unleash potent [[electricity|electrical]] blasts or use directed gravitational fields to increase his strength.  His armor provides him with protection from assault, and devices in his helmet allow him to [[mind control|control the minds]] of others.
