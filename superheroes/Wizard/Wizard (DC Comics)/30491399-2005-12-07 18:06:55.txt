The Wizard is the name of a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[supervillain]].

==History==

William I. Zard was possibly born in 1910. William grew up hard and became a petty criminal at an early age. He worked for organized criminals as a gun man which led him to time in jail. After being paroled, Zard left for [[Tibet]] to study the mystic arts.

After completing each task, Zard became the Wizard and joined the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] and left to start a life of crime. He had been known to use illusions to fake his demise.

==The Wizard and the Injustice Society==

The Wizard helped to form the [[Injustice Society]] with [[Per Degaton]], [[Vandal Savage]], the [[Thinker (DC Comics)#Thinker I|Thinker]], the [[Gambler (comics)|Gambler]], and [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]]. Together, they fought the Justice Society and were thwarted by them. After his escape, he later recruited [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]], [[Tigress (comics)|Tigress]], [[Icicle (comics)#Icicle I|Icicle]], [[Harlequin (comics)#Molly Mayne|Harlequin]], and [[Sportsmaster]]. Harlequin betrayed the Injustice Society to help her one true love [[Green Lantern]] and the villains were sent to jail once more.

In the 1940's, the Wizard was contacted by [[Colonel Future]] to help get revenge on [[Superman]] by removing him from existence. Unfortunately, the Wizard accidentally eliminated his memory. When Clark Kent married [[Lois Lane]], Lois pursuaded the Wizard to restore his memory (which was a success) and Superman battled The Wizard. Superman's memory was restored and the Wizard was sent to jail.

Wizard later joined with Fiddler, Icicle, and villains from Earth-1 to form the [[Crime Champions]] to fight not only the Justice Society, but also the [[Justice League]] in a battle on both worlds until they were defeated.

==Bronze Age and Beyond==

By the 1970's, Zard and the other Injustice Society members invaded the Justice Society headquarters, severly injured [[Hourman]] and staged a crime spree that spanned the globe. They were later apprehended.

Soon, he and the Injustice Society members went to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-1|Earth-1]] to recruit younger villains to fight the Justice Society. The Wizard went there with the Fiddler with the unexpected side effect of reduced power. There, he was recruited into [[Darkseid]]'s [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] which he later took over with other villains who revolted. The Wizard was later apprehended and sent to jail. The Wizard led the Secret Society back to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-2|Earth-Two]] in a plot to capture the JSA, which was a success when they captured the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], [[Dr. Mid-Nite]], and [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]. The JSA were alerted and defeated them.

Sometime later, he moved to Canada and joined with the Fiddler and the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]] as well as new villains [[Icicle (comics)#Icicle II|Icicle]] II, [[Tigress (comics)|Artemis Crock]] (later called Tigress), [[Harlequin (comics)#Marcie Cooper|Harlequin]] III and [[Hazard (comics)|Hazard]], to form the group [[Injustice Society#2nd Formation|Injustice Unlimited]], the second incarnation of the Injustice Society, where they fought [[Infinity, Inc.]] and the [[Global Guardians]]. The Wizard was knocked out by the second generation Hourman and presumably killed. Zard still had the trick of faking his death and attacked Earth-1 with his group of supervillains.

The Wizard appeared in the ''JSA All-Stars'' miniseries in which he disguised himself as the villain Legacy and captured the elder members of the Justice Society.  Recently, he has appeared in issues of ''JLA'' with a reformed Secret Society of Super-Villains looking to avenge themselves against the forced erasure of their memories.

==Powers==

The Wizard is an expert magician using illusions when faking his deimise and other array of magic tricks.
