'''Slapstick''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created in the early [[1990|nineties]]. He debuted in ''Slapstick #1'', November ([[1992]]), created by Len Kaminski and James Fry.

==History==
Slapstick resembles an [[animation|animated]] [[clown]] and has the abilities of a slapstick cartoon character, such as one from Looney Tunes, including warping reality to match that of an animated cartoon.

==Fictional character biography==
Slapstick was originally class clown Steve Harmon, who accidentally fell into an alien funhouse mirror, having his molecules nearly stretched across 3741 dimensions until the Scientist Supreme of Dimension X helped Steve master his new form, a body composed of living [[unstable molecules]] dubbed ''Electroplasm'', which essentially made him a living cartoon character. Using his new powers, Steve freed many captive earthlings from the evil Clowns from Dimension X. Later, Slapstick teamed up with the New Warriors to fight Dr. Yesterday and dropped into "character limbo" shortly after, until the recent Civil War era.  

He is a friend of [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]] of [[the New Warriors]] and is described as "The hero who doesn't fight crime but rather plays cruel tricks on it".

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
In ''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (July, 2006), Slapstick helped the surviving members of the New Warriors find Carlton LaFroyge, a.k.a. [[Hindsight Lad]], the young man and former Warrior responsible for outing the secret identities of past Warriors and allies to the public.  LaFroyge was stopped before Slapstick's identity was made public.

==Powers==
As Slapstick, Steve Harmon's body is made out of Electroplasm, which makes him indestructible. Any damage that he takes can be immediately shaken off, similar to popular [[slapstick]] cartoon characters.  He also has the capability to stretch like such a cartoon character.
In addition, Slapstick gets temporarily stronger when electrocuted.
Slapstick's gloves also possess strange alien technology. His left glove has a transformation inducer that allows him to transform from Slapstick to his normal Steve Harmon form and back. His right glove contains an extradimensionally sub-spacial storage pocket, which functions similar to cartoon [[hammerspace]], and allows him to store items seemingly nowhere. He can access these items by making a special gesture with that hand, though to anyone observing it would appear he is pulling them out of thin air. He usually keeps a large cartoonish mallet in this space. It has been noted that Steve Harmon has no genitalia in his Slapstick form, much to his disappointment.

==Alternate version==
In the [[alternate universe]] of ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' (Earth-1298 in the [[Marvel Comics Multiverse]]), Slapstick was a member of a group of supernatural heroes called the Lethal Legion (no connection to the [[Lethal Legion|Earth-616 villain group]]). Little is known about this version of the character, and why he joined the team. He was killed by the [[Goblin Queen]], disguised as the [[Beyonder]].
