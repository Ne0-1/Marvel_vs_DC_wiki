'''Slapstick''' ('''Steve Harmon''') (born [[October 24]]) is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created in the early [[1990s in comics|nineties]]. He debuted in ''Slapstick #1'', November ([[1992 in comics|1992]]), created by Len Kaminski and James Fry. He resembles an [[animation|animated]] [[clown]] and has the abilities of a slapstick cartoon character, such as one from [[Looney Tunes]], including warping reality to match that of an animated cartoon.

==Publication history==
In 1992, Slapstick made his Marvel debut in a four issue limited series, which guest starred mainstream Marvel characters. Afterwards, he made one other notable appearance, with the New Warriors in [[Marvel Comics Presents]], and was unseen until a ''Civil War'' cameo in ''She-Hulk''. Now, he regularly appears in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' as a recruit.

==Fictional character biography==
Slapstick was originally class clown Steve Harmon. In a plan to get back at his archrival Winston, Steve dresses as a clown to blend into the crowd at a strange new carnival.

Before Steve could enact his plan, Winston and his date, Heather, were kidnapped by several clowns. Steve picks up a mallet as a weapon and follows them. The group enters the carnival funhouse and enter a portal disguised as a mirror. As it was closing, Steve follows.

At the moment of entry, an energy burst races across Steve's world, alerting the senses of several beings, such as [[Doctor Strange]], [[Silver Surfer]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Howard the Duck]].

His molecules stretch across 3741 dimensions and Steve ends up in the realm of the Scientist Supreme of Dimension X (who resembles [[Groucho Marx]]). The scientist helps Steve master his new form, a body composed of living [[unstable molecules]] dubbed ''Electroplasm''. This essentially makes him a living cartoon character. The scientist, who had been ousted from his position by the Overlord, theorizes that Steve had come to his new form because he was slightly out of synch when entering the funhouse portal.

Using his new powers and a map the scientist had, Steve freed many captive Earthlings from the evil Clowns from Dimension X and their ruler, the Overlord. It is learned that this is what the scientist had intended all long. The Overlord's plan had been to brainwash Earthlings enough so their belief would be sufficient to give Overlord whatever he desired. The Overlord's plans were foiled when the belief that held up his castle gave way as the humans regained their right minds. The castle crashes. The captured humans run to the portal, followed quickly by the monstrous clowns. Steve destroys the mirror, eradicating the clown's influence on this reality.

Minutes afterward, Steve is found by his best friend, who agrees to assist him.

===Other Enemies===
Steve has other villains to confront: a Punisher copycat called the Overkiller attacks Steve simply because he is different. The two fight in a mall, destroying most of it. Steve ends the fight by literally kissing Overkiller and then walloping him while the man reacts with disgust. [[Spider-Man]] assists with the battle.  There was also a homeless man, the Neutron Bum, with the power to cause explosions. The vagrant was furious over the price of coffee and decided to take it out on society by blowing up random parts of New York, such as a local Tower Records. Neutron Bum, despite his fixation on the unfairness of high coffee prices, seemingly could not keep the actual price of it straight. Despite the gathering of dozens of superheroes willing and planning to fight the man, Slapstick simply neutralizes the situation by getting Neutron Bum what he had been yelling for all along, a cup of coffee (and then blindsiding the man from behind while he's drinking it).

He is a friend of [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] of the [[New Warriors]] and is described as "The hero who doesn't fight crime but rather plays cruel tricks on it."

Later, Slapstick teamed up with the New Warriors to fight Dr. Yesterday, partly because doing so would impress women. He is not seen for some time.  It has been established that at some point prior to [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and [[Firestar]] leaving the New Warriors to become [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Slapstick and [[Ultra Girl]] are made official members of the Warriors and given communicators, after helping the team stop a [[Badoon]] invasion<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #10">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10</ref>.

===Civil War===
Slapstick helped the surviving members of the New Warriors find [[Hindsight (comics)|Hindsight Lad]], the young man and former Warrior responsible for outing the secret identities of past Warriors and allies to the public. LaFroyge was stopped, arrested by the authorities, before Slapstick's identity was made public<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (July, 2006)</ref>.

===The Initiative===
Slapstick is later seen on the bus of new recruits arriving at [[Camp Hammond]] as part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] training program<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref>. He is later seen, with other heroes, confronting [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] as part of a training mission.

Slapstick and other Camp Hammond members are sent out as crowd control when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] leads an attack on New York. Slapstick and other members are imprisoned by Hulk's forces in Madison Square Garden and neutralized with power-sapping technology. They are rescued by black ops forces associated with the Camp.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4 & #5</ref> In a recent issue of the The Initiative, it is shown that it was Slapstick who attacked and almost killed [[Gauntlet (comics)|the Gauntlet]] out of loyalty to the New Warriors, in retaliation for Gauntlet's use of the team's name as an insult.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #6</ref> He has since tried to admit this to his teammates but is almost comically interrupted. He later comes in possession of a device containing the memory and personality of [[Michael Van Patrick#KIA|KIA]], villainous clone of Michael Van Patrick, and decides to keep him away for further use <ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #11">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #11</ref>

Slapstick and several other former New Warriors have recently been recruited by Justice and apparently [[desertion|deserted]] from the Initiative, after Justice finds evidence of shady activities within the organization<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #10"/>.  After helping to stop KIA's rampage, this new group officially quits the Initiative, intending to act as a form of independent oversight for the program; as legally registered heroes, they are free to act unless they break the law while doing so.  When asked to change to his less conspicuous normal form, Slapstick admits that he has not done so since joining the Initiative, and claims that the mechanism that activates the change no longer works.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
* As Slapstick, Steve Harmon's body is made out of Electroplasm, which makes him indestructible. Any damage that he takes can be immediately shaken off, similar to popular [[slapstick]] cartoon characters.  It has been shown that the molecular bonds of the Electroplasm can be disrupted by a counter charge of a specific frequency of energy, reducing Slapstick to an immobile "puddle"; however, another energy charge can restore him to "normal".<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #11"/>
* He also has the capability to stretch like such a cartoon character.
* In addition, Slapstick gets temporarily stronger when electrocuted. However, he must have a consistent feed of electricity to maintain this strength.  Certain electrical fields destabilize his electroplasmic form, turning him into a sentient puddle.
* Slapstick's gloves also possess alien technology. His left glove has a transformation inducer that allows him to transform to and from Slapstick to his normal Steve Harmon form. His right glove contains an extra-dimensionally sub-spacial storage pocket, which functions similar to cartoon [[magic satchel|hammerspace]], and allows him to store items seemingly nowhere. He can access these items by making a special gesture with that hand, though to anyone observing it would appear he is pulling them out of thin air. He usually keeps a large cartoon-ish mallet in this space. Recent accounts have shown similar pockets in the pants of his costume.  Objects stored in these pockets are apparently undetectable by conventional means; for example, Slapstick carried his New Warriors communicator, left forgotten in a pants pocket, into Camp Hammond without any of the base's security measures detecting it.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #10"/>
* It has been noted that Steve Harmon has no genitalia in his Slapstick form, much to his disappointment.

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
In the alternate universe of ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' (Earth-1298 in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Comics Multiverse]]), Slapstick was a member of a group of supernatural heroes called the Lethal Legion (no connection to the [[Lethal Legion|Earth-616 villain group]]). Little is known about this version of the character, and why he joined the team. He was killed by the [[Madelyne Pryor|Goblin Queen]], disguised as the [[Beyonder]].
