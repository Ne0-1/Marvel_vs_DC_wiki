'''Slapstick''' ('''Steve Harmon''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created in the early [[1990|nineties]]. He debuted in ''Slapstick #1'', November ([[1992]]), created by Len Kaminski and James Fry. He resembles an [[animation|animated]] [[clown]] and has the abilities of a slapstick cartoon character, such as one from Looney Tunes, including warping reality to match that of an animated cartoon.

==Publication history==
In 1992, Slapstick made his Marvel debut in a four issue limited series, which guest starred mainstream Marvel characters. Afterwards, he made one other notable appearance, with the New Warriors in [[Marvel Comics Presents]], and was unseen until a Civil War cameo in ''She-Hulk''. Now, he regularly appears in [[Avengers: The Initiative]] as a recruit.

==Fictional character biography==
Slapstick was originally class clown Steve Harmon. In a plan to get back at his arch-rival Winston, Steve dresses as a clown to blend into the crowd at a strange new carnival.

Before Steve could enact his plan, Winston and his date, Heather, were kidnapped by several clowns. Steve picks up a mallet as a weapon and follows them. The group enters the carnival funhouse and enter a portal disguised as a mirror. As it was closing, Steve follows. 

At the moment of entry, an energy burst races across Steve's world, alerting the senses of several beings, such as [[Doctor Strange]], [[Silver Surfer]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Howard The Duck]].

His molecules were stretched across 3741 dimensions and Steve ends up in the realm of the Scientist Supreme of Dimension X (who resembles [[Groucho Marx]]). The scientist helps Steve master his new form, a body composed of living [[unstable molecules]] dubbed ''Electroplasm''. This essentially makes him a living cartoon character. The scientist, who had been ousted from his position by the Overlord, theorizes that Steve had come to his new form because he was slightly out of synch when entering the funhouse portal.

Using his new powers and a map the scientist had, Steve freed many captive earthlings from the evil Clowns from Dimension X and their ruler, the Overlord. It is learned that this is what the scientist had intended all long. The Overlord's plan had been to brainwash earthlings enough so their belief would be sufficient to give Overlord whatever he desired. The Overlord's plans were foiled when the belief that held up his castle gave way as the humans regained their right minds. The castle crashes. The captured humans run to the portal, followed quickly by the monstrous clowns. Steve destroys the mirror, eradicating the clown's influence on this reality.

Minutes afterward, Steve is found by his best friend, who agrees to assist him.

===Other Enemies===
Steve fights other villains. There was a Punisher copy-cat called the Overkiller who attacks Steve simply because he is different. The two fight in a mall, destroying much property. Steve ends the fight by literally kissing Overkiller and then walloping him while the man reacts with disgust. [[Spider-Man]] assists with the battle. There is the evil-genius child his love interest was babysitting. The child has access to powerful equipment which endangers Steve and everyone else involved. There was also a homeless man, the Neutron Bum, with the power to cause explosions. The bum was furious over the price of coffee and decided to take it out on society by blowing up random parts of New York, such as a local Tower Records. The man, despite his concentration on the unfairness of coffee, seemingly could not keep the actual price of it straight. Despite the gathering of dozens of superheroes willing and planning to fight the man, Slapstick simply neutralizes the situation by getting Neutron Bum what he had been yelling for all along, a cup of coffee.

He is a friend of [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]] of [[the New Warriors]] and is described as "The hero who doesn't fight crime but rather plays cruel tricks on it."

Later, Slapstick teamed up with the New Warriors to fight Dr. Yesterday, partly because doing so would impress women. He is not seen for some time.

===Civil War===
Slapstick helped the surviving members of the New Warriors find [[Hindsight Lad]], the young man and former Warrior responsible for outing the secret identities of past Warriors and allies to the public. LaFroyge was stopped, arrested by the authorities, before Slapstick's identity was made public<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (July, 2006)</ref>.

===The Initiative===
Slapstick is later seen on the bus of new recruits arriving at [[Camp Hammond]] as part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] training program<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref>. He is later seen, with other heroes, confronting [[Ben Grimm]] as part of a training mission. 

Slapstick and other Camp Hammond members are sent out as crowd control when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] leads an attack on New York. Slapstick and other members are imprisoned by Hulk's forces in Madison Square Garden and neutralized with power-sapping technology. They are rescued by black ops forces associated with the Camp.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4 & #5</ref> In a recent issue of the The Initiative, it is shown that it was Slapstick who attacked and almost killed [[Gauntlet (comics)|the Gauntlet]] out of loyalty to the New Warriors, in retaliation for Gauntlet's use of the team's name as an insult.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*As Slapstick, Steve Harmon's body is made out of Electroplasm, which makes him indestructible. Any damage that he takes can be immediately shaken off, similar to popular [[slapstick]] cartoon characters.  
*He also has the capability to stretch like such a cartoon character.
*In addition, Slapstick gets temporarily stronger when electrocuted. However, he must have a consistent feed of electricity to maintain this strength.
*Slapstick's gloves also possess alien technology. His left glove has a transformation inducer that allows him to transform to and from Slapstick to his normal Steve Harmon form. His right glove contains an extra-dimensionally sub-spacial storage pocket, which functions similar to cartoon [[hammerspace]], and allows him to store items seemingly nowhere. He can access these items by making a special gesture with that hand, though to anyone observing it would appear he is pulling them out of thin air. He usually keeps a large cartoon-ish mallet in this space. 
*It has been noted that Steve Harmon has no genitalia in his Slapstick form, much to his disappointment.

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
In the alternate universe of ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' (Earth-1298 in the [[Marvel Comics Multiverse]]), Slapstick was a member of a group of supernatural heroes called the Lethal Legion (no connection to the [[Lethal Legion|Earth-616 villain group]]). Little is known about this version of the character, and why he joined the team. He was killed by the [[Goblin Queen]], disguised as the [[Beyonder]].
