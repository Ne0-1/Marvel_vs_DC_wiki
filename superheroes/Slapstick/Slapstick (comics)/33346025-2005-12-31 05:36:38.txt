'''Slapstick''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created in the mid [[1990|nineties]].  He resembles an [[animation|animated]] [[clown]] and has the abilities of a cartoon character, including warping reality to match that of an animated cartoon.  He is a friend of [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]] of [[the New Warriors]] and is described as "The hero who doesn't fight crime but rather plays cruel tricks on it".

Slapstick was originally class clown Steve Harmon who accidentally fell into an alien funhouse 
mirror,having his molecules nearly stretched across 3741 dimensions until an extremely witty
extra-dimensional scientist helped Steve master his new form,a body composed of living [[unstable molecules]] dubbed Electroplasm,which essentially made him a living cartoon character.Using his new powers,Steve freed many captive earthlings from the evil Clowns from Dimension X.
