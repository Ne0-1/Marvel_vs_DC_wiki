'''Ch'od''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]], usually seen in the [[X-Men]] series and various spin-offs. He first appeared in ''X-Men'' #104 (April 1977).

==Fictional character biography==
Ch’od is one of the founding members of the [[Starjammers]].  Though he can be a fierce combatant, he is usually genial and friendly in social interactions (though his sheer size and lizard-like appearance can be intimidating to those unfamiliar with him or his species). Ch’od is accompanied by his small, furry intelligent alien pet [[Cr’reee]], from the planet Lupus.

Ch'od was born in the planet Timor (Varanus IV), in the Shi'ar Empire. Ch'od was once a slave on the planet Alsibar, where he met the other original three beings who would become Starjammers, until [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] leads a rebellion.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #15</ref> The group ends up operating out a powerful starship, and gain the membership of [[Sikorsky (comics)|Sikorsky]], a powerful, insectoid doctor.

Ch'od has been with the Starjammers through all their adventures, such as combating the alien Brood, helping [[Professor X]] gain an entirely new body and being on the run from the Shi'ar Empire, when they harbored its longtime ruler, [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]]. The Starjammers not only have the trust of the X-Men, but the Earth's other major super-team, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. 

Ch'od first met the [[X-Men]] when the Starjammers came to aid them against [[D'Ken]]'s [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #107</ref> He helped save [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]'s life in outer space, and engaged in mock combat with [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #157-158</ref> With the Starjammers, he aided the [[New Mutants]] against the [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #50</ref>

Ch'od and [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]] sought the "map-rod" holding information on the location of the "Phalkon" power source, which was actually the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]. [[Deathbird]]'s Shi'ar starships attacked the Starhammers. The Starjammers went to Earth and met [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], and aided a rebellion against Deathbird on a Shi'ar border world.<ref>''X-Men Spotlight on: Starjammers'' #1-2</ref> 

For a time he and his fellow Starjammers were imprisoned and replaced by the [[Skrull|Warskrulls]], who were attempting to conquer the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. The Warskrulls impersonated the Starjammers and key members of the Imperial Guard, until the [[X-Men]] helped rescue them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275-277</ref> 

Ch'od battled [[Wonder Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] while escorting the Shi'ar nega-bomb.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #8</ref> Later, Ch'od and the Starjammers assist when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] needs help infiltrating the Troyjan Empirer. Its leader, a warlord, is threatening the lives of the Hulk's friends.

Ch'od has recently suffered the death of his loyal friend Corsair and less tragically, Hepzibah's stranding on Earth. Several X-Men have remained with the Starjammers.
