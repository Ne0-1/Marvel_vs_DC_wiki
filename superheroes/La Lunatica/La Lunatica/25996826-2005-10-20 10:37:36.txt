La Lunatica was a character in X-Men 2099 that originally worked for the villainous Brimstone Love as a bodyguard and assassin. Eventually, she left his and followed around the X-Man Skullfire for a time, before joining the [[X-Men 2099]] as a whole.

La Lunatica had completely white skin and hair, and elongated canine teeth, making her appear much like a vampire. She was extremely strong and superhumanly fast, so much so that she was able to outmanuever Meanstreak, the 2099 equivalent of [[Quicksilver]].She also demonstrates a superhuman resistance to injury.

La Lunatica was, not surprisingly, effectively insane. She was prone to violence and dangerous behavior, and enjoyed fighting with people weaker than she was.
