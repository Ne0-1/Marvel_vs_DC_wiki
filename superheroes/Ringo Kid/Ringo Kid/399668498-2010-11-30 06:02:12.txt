The character is unrelated to the actor [[John Wayne]]'s "Ringo Kid" in the classic Western [[movie|film]] ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]''.

==Publication history==
The Ringo Kid debuted in the [[anthology]] ''Wild Western'' #26 (Feb. 1953). His series ''Ringo Kid'' (first three issues titled ''Ringo Kid Western'') ran 21 issues (Aug. 1954 - Sept. 1957), with his adventures drawn primarily by [[Joe Maneely]] and [[Fred Kida]] <!--Backup features were usually TK or an anthological Western tale.--> Stories ran occasionally as well in ''Wild Western'' — with artist [[John Severin]] taking the reins in at least issues #46-47 (Nov. 1955 - Jan. 1956) — and Ringo was the lead feature in the two-issue anthology series ''Western Trails'' (May & July 1957).

Marvel reprinted the series in ''Ringo Kid'' Vol. 2, #1-30 (Jan. 1970 - Nov. 1976), often with the original Maneely covers. The Ringo Kid made his first appearance in present-day stories in a [[time travel]] tale in the [[superhero]]-team comic ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #142 (Dec. 1975)

Marvel writer [[Steve Englehart]] planned a revival series at about this time, with art by [[Dick Ayers]]: "Every series I did took off so Marvel kept giving me more. I relaunched this classic Western — always my favorite of Marvel's true cowboy heroes (as opposed to the Two-Gun Kid, whom I also liked but who was more a superhero) — with classic Western artist Dick Ayres [sic]. But after this first issue was drawn and scripted, Marvel decided to do more superheroes and fewer cowboys, so it was set aside before inking".<ref>[http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Ringo%20Kid%201.html Steve Englehart official site: Ringo Kid]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The Ringo Kid, dressed all in black, is a heroic [[Old West]] [[gunslinger]] of the 19th Century American West with a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] father and a [[Comanche]] mother. She is referred to as "a Comanche princess," but as the Comanche did not have royalty this is a figurative term, like "[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]". He was treated as an outcast because of his mixed heritage.  With his Comanche sidekick Dull Knife, he roamed the frontier atop his horse, Arab. His specific mission or goal appears not to have been stated explicitly, but there is intimation of some law-enforcement function: As many covers note breathlessly, "Ringo!" is "The name that makes killers tremble!"
