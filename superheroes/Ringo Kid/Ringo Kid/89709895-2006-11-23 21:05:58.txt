'''The Ringo Kid'''  is a [[fictional]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]], whose [[comic book]] series was originally released by the company's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. A lesser-known character than the company's [[Kid Colt]], [[Rawhide Kid]] or [[Two-Gun Kid]], he also appeared in a reprint series in the 1970s.

The Kid, dressed all in black, is an [[Old West]] [[gunslinger]] with a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] father and a [[Comanche]] mother. She is referred to as "a Comanche princess," but as the Comanche did not have royalty this is a figurative term, like "[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]". With his Comanche sidekick Dull Knife, he roamed the frontier atop his horse, Arab. His specific mission or goal appears not to have been stated explicitly, but there is intimation of some law-enforcement function: As many covers note breathlessly, "Ringo!" is "The name that makes killers tremble!"

The Ringo Kid debuted in the anthology ''Wild Western'' #26 (Feb. 1953). His series ''Ringo Kid'' (first three issues titled ''Ringo Kid Western'') ran 21 issues (Aug. 1954 - Sept. 1957), with his adventures drawn primarily by [[Joe Maneely]] and [[Fred Kida]] <!--Backup features were usually TK or an anthological Western tale.--> Stories ran occasionally as well in ''Wild Western'' — with [[John Severin]] taking the reins in at least issues #46-47 (Nov. 1955 - Jan. 1956) — and Ringo was the lead feature in the two-issue anthology series ''Western Trails'' (May & July 1957).

Marvel reprinted the series in ''Ringo Kid'' Vol. 2, #1-30 (Jan. 1970 - Nov. 1976), often with the original Maneely covers. 

Marvel writer [[Steve Englehart]] planned a revival series at about this time, with art by [[Dick Ayers]]: "Every series I did took off so Marvel kept giving me more. I relaunched this classic Western — always my favorite of Marvel's true cowboy heroes (as opposed to the Two-Gun Kid, whom I also liked but who was more a superhero) — with classic Western artist Dick Ayres [sic]. But after this first issue was drawn and scripted, Marvel decided to do more superheroes and fewer cowboys, so it was set aside before inking."

The character is unrelated to the actor [[John Wayne]]'s "Ringo Kid" in the classic Western [[movie|film]] ''[[Stagecoach (film)|Stagecoach]]''.
<!--Rawhide Kid #79
He teamed up with the Two-Gun Kid, the Rawhide Kid, the Phantom Rider, and the Avengers on various occasions.
