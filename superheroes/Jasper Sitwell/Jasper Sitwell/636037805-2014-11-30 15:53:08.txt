'''Jasper Sitwell''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[espionage]] agent in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #144 (May 1966).

==Publication history==
Jasper Sitwell appears as an agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], beginning in the feature "[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]" in Marvel Comics' ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #144 ([[cover-date]]d May 1966) and continuing into the subsequent ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' comic-book series in 1968. He became the S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to [[defense industry]] contractor Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]) beginning in the "Iron Man" feature in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #93 (Sept. 1967), and continuing into that subsequent series as well. He was seldom featured from the early 1970s until the 1988 [[miniseries]] ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and then again in the 1996-1997 series ''Iron Man'' vol. 2. Sitwell afterward appeared in a three-issue arc of the [[superhero]]-team series ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' in 2000, and in ''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #1 (Jan. 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
Jasper Sitwell graduated at the top of his class at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, with particularly high marks in airborne jump school and underwater maneuvers. When first introduced to S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Director [[Nick Fury]], the new agent's eager-beaver attitude meets initially with mock (and occasionally real) frustration from Fury and second-in-command [[Dum Dum Dugan]], but Sitwell soon proves himself and earns his fellow agents' respect &mdash; albeit tinged with occasional humor aimed at his youthfulness and idealistic naïveté. Mentored by Fury himself and occasionally appointed interim director when Fury is on solo missions in the field, Sitwell later is assigned to Stark Industries as liaison between S.H.I.E.L.D. and that defense-industry contractor, which designs and manufactures much of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ordnance and equipment.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #95. Marvel Comics.</ref> There he confronts costumed [[Assassination|assassins]] and [[terrorists]] such as [[Grey Gargoyle]], [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] (who shoots him and puts Sitwell in a [[coma]] for a time),<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol.1 #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], and even romances Whitney Frost ([[Madame Masque]]),<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 1 #104. Marvel Comics.</ref> a one-time Stark paramour. Sitwell is eventually reassigned back to S.H.I.E.L.D.,{{issue|date=June 2012}} but continues to play a role in the affairs of Tony Stark from time to time. When [[Obadiah Stane]] takes over what was by then named Stark International, Fury sends Sitwell on an ultimately failed attempt to retrieve Stark's [[Iron Man]] armors.<ref>''[[Iron Man]]'' Vol.1 #174. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sitwell, like most of the S.H.I.E.L.D. leadership at the time, is seemingly killed by a self-aware, renegade "Deltan" variety of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Android (robot)|artificial human]] "[[Life Model Decoy]]s", and replaced by one such LMD, which was then installed as Executive Director.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (1988)</ref> The real Sitwell later turns up alive after having been [[brainwash]]ed by a faction of the terrorist organization [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]], placed in [[suspended animation]], released as part of a plot against Fury, and eventually [[deprogram]]med.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD'' Vol.2 #45. Marvel Comics.</ref> He has since become S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top interrogator, often paired with fellow agent [[Jimmy Woo]].<ref>''Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury''</ref> He has also worked closely with [[G. W. Bridge]], mainly in an attempt to neutralize the threat of the [[Punisher]].<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #1 (Jan 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sitwell was one of the many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who refused to join [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] organization in the wake of the Skrull [[Secret Invasion]]. He would join with [[Dum Dum Dugan]] to form a mercenary paramilitary group, dubbed the Howling Commandos, that would engage H.A.M.M.E.R., HYDRA and its associate "Leviathan" program, alongside Nick Fury's [[Secret Warriors]].{{issue|date=June 2012}} One of these many skirmishes sees Jasper lose his friends [[Eric Koenig]] and [[Gabriel Jones]].<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #19 (August 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He also works with Nick Fury in regards to the underground activities of [[Bucky Barnes]], the Winter Soldier.<ref>''[[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During one of the Winter Soldier's missions, a brainwashed [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] is brought into custody at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters; she injures Nick Fury and kills Sitwell before escaping.<ref>''Winter Soldier'' #9-10 (2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He informs Nick Fury that they will be decreasing S.H.I.E.L.D.'s budget by 30 percent, and is a [[Government]] operative, as opposed as the Mainstream Marvel's S.H.I.E.L.D. position.<ref>''[[Ultimate Fallout]]'' #5.

* Jasper Sitwell appears in several films in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], portrayed by [[Maximiliano Hernández]]:
** Jasper Sitwell first appeared in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.
** Hernández reprised the role of Jasper Sitwell in the ''[[Marvel One-Shots]]'' [[short film]]s ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant (2011)|The Consultant]]'' and ''[[Marvel One-Shots#Item 47 (2012)|Item 47]]''. In ''The Consultant'', Phil Coulson informs Jasper Sitwell that the World Security Council wishes Emil Blonsky released from prison to join the Avengers Initiative. They see him as a war hero and blame the devastation in New York City on Bruce Banner. The Council orders them to send an agent to ask General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross to release Blonsky into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. As Nick Fury does not want to release Blonsky, the two agents decide to send a patsy to sabotage the meeting. At Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends "the Consultant"....Tony Stark. In ''Item 47'', Jasper Sitwell and Felix Blake pursue Bennie and Clare when they obtain a discarded Chitauri gun. Jasper Sitwell tracks the couple down to a motel room which is wrecked in the subsequent confrontation with all the stolen money blown to pieces. Instead of killing the couple, Sitwell invites them to join S.H.I.E.L.D. with Bennie assigned to the R&D "think-tank" to reverse engineer the Chitauri technology and Claire becoming Blake's assistant. Sitwell's reasoning for recruiting them, is because Bennie was the only person outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. that was able to figure out how to use the Chitauri gun and that Claire could be mentored by Blake.
