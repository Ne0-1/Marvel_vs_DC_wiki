'''Randy Robertson''' is a [[supporting character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Spider-Man]] series and is depicted as the son of [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #67 (December [[1968 in comics|1968]]).

==History==
Randy Robertson, son of [[Daily Bugle]] city editor [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], enrolled at [[Empire State University]] a year behind Bugle photographer [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. A boisterous hothead unlike his even-tempered father, Randy quickly became involved in student activism, albeit usually as the voice of moderation to the more radical Josh Kittiling. On his father's advice, Randy sought Peter's friendship, although Parker's double life as Spider-Man left him little time to help Randy promote social change. The day after meeting Peter, Randy joined Josh and other in protesting E.S.U.'s plans to turn an exhibition hall into a dorm for visiting alumni, rather than for needy students. Crime boss the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] interrupted their demonstration to steal the lifeline Tablet, allegedly containing the secret to longevity. When Spider-Man intervened Randy tried to restrain the Kingpin. He was easily knocked aside, but following the Kingpin's defeat, Spider-Man did not forget Randy's act of courage. Randy soon joined Peter's circle of college friends, although he was rarely drawn into Spider-Man's activities at E.S.U. and elsewhere in New York City. His rebellious streak eventually faded, and after graduating from E.S.U. Randy pursued graduate studies in social work at Pittsburgh State University, where he met and married fellow student Mandy Batavides, a Jewish woman. 

Randy eventually returned to New York with Mandy, and although their hasty marriage troubled Robbie, he soon accepted Mandy, as a daughter-in-law. Randy and Mandy stayed at Robbie's side after the hitman [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] crippled him. Following his father's recovery, Randy disagreed with Robbie about pleading guilty to misprison of felony and vigorously protested his father's imprisonment. He nonetheless continued to provide his mother Martha with emotional support. and the family was soon reunited when Robbie, after escaping death at Tombstone's hands during a forced prison break, received a pardon. When Mandy received a job offer in California, the younger Robertson couple relocated to the West Coast, but various factors strained their marriage, and Randy returned to New York alone following their divorce.

Randy gave up social work to become an actor, much to his father's disapproval. Renewing his friendship with Peter, whose own wife, [[Mary Jane Watson]], was believed dead, Randy offered to share his apartment with the widower. The two men became roommates, although Randy tended to spend more time with their mutual friends [[Glory Grant]] and [[Jill Stacy]], little realizing the hazards he and Peter were sharing such as nocturnal experimentation by the extraterrestrial Brll'nah>zhhk< and drugged toothpaste from the [[Green Goblin]]. Following a direct encounter with the Green Goblin, Randy sought advice from Robbie, who had significant experience with super-villains from his Bugle position. While Randy and Glory began dating, Peter could not return Jill's flirtations. Peter moved out after Mary Jane turned up alive. Once Peter joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and moved into [[Stark Tower]], Randy lost touch with the Parkers. Randy was seen briefly at the Robertson's household after Robbie was fired from the Bugle. Randy recently reappeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' and began dating a reporter from the [[Daily Bugle#Front Line|Front Line]] named [[Norah Winters]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #591 (2010)</ref> Later, [[Phil Urich]] is jealous of Randy for dating Norah. When [[Alistair Smythe]]â€™s minions attack the Front Line offices Phil breaks a support beam. This, along with the damage caused by the attack, causes the ceiling to collapse on Randy. Randy survives the collapse, but he is seriously injured.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654 (2011)</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Randy Robertson goes to assist Norah during the outbreak. During this time, He is attacked by the Hobgoblin (Phil Urich),  who has been trying to break them up for quite some time. To his surprise, Randy is one of the New Yorkers given spider powers. With his new found powers he is able to fend off the Hobgoblin for some time, but begins to lose because of his lack experience. While almost meeting his death, Norah is entranced in reporting the whole thing and misses an opportunity to save Randy. Randy manages to fend off the Hobgoblin, but decides to break up with Norah, citing that she cares more about the story than his life, or hers.<ref>''Spider-Island: Deadly Foes'' #1</ref> However, his mutation, like the millions of others in New York City, turns him into a monstrous spider-being.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref> Randy and the rest of the civilian population were eventually cured when Spider-Man uses Doctor Octopus' octo-bots to disperse the antidote.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Randy appeared in two episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]]. He was involved in a storyline involving his father and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], and is very anti-Spider-Man.

* Randy Robertson appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/10/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Thursday, January 10, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This version has quiet laid-back nature. This easy-going charm is quite a contrast from the fiery, militant Randy of the Spider-Man books. He is on the Midtown football team with [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Kenny McFarlane|Kenny Kong]], and is dating [[Bluebird (comics)|Sally Avril]] (although in the episode "First Steps", he seem less than happy about that fact). Randy, called '''Rand''' in this series, is the nicest and most neutral of the football players, even protecting Peter from Flash's water balloon barrage. He considers [[John Jameson (comics)|Col. John Jameson]] like an "older brother" and, when his [[space shuttle]] experiences distress on a mission, fears for him (which irks Sally, who seems not to get it). In the final episode of the first season, he helps catch a bound and gagged [[Gwen Stacy]] after she is hurtled to the street by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]].
