==Fictional character biography==
Randy Robertson, son of [[Daily Bugle]] city editor [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], enrolled at [[Empire State University]] a year behind Bugle photographer Peter Parker. A boisterous hothead unlike his even-tempered father, Randy quickly became involved in student activism, albeit usually as the voice of moderation to the more radical Josh Kittiling. On his father's advice, Randy sought Peter's friendship, although Parker's double life as [[Spider-Man]] left him little time to help Randy promote social change. The day after meeting Peter, Randy joined Josh and other in protesting E.S.U.'s plans to turn an exhibition hall into a dorm for visiting alumni, rather than for needy students. The crime boss [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] interrupted their demonstration to steal the lifeline Tablet, allegedly containing the secret to longevity. When Spider-Man intervened Randy tried to restrain Kingpin. He was easily knocked aside, but following Kingpin's defeat, Spider-Man did not forget Randy's act of courage. Randy soon joined Peter's circle of college friends, although he was rarely drawn into Spider-Man's activities at E.S.U. and elsewhere in New York City. His rebellious streak eventually faded, and after graduating from E.S.U. Randy pursued graduate studies in social work at Pittsburgh State University, where he met and married fellow student Mandy Batavides, a Jewish woman.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Randy eventually returned to New York with Mandy, and although their hasty marriage troubled Robbie, he soon accepted Mandy as a daughter-in-law. Randy and Mandy stayed at Robbie's side after the hitman [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] crippled him. Following his father's recovery, Randy disagreed with Robbie about pleading guilty to misprison of felony and vigorously protested his father's imprisonment. He nonetheless continued to provide his mother Martha with emotional support. and the family was soon reunited when Robbie, after escaping death at Tombstone's hands during a forced prison break, received a pardon. When Mandy received a job offer in California, the younger Robertson couple relocated to the West Coast, but various factors strained their marriage, and Randy returned to New York alone following their divorce.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Randy Robertson appeared in two episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]]. In the series, he was a typical rebellious teenager, highly immature, always getting into trouble and easily influenced by the wrong crowd, much unlike his responsible father. He foolishly believed that his fellow gang of delinquents and hoodlums cared for him more than his loving father and soon became an underling of [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], a criminal who has a personal vendetta against [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] and wanted to use the boy to destroy his family's reputation. With [[Spider-Man]]'s help, he managed to learn the error of his ways and reconciled with his father. When his father was framed for armed crime by Tombstone and [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Randy blamed Spider-Man for his less-than-helpful involvement in the crime scene despite Spider-Man having helped him and his father before.

* The character appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/10/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Thursday, January 10, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This version is named '''Rand Robertson''' and has quiet laid-back nature. This easy-going charm is quite a contrast from the fiery, militant his incarnation from the comics. He is on the Midtown football team with [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Kenny McFarlane|Kenny Kong]], and is dating [[Bluebird (Marvel Comics)|Sally Avril]] (although he seems less than happy about that fact in the episode "First Steps"). Rand is the nicest and most neutral of the football players, even protecting Peter Parker from Flash's water balloon barrage. He considers [[John Jameson (comics)|Col. John Jameson]] like an "older brother" and fears for him when his [[space shuttle]] experiences distress on a mission (which irks Sally who seems not to get it). In the first season finale, Rand helps catch [[Gwen Stacy]] after she is hurtled to the street by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]].
