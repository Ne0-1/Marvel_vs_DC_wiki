She was created by [[Greg Rucka]] in ''Wonder Woman'' v2, #196 (November 2003). Rucka has stated his intent as creating a "[[Lex Luthor]] for Diana".<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/pages/DC/Rucka_WW.htm Newsarama<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==

Veronica Cale is a founding partner (with her friend Leslie Anderson) in Cale-Anderson Pharmaceuticals. Having worked hard to get to this position she resents Wonder Woman for finding acceptance in Patriarch's World so easy, and finds her message of peace simplistic, reasoning that it is easy to preach an end to conflict if you are a superstrong demi-goddess. When Diana writes ''Reflections'', a study of Amazon philosophy, Cale uses selected quotations from the book to spin the media against her. 

When the book's most outspoken critic loses a debate, she arranges to have him killed at a demonstration, making it look like the book's proponents are responsible. She also uses [[Doctor Psycho]] to inflame both crowds.

Cale is subsequently bound, gagged,and locked in a closet by Psycho who impersonates her for a brief period, before she is rescued by Wonder Woman. This does not change her opinion of the superheroine, but does have an influence on Dr. Anderson which Cale finds worrying.

She is later coerced by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] into applying as legal guardian of Circe's daughter Lyta as a way of removing Lyta from the Amazon island of [[Themyscira]]. The process is stopped mid-way through once [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] kidnapps Lyta from the island, leaving Circe to abandon her scheme with Veronica Cale.

This story plot was to have a larger part in the Wonder Woman comic but was dropped due to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. Cale's reaction to the media furore surrounding Wonder Woman's killing of [[Maxwell Lord]] and its consequences have not been recorded.

She resurfaces in Week 26 of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' as one of the [[Science Squad|abducted scientists]] on Oolong Island (and the only female among the group).  She suffers a breakdown after unleashing the Four Horsemen upon the Black Marvel family.  When [[Black Adam]] starts his world-wide crusade for vengeance, her conflicting feelings cause her to seduce the mentally unstable [[Will Magnus]]. When Black Adam actually arrives on the shores of Oolong Island she attempts to take the blame for it, walking out to confront the maddened Adam. She is subsequently entirely ignored.

According to author notes in the fourth volume of the collected ''52'' editions, Cale was supposed to originally die at this point, casually slain by Black Adam. Further discussion changed her fate.

Subsequently, Cale leads the remaining mad scientists to form an independent collective. Their first problem is the return of the Four Horsemen of Apokilips. Cale  ingests a semi-organic containment unit, and uses it to absorb the Horsemen's essences. She is later seen undergoing an operation to remove the unit.

==Other versions==
In a pastiche of [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] stories printed as a back-up strip in ''Wonder Woman'' v2, #200, Cale is reinvented as a perfume manufacturer called Veronica Callow. When Wonder Woman refuses to promote her new perfume, Callow tries to discredit Wonder Woman by creating a robot duplicate, Superba, who commits crimes.
