'''Veronica Cale''' is a fictional character, an enemy of [[Wonder Woman]] in [[DC Comics]]. She was created by [[Greg Rucka]] in ''Wonder Woman'' (2nd series) #196 (November 2003).

== Character History ==

Veronica Cale is a founding partner (with her friend Leslie Anderson) in Cale-Anderson Pharmaceuticals. Having worked hard to get to this position she resents Wonder Woman for finding acceptance in Patriarch's World so easy, and finds her message of peace simplistic, reasoning that it is easy to preach an end to conflict if you are a superstrong demi-goddess. When Diana writes ''Reflections'', a study of Amazon philosophy, Cale uses selected quotations from the book to spin the media against her. 

When the book's most outspoken critic loses a debate, she arranges to have him killed at a demonstration, making it look like the book's proponents are responsible. She also uses [[Doctor Psycho]] to inflame both crowds.

Cale was subsequently captured by Psycho who impersonated her for a brief period, before she was rescued by Wonder Woman. This did not change her opinion of the superheroine, but did have an influence on Dr. Anderson which Cale found worrying.

The Cale storyline was dropped due to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and her reaction to the media furore surrounding Wonder Woman's killing of [[Maxwell Lord]] and its consequences has not been recorded.

She resurfaced in Week 26 of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' as one of the abducted scientists and the only female among the group.

==Other versions==
In a pastiche of [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] stories printed as a back-up strip in ''Wonder Woman'' (2nd series) #200, Cale is reinvented as a perfume manufacturer called Veronica Callow. When Wonder Woman refuses to promote her new perfume, Callow discredits Wonder Woman by creating a robot duplicate, Superba, who commits crimes.
