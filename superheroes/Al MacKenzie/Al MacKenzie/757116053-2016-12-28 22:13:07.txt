He is also old friends with [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Barbara "Bobbi" Morse]]. In the episode "One of Us," it is revealed that he and Bobbi are secretly associated with "the real S.H.I.E.L.D." In the episode "One Door Closes", it is revealed that during the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', when Hydra infiltrators attempted to target their enemies with three new repulsor-powered Helicarriers, Mack was on the S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft carrier ''Iliad'', and that he and Robert Gonzales were saved by Bobbi Morse and Isabelle Hartley.
