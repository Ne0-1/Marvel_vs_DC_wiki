==Fictional character biography==
Al MacKenzie was born in [[Austin, Texas]]. He was once the [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] liaison to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  He became romantically involved with Contessa [[Valentina Allegra di Fontaine]] after a while, which led to an estrangement between him and [[Nick Fury]].  Because of this, he returned to the CIA with the Contessa.

MacKenzie later joined the S.H.I.E.L.D. organization full time, and spent considerable time as the senior liaison officer to the C.I.A. Subsequently, under unknown circumstances, MacKenzie resigned from S.H.I.E.L.D., and wrote a "tell-all" book entitled ''UnSHIELDed: an Unauthorized Insider's Look Behind the World's Most Powerful Global Spy Network'', which purportedly explained some of the history behind the organization from his point of view.<ref>''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' Vol. 2, # 10</ref> Since then, he also acted as an unofficial source to [[Ben Urich]], prodding Urich and [[Jessica Jones (comics)|Jessica Jones]] to attempt to expose Fury's unauthorized mission to [[Latveria]],<ref>''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'' # 9</ref> suggesting to some readers that it is unclear how valid his resignation truly is.
