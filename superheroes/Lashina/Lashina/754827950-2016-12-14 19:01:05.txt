During a mission to capture [[Glorious Godfrey]], a New God that had been imprisoned on Earth, Lashina is betrayed by [[Bernadeth]] as the Female Furies are escaping through a [[boom tube]]. Caught in an explosion, Lashina is sent flying into the swamp surrounding [[Belle Reve]] Penitentiary.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ostrander|first1=John|title=Suicide Squad: Trial By Fire|date=2015|publisher=DC Comics|location=Burbank, CA|isbn=9781401258313|pages=113-114|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> Surviving, she remains in the swamp until an opportunity to save an [[Slipknot (comics)|injured member]] of the [[Suicide Squad]], a [[United States]] government agency that uses super-powered beings to fulfill [[black operation|black ops]] missions, presents itself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ostrander|first1=John|title=Suicide Squad: The Nightshade Odyssey|date=2015|publisher=DC Comics|location=Burbank, CA|isbn=9781401258337|page=19|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> Using the opportunity to ingratiate herself with the team and claiming to be suffering from amnesia, [[Amanda Waller]] allows her to join.

Eventually, she engineers a return to Apokolips and convinces many members of the Squad to come with her, while others she outright kidnaps. The plan ends in a battle against Apokolips forces once the group lands on the planet's surface. Multiple Squad members are killed, including Doctor Light.<ref name="dc-fema"/> Lashina confronts and kills Bernadeth. Darkseid, angry that Lashina has brought humans to Apokolips, brings Bernadeth back to life and kills Lashina. The survivors of the Suicide Squad are allowed to return home.<ref name="dc-fema"/>

Lashina is sent with the Furies on another mission to retrieve [[Mister Miracle]], but he escapes.

Sharing leadership with Bernadeth, Lashina is often the field leader of the Furies, while Bernadeth leads them out of the battlefield.  Lashina has since battled [[Young Justice]], the [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]] and [[Wonder Woman]].  She is also a long-time enemy of [[Superman]] and his compatriots [[Superboy]] and [[Supergirl]]. She was also seen as a [[prostitute]] in Granny Goodness' Earth-based brothel. This was when the majority of Apokolips' ruling forces were operating on Earth, though it is unrevealed as to why. In recent appearances she has been seen battling [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] and [[Hawkgirl]].

===Seven Soldiers===
Lashina appears in ''Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle'', part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' maxi-series event. Within the story, Lashina and the rest of the Furies are given human form by Darkseid, with Lashina taking on the appearance of a bald-headed [[dominatrix]] prostitute. She and the rest of the Furies battle [[Shilo Norman]] in an attempt to stop him in his quest to free [[Aurakles]], the world's first superhero.

===Final Crisis===
During the events of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lashina, once again in her bald-headed human form, is seen as one of the villains running the [[Darkseid|Dark Side Club]], an illegal arena where spectators gamble on battles between brainwashed teen metahumans. When [[Rose Wilson]] and [[Miss Martian]] lead a rebellion against the Dark Side Club staff, Lashina attempts to flee along with the wealthy club patrons in the VIP section of the arena. They nearly escape the club, but are cut off by teen superhero [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], who proceeds to electrocute Lashina and the others into unconsciousness, turning them over to the authorities afterwards.<ref>''Terror Titans''#1-6 (2008-2009)</ref>

When the [[Anti-Life Equation]] takes effect across the globe, several superheroines and villainesses are taken under Darkseid's power and are transformed into the new Female Furies. [[Catwoman]] apparently becomes the new Lashina, wearing an outfit similar to hers. In the aftermath of the series, Lashina is presumably reborn on Earth-51, along with the rest of the Jack Kirby-created characters.<ref>''Final Crisis #3'', August 2008</ref>

===The New 52===
Lashina makes her first appearance alongside '''Granny Goodness''' in issue #8 of ''Infinity Man and the Forever People''. During the Darkseid War, Lashina and [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]] traveled to Earth to hunt down the renegade amazon Myrina Black.<ref>''Justice League'' #43</ref> Later, after Darkseid had been enslaved by his daughter Grail, Lashina and the other Female Furies accepted an offer from Big Barda to help defeat Grail as well as to protect Barda's husband, Mister Miracle. Lashina participated in the final battle against Grail and Darkseid, which resulted in the pair's defeat. Lashina then left for Apokolips with the rest of the Furies, including Barda.<ref>''Justice League'' #50 (2016)</ref>

Lashina is a great warrior with superhuman strength, durability and speed. She uses steel whips that she can charge with electricity.<ref name="dc-fema"/>

===Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman===
Lashina appears in the story "Dig For Fire" in the anthology series ''Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman''. After discovering that [[Wonder Woman]] had traveled to Apokolips to save two of her amazon sisters, Lashina along with Stompa and Mad Harriet tracked her down. The Furies refused to speak peacefully to Wonder Woman, and in the ensuing battle, the heroine was shot in the neck by an explosive dart from Bernadeth and thrown into the fiery pits by Stompa. When the Furies reported back to Darkseid, he was displeased that they had killed her rather than executing her publicly. Wonder Woman, still alive, managed to save her sisters. The Furies once again battled the amazon, though the battle ended when Darkseid killed the two amazons and allowed Wonder Woman to return to Earth.<ref>''Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman'' #16-18 (digital)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Lashina appeared on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' in several episodes, and was voiced by [[Diane Michelle]]. Her first appearance was in the two-parter "[[Little Girl Lost (Superman: The Animated Series)|Little Girl Lost]]," where she, along with [[Stompa]] and [[Mad Harriet]], were summoned by Granny Goodness to battle Supergirl. Lashina was the leader of the Furies, and had the final battle with Supergirl at the end of the episode.  She also appeared later during the series finale two-parter, ''Legacy'', where she apparently had a romantic relationship with the brainwashed Superman, but attacked him when he turned on them.
** There was a planned script for ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' where Lashina and Superman's brief fling during the events of Legacy's ramifications were revealed. Lashina would have given birth to a son who deposed of Darkseid and became ruler of Apokolips, and also targeted Earth for invasion. Lashina secretly went to Earth and warned the Justice League about the invasion and teamed up with them to prevent it. During this time, Lashina would also reveal that he was Superman's son, causing the latter to feel guilt for not raising him. However, it was cut.
* Lashina also appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in the first part of the series finale, ''Alive''.
* Lashina appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Duel of the Double Crossers," voiced by [[Nika Futterman]].  She, along with her teammate Stompa, was a member of [[Mongal]]'s Furies. Her connections to Darkseid, Apokolips, and the New Gods were not mentioned during her appearance. She had a romantic interest in [[Jonah Hex]], and flirted with him during battle.  After [[Mongul]] and [[Mongal]] were defeated, Lashina rode off into the sunset with Jonah Hex.
* Lashina (played by [[Jonel Earl]]) is briefly seen in the episode "Abandoned" on the last season of ''[[Smallville]]''. She tries to choke [[Tess Mercer]] to death until Clark Kent intervenes and stops her.
* Although Lashina is one of the few Furies that do not appear in the animated specials for ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', she is featured in a [[Lego]] playset for the series, suggesting she will appear in the animated series at a future point.

===Film===
* Lashina appears in ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]] who was uncredited in the role.
* An alternate version of Lashina briefly appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]''. This version closely resembles her appearance from Superman: The Animated Series.

===Video games===
* Lashina appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
* In ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]'', Lashina is one of the thousands of characters that can be summoned by the player.
