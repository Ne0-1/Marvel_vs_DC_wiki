'''Lashina''' is a [[New God]] of [[Apokolips]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe. Leader of the [[Female Furies]], [[Granny Goodness]]' personal strike-force, Lashina is a cunning warrior and one of Granny's favorite servants.  Lashina uses steel whips that she can charge electrically.

==History==
Lashina was raised a warrior in Granny Goodness' [[orphanage]], and took over leadership when [[Big Barda]] left Apokolips for [[Earth]].  Though the Furies went to Earth to aid Big Barda and her lover, [[Mister Miracle]], they soon returned to Apokolips to take their punishment for their betrayal of [[Darkseid]].  Lashina was then given leadership over the Female Furies by Darkseid, much to [[Bernadeth]]'s annoyance.  

During a mission to capture [[Glorious Godfrey]], a New God that had been imprisoned on Earth, Lashina was betrayed by [[Bernadeth]] and shoved out of the [[boom tube]], where she was shot and later suffered from amnesia.  She became ''Duchess'' and joined the [[Suicide Squad]] until she regained her memory.  She eventually led Suicide Squad to Apokolips and used them to fight the other Gods while she battled Bernadeth.  She snapped Bernadeth's neck, but [[Darkseid]], infuriated that Lashina had brought humans to Apokolips, killed Lashina, resurrecting Bernadeth in her place.  Lashina was later brought back to life by Darkseid, sent to lead the Furies once more on a mission to retrieve [[Mister Miracle]].  They succeeded, but Mister Miracle was eventually able to escape.

Sharing leadership with Bernadeth, Lashina is often the field leader of the Furies, while Bernadeth leads them out of the battlefield.  Lashina has since battled [[Young Justice]], [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]] and [[Wonder Woman]].  She is also a long-time enemy of [[Superman]] and his counterparts [[Superboy]] and [[Supergirl]].  She was most recently seen as a prostitute in Granny Goodness' brothel, though it is unknown what brought her or the Furies to Earth.

==Alternate Universes==
In a [[crossover]] with [[Marvel Comics]], the New Gods and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] were amalgamated, and Lashina was paired with [[Scarlet Witch]] to form ''Red Lash''.  Also, she battled [[Sovereign Seven]] numerous times, which is not considered a part of DC continuity.

==Other Media==
Lashina appeared on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' in several episodes, and was voiced by [[Diane Michelle]]. Her first appearance was in the ''Little Girl Lost'' two-parter, where she, along with [[Stompa]] and [[Mad Harriet]], was summoned by Granny Goodness to battle Supergirl. Lashina was the leader of the Furies, and had the final battle with Supergirl at the end of the episode.  She also appeared later during the series finale two-parter, ''Legacy'', where she apparently had a romantic relationship with Superman, but attacked him when he turned on them. Lashina also appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in the first part of the series finale, ''Alive''.
