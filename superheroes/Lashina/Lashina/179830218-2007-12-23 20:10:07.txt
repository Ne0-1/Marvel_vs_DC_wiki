'''Lashina''' is a [[fictional character]], and [[extraterrestrial]] [[Amazons|amazon]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' vol. 1 #6 (January 1972).

==Fictional character biography==
Lashina was raised a warrior in Granny Goodness' [[orphanage]], and took over leadership of the Female Furies when [[Big Barda]] left Apokolips for [[Earth]].  Though the Furies went to Earth to aid Big Barda and her lover, [[Mister Miracle]], they soon returned to Apokolips to take their punishment for their betrayal of [[Darkseid]].  Lashina was then given leadership over the Female Furies by Darkseid, much to [[Bernadeth]]'s annoyance.  

During a mission to capture [[Glorious Godfrey]], a New God that had been imprisoned on Earth, Lashina was betrayed by [[Bernadeth]] and shoved out of the [[boom tube]], where she was shot and later suffered from amnesia.  She became ''Duchess'' and joined the [[Suicide Squad]] until she regained her memory.  She eventually led Suicide Squad to Apokolips and used them to fight the other Gods while she battled Bernadeth.  She snapped Bernadeth's neck, but [[Darkseid]], infuriated that Lashina had brought humans to Apokolips, killed Lashina, resurrecting Bernadeth in her place.  Lashina was later brought back to life by Darkseid, sent to lead the Furies once more on a mission to retrieve [[Mister Miracle]].  They succeeded, but Mister Miracle was eventually able to escape.

Sharing leadership with Bernadeth, Lashina is often the field leader of the Furies, while Bernadeth leads them out of the battlefield.  Lashina has since battled [[Young Justice]], [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]] and [[Wonder Woman]].  She is also a long-time enemy of [[Superman]] and his counterparts [[Superboy]] and [[Supergirl]].  She was also seen as a prostitute in Granny Goodness' brothel with the rest of her team, though it is unknown what brought her or the Furies to Earth.  Most recently, she was seen battling [[Firestorm (Jason Rusch)|Firestorm]] and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], as well as [[Hawkgirl]].

==Powers and abilities==
* Lashina has superstrength, durability, and speed.

Lashina appeared on ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' in several episodes, and was voiced by [[Diane Michelle]]. Her first appearance was in the two-parter "[[Little Girl Lost (Superman: The Animated Series)|Little Girl Lost]]," where she, along with [[Stompa]] and [[Mad Harriet]], was summoned by Granny Goodness to battle Supergirl. Lashina was the leader of the Furies, and had the final battle with Supergirl at the end of the episode.  She also appeared later during the series finale two-parter, ''Legacy'', where she apparently had a romantic relationship with Superman, but attacked him when he turned on them. Lashina also appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in the first part of the series finale, ''Alive''. She was set to appear in Season 4 of [[Batman Beyond]] in which the events of Legacy begin to haunt Superman once again. It was revealed that they had a child and he became the new ruler of Apokolips. Their son invades Gotham City which gets the attention of Terry McGinnis and the Justice League. She helps them fight off his invasion. However, the series was cancelled. The writers said that they didn't want to use the idea in Justice League or Justice League Unlimted due to the fact they wanted to focus on new characters.

==Notes==
* Lashina's recent appearance in ''Hawkgirl'' #61 has her mis-drawn as [[Gilotina]].
