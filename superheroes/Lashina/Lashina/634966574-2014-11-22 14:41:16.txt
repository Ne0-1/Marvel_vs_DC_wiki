==Fictional character biography==
Lashina is raised a warrior in Granny Goodness' [[orphanage]], and takes over leadership of the Female Furies when [[Big Barda]] leaves Apokolips for [[Earth]].  Though the Furies go to Earth to aid Big Barda and her lover, [[Mister Miracle]],<ref>''Mister Miracle'' #14 (July 1, 1973)</ref> they soon return to Apokolips to take their punishment for their betrayal of [[Darkseid]].  Lashina is then given leadership over the Female Furies by Darkseid, much to [[Bernadeth]]'s annoyance.<ref name="dc-fema">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Female Furies | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 120  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

During a mission to capture [[Glorious Godfrey]], a New God that had been imprisoned on Earth, Lashina is betrayed by [[Bernadeth]] and shoved out of the [[boom tube]], their teleportational technology. She is shot and later suffered from amnesia.  She becomes ''Duchess'' and joins the [[Suicide Squad]], a [[United States]]-based government agency that uses super-powered beings to fulfill any required missions. There she operates under [[Amanda Waller]], participating in many heroic missions. For example, she assists in saving the world from the murderous plans of [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]]. Her memory comes back to her and she plans a return to Apokolips. She convinces many members of the Squad to come with her, and others she outright kidnaps. The grouping includes [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], Amanda Waller, [[Count Vertigo]] and others. The plan ends in a battle against Apokolips forces once the group lands on the planet's surface. Multiple Squad members are killed, including Doctor Light.<ref name="dc-fema"/>

Lashina confronts and kills Bernadeth. Darkseid, angry that Lashina has brought humans to Apokolips, brings Bernadeth back to life and kills Lashina. The survivors of the Suicide Squad are allowed to return home.<ref name="dc-fema"/>

Lashina is sent with the Furies on another mission to retrieve [[Mister Miracle]], but he escapes.

Sharing leadership with Bernadeth, Lashina is often the field leader of the Furies, while Bernadeth leads them out of the battlefield.  Lashina has since battled [[Young Justice]], the "[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]" and [[Wonder Woman]].  She is also a long-time enemy of [[Superman]] and his counterparts [[Superboy]] and [[Supergirl]]. She was also seen as a [[prostitute]] in Granny Goodness' Earth-based brothel. This was when the majority of Apokolips' ruling forces were operating on Earth, though it is unrevealed as to why. In recent appearances she has been seen battling [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] and [[Hawkgirl]].

===Seven Soldiers===
Lashina appears in ''Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle'', part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' maxi-series event. Within the story, Lashina and the rest of the Furies are given human form by Darkseid, with Lashina taking on the appearance of a bald-headed [[dominatrix]] prostitute. She and the rest of the Furies battle [[Shilo Norman]] in an attempt to stop him in his quest to free [[Aurakles]], the world's first superhero.

===Final Crisis===
During the events of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lashina, once again in her bald-headed human form, is seen as one of the villains running the [[Darkseid|Dark Side Club]], an illegal arena where spectators gamble on battles between brainwashed teen metahumans. When [[Rose Wilson]] and [[Miss Martian]] lead a rebellion against the Dark Side Club staff, Lashina attempts to flee along with the wealthy club patrons in the VIP section of the arena. They nearly escape the club, but are cut off by teen superhero [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], who proceeds to electrocute Lashina and the others into unconsciousness, turning them over to the authorities afterwards.<ref>''Terror Titans''#1-6 (2008-2009)</ref>

When the [[Anti-Life Equation]] takes effect across the globe, several superheroines and villainesses are taken under Darkseid's power and are transformed into the new Female Furies. [[Catwoman]] apparently becomes the new Lashina, wearing an outfit similar to hers. In the aftermath of the series, Lashina is presumably reborn on Earth-51, along with the rest of the Jack Kirby-created characters.<ref>''Final Crisis #3'', August 2008</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lashina has super strength, durability, and speed.  She uses steel whips that she can charge with electricity.<ref name="dc-fema"/>
