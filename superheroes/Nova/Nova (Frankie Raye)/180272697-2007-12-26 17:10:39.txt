'''Nova''' ('''Frankie Raye''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Frankie Raye was born in [[New York City]]. She worked for the [[United Nations]] as an [[interpreter]]. She became [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]'s girlfriend, and was known for being afraid of fire. Later, her fear was explained to be the result of a mental block induced by her stepfather, [[Phineas Horton]], after she was accidentally doused with the chemicals which caused the android [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] (his creation) to burst into flame, in an attempt to prevent her using the Torch-like powers granted her by the accident. 

After breaking through the block, she aided the [[Fantastic Four]] for some time, until she volunteered to become the herald of [[Galactus]].<ref>''Fantastic Four ''#244.</ref> She claimed to have no compunction about leading him to sentient populated planets and proved that when she led the Devourer of Worlds to the [[Skrull]] homeworld to consume it in her period of service. When [[Richard Rider]] resumed his Nova identity alongside the [[New Warriors]], he was briefly called "Kid Nova" to distinguish him from Raye. Frankie Raye was ultimately killed by the alien [[Morg]], who had replaced her as Galactus' herald, in ''Silver Surfer'' #75 (1992). The demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] later made it appear that she had returned from the dead in a failed bid to steal the soul of the [[Silver Surfer]].

Nova appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 animated series)|1994 ''Fantastic Four'' animated series]]''.

In 1998, she appeared in various episodes of the [[The Silver Surfer (TV series)|''Silver Surfer'' cartoon series]]. When the Surfer is trying to save citizens of Earth from Galactus, he uses his Power Cosmic to save an orphan, Frankie Raye. A rare mutant gene in her body is activated. Her gift allows her to end up where she needs to be. Galactus immediately chooses Frankie for his next herald due to her gift, thereby transforming her into Nova.

In the scripted (unmade) episode "The Hunger", she was replaced by [[Terrax]]. She would join the Silver Surfer to return to Earth in the three-parter "Down To Earth", as well as meeting The Fantastic Four.

Frankie Raye is set to make  an appearance in an episode of the new ''[[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series. 

===Live-action===
Frankie Raye appeared in the movie ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', portrayed by [[Beau Garrett]].  In this version, she is depicted as a captain working for the American government under General Hager. Raye and Hager inform the [[Fantastic Four]] about strange occurrences happening worldwide, due to the arrival of a distinct [[Power Cosmic|Cosmic]]-entity, the [[Silver Surfer]] on earth. 

[[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], the Human Torch, becomes romantically interested in her, but his feelings are not reciprocated, with Raye rebuffing him after their first meeting, and later chastising him for making mistakes during an encounter with the Surfer that nearly results in his teammates being killed. By the end of the film, however, Frankie is shown attending the wedding ceremony of [[Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]]. When Susan throws the bouquet Frankie nearly catches it (the wedding tradition being that whoever catches the bouquet thrown by a bride will be the next to marry), but Johnny, who forgot his power problem is under control again try to reaches it with the powers of Mr. Fantastic, only to flame it before it reaches her.

Garrett has expressed interest in reprising the role and portraying Raye as Nova.<ref>{{cite news | author = Matthew Price | title = Word Balloons: Actress in â€˜Silver Surfer' hopes for super role if there's a sequel | publisher = [[The Oklahoman]] | date = [[2007-10-05]] | url = http://newsok.com/article/3140667/1191549264 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>
