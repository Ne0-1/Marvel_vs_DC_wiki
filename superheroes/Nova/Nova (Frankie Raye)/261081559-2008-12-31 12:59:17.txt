'''Nova''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Frankie Raye''' was born in [[New York City]]. She worked for the [[United Nations]] as an [[interpreter]]. She met [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #164</ref> and became his girlfriend, and was known for being afraid of fire. Later, her fear was explained to be the result of a mental block induced by her stepfather, [[Phineas Horton]], after she was accidentally doused with the chemicals which caused the android [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] (his creation) to burst into flame, in an attempt to prevent her using the Torch-like powers granted her by the accident.<ref>as revealed in ''Fantastic Four'' #238</ref>

After breaking through the block, she regained her full memory and discovered her previously-repressed superhuman powers, and became the third person to take the name the '''Human Torch'''.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #238</ref> She aided the [[Fantastic Four]] for some time, until she volunteered to become the new herald of [[Galactus]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #244</ref> She took the name '''Nova'''. She claimed to have no compunction about leading him to sentient populated planets and proved that when she led the Devourer of Worlds to the [[Skrull]] home-world to consume it in her period of service.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #257</ref> Nova later attended the trial of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] by the [[Shi'ar]] Empire.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #262</ref> When [[Richard Rider]] resumed his Nova identity alongside the [[New Warriors]], he was briefly called "Kid Nova" to distinguish him from Raye.

Nova was later rescued from Skrull imprisonment by the [[Silver Surfer]], whom she met for the first time.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> She then battled the [[Elders of the Universe]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #9</ref> She was sent by Galactus to locate one of the Elders, the [[Contemplator]], and was joined by the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #10</ref> She journeyed to the Coal Sack Nebula in search of the Contemplator and was captured by Captain [[Reptyl]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #11</ref> She battled Captain Reptyl, and rescued the Silver Surfer from Reptyl.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #12</ref> She then battled [[Ronan the Accuser]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #13</ref> She battled a Skrull duplicate of the Silver Surfer, and then romanced the real Silver Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #14</ref> She then battled the [[In-Betweener]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #17</ref> She aided Galactus in battle against the In-Betweener.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #18</ref> She then romanced [[Firelord]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #19</ref>

Nova later encountered an injured Elan. She battled the second [[Star Stalker (comics)|Star-Stalker]], and then met the [[Power Pack]]. A stimulator device temporarily rendered her evil, until she was subdued by Reed and [[Franklin Richards]], and Power Pack.<ref>''Power Pack'' #56-58</ref>

Frankie Raye was ultimately killed by the alien [[Morg]], who had replaced her as Galactus' herald.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #75 (1992)</ref> The demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] later made it appear that she had returned from the dead in a failed bid to steal the soul of the [[Silver Surfer]].

==Powers and abilities==
Nova originally gained her superhuman powers as the result of a mutagenic reaction to an exposure to unknown chemicals. Originally, she had powers similar to that of the Human Torch.

Her powers were later enhanced exponentially by an infusion of cosmic energies by the world-devourer Galactus. She gained superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and could fly at warp speed. She had the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of stellar fire, and allowing her to project any form of energy possessed by a star, including heat, light, gravity, radio waves and charged particles. She also had the ability to project streams of stellar fire for distances in the hundreds of miles, and to mentally control the flame she projects (for instance, to maintain a sustained ring around a person or object at a fixed distance). She also has the ability to fly at near-light speeds through interstellar space and traverse hyper-space, and also possesses near-total physical invulnerability. Nova's entire body, particularly her head, is plumed with cosmic energy resembling flames.

Frankie Raye was fluent in more than one language besides English.

==Other versions==
In one alternate future, Nova met and was romanced by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)#Hercules 2300|Hercules]].<ref>''Hercules'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

*Nova appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 animated series)|1994 ''Fantastic Four'' animated series]]''.

*Nova appears in various episodes of the [[The Silver Surfer (TV series)|''Silver Surfer'' cartoon series]]. When the Surfer is trying to save citizens of Earth from Galactus, he uses his Power Cosmic to save an orphan, Frankie Raye. A rare mutant gene in her body is activated. Her gift allows her to end up where she needs to be. Galactus immediately chooses Frankie for his next herald due to her gift, thereby transforming her into Nova. In the scripted (unmade) episode "The Hunger", she was replaced by [[Terrax]]. She would join the Silver Surfer to return to Earth in the three-parter "Down To Earth", as well as meeting The Fantastic Four.

*Frankie Raye has also appeared in the [[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]] episode "Zoned Out" where Johnny gives her a tour of Reed's Lab.

===Film===
Frankie Raye appears in the movie ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', portrayed by [[Beau Garrett]].  In this version, she is depicted as a Captain curretly commissioned in the U.S. Army under command of General Hager. Raye and Hager inform the [[Fantastic Four]] about strange occurrences happening worldwide, due to the arrival of a distinct [[Power Cosmic|Cosmic]]-entity, the [[Silver Surfer]] on Earth. [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], the Human Torch, becomes romantically interested in her, but his feelings are not reciprocated, with Raye rebuffing him after their first meeting, and later chastising him for making mistakes during an encounter with the Surfer that nearly results in his teammates being killed. By the end of the film, however, Frankie is shown attending the wedding ceremony of [[Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]]. When Susan throws the bouquet Frankie nearly catches it (the wedding tradition being that whoever catches the bouquet thrown by a bride will be the next to marry), but Johnny, who is still scared about commitment, torches the flowers.

Garrett has expressed interest in reprising the role and portraying Raye as Nova.<ref>{{cite news | author = Matthew Price | title = Word Balloons: Actress in ‘Silver Surfer' hopes for super role if there's a sequel | publisher = [[The Oklahoman]] | date = [[2007-10-05]] | url = http://newsok.com/article/3140667/1191549264 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>
