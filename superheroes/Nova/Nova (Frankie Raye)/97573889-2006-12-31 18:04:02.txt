'''Nova''' (real name '''Frankie Raye''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the {{Marvel Universe}}.

==Fictional character biography==
She was originally the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]]'s girlfriend who happened to be afraid of fire. Later, this was explained to be the result of a mental block induced by her stepfather, [[Phineas Horton]], after she was accidentally doused with the chemicals which caused the android [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] (his creation) to burst into flame, in an attempt to prevent her using the Torch-like powers granted her by the accident.

After breaking through the block, she aided the [[Fantastic Four]] for some time, until she volunteered to become the herald of [[Galactus]]. She claimed to have no compunction about leading him to sentient populated planets and proved that when she led the Devourer of Worlds to the [[Skrull]] homeworld to consume it in her period of service.  When Richard Rider resumed his Nova identity alongside the [[New Warriors]], he was briefly called "Kid Nova" to distinguish him from Raye.  Frankie Raye was ultimately killed by the alien [[Morg]], who had replaced her as Galactus' herald, in ''Silver Surfer'' #75 (1992).  The demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] later made it appear that she had returned from the dead in a failed bid to steal the soul of the Silver Surfer.

==Other versions==
In the alternate future of [[John Byrne]]'s "The Last Galactus Story" (serialized in ''[[Epic Illustrated]]''), she survived (or was resurrected) and continued serving Galactus until the end of the universe, at which time he would sacrifice himself to create a new universe, and she would become the Galactus of this new universe.

==Appearances in other media==

Nova appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 animated series)|1994 Fantastic Four animated series]]''.

In 1998, she appeared in various episodes of the [[The Silver Surfer (TV series)|''Silver Surfer'' cartoon series]].  When the Surfer is trying to save citizens of Earth from Galactus, he uses his Power Cosmic to save an orphan, Frankie Raye. A rare mutant gene in her body is activated.  Her gift allows her to end up where she needs to be.  Galactus immediately chooses Frankie for his next herald due to her gift, thereby transforming her into Nova.

In the scripted (unmade) episode "The Hunger", she was replaced by [[Terrax]].  She would join the Silver Surfer to return to Earth in the three-parter "Down To Earth", as well as meeting The Fantastic Four.

Frankie Raye is set to make an appearance in an episode of the new ''[[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series.  Although she will not have her powers, [[MoonScoop Group|MoonScoop]] will possibly do what [[Fox Kids]] did with [[Venom (comics)|Eddie Brock]] in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'': they will continue to use her as a supporting character for the series until one episode where she gains her powers and becomes Nova.

Frankie Raye is also set to appear in the upcoming movie ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.
