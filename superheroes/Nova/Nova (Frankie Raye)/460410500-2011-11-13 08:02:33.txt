'''Nova''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared as Frankie Raye in ''Fantastic Four'' #164 (Nov. 1975), and as Nova in ''Fantastic Four'' #244 (July 1982).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Frankie Raye''' worked for the [[United Nations]] as an [[interpreter]]. She met [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #164 (Nov. 1975)</ref> and became his girlfriend, despite her fear of fire. Her fear was eventually explained to be the result of a mental block induced by her stepfather, [[Phineas Horton]], after she was accidentally doused with the chemicals which caused the android [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] (his creation) to burst into flame, in an attempt to prevent her using the Torch-like powers granted to her by the accident.<ref name="FF238">as revealed in ''Fantastic Four'' #238 (Jan. 1982)</ref>

After breaking through the block, she regained her full memory and discovered her previously repressed superhuman powers, and became the third person to take the name the '''Human Torch'''.<ref name="FF238"/> She aided the [[Fantastic Four]] for a short time, until she volunteered to become the new herald of [[Galactus]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #244 (July 1982)</ref> She took the name "Nova". Having previously demonstrated what the Fantastic Four deemed an alarming willingness to kill opponents, she claimed to have no compunction about leading him to sentient populated planets and proved that when she led the Devourer of Worlds to the [[Skrull]] home-world to consume it.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #257 (Aug. 1983)</ref> Nova later attended the trial of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] by the [[Shi'ar]] Empire.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #262 (Jan. 1984)</ref> When [[Richard Rider]] resumed his Nova identity alongside the [[New Warriors]], he was briefly called "Kid Nova" to distinguish him from Raye.

Nova was later rescued from Skrull imprisonment by the [[Silver Surfer]], whom she met for the first time.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #1 (July 1987)</ref> She then battled the [[Elders of the Universe]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #9 (March 1988)</ref> Galactus sent her to locate one of the Elders, the [[Contemplator]], and she was joined in this quest by the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #10 (April 1988)</ref> They journeyed to the [[Coal Sack Nebula]] where they were captured by Captain [[Reptyl]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #11 (May 1988)</ref> After battling Captain Reptyl,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #12 (June 1988)</ref> Nova battled [[Ronan the Accuser]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #13 (July 1988)</ref> This was followed by a clash with a Skrull duplicate of the Silver Surfer and a romantic flirtation with the real Silver Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #14 (Aug. 1988)</ref> Nova and Galactus battled the [[In-Betweener]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #17 (Nov. 1988)</ref><ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #18 (Dec. 1988)</ref> Nova then turned her romantic interests toward [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #19 (Jan. 1989)</ref>

Nova later encountered an injured Elan. She battled the second [[Star Stalker (comics)|Star-Stalker]], and then met the [[Power Pack]]. A stimulator device temporarily rendered her evil, until she was subdued by Reed and [[Franklin Richards]], and Power Pack.<ref>''Power Pack'' #56-58 (June - Sept. 1990)</ref>

Frankie Raye was ultimately killed by the alien [[Morg]], who had replaced her as Galactus' herald.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #75 (Nov. 1992)</ref> The demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] later made it appear that she had returned from the dead in a failed bid to steal the soul of the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #96-100 (Sept. 1994 - Jan. 1995)</ref>

In the weekly mini-series ''Heralds'', a character named Frances appears. After stabbing a customer at the diner where she works following a disruption from space that led to the destruction of a [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] facility and the release of many cloned scientists and prehistoric life forms, Frances speed off in a car where she meets a clone of Phineas Horton. After crashing the car while attempting to miss him, Frances looks up at Horton and says "Father?" while the Horton clone greets her with, "Hello Frankie."<ref>''Heralds'' vol. 1 #1 (Aug. 2010)</ref> As the series continues, female superheroes [[Emma Frost]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Monica Rambeau]], [[She-Hulk]] and [[Valkyrie (Brunnhilde)|Valkyrie]] find her and after a brief discussion where they speculate that she could be a returned Frankie Raye, which she denies, claiming her name is Frances, they agree to take her to the [[Baxter Building]]. At the same time, a fully flamed Nova arrives in New York, causing Johnny Storm's powers to activate automatically.<ref>''Heralds'' vol. 1 #2 (Aug. 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nova originally gained her superhuman powers as the result of a mutagenic reaction to an exposure to unknown chemicals. Originally, she had powers similar to that of the Human Torch: flame generation, projection, and flight.

Her powers were later enhanced exponentially by the infusion of cosmic energies by the world-devourer Galactus. She gained metahuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. She had the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of stellar fire, and which allowed her to project any form of energy possessed by a star, including heat, light, gravity, radio waves and charged particles. She also had the ability to project streams of stellar fire for distances in the hundreds of miles, and to mentally control the flame she projects (for instance, to maintain a sustained ring around a person or object at a fixed distance). She also has the ability to fly at superluminal speeds through intergalactic space and traverse hyper-space. Finally, she possessed near-total physical invulnerability, as was evident when she was once punched by [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix III]] with such force that it launched her from Earth and slammed her into the moon's surface, forming an impact crater in the process.<ref name="Excalibur">''Excalibur'' #25 (Aug. 1990)</ref> She later expressed amazement that she was able to even survive such a blow, let alone withstand it completely uninjured.<ref name="Excalibur"/> Nova's entire body, particularly her head, is plumed with cosmic energy resembling flames.

Frankie Raye was fluent in more than one language besides English.

==Other versions==
Writer-penciler [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced a serialized story titled "The Last Galactus Story",  which appeared in [[anthology]] comics-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26-34 (Oct. 1984 - Feb. 1986), and detailed an all-new adventure for the character. The magazine published the first nine serialized installments of a what was to be a 10-part tale. Each ran six pages, with the exception of part eight, which ran 12 pages. The magazine was cancelled as of February 1986, leaving the last chapter [[List of comics that were never published|unpublished and the story unfinished]]. According to notes at Byrne's website, the conclusion of the story would see a dying Galactus releasing his power causing a new [[Big Bang]] and transforming his herald Nova into the Galactus for the new universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 |title=Frequently Asked Questions - Questions about Aborted Storylines |publisher=Byrne Robotics |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>

During the Fantastic Four's fight with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], they were briefly allied with an alternate version of Nova. It was revealed at the conclusion that she was actually allied with Abraxas after her Galactus destroyed Earth even after accepting her as his herald. Nova transferred her anger for her failure to the Fantastic Four of the Earth-616 universe in the absence of her own. Abraxas subsequently drew in an army of Novas who had experienced similar traumas to keep the Fantastic Four occupied while he acquired the Ultimate Nullifier, the resulting army of Novas requiring the assistance of an army of alternate [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] just to keep them occupied.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #478</ref>
