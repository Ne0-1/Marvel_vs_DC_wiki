'''''Sons of the Tiger''''' were three [[Martial arts]] heroes featured in the [[comic book]] [[magazine]] published by [[Curtis Magazines]] (a short lived [[imprint]] of [[Marvel Comics]]) called The [[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]].  The "Origin" issue appeared in DHKF #1 entitled appropriately enough "The Sons of the Tiger".  The series was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and drawn by [[Dick Giordano]]. The series was published in the early 1970s amidst the "Kung Fu" or [[Chopsocky]] movie craze.  

The Sons of the Tiger also made appearances in ''Special Collector's Edition'' #1 entitled "Savage Fists of Kung Fu". They also appeared in the Special Album Edition of ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''. As a note; both of these appearances contained the exact story entitled: "The Master Plan of Fu Manchu". In this story the Sons of the Tiger team up with [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Shang-Chi]]. The SCE contained the story in color while the SAE contained it in [[Black-and-white]].

The Sons of the Tiger were three friends and [[Martial arts]] students of [[Master Kee]]:

*Lin Sun - [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], leader of the trio and adopted son of Master Kee.
*Abe Brown - [[African American]] member of the trio from the Ghetto streets of [[Harlem]].
*Robert Diamond - [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] member of the trio, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor.

===Origin===

Lin Sun is walking back from a [[Martial arts]] [[tournament]] with his 1st place [[trophy]] when he is suddenly attacked by ''[[ninja]]'' in front of his school in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. After defeating the villains he goes into the "Tiger Dojo" which has been ransacked. He finds a dying Master Kee who tells him that there are forces in this world which would destroy us and then points to a box on a shelf after which he dies. In the box Lin finds three amulets made of jade, a tiger's head and two claws: the symbol of their school. The inscription at the base of the box reads: '''When three are called and stand as one, as one they'll fight, their will be done...For each is born anew, The Tiger's Son'''.  They are later known as "The Amulets of Power".

Soon after, Lin meets up with his two friends Abe Brown and Bob Diamond who have also been attacked by ''ninja''. Lin recounts the story of Master Kee's death and gives each of them one of the Jade Tiger claw amulets. They soon discover that when they join hands and chant the inscription from the box they become mystically connected. Their martial arts skills combine to become one force: their physical abilities are tripled when they wore the amulets.   During the series run the trio runs up against "The Silent Ones", an evil organization with mystical ties attempting to rule the world.

===Demise===
Beginning in DHOKF # 19 entitled "An Ending", the trio break up and Lin Sun throws all three amulets in a trashcan located in an alley. There Hector Ayala of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] descent finds the amulets and wears them to become [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|The White Tiger]]. The Sons of the Tiger appeared in the next two stories: "A Beginning" and "To Claw the Eyes of Night" during the transition to The White Tiger stories. The character of Abe Brown is mostly seen periodically after that. 

Interestingly, the book continued using the title "Sons of the Tiger" even though the trio had split up and power was transferred to the "White Tiger".

===After cancellation===
Bob Diamond continued to make occasional appearances in ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' as [[Colleen Wing]]'s lover.

More recently, the Sons of the Tiger appeared briefly with [[Luke Cage]]'s Human Resistance after the [[Scarlet Witch]] altered the world during the ''[[House of M]]'' crossover, along with the [[Daughters of the Dragon]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Moon Knight]]. They also appeared alongside Spider-Man in Marvel Team-Up #40. In November 2008 they made an appearance in Manifest Destiny: Wolverine, though their purpose has not been revealed yet it appears they will be reoccurring characters in the storyline<ref>http://comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=437</ref>.
