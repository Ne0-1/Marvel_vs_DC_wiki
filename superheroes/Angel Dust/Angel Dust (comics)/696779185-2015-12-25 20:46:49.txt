==Fictional character biography==
When the scared young mutant Angel Dust ran away to join the [[Chicago]] faction of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], she left behind her frantic parents, who had no idea where she went or why she had left.<ref>''Morlocks'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Angel Dust and the other Morlocks swore to help each other resolve one "aboveground" issue, she returned home to tell her parents the truth she thought they would turn her out of the family forever: she was a mutant. To Angel DustÂ´s surprise, her parents accepted her for who she was, but it was only after she had helped her compatriots defeat a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] base that Angel Dust finally returned home for good.<ref>''Morlocks'' #3-4.
