==Fictional character biography==
When the scared young mutant Angel Dust ran away to join the [[Chicago]] faction of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], she leaves behind her frantic parents, who have no idea where she went or why she left them.<ref>''[[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Angel Dust and the other Morlocks swear to help each other resolve one "aboveground" issue, she returns home to tell her parents the truth, which she thought would result in rejection by her family. To Angel Dust's surprise, her parents accepted her for who she was, but it was only after she had helped her compatriots defeat a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] base that Angel Dust finally returns home for good.<ref>''Morlocks'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She is confirmed to have lost her powers after the events of the 2005 "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" storyline.<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Angel Dust has the ability to increase her [[adrenaline]] levels, gaining superhuman strength for a short time. Her strength varies from being able to lift {{convert|800|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} to being able to lift {{convert|25|t|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=in|order=flip}}, depending on her adrenaline levels. Her speed, agility and stamina are also enhanced. However, she can only use her powers for a short time before exhausting herself. When she uses her powers, dark lines appear on her face.<ref>''Morlocks'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
[[Gina Carano]] plays Angel Dust in the 2016 feature film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Kit, Borys|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/gina-carano-joins-ryan-reynolds-773247|title=Gina Carano Joins Ryan Reynolds in Fox's 'Deadpool' (Exclusive)|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Instead of being a teenage superhero with natural mutant abilities, she is an adult who gained her powers through experimentation by the film's villain [[Ajax (comics)|Ajax]], for whom Angel Dust works. In contrast to her comic counterpart, her powers do not appear to be as dependent on a temporary surge of adrenaline, the upward limits of her physical strength seem to be higher and she exhibits a super-human level of durability, as she is able to hold her own in hand-to-hand combat with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].
