:''This article is about the comic book version of the Gibborim. For the beings out of Judeo-Christian belief see [[Gibborim (biblical)]].
'''The Gibborium''' are a [[fictional]] group of six-fingered giants who have the goal of wiping the Earth clean of humanity. They first appeared in the pages of the [[comic book]] series [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
To obtain their goal the Gibborim enlisted six couples in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area to carry out their plans. These six formed the core of a secret criminal organization known as [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]].

{{spoiler}}

Annually the Pride would get together and ritually murder a young girl in what they referred to as "The Rite of Blood." The victim's soul would then be fed to the Gibborim in "The Rite of Thunder." These ceremonies were to be performed every year. Eventually, the result was to be the annihilation of humanity with the Gibborim promising six surviving positions to those among the Pride who served them best.

Seventeen years in, the Rite of Thunder was interrupted by the children of the Pride. In response, the Gibborim presumably killed all the members of the Pride. [[Alex Wilder]], the only individual amongst the children to side with the Pride was killed as well.
