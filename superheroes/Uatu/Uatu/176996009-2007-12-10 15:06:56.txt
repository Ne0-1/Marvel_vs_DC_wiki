'''Uatu''' often simply known as '''The Watcher''' is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[character]] created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' Volume 1 #13 (April 1963). He is a member of the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] [[species]] who in the distant past stationed themselves across space to monitor the activities of other species. Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe [[Earth]] and its [[solar system]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Like other Watchers, Uatu is sworn to an oath of non-interference; however, he has bent or outright violated his oath on numerous occasions in order to aid humanity. Uatu dwells on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], an abandoned city built by the alien [[Kree]] centuries ago. In his first appearance, he encountered the Fantastic Four and their enemy, the [[Red Ghost]], When the latter entered his home, he repelled the invader with a thought and, breaking his oath for the first time, revealed himself to the Fantastic Four. Uatu, being youthful and rebellious in comparison to his brethren, would break his oath many more times in the future, most notably in ''Fantastic Four'' volume 1 #48, in which he tried, and failed, to prevent the [[Silver Surfer]] from bringing the world-devourer [[Galactus]] to the Earth. He was once placed on trial for violating his oath.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #39</ref> 

In the mini-series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' we learn that, although ''Fantastic Four'' #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel's superheroes more than 300 years early forced him to severely bend it, communicating with the 1602 version of [[Doctor Strange]] prior to the latter's death (thereby breaking his commandment not to reveal himself to a living soul). To remind him of this, he must maintain a [[pocket universe]] containing the 1602 world within himself.

Uatu has appeared countless times since, on several occasions narrating other characters' adventures. He also served as narrator for the ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' series, which told tales of alternate versions of the [[Marvel Universe]] where certain events unfolded differently (and often disastrously). At least once, he has been removed from his duty as Watcher of the Earth, but he nevertheless returns to his true calling, observing the world he has become so fond of. In particular, he considers the Fantastic Four to be quite intriguing; [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] could be said to be his only human friend.

Uatu also has a history with the [[X-Men]], and most commonly appears when [[Jean Grey]] is experiencing enhancements to her Phoenix powers. He is also seen in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #473, where he reveals the true story of [[Jamie Braddock]], the brother of X-Man [[Psylocke]], and how he got involved with the villain group called "the Foursaken". He also appears to have some sort of history with the centuries old mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. During the ''[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught saga]]'', he and Apocalypse observed and discussed the conflict from afar.

Uatu revealed himself during the "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" event, as well as during the wedding of the Black Panther and Storm (apparently he smiled when their vows were exchanged). It has been stated that when Uatu appears, an event of great importance is taking place. He also spoke briefly with the meditating Doctor Strange on the eve of the final battle between the two sides of the war. He asks Doctor Strange why he doesn't use his immense power to end the conflict with a wave of his hand. Strange answers that a [[Sorcerer Supreme]] cannot take sides in this matter, especially since there is no clear right or wrong, but he will pray for an outcome that will benefit mankind and spill the least amount of blood. Uatu reflects that this is much like his own situation.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate universe of [[Earth X]], Uatu is portrayed as a cold, nihilistic manipulator who feels far superior to the people of earth whom he watches. 

===JLA/Avengers===
In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Uatu made a wordless cameo, as he watched the [[Justice League]] in the DC Universe, the only time a Watcher ever appeared there.

===Powerless===
In the ''Powerless'' [[limited series]], reality is turned upside down and Uatu plays the role of psychiatrist William Watts. Watts's patients are the powerless heroes who face problems similar to their super-powered counterparts from [[Earth 616]]. Just like in Earth 616, Uatu finds that he cannot just stand by and watch as his patients' lives are ruined, and tries to come to their aid.

===Star Trek/X-Men===
In the ''[[Planet X (Star Trek)|Planet X]]'' ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''/X-Men crossover novel, at the end the crossing of dimensions is revealed to be due to the interference of both [[Q (Star Trek)|Q ]] and The Watcher.
