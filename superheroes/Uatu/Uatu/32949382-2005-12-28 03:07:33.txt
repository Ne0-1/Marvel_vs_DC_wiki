In the [[fiction]]al [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], '''Uatu''' is the member of the [[extraterrestrial]] [[species]] known as the [[Watchers (comics)|Watchers]] assigned to observe [[Earth]] and its [[solar system]]. As he is thus the Watcher whom Earth-based superheroes most often come contact with, he is often known as simply the '''Watcher'''.

Like other Watchers, Uatu is sworn to an oath of non-interference; however, he has bent or outright violated his oath on several occasions in order to aid humanity. Uatu first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' volume 1 #13 (1962), created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].  

Uatu dwells on the "Blue Area" of the Moon, an abandoned city built by the alien [[Kree]] centuries ago.  In his first appearance, he encountered the Fantastic Four and their enemy, the [[Red Ghost]], as the latter entered his home; he repelled the invader with a thought and, breaking his oath for the first time, revealed himself to the Fantastic Four.  Uatu, being youthful and rebellious in comparison to his brethren, would break his oath many more times in the future, most notably in ''Fantastic Four'' volume 1 #48, in which he tried, and failed, to prevent the [[Silver Surfer]] from bringing the world-devourer [[Galactus]] to the Earth. 

Uatu has appeared countless times since, on several occasions narrating other characters' adventures.  He also served as narrator for the ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' series, which told tales of alternate versions of the Marvel Universe where certain events unfolded differently (and often disastrously). At least once, he has been removed from his duty as Watcher of the Earth, but he nevertheless returns to his true calling, observing the world he has become so fond of.

In the mini-series ''[[1602 (comics)|1602]]'' we learn that, although ''Fantastic Four'' #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel's superheroes more than 300 years early forced him to severely bend it, communicating with the 1602 version of [[Doctor Strange]] following the latter's death (thereby following to the letter his commandment not to reveal himself to a living soul). To remind him of this, he must maintain a [[pocket universe]] containing the 1602 world within himself.
