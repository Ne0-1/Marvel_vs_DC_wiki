'''Uatu''', often simply known as '''The Watcher''', is a [[fictional character]] created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' Volume 1 #13 (April 1963). He is a member of the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] [[species]] who in the distant past stationed themselves across space to monitor the activities of other species. Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe [[Earth]] and its [[solar system]].

==Fictional character biography==
The race of Watchers was an advanced civilization which sought (at the suggestion of Uatu's father, Ikor) to spread its knowledge to other races. Their first attempt ended when the recipient race used the nuclear technology gained to create weapons and destroy itself. Afterwards the Watchers took a vow never to interfere with other civilizations.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]] #52-#53''</ref>

Like other Watchers, Uatu is sworn to an oath of non-interference; however, he has bent or outright violated his oath on numerous occasions in order to aid humanity. Uatu dwells on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], an abandoned city built by the alien [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] centuries ago. In his first appearance, he encountered the Fantastic Four and their enemy, the [[Red Ghost]], When the latter entered his home, he repelled the invader with a thought and, breaking his oath for the first time, revealed himself to the Fantastic Four. Uatu, being youthful and rebellious in comparison to his brethren, would break his oath many more times in the future, most notably in ''Fantastic Four'' volume 1 #48, in which he tried, and failed, to prevent the [[Silver Surfer]] from bringing the world-devourer [[Galactus]] to the Earth. He was once placed on trial for violating his oath.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #39</ref> 

The mini-series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' reveals that, although ''Fantastic Four'' #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel's superheroes more than 300 years early forced him to severely bend it, communicating with the 1602 version of [[Doctor Strange]] prior to the latter's death. As a result, he must maintain a [[pocket universe]] containing the 1602 world within himself.

Uatu has appeared countless times since, on several occasions narrating other characters' adventures. He also served as narrator for the ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' series, which told tales of alternate versions of the [[Marvel Universe]] where certain events unfolded differently (and often disastrously). He also narrated and starred in ''Tales of the Watcher'', a short-lived feature which ran in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #49-#58 as backup stories to the main [[Iron Man]] feature. At least once, he has been removed from his duty as Watcher of the Earth, but he nevertheless returns to his true calling, observing the world he has become so fond of. 

Uatu also has a history with the [[X-Men]], and most commonly appears when [[Jean Grey]] is experiencing enhancements to her Phoenix powers. He is also seen in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #473, where he reveals the true story of [[Jamie Braddock]], the brother of X-Man [[Psylocke]], and how he got involved with the villain group called "the Forsaken". He also appears to have some sort of history with the centuries old mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. During the [[Onslaught (comics)|''Onslaught'' saga]], he and Apocalypse observed and discussed the conflict from afar. When the Dreaming Celestial was awakened, the Watcher, for just an instant, turned away, unwilling to watch.<ref>''The Eternals'' (2006) #6</ref>

===Civil War===
Uatu revealed himself during the "''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''" [[story arc]], as well as during the wedding of the Black Panther and Storm. He also spoke briefly with the [[meditation|meditating]] Doctor Strange on the eve of the final battle between the two sides of the war. He asks Doctor Strange why he doesn't use his immense power to end the conflict with a wave of his hand. Strange answers that a [[Sorcerer Supreme]] cannot take sides in this matter, especially since there is no clear right or wrong, but he will pray for an outcome that will benefit mankind and spill the least amount of blood. Uatu reflects that this is much like his own situation.

===Hulk===
During his fight with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], the [[Red Hulk]] attacked Uatu who was watching the fight.<ref>''Hulk'' #4 (June 2008)</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
In issue #7 of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' Mini-series, Uatu made himself known during the midst of the fight between the heroes and the [[Skrull]] army warning them of a cosmic battle that is yet to come.

==Other versions==
===1602===
The mini-series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' reveals that, although ''Fantastic Four'' #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel's superheroes more than 300 years early forced him to severely bend it, communicating with the 1602 version of [[Doctor Strange]] prior to the latter's death. As a result, he must maintain a [[pocket universe]] containing the 1602 world within himself.

===Earth X===
In the [[alternate universe]] of ''[[Earth X]]'', Uatu is portrayed as a cold, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] manipulator who feels far superior to the people of earth whom he watches. This is partially because of the fact that he has been blinded by [[Black Bolt]]. Also, Uatu (who watches the events on Earth from a base on the moon) is the original inspiration for the Egyptian moon god [[Khonshu_(Marvel_Comics)|Khonshu]] who is associated with the origins of the Marvel superhero [[Moon Knight]].

===JLA/Avengers===
In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Uatu makes a wordless cameo, as he watched the [[Justice League]] in the DC Universe, the only time a Watcher ever appeared there.

===MC-2 Universe===
In the [[alternate universe]] of the ''[[MC-2]]'' Universe, Uatu made several appearances in that world regarding it last two mini-series, ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'', and ''[[Last Planet Standing]]''. The former where he briefly told the story of the MC-Universe and it history, while in the latter he died while standing in the way of Galactus and his herald.

===Powerless===
In the ''Powerless'' [[limited series]], reality is turned upside down and Uatu plays the role of [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] William Watts. Watts's patients are the powerless heroes who face problems similar to their super-powered counterparts from [[Earth 616]]. Just like in Earth 616, Uatu finds that he cannot just stand by and watch as his patients' lives are ruined, and tries to come to their aid.

===Star Trek/X-Men===
In the ''[[Planet X (Star Trek)|Planet X]]'' ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''/''X-Men'' crossover novel, at the end the crossing of dimensions is revealed to be due to the interference of both [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] and The Watcher.

===Ultimate Uatu===
The Watcher was a character announced to appear {{Fact|date=August 2008}} in the [[Ultimate Universe]] 6 part book, ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel Comics)|Ultimatum]]''.

In #4 of [[Ultimate Origins]], the Ultimate counterpart of Uatu is revealed. Ultimate Uatu is not a person, but rather a highly advanced alien computer that "Watches" everything. Ultimate Watcher resembles a stone totem of sorts with a glowing red eye. However, it appears that there is more than one Watcher in the Ultimate universe for in [[Ultimate X-Men]] #96 [[Jean Grey]] attempts to find heaven to resurrect her father, only to be stopped by a [[Silver Surfer]] that is stationed in front of thousands of Watcher's in a hive colony.

===Marvel Apes===
At the end of the main story of each Marvel Apes issue, a Gorilla version of the watcher can be seen telling us about stories from the past and trying to get around to a story of the "MARVEL APES AGE". In issue two he becomes drunk after drinking an "Ultimate Nullifier", which he claims is like a martini only mixed with "Kirby Dots", in his drunken state he vents at how boring watching everything all the time is. He also reveals how he is infatuated with the ape version of the Wasp. In his drunken ranting he goes so far as to ask the reader if they "Wanna make out" then after realising what he has said, he apologises and then tries to explain himself.   He usually picks stories to tell that entertain him, such as the story of giant cowboy rat men, or homosexual cowboy-apes, or the story of how Odin sentenced the Thorangutang to learn humility by becoming a doctor in the upbeat, rich city of Manhattan.
