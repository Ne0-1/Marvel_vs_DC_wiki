'''Uatu''', often simply known as '''The Watcher''', is a [[fictional character]], created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and designed by artist [[Jack Kirby]], who first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' Volume 1 #13 (April 1963). He is a member of the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] [[species]] who in the distant past stationed themselves across space to monitor the activities of other species. Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe [[Earth]] and its [[solar system]].

==Fictional character biography==
The race of [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]] was an advanced civilization which sought (at the suggestion of Uatu's father, Ikor) to spread its knowledge to other races. Their first attempt, on the planet Prosilicus, ended when the recipient race, the Prosilicans, used the nuclear technology gained to create weapons and destroy itself. When the Watchers returned to Prosilicus, the survivors blamed them for the catastrophe by giving the Prosilicans nuclear technology before they were ready for it. The Watchers then took a vow never to interfere with other civilizations.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]] #52-#53''</ref>

Like other Watchers, Uatu is an observer sworn to an oath of non-interference; however, as an altruist he has bent or outright violated his oath on numerous occasions in order to aid humanity. Uatu left the Watchers' home world to dwell on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], an abandoned city built by the alien [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] centuries ago. In his first appearance, in which he was introduced simply as '''The Watcher''', he encountered the [[Fantastic Four]] and their enemy, the [[Red Ghost]]. When the latter entered his home, he repelled the invader with a thought and, breaking his oath for the first time, revealed himself to the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #13</ref> The Watcher, being youthful and rebellious in comparison to his brethren, would break his oath many more times in the future. He warned the Fantastic Four about the original [[Molecule Man]], and took him into custody.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #20</ref> He also enabled [[Mister Fantastic]] to find a device to defeat a horde of enemies.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> His most notable transgression was in ''Fantastic Four'' volume 1 #48, in which he tried, and failed, to prevent the [[Silver Surfer]] from bringing the world-devourer [[Galactus]] to the Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #48</ref> He then witnessed the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' battle against the [[Scarlet Centurion]],<ref>''Avengers Special'' #2</ref> and witnessed the Avengers and [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] battle against [[Dormammu]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Avengers'' #118</ref> He was once placed on trial by the Watchers for violating his oath; he was found guilty by the Watchers' High Tribunal of intervention in the affairs of humanity, but released under his own cognizance. His true name, Uatu, was revealed in this appearance.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #39</ref> 

During ''[[The Trial of Galactus]]'' storyline, Uatu also served as Mister Fantastic's lawyer when he stood trial before the Shi'ar.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #262</ref>

The mini-series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' reveals that, although ''Fantastic Four'' #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel's superheroes more than 300 years early forced him to severely bend it, communicating with the 1602 version of [[Doctor Strange]] prior to the latter's death. As a result, he must maintain a [[pocket universe]] containing the 1602 world within himself.

Uatu has appeared countless times since, on several occasions narrating other characters' adventures. He also served as narrator for the ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' series, which told tales of alternate versions of the [[Marvel Universe]] where certain events unfolded differently (and often disastrously). He also narrated and starred in ''Tales of the Watcher,'' a short-lived feature which ran in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #49-#58 as backup stories to the main [[Iron Man]] feature. At least once, he has been removed from his duty as Watcher of the Earth, but he nevertheless returns to his true calling, observing the world he has become so fond of. 

Uatu also has a history with the [[X-Men]], having witnessed the physical demise of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>''X-Men'' #137</ref> Much later, Uatu enlisted [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]]'s aid in gathering the renegade [[Living Laser]]s.<ref>''Quasar'' #30</ref> Regarding the X-Men, Uatu most commonly appears when [[Jean Grey]] is experiencing enhancements to her Phoenix powers.{{Or|date=May 2009}} He is also seen in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #473, where he reveals the true story of [[Jamie Braddock]], the brother of X-Man [[Psylocke]], and how he got involved with the villain group called "the Forsaken." He also appears to have some sort of history with the centuries-old mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. During the [[Onslaught (comics)|''Onslaught'' saga]], he and Apocalypse observed and discussed the conflict from afar. When the Dreaming Celestial was awakened, the Watcher, for just an instant, turned away, unwilling to watch.<ref>''The Eternals'' (2006) #6</ref>

The [[Dreaming Celestial]] later scans Uatu and learns the Watcher has broken his pact of non-interference almost 400 times <ref>''Eternals'' vol. 7, (Oct. 2008)</ref>

Uatu later appeared before the Illuminati during their accidental misuse of the Infinity Gauntlet and its gems. Reed Richards pleads with Uatu to take the Gauntlet but he refuses, stating that not even he can handle such power. So therefore, the Illuminati split the gems among themselves.<ref>''New Avengers Illuminati'' Vol.2, #2</ref> 

===Civil War===
Uatu revealed himself during the ''"[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]"'' [[story arc]], as well as during the wedding of the Black Panther and Storm. He also spoke briefly with the [[meditation|meditating]] Doctor Strange on the eve of the final battle between the two sides of the war. He asks Doctor Strange why he does not use his immense power to end the conflict with a wave of his hand. Strange answers that a [[Sorcerer Supreme]] cannot take sides in this matter, especially since there is no clear right or wrong, but he will pray for an outcome that will benefit mankind and spill the least amount of blood. Uatu reflects that this is much like his own situation. Uatu later shows two possible versions of the Civil War to Tony Stark as the latter visits the grave of his fallen friend and fellow hero, [[Steve Rogers]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

===The Hulk===
During his fight with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], the [[Red Hulk]] attacked Uatu who was watching the fight.<ref>''Hulk'' #4 (June 2008)</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
In issue #7 of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' Mini-series, Uatu made himself known during the midst of the fight between the heroes and the [[Skrull]] army, warning them of a cosmic battle that is yet to come.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a member of the race of Watchers, Uatu possesses vast psionic abilities which have been further developed through training. These abilities include flight, telepathy, energy-manipulation powers, power-negating force-field projection, illusion casting, the ability to psionically alter his appearance at will, and highly advanced cosmic senses allowing him to be aware of countless events of Earth. His superhumanly complex intelligence enables him to monitor activities throughout Earth's solar system simultaneously. Uatu can convert his body into an unknown form of energy while still retaining his sentience for travel through hyperspace, and then return to his physical form. Bolstered by treatment with "delta-rays", Uatu possesses virtual immortality, although he can die by losing the will to live. Watchers can augment their strength with cosmic psionic energy if they choose to; however they tend to minimize their physical activities.

The 1985 edition of the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' compared Uatu's scale of power to that of [[Galactus]], the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], and [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]. 

Uatu has received a highly extensive education in his youth on his home world.  Uatu has devoted himself to the study of Earth's solar system and its sentient beings for millions of years. His home on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] contains an enormous array of weaponry, artifacts, and technology created by various alien races from throughout the universe.

In recent years Uatu has undertaken the study of the Earths of alternate realities. With permission from the Timekeepers, he possesses a portal through which he can observe alternate realities. He has acquired extraordinary knowledge of the history of both the sentient beings on "mainstream" Earth and numerous alternate Earths.

==Other versions==
===1602===
The mini-series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' reveals that, although ''Fantastic Four'' #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel's superheroes more than 300 years early forced him to severely bend it, communicating with the 1602 version of [[Doctor Strange]] prior to the latter's death. As a result, he must maintain a [[pocket universe]] containing the 1602 world within himself.

===Earth X===
In the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] of ''[[Earth X]]'', Uatu is portrayed as a cold, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] manipulator who feels far superior to the people of earth whom he watches. This is partially because of the fact that he has been blinded by [[Black Bolt]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Also, Uatu (who watches the events on Earth from a base on the moon) is the original inspiration for the Egyptian moon god [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]] who is associated with the origins of the Marvel superhero [[Moon Knight]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===JLA/Avengers===
In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Uatu makes a wordless cameo, as he watched the [[Justice League]] in the DC Universe, the only time a Watcher ever appeared there.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies Return===
A version of Uatu witnesses the Zombie Spider-Man's arrival in his universe. After being horrified by the nature of the infection, he decides to travel to other universes to warn others of the infection, but the zombie [[Henry Pym#Marvel Zombies|Giant-Man]] appears and bites off Uatu's head, planning to use his communicator to traverse the multiverse and satiate his hunger.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #1</ref> At the end of the series, Uatu returns stating he was pure energy, and thus could not be infected by the virus. He then proceeds to trap the last zombie, the Sentry, in a time-loop paradox by sending him back in time to Earth-2149, starting the entire Marvel Zombies Saga from the beginning.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #5</ref>

===MC-2 Universe===
In the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate]] ''[[MC-2]]'' Universe, Uatu made several appearances regarding its last two mini-series, ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'', and ''[[Last Planet Standing]]''. In the former, he briefly related the history of the MC-Universe; in the latter he died while standing in the way of Galactus and his herald.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Powerless===
In the ''[[Powerless (comics)|Powerless]]'' [[limited series]], reality is turned upside down and Uatu plays the role of [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] William Watts. Watts (whose name recalls "Uatu" and "Watcher") encounters non-powered versions of Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil, who face problems similar to their super-powered counterparts from [[Earth 616]]. Just like in Earth 616, Uatu finds that he cannot just stand by and watch as his patients' lives are ruined, and tries to come to their aid.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Star Trek/X-Men===
At the end of the ''[[Planet X (Star Trek)|Planet X]]'' ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''/''X-Men'' crossover novel, the crossing of dimensions is revealed to have been due to the interference of both [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] and The Watcher.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Ultimate Uatu===
In #4 of [[Ultimate Origins]], the Ultimate counterpart of Uatu is revealed. Ultimate Uatu is not a person, but rather a highly advanced alien computer that "Watches" everything. Ultimate Watcher resembles a stone totem of sorts with a glowing red eye. However, it appears that there is more than one Watcher in the Ultimate universe, for in [[Ultimate X-Men]] #96 [[Jean Grey]] attempts to find heaven to resurrect her father, only to be stopped by a [[Silver Surfer]] that is stationed in front of thousands of Watchers in a hive colony.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Marvel Apes===
At the end of the main story of each [[Marvel Apes]] issue, a Gorilla version of The Watcher can be seen telling us about stories from the past and trying to get around to a story of the "MARVEL APES AGE". In issue two he becomes drunk after drinking an "Ultimate Nullifier", which he claims is like a martini only mixed with "Kirby Dots". in his drunken state he vents, complaining about how boring it is to watch everything all the time. He also reveals that he is infatuated with the ape version of the Wasp. In his drunken ranting he goes so far as to ask the reader if they "Wanna make out" then after realizing what he has said, he apologizes and tries to explain himself.   He usually picks stories to tell that entertain him, such as the story of giant cowboy rat men, or homosexual cowboy-apes, or the story of how [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] sentenced the Thorangutang to learn humility by becoming a doctor in the upbeat, rich city of Manhattan.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}
