==Fictional character biography==
Goom is an alien from Planet X who attempted to conquer the Earth. He was defeated and returned to his home planet by other aliens from Planet X, but his son [[Googam]] soon followed in his father's footsteps.  At some point, he was captured by the alien [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and imprisoned alongside other monsters. These captives were freed by the [[Mole Man]], but were defeated by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Mister Fantastic]] exiled them into the [[Negative Zone]]. Somehow, Goom and other monsters returned to Earth and took up residence on the Mole Man's Monster Isle. On a Valentine's Day, Goom attempted to find a human mate on Earth, but the goddess [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] instead set him up (somewhat against his will) with the alien Shivoor. Goom vanished afterwards, leaving his son Googam alone on Earth. The microscopic dictator [[Tim Boo Baa]] took advantage of Googam's search for his father to manipulate Googam into bringing him to Earth, where he was defeated by Googam's allies, the "Fin Fang Four". Goom was later captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed in the custody of their [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.

In ''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #5, [[Xemnu the Titan]] created a duplicate of Goom which was later destroyed by the Hulk.

Goom has mental powers and an immense head.  He had advanced technology which was seen in ''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1 #15 including a spaceship, a disintegration-inducing "Neutron Ray", and a time machine, which had the ability to change the age of others.
