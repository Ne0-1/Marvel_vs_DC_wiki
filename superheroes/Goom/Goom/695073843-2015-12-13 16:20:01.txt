==In other media==
===Television===
* Goom appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "The Hunted" where its vocal effects are provided by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. The Goom seen in this episode is depicted as a female, didn't demonstrate any mental powers and was little more than a wild animal, and is revealed to have the ability to breathe fire, ice, and acid. Hulk finds the eggs of Goom which hatch as Hulk protects the eggs of Goom from [[Arkon]]. When Hulk and the baby Gooms (whose vocal effects are provided by [[Clancy Brown]], [[Benjamin Diskin]], and [[Eliza Dushku]]) are captured and placed in cages on Arkon's ship, it is revealed that Goom was previously captured by Arkon in his plot to raise the baby Gooms and use them to hunt Earth's heroes. With help from Hulk, the Gooms end up crashing Arkon's ship while Arkon is chased away by Monster Island's inhabitants. Hulk left one of the floating cameras on Monster Island to keep an eye on the baby Gooms. In the episode "Planet Monsters" Pt. 2, Goom assists the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers in their fight against the [[Kree]].
