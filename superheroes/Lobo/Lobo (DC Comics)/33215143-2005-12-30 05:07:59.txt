At least two [[comic book]] characters, including the first known [[African-American]] character to star in his/her own comic-book series [http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=220622], have used the name '''Lobo.'''

==Dell Comics==

The first was the [[Western (genre)|Western]] star of [[Dell Comics]]' little-known but groundbreaking, two-issue series  ''Lobo'' (Dec. 1965 & Sept. 1966), also listed as ''Dell Comics'' #12-438-512 and #12-439-610 in the company's quirky numbering system. Created by an unknown writer and drawn by [[Tony Tallarico]], it chronicled the [[Old West]] adventures of a wealthy, unnamed African-American gunslinger hero called "Lobo" by the first issue's [[antagonists]]. On the foreheads of vanquished criminals, Lobo would leave the calling card of a gold coin imprinted with the image of a wolf and an "L".

While [[Marvel Comics]]' 1950s predecessor [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] had included "Waku, Prince of the Bantu" — a rare feature starring an African chieftain in Africa, with no European characters — in its seven-issue [[omnibus (media)|omnibus]] series ''Jungle Tales'' (Sept. 1954 - Sept. 1955), it was one of four regular features each issue, and did not star an African-American. There would be no other African-American star of his/her own comic book until 1973 in ''[[Jungle Action]]'', starring Marvel's [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] (the first black superhero, introduced July 1966).

==DC Comics==
The better-known comic-book character Lobo is an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[mercenary]]  [[antihero]] (arguably a [[superhero]]) created by artist [[Keith Giffen]] and writer [[Roger Slifer]]. He debuted in [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Omega Men]]'' series in 1983.  Although intended to be an over-the-top [[parody]] of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], the character became hugely popular — more so than his creators had intended for a one-note gag character. When the series ''Omega Men'' was disrupted in 1988, Lobo became a regular character in ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'' and its successor series ''[[R.E.B.E.L.S.]]'' until 1990, when he appeared in his own [[miniseries]], ''Lobo: The Last Czarnian'', by writer [[Alan Grant]] and artist [[Simon Bisley]].

Grant's humor and Bisley's art helped to make made this four-issue series a hit, leading to many subsequent miniseries and specials. These include ''Lobocop'' (a [[RoboCop]] parody), ''Blazing Chain of Love'' (in which he is sent on a job to a [[harem]]), ''Paramilitary Christmas Special'' (in which he is contracted to assassinate [[Santa Claus]] by the [[Easter Bunny]]), ''Convention Special'' (a send-up of comic book [[conventions]]) and ''Un[[American Gladiators]]'' (in which Lobo takes part in a deadly televised [[game show]]). Lobo also starred in his own title for 64 issues, from 1993 to 1999. 

[[Image:Wolverine lobo.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Wolverine vs. Lobo.]] 

Throughout, Lobo has guest-starred regularly in other series, even in cross-company interactions with such non-DC characters as [[The Mask]], [[Judge Dredd]], and [[The Authority|the Authority]]. During the ''DC vs. Marvel'' crossover series, he fought [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] &mdash; and lost due to popular vote by real-life fans, though a later issue of Lobo's series implied that a bald-headed individual, possibly [[Professor Xavier]], had paid Lobo to take a fall.

In the Lobo series and miniseries, everything is excessive, from the main character's perversions, mindless violence, and vocabulary to the <!--muted -- NOTE: "muted" means quiet or toned-down. Is that really the right word?--> colors and the grotesque graphics.  Everything in the series is laughable (in the sense of being ridiculous, if not always amusing), even his profanities ("Frag" and "Bastich"), which are used to replace vocabulary unwanted by a family-friendly DC and to satirize similar expressions in other comics.

===Background===
Lobo is a [[Czarnia]]n, possessing exceptional strength and fortitude. Lobo has always been a bad man, who likes nothing better than mindless violence and intoxication. Killing is an end in itself: his name is [[Khund]]ian for "he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it". He is also arrogant and self-centered, focusing almost solely on his own pleasures. Lobo is the last of his kind: he killed all the other Czarnians. According to ''Superman: The Animated Series'', it was for a high school science project, for which he gave himself an "A". Possibly, Lobo cannot stay dead, as both heaven and hell threw him out; however, whether the comics in which these events occurred can be considered part of DC's mainstream [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] is dubious.

[[Image:Lobo01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|'''Lobo'''.]]
Lobo's friends include a [[pit bull]] and a hair-parlor proprietress.  His enemies include the do-gooder superhero parody [[Goldstar (comics)|Goldstar]], [[Loo (comics)|Loo]] as well as [[Vril Dox]], [[Bludhound]], [[Etrigan]] the Demon, and [[General Glory]].  

Physically, Lobo resembles a chalk-white human male with blood-red [[pupil]]less eyes surrounded by black [[mascara]]-like patches. Although he was originally portrayed as having neatly trimmed purple-grey hair, this was soon redesigned to be a long, straggly, grey-black mane. Similarly, the orange-and-purple leotard he wore in his first few appearances has long since been replaced by black leather [[biker]] gear.

His superhuman (or super-Czarnian) abilities include enormous strength (which, however, seems to vary greatly; [[fanon]] speculates that his strength automatically scales up or down to match that of his opponent), the ability to survive unaided in space, a [[healing factor]] that heals ludicrous amounts of damage, an equally ludicrous sense of smell which allows him to track objects between solar systems, and the ability to regrow an entire new Lobo from each drop of his own spilled blood. This last ability was removed by Vril Dox, but later restored.

In addition to his ever-present lust for violence, Lobo also has a strict personal code of honor — he will never violate the ''letter'' of an agreement, although he may gleefully disregard its ''spirit''. Also, he is extremely protective of space dolphins.

===Li'l Lobo===
[[Image:LilLobo01.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Li'l Lobo with the [[Young Justice]].]]

In 1998, Lobo was transformed into a [[teenager]] by a magical accident. In this state, he joined [[Young Justice]] and eventually accompanied them to [[Apokolips]]. There, he was killed in combat. However, the aforementioned magical accident had restored his ability to regrow from a single drop of blood, and millions of Lobos rushed into battle with Apokoliptian soldiers, whom the Lobos quickly defeated. The Lobos then turned on each other, until only one was left; in the process, the surviving Lobo regrew to adulthood.

An additional teenage Lobo remained, having hidden from the fight; he rejoined Young Justice and chose to rename himself '''Slo-bo'''. Eventually, this clone degraded, becoming blind and on the brink of death. Before he could die, however, [[Darkseid]] teleported him to the headquarters of Young Justice [[DC One Million|One Million]] in the 853rd Century, turning him into a (still aware) statue in the process.

===Lobo the Duck===
Lobo the Duck is an incarnation of Lobo and [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Howard the Duck]] in the [[Amalgam Comics]] company crossovers.  The big arm is derived from Lobo's alternative self, Lady Lobo, of ''Lobo's Back'' #2.  He fights characters of DC and Marvel combinations such as the Kidnoids, and Ambush the Lunatik.  His friends include [[Impossible Dawg]] and [[Doctor Strangefate]].

===Animated Lobo===
{{spoiler}}
Lobo first appeared on the small screen in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. In the episode "Main Man", Lobo (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]) was hired by an alien named the "Preserver" to capture Superman and add him to the Preserver's collection of rare and endangered species. Lobo headed straight for Earth and started firing in the middle of a police station until [[Superman]] eventually showed up to confront him. The two battled all over downtown [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], a battle which ended with Lobo leaving Earth to supposedly "take five."

Superman followed after Lobo into space, where Lobo lured Superman into a trap set by the Preserver. Superman was eventually captured and placed in a specialized cage, so that the Preserver might preserve Superman as the last remnant of the [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]]ian race. However, the Preserver then decided to add Lobo to his collection as well, since Lobo was also technically the last of his own race. Superman and Lobo eventually joined forces to escape the Preserver, and in return, Lobo promised to leave Earth alone.

Lobo also briefly appeared in another ''Superman: The Animated Series'' episode in which [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] falls in love with Superman.

Lobo eventually returned to Earth, however, in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter." Believing that Superman had died, Lobo wanted to join the Justice League, insisting that only he could take Superman's place. Lobo seemed to be motivated more out of [[ego]] and a chance "to bust heads" than any actual desire to do good or help others. In spite of his obvious violent tendencies and his lack of any redeeming moral virtues, the League allowed Lobo to help them for a short time while they dealt with a large number of supervillains running amok in Metropolis in response to Superman's apparent death. Lobo battled and defeated the supervillain [[Kalibak]], though the League had to stop Lobo from using excessive force on Kalibak after the fight had ended. In the end, Superman returned to the ranks of the League, and Lobo, his membership rejected, left. Brad Garrett reprised his voice role.

As in the comics, Lobo possessed exceptional strength and durability as well as an arsenal of weapons. However, he never displayed any of the healing powers or advanced senses that he posses in the comics. Lobo has not reappeared since the League removed him.

===Film debut===
Lobo found his way onto an [[American Film Institute]] [[student film]] based on the comic book ''Lobo's Paramilitary Christmas Special''.  While not widely distributed, ''LOBO: Paramilitary Christmas Special'' can be found occasionally on [[Ebay]].
